I paid the rent in advance myself.\n\nThe cabin is really too small and there is some hitch about connecting the lights and there are no conveniences, so hope the house building will begin soon.\n\nDo you know what salary I am to receive here?\n\nI hope I have not overstepped my authority in doing these things. But the housing situation is desperate here at present.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"Mrs. Constance Culver\"\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nSept. 2nd, 1947.\n\nEX'D.\n\nIndian Commissioner for B.C., Department of Mines and Resources, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nThe attached letter has been received from Mrs. Constance Culver, newly appointed teacher at Campbell River Indian Day School, and will be self-explanatory.\n\nThis copy is being forwarded so that you will be kept in touch with what is transpiring at Campbell River, and also know of the housing problem we have on our hands at the present time.\n\nEnc.\n\n(M.S.

C.\n\nWhen Mrs. Culver was employed as teacher of the Campbell River Indian Day School her salary included accommodation; but as no teacherage was provided by the Department, Mrs. Culver was obliged to find accommodation elsewhere and the only thing available in Campbell River was an auto camp. In addition to cabin rent, Mrs. Culver has had to pay for electricity and water.\n\nI would recommend that Mrs. Culver be reimbursed for the rent of the cabin, electricity and water.\n\nJ. C.

Culver - Campbell River Indian Day School\n\nI refer to Mr. Neary's letter dated December 18th with attached vouchers for payment of accommodation for the above named teacher. At the time of Mrs. Culver's appointment it was expected that a teacherage would be constructed at Campbell River from materials at the Port Hardy Army Camp. However, the builders were unable to complete the construction and in fact the work on this building has only just begun.\n\nIn view of the fact that it is apparently not the policy of the Department to supply water and light it is recommended that Mrs. Culver be re-imbursement for rent of the cabin, amounting to $77.00. The Department will no doubt be called upon to pay rent for accommodation for Mrs. Culver until such time as the teacherage is completed.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n| DATE | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Nov. 29 | To room rent August 21st, 1947 - Nov. 21st, 1947, and from Nov. 28th - Dec. 26th, 1947, as per receipted accounts attached: | $77.00 |\n|      | To electricity used during September and October as per receipted account attached: | 3.44   |\n|      | To water used during September and October as per receipted account attached: | 4.00   |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

He has approved of a school being conducted for approximately a three or four month period during the coming summer. It is noted that the Provincial authorities have signified their willingness to permit the use of the school situated half way between the two reserves.\n\nThe Department will approve of the appointment of Mr. Lloyd Gething as teacher and will allow him salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month. You may arrange with him to begin duties as teacher of the summer school at as early a date as possible. Mr. Gething should be informed that he is not to give any religious instruction. It is noted that the regular holidays of the white school are for two months, viz.: July and August, but it will be satisfactory, as far as this Department is concerned, for the temporary Indian summer school to be conducted during September and October, together with Mr. Gething's other pupils, when they return about September first.\n\nMr. Gething should prepare a return, on the form for that purpose, giving the names of the Indian children only, and forward same at the end of each month, through your office, when a cheque in payment for the salary due will be sent.\n\nRegarding the equipment required, I have to inform you\n\nD.F. H. A. W. Brown,\nIndian Agent,\nFort St. John, B. C.\ninform you that an order will be forwarded to the Government Stationery Office here to supply the classroom equipment considered necessary for the Indian children during the period the school will be open. The Department is not prepared to furnish certain of the equipment as suggested by Mr. Gething, viz.: teacher's desk and chair, paper towel cabinet with towels, bookcase, desks, etc. However, the Department will approve of the expenditure required in putting up a chimney made of local material, by way of remuneration for the use of the school building. You may also arrange for the purchase and delivery of a lumberman's wood heater. Please obtain an account, in triplicate, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. It is hoped that this summer school will meet with success and that there will be a regular attendance of the Indian children from both reserves.\n\nWith reference to the erection of a permanent school building on each reserve at Moberly Lake, with living accommodation for a teacher, I would request that you enquire carefully into the cost of erecting suitable buildings. You might include the cost of building and equipping the schools when forwarding your estimates for the next fiscal year. An effort will be made to provide the amounts required in our Estimates for the fiscal year 1937-38. No doubt, the Indians could do a certain amount of the labour in getting out materials for the buildings. It is considered that it would be more satisfactory to have a school on each reserve than to erect a building half-way between the two reserves.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you the date on which Mr. Gething begins teaching activities in conducting the summer school. The Department will endeavour to have the Stationery Department rush the classroom supplies. A flag will be sent from here, also a softball and bat and a football. We do not supply swings or merry-go-rounds.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will give any assistance you can to Mr. Gething in making the summer school a success and in encouraging the Indians to see that their children attend regularly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

C.\n\nOriginal on 77-158\n\nI beg to submit for your inspection\nsome correspondence that has taken place between the\nRev. Father E. Allard, O.M.I., of the local R. C.\nMission, and this office.\n\nIt will be seen that an effort was made\nto induce the Bear Lake Indians who reside over\nacross the river, and who are part of Father Allard's\ncommunity, to leave the Reserve and get out to their\ntrapping grounds. Father Allard, this Fall, upon\nreturn from the McDames District, started up very\nactive church work; but all on this side of the\nriver, this it is certainly considered, induced the\nIndian families to remain around the town, which fact\ngreatly harmed them.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM HARPER REED, INDIAN AGENT,\nTELEGRAF CREEK, B. C., dated Sept. 30, 1934,\naddressed to Chas. C. Perry, Asst. Indian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B. C.\n\nThe question of education for the Bear-Lakers, or Klappan Indian children, some families of which number to 13 - 12 - & 9, etc., is yet to be solved. It most certainly requires attention, and the sooner it is taken in hand the better. It hurts your Agent to see all these children growing up without some sort of training.\n\nThe Rev. Father E. Allard, O.M.I., is really in charge of their social welfare, at least he maintains he is, but nothing up to now has been accomplished. It is regarded by this office that Father Allard has even more than he can attend to down at McDames Creek, and cannot attend to matters in and around Telegraph Creek.\n\nAs is usual, the R.C. Mission has been building all sorts of Mission Houses, and the Church in Dry Town has now an excellent addition joined to the Church itself.\n\nIt is thought that, should Father Allard want to give these Bear Lakers social attention, it would be far better for him to go out to their lovely country of the Klappan River - there is no better in the Cassiar, and there start such work as he and the Indian Department think necessary for their betterment.\n\nThe whole matter seems part of the old question as to if the Stikine Agency needs an Indian residential school or not, and as you have already gone into the matter most carefully, little need be added now.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM HARPER REED, INDIAN AGENT,\nTELEGRAPH CREEK, B.

I agree with you entirely that\nsome school should be started out that way, which it is\nhoped will keep them in that district during the\nsummer months.\nTelegraph Creek, B. C., (Dry Town)\nSeptember 22, 1934.\n\nMr. Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Reed,\n\nIn answer to your letter of September 13, with reference to the Indians across the river, I will readily now put in writing what I have already stated many times in the course of my conversations, that the best place - in every way - to my mind, for those Indians is in their respective hunting and trapping grounds, away from the contact of too many other Indians and from the white people. This should also apply to other Indians hanging around here. Unfortunately, as you know, many of them - if not all of them - have always considered themselves of Telegraph Creek too; they come here to trade almost every year, they have property in Dry Town, most of them are closely related around here. True our church was built for their convenience as well as for others, but I am not trying, you may rest assured, to hold them unreasonably hanging around town. You are not unaware that as soon as I got back from inside I told them in the church that it was grand time for them to go back to the woods. It is rather difficult for me to see my way to go after them myself in a much stronger way than I have already done. However, if it was possible to have them stay at Cariboo Hide or Klappan every summer there is no doubt that our church would be too glad to send some one to visit them regularly and also if possible to start a summer school for their children same as it is done now with the assistance of the Indian Department at McDames.\n\nIf I can otherwise be of some assistance will you kindly let me know.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"E. Allard, O.M.I:\"\n(Rev. E. Allard, O. M. I.)\n\nIndian Affairs. (R3 10, Volume 6419, file 857-1, part 1)\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM HARPER REED, INDIAN AGENT,\nTELEGRAPH CREEK, B. C., dated Sept. 13, 1934.,\naddressed to Rev. Father E. Allard, O.M.I.,\nDry Town, Telegraph Creek, B. C.\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nOrig. on 77-158\n\nWith further reference to our visit of inspection across the River to the Bear Lake Indian Reserve, this letter is to ask your opinion and advice as to how, for the future, these people can be saved from again being in a wretched state of existence in which we found them.\n\nNot least, we noticed over 25 children running wild, with no schooling whatsoever, and such a state of affairs cannot go on. These children, as you know, are not fit to attend the Provincial School within the Townsite.\n\nNearly all these Indians belong to your Church, and therefore your advice is respectfully sought, so that some relief can be arrived at. It is most respectfully and humbly thought that a school, such as you have been so successfully conducting at McDames Creek, situated out in their own country - that of Klappen, would be the ideal thing, and so if possible, during the summer months, keeping these large families, with their grown up girls, away from the Town of Telegraph Creek. It would be considered a favour if you could give this office some advice on the matter that could be forwarded to the Department for their consideration.\nOttawa, November 1, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Perry, Assistant Indian Commissioner, has forwarded a copy of your letter to him, dated September 30th, last, and correspondence which you had with Rev. Father Allard, with respect to matters generally in the Stikine agency.\n\nI wish to refer, at this time, to the providing of educational facilities for the children of the Bear Lake, or Klappan, Indians, who reside across the river from Telegraph Creek. It is noted you state that if a school was conducted during the summer months, it would lead to the Indians residing on the reserve, away from the town. It is also noted that there are no present educational facilities for the children of these Indians. In view of this report and provided there is a suitable building available for carrying on classwork, the Department will be pleased to favourably consider authorizing a grant towards the salary of a teacher for approximately a five month period during the summer of 1935. We shall also supply any text books and classroom material required. We will have no funds to provide or fit up a building, but it is hoped that Father Allard would be able to make suitable arrangements for classroom accommodation.\n\nIt is considered that, if a school for the Bear Lake Indian children is in operation from, approximately, May first to September 30th following, this would meet the needs.\n\nThis school would be conducted under the auspices and supervision of the Roman Catholic Church authorities. I would request that, in due time, you forward a requisition for the classroom material required and also forward a nomination of a suitable teacher from His Lordship Bishop Buxton or Father Allard. When forwarding the requisition, you should state the arrangements that can be made to provide classroom accommodation and the number of Indian children who would be likely to attend.\n\nThe Department is informing Mr. Perry, Assistant Indian Commissioner, of the arrangements that will be made for seasonal schools at this point, and also for the benefit of the Indian children in the village of Tahltan next summer. Besides the two above mentioned schools, a grant will also be provided to continue the MacDames Summer School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (K3 10, Volume 6410, file 857-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your very considerate letter, dated November 1st, in regard to a proposed School for the Klappan Indians, known as \"Bear-Lakers\" that inhabit the district south of Telegraph Creek.\n\nThe Rev. Father E. Allard, C.M.I., at present here, has been interviewed several times regarding the subject, and he fully concurs with the view held by this Office, that the correct location for the school should be out in their own country of the Klappan River.\n\nA rather good map has been given the Rev. Father showing the, at present considered, best location - that of the Reserve Lot No. 5972, at Kluachon Lake, which is at the head water drainage of the Isku and Klappan Rivers, and is just 30 miles away from Telegraph Creek. Here exists a natural play-ground for the Indians, containing an abundance of all their requirements, and moreover is actually within their own registered Trapping Grounds.\n\nAs the Rev. Father has decided to pass the winter in this upper country, it has been suggested to him, that he runs out to Bulkley Lake, 20 miles distant, and visit the large camp of Indians that are passing the winter at this spot, and go into the matter with them. Your Agent intends to do this, as soon as possible, and it is now expected that the Indians will very readily fall in with the scheme, and offer much help. Father Allard reports that there are in all, 28 youngsters that could attend school, and many more coming along soon.\n\nHis Lordship Bishop Bunz is to arrive here about June the 15th next, and the Indians have been instructed to come in for services etc. Then some definite arrangement can be arrived at, but up to then it is almost impossible to do much, but gather information. This of course will be done, and perhaps be so successful that it might be possible for His Lordship to bring along with him the Assistant that will have charge of the proposed school and that such action could be taken right away, during the Bishop's visit.\n\nWhere-so-ever the location is to be, a school house will have to be constructed. The matter was mentioned to the Indians last summer, and they stated that it would be nothing to them, to put up a very fine cabin. Perhaps four windows with a couple of doors might be requested, but that would be all they would need. There are at present four new cabins near this spot, which will induce this hand to have their school near-by.\n\nAs the whole matter proceeds it shall be reported upon, but it is impossible for Father Allard to take charge of a school, this winter, at the present Indian Camp, for he wishes to remain in town, and give attention to his local residents.\n\nIt is desired to submit to the Department, the Agent's many thanks for the valuable assistance that has been afforded his Agency.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept. Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Read\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6419, file 857-1, part 1)\nOttawa, December 14, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to the proposed summer school for the benefit of the Klappan Indian children, who inhabit the district south of Telegraph Creek. It is noted that Rev. Father Allard and yourself consider the best location for this school would be at Kluachon Lake and that there would be, approximately, 28 children who could attend. It is noted, further, that Father Allard will endeavour to have the Indians erect a suitable building. If this can be made ready in time to conduct classes next summer, the Department will allow a grant for teacher's salary, as you were informed in official letter of the first ultimo.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you at a later date, regarding the progress made in arranging for facilities for carrying on a summer school. The name, qualifications, etc., of the teacher nominated by His Lordship Bishop Bumoz should be forwarded in due time, as well as a requisition for any classroom supplies required.\n\nThe Department will await a further communication from you, stating what has been done towards having having the school started.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek,\nB. C.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nJan 3rd 1935.\n\nThe Rev. Father E. Allard, C.M.I.\nThe R.C. Mission, Dry Town.\nTELEGRAPH CREEK, B.C.\n\nDear Father Allard,\n\nYour note regarding a meeting that has been held in your Mission in regard to the proposed School for the Klappan Band of Indians, has just been received. It is a pleasure for this Office to learn that the matter seems to be now actually under way. It is regretted that I was not present, for there are many matters that must be gone into ere the Indians start to work on the project. Dougan Dennis did call at the Indian Office after your meeting, and agreed that the matter must be gone into slowly, to be permanently good for all concerned.\n\nThe first matter of note would be - the location - which Lake have they agreed upon - is it a Reserve - do they know where the lots are - and lastly is it a good - the best location and somewhat \"fire-proof\".\n\nIf it is on the edge of a lake or near by, the cutting of logs etc could be undertaken at anytime, and they could then be floated along the lake. Perhaps a Log School house would be better - cheaper & warmer than a \"whip-sawed\" cabin or house, especially if it is to be for winter.\n\nIs the School to be run all the Year around, or during the summer - or the winter? The latter idea appeals to most of them as it would free them to continue their Trapping and so produce the necessary revenue - a thing here to do in the summer.\n\nThen who will be their instructor, do you know if your much respected Bishop is willing to bring up some assistant - some person that understands such matters and is willing to go out there and give his careful attention, and advice. This is most important for a village is really being started, and will, I have little doubt, turn out to be a great success, even more so than is possible at Mc Dames Creek Mission.\n\nThere is no intention on the part of the Indian Department to stop the Indians coming in to Telegraph Creek for sensible reasons, such as working for an arranged job - selling their furs and obtaining provisions etc- in to see the Doctor etc etc, but the Department will not allow of their coming to town and laying around, with their Girls etc, the way they did last summer, that was a disgrace, and complaints were laid against such conduct by the other Indians of the Tahltan Band. Dougan Dennis agrees to all this, and has so stated.\n\nAs previously stated, it would indeed be a very fine act, if you could see your way clear, when the trail are in good shape to go out to the Location and give it your experienced look-over, then we would be assured that they have not too eagerly selected the wrong spot.\n\nYou are quite correct in stating that the Department will help this project forward to the best of their ability\n\nI am.

As suggested in\nyour letter I am ready to take upon myself to order the\nthings wanted, and as requested by the Department the expen-\nditure shall be covered by accounts in triplicates.\n\nIn regard to nominating a teacher for the proposed\nschool at Kluachon Lake I have not heard anything yet from\nHis Excellency Bishop Hunoz.\n\nPersonally, it appears to me those Indians are not very\nmuch enthused about having a school out there. I had hardly\nsent my note of January 2nd to you informing you of our\nmeeting in regard to that school that most of them came back\nto me individually and said they did not like it \"that it\nappeared as if some one wanted to keep them in the woods\" etc.\netc. Dougan himself came to tell me they were also telling\nhim the same things. He was going to send me the consent\nof John Calbraith, Guy Reid, Bell. He has not done so yet\nbecause apparently they are no more in favour of the idea than\nthe others. By pushing a thing too much sometime one kills\nit. So perhaps it is better to let this question drop till\nthe Spring when they will all be in and can be approached again.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSign'd E Allard O.M.I.\n\nRev. E. Allard. O.M.I.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 14th 1934, in regard to the proposed R.C. Mission School for the children of the Klappan Indians, to be, if possible established out in their own country of Klappan.\n\nSubmitted are two sets of letter regarding the arrangements as far as they have progressed up to date.\n\nIt will be seen that the matter has received a \"check\" the real reason being yet unknown. It is thought that the Klappan Indians whilst in during the New Year, to bury Norman Dennis an Indian Lad, and also to sell what little fur they had, were influenced by one of their number who is married to a White Man within the Townsite, who is known to rather favour the Klappan Indians being allowed to do what-so-ever they like, when they like.\n\nThe Rev Father's letter dated January 12th, was so different from his previous letter dated January 2nd, that he was called upon, and the whole matter talked over.\n\nIt was then found that he too seemed to fancy that the school, if established so far away, would be of little service.\n\nFurther talk revealed the fact that the new Father was still of the opinion that the Department should establish, or should afford help to do so, an industrial school under the auspices of the supervision of the Roman Catholic Church for all the children under Father Allard's care in this part of the Stikine Agency.\n\nHe was carefully questioned as to why the Indians had changed their minds in so short a time, and no reason could be ascertained, except that as the Indians were passing on their way back to their camp at Buckley Lake they stated in a hurry that they did not like the idea.\n\nFather Allard was informed that when it is possible the Indian Agent will go out to their Camp and interview their women, who as yet have not been spoken to; except that last summer when the matter was mentioned everybody agreed with the idea most heartily; and see for himself what is the cause for such a sudden change of front.\n\nPerhaps as the new Father states, nothing much can be done till next spring, as then upon the arrival of His Lordship Bishop Buno\u00e9, all the Indians will be in from far and near, and this event overshadows all else just at present.\n\nHowever, it is correct to state that your Agent is fully of the opinion that Father Allard intends to make Telegraph Creek the headquarters of the R.C. Mission, and that in every way possible, all effort will be directed towards this end. As stated a visit will be paid the Indians in their camp at Buckley Lake, and then it will be possible to gain the Indians' real point of view.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (R3 10, Volume 6410, file 857-1, part 1)\nMr Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nDear Mr Reed,\n\nAt a meeting held at this Office this afternoon at which the following Indians were present:\n\nDunken (Dougan)\nJoseph Dennis (Scotty)\nAntwin Tashoots\nWilliam Tashoots\nBaptist (Mutts)\nJohn Craig\nJack Pete Tashoots\nAndy Dennis\nNeilson Reid.\nFrank Tashoots\nAlex Dennis.\n\nIt was agreed that a school was needed for the children of the Klappan and Iskoot Band of Indians and that the place for such a school should be at Iskoot Lake. It was explained to them that they would have to haul the logs, saw some of them for lumber needed, and put up the building and that perhaps some help could be obtained for the windows etc from the Indian Department. They all seemed to be satisfied with the proposition, because as I understand it myself and also pointed out to them it is asked by the Indian Department that all the Indians either of the Anglican or the Catholic Church should as much as possible keep away from this place. John Galbraith, Hell, Honorat, Guy Reid are out on their trap lines.\n\nDougan promised to write to me and let me know their opinion in this matter as soon as he can get in touch with them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSign'd E. Allard.\n\nRev. E. Allard.\nOttawa, January 29, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, with attached correspondence and a requisition for school material, for a proposed summer school, to be conducted in the R. C. Mission Church, Drytown, which, it is understood, is for the benefit of the children of the Klappan Indians, who reside outside Telegraph Creek during the summer months.\n\nAs you are, no doubt aware, at the present time we pay a grant for the attendance of Indian children at the Provincial School in Telegraph Creek. In future correspondence regarding the R. C. summer school for the Klappan Indians, I would request that you refer to this school as either \"Drytown\" or \"Klappan\", in order to prevent confusion in our filing, getting this school mixed with the correspondence regarding the Telegraph Creek White School.\n\nIt is noted that Rev. Father Bosse, O.M.I., who succeeds the late Father E. Allard, is doubtful if a summer school, conducted in the R. C. Mission Church, Drytown, would meet with success. Our funds are extremely limited and no special provision has been made for teacher's salary and other expenses, and, unless you are definitely of the opinion that there would be a regular attendance of at least 12 children, the Department considers it would be a waste of money to carry on this school during the coming summer months.\n\nIt is noted that the Klappan Band have started to cut logs for a school building at their new settlement. Would it not be advisable to wait until they have this school ready and conduct it as a winter school, to begin next fall, when the building is ready.\n\nWe will await a further report from you, stating if, in your opinion, a summer school would meet with success, if conducted in the R. C. Mission Church, Drytown this coming summer. You might state, also, the number of children who would be likely to attend, the date when you would recommend the school open and the period it would be continued during the summer. When your reply is received, consideration will be given as to whether approval can be granted for the conducting of the school, and, if approved, the classroom supplies could then be forwarded.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek,\nB.

C.,\ndated January 2, 1936.\n\nThe letter attached mentions a visit to the Klappan Band of Indians by Father Bosse this winter. This has been accomplished. The very Indians who signed a petition for a summer school, as above, now sign a new petition to have a village established out in their trapping district, and a winter school established next winter. This Father Bosse is most willing to undertake and conduct. To here, in the Fall could be sent the school material ordered for the town trial summer school, which we consider will be poorly attended, if allowed.\n\nThe visit to Klappan Indians by Father Bosse' was very successful, not only have they started to cut logs for a school house, but they have, in addition, decided to construct a \"work-shop\" in which Father Bosse' will give wood-craft instruction.\n\nKlappan Band - proposed winter schooling-new settlement.\nTeachers salary - October - April, inclusive\n7 months at $90.00 per month $630.00\nSchool supplies - moved out from Telegraph Creek school and few extras. about 20.00\n\"Grant\" for necessary equipment of school house i.e. four windows.

Mission School, for the Klappan Indian Children, that they wished opened up in the R.C. Mission Church building in Dry Town, part of the Telegraph Creek Townsite.\n\nThe drowning of the late Rev Father E. Allard in the Dease River this summer, whilst en route to Mc Dames Creek with Bishop Bunoz, has upset matters very much indeed, so that at the present time it is not possible to state what this Mission intends to do for next summer's work.\n\nHowever the Bishop has been written to on the matter, and in due course his wishes shall be submitted to the Department.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 7, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th ultimo, regarding the establishment of a school during the summer of 1936, for the benefit of the Klappan Band of Indians at the Tahltan Mission, and enclosing copies of correspondence with His Lordship Bishop Bunoz, in connection with the matter.\n\nIt is noted the Indians were rather undecided as to where they would reside during the summer or the length of time they want the school to be open. It is noted, further, that a classroom can be fitted up in the present church building and that, after some talk, the Indians agreed that the school should be in operation during the months of May, June, July and August.\n\nThe Department would be prepared to favourably consider the conducting of a summer school for the benefit of these Indians and to allow salary for a teacher at the rate of $90 per month. You may include an item for this amount in your Estimates and also for any costs that would be involved in fitting up the classroom.\n\nIt is considered that, until we are assured of the success of this school, it would not be necessary to supply the usual school desks. You should again advise the Department, early next winter, whether arrangements can be completed for successfully carrying on the school during the four summer months. At that time, you should state the number that would be likely to attend and where the school will be definitely located.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

(RG 10, Volume 6419, file 857-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that upon the arrival of His Lordship, Bishop Runoz, the matter of schooling for the Klappan Band of Indians who yearly visit this Town, was further gone into. Submitted herewith is a confirmation of the meeting, which was respectfully directed to his Lordship, the following day.\n\nIt seems that these Indians will come in to Town for a short summer vacation, every year, and that they wish to all come to Town and see what is going on. The many advantages of a Village, such as the Tahltan Mission has now, was pointed out to them. They were a little undecided in the matter of a Summer School or Winter School, and it is thought that they really want both.\n\nHowever, as they will come to Town for at least two months, and during that time their children will be just running around their Reserve, if not the Town, there would seem to be no good reason why they should not be instructed in something \"good\" whilst in this vicinity.\n\nThey were tied down to \"time\" of being at school, and it will be seen that the first two months are when the Provincial School would be in operation, but the youngsters are so \"wild\" that it is thought that perhaps they would be objected to, at this School. Their parents however are properly Townsite owners.\n\nMay this Office be instructed as to if a Teacher is thought possible for the R.C. Mission and if so, at what salary, so that this item might be included in the coming Estimates.\n\nThe matter of Teachers Salary for the interior points will be settled later on, when His Lordship returns from the Interior.\n\nI am.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept. Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed Indian Agent.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nJuly 5, 1935\n\nMeeting called at 9 p.m. in the Catholic Priest House by Bishop E.

Allard\n\nDuggan\nJohn Calbraith\nAlex Dennis\nJack Tashoots\nEarl Tashoots\nBell Honorat\nFrank Pete Tashoots\nBaptiste Joseph (Mutts)\n\nQuestion asked by His Excellency: Who want a school?\nAnswer: All individually answer want a school; Duggan remarks that everywhere all over the world catholic children go to school, school also wanted for catholic Indian children around here.\n\nQuestion: Where school should be located\nAnswer: Unanimously, right here near this church, near Doctor, near salmon, near our houses already built and paid for; if school here, would leave wives and children here, make wood for them, bring meat, etc., men go back to trapping ground when proper time.\n\nSigned:\n\nWitnesses:\n\nNote by Agent:\n\nThe above all belong to two families. Question Tashoots River boat allowed them last year, most likely was the owner's boat. Time is...\n\nIdea above seems to be a school, summer or winter, if they care to, I certainly a boarding School!\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nJuly 10th 1935.\n\nYour Reverence,\n\nI beg to respectfully confirm the proceedings that took place, in regard to schooling for the Klappan Band of Indians, at a meeting held within your Mission, on the evening of July 9th 1935. This Office wishes to thank Your Lordship for the efforts gone to, in bringing this small Band to some idea of unity effort.\n\nPresent at the meeting were, Your Lordship, Rev. Father E. Allard, O.M.I., Indian Agent, Chief Charlie Quash of the Thaltans, Douglass Dennis, John Quack, Antwin Tashoots, Frank Tashoots, Jack Tashoots, Baptiste Joseph Dennis, Alex Dennis, Bell Honorat Nole, Nelson Reid. Also were present Larry Martin and David Steack, both of the Thaltan Band, and objected to by the Indian Agent, but allowed to stay during the meeting, by all these present. It was stated later that Scotty Dennis and Guy Reid, of the Klappan Band, desired to attend but could not do so.\n\nA Petition for a School, kind not mentioned\u2014summer or winter to be located near their Church, in Drytown, was first read over by the Indian Agent. The Petition was signed by the following members: Douglass Dennis, John Quack, Alex Dennis, Jack Tashoots, Bell Honorat Nole, F.P. Tashoots, B.J. Mutts Dennis.\n\nThe following questions were then asked by the Indian Agent:\n\nQ. Do you want a School? Ans. Yes.\n\nQ. What kind of school do you want? Ans. Here took place some discussion in regard to a Summer School. V. a winter school a little doubt existed, but at last they decided to have a Summer School, during the time they were in Town\u2014summers.\n\nQ. How long do you want the school to be open? Ans. After some talk regarding \u201cseasons\u2014fat meat\u2014etc\u201d they stated\u2014 the months of May\u2014June July & August.\n\nQ. Will a Teacher be necessary? Ans. General talk took place and His Lordship decided, and quite correct, that a Teacher was necessary.\n\nQ. What School Building would be used? Ans. It was agreed that the present Church Building would be used\u2014at any rate temporarily. Father Allard thought that the Department should allow some \u201crent\u201d for its use. This item was promised to be submitted to the Department for their consideration.\n\nQ. What equipment was necessary? Ans. The usual school supplies in fact just the same as for the Mc Dames Mission School. Also it was desired that 24 School Desk-seats should be supplied.\n\nGeneral talk then took place, in which Father Allard thought that a River Scow should be supplied the Mission to assure a steady attendance from across the River, in case the Indians private boats were not in commission.\n\nHaving found out more nearly what actually was required, The Indian Agent pointed out the following facts:\u2014\n\nIndian Affairs. (K3 10, Volume 6419, file 857-1, part 1)\nKlappan School Meeting. Contiu. Stikine Agency.\n\nThe reasons given in the Petition were not exactly all they seemed to be, in respect for the location.\n\nIn regards to a Doctor, the Department could not guarantee his being here all the time. That all Doctors object to continued assistance when the Indians will not carry out instructions. En route to the meeting the Indian agent examined a Teilet, and found same in a disgusting condition. Another family had none.\n\nRegarding Salmon:- It is generally known to be a fact that all the available salmon backwaters are already overfished. To obtain sufficient for their own, and their dogs requirements they would have to move up or down river. Moose are not in the vicinity. Moreover packing moose meat to Town by dogs, means little meat of poor condition. There are no possible gardens here. This all means that \"store\" provisions must be used, therefore a continuous call for rations. Past events have proven all this.\n\nTown property consists of four unrepairsed, unhealthy houses, generally overcrowded, and upon which Taxes are owing, their owners having to call at the Indian Office for living help.\n\nThe promises laid down to keep their families in food whilst in Town has never been kept, and it is difficult to see how they can, and as for moving out to their trapping grounds, at the correct time for their families benefit, to put up \"fat\" etc and arrange for their seasons trapping, this has always been delayed to the last minute, and results in a large broken down Camp some few miles from Telegraph Creek, from which it is impossible for them to correctly trap their well provided grounds; that being their only revenue. It was shown to be impossible to move a large family, by dogs, to no special spot in the \"bush\", perhaps 100 miles away - late in the Fall.\n\nAnd not least, whilst in Town their \"girls\" were enticed down Town, and bad results come about, as the records show.\n\nTheir Agent tried to show them once more that it would be far better to establish a \"Klappan Village\" out in their own country, and during the long winter days have some good supervision given them, by perhaps their own Authorities. This did not mean that they would not come to Town during the Summer for short times, of necessity they must but it did mean that some sort of Homes would be established, were the Village idea be put into effect.\n\nMap. 38. B. showing all their large trapping Area was shown them. They were also informed that did they not use these grounds, and trap, applications to have them given to other Indians or Whites would be received and would have to have consideration, with this Your Lordship was good enough to concur.\n\nIn conclusion, all this matter was promised to be submitted to the Department for their kind consideration, and with the object of having all necessary expenses allowed for in the coming Agency's Estimates, and as instructed by the Department under letter 158-3-1. dated May 8th 1935.\n\nLater, this Band of Indians requested that a Headman be allowed them:- viz Dougeen Dennis, which matter is still receiving the necessary attention of the Indian Office.\n\nAll of which, Sir, is an outline of the meeting held as above mentioned.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHis Lordship Bishop Bunoz.\nTELEGRAPH CREEK, B.C.\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary.\nThe Dept. Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nSubmitted, Sir.\n\nIndian Affairs. (R3 10, Volume 6410, file 857-1, part 1)\nOttawa, May 8, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th ultimo, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from Reverend E. Allard, O.M.I., together with a copy of your reply, with reference to the establishment of schools for the coming summer months, at McDames, Liard Post, and Telegraph Creek, to be conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will approve of the school at McDames being conducted this coming summer. It is considered, however, that this school should be in operation for at least a three month period. I have noted that Father Allard suggests it should be open only two months. It is thought that very little could be accomplished by conducting this school for such a short period. If possible, it should open on or about June 15th, next, and remain in operation until September 15th following. The salary allowed for teaching services will be at the same rate as was paid last year, viz.: $108 per teaching month. I would request that you inform the Department, as soon as possible, the name of the teacher who has been selected by the church authorities to teach the McDames Summer School.\n\nI may say that a supply of classroom material has been ordered, to be forwarded, addressed to Rev. Father Allard, Telegraph Creek, B. C.\n\nRegarding the conducting of a day school during the coming summer months at Liard Post and for the Catholic Indian children at Telegraph Creek, I have to say that the Department has no funds provided in the Appropriation for the current fiscal year for teachers' salary at these two points, and therefore, we will be unable to authorize the conducting of classroom activities at these points. I may add that there was no opportunity to discuss the matter of summer schools with the Assistant Indian Commissioner during his recent visit to Ottawa.\n\nEarly next fall, you might give the Department a report, with your views regarding the summer schools you would recommend be operated during the summer of 1936, when we would be able to provide funds to pay salaries of teachers in the case of the summer schools which it is decided to establish.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek,\nB. C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit, herewith, a copy of a letter received from the Rev. Father E. Allard C.F.I., who is in charge of all the R.C. Missions in this part of the Stikine Agency.\n\nAlso attached is this Office's reply to same, and if taken in conjunction with other correspondence that has passed under refi- Ottawa 1387-1, December 14th, 1934, will, it is hoped, be self-explanatory.\n\nThe R.C. Mission mission at that point was reported upon by Doctor Hildebrand M.D., and your Agent under date of last July's Monthly Report. It was found that good work was being carried forward, but it was quite all one man's work for a summer, and a lot of supervision could be given to the old Indians, outside the work of the school itself.\n\nAt Liard post new stakes were noticed, placed there by the Rev. Father Allard and it was learnt that a school was to be created at some future date but a church hut was to be established first. This effort was being backed by a few white prospectors who had Indian families, and could not send their children \"outside\" for schooling. Rather Allard has nearly every year made a \"run\" to Liard post, but has never stayed there very long. It is considered that he could, very well do the same thing again this summer, and until such time as matters can be arranged in proper order.\n\nThe Telegraph Creek situation has been reported upon so many times that it needs little more information to be fully understood. There is no doubt whatsoever that the proper place for a mission is someway out from this not too nice townsite, especially in view of a mining rush this spring.\n\nIf the proposed school and small village out at Klappan could be got underway, it would practically be the same as the Anglican mission efforts and work at the Tahltan village, the Anglicans being on the north side of the Stikine, with the R.C. Mission and village (it is hoped) being on the South side of the Stikine River, both in their own trapping districts.\n\nNo doubt with the arrival of His Lordship, Bishop Hunz this spring matters will come to a head, and further reports will be possible. It can only be restated that if an Indian R.C. Mission school is once started within the townsite, it will be very hard not to continue it in the future, and such a school will essentially mean that the Indian families will arrive here early in the Spring and request nations.\n\nIt is understood that R.C.C. Curry, Esq., Agent, Indian Commissioner for B.C., is paying Ottawa a visit; when no doubt this matter will be taken up, and correct advice given your Agent at this point.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (R3 10, Volume 6419, file S57-1, part 1)\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nMarch 7th 1935.\n\nMr Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will kindly remember how difficult, almost impossible, it is for me, and for the Indians to get to Mc Dames every spring before the middle of June. It has also been my experience, and I believe yours, that it is better for the same Indians to go back to the woods, to put up their winter supplies, on or about the middle of August. There is also the fact that about the same time navigation on the Peace River is very uncertain. So perhaps it would be better if the Summer School at Mc Dames was of two months instead of three, starting with the 15th of June or about, and closing with the 15th of August or about. But as the expenditures incurred in getting in and out would be the same it is necessary to ask that the grant should be at least $300-00 for the whole term of two months.\n\nNow that I am here it would be easier for me to find a teacher for Liard post, if you think that one should be had for this coming summer, would the Dept. be willing to give a grant of $300-00 for the teacher for two months, same as Mc Dames. I am confident that one of the local cabins at Liard could be rented for this summer. If another grant of $50-00 or so worth of food could be obtained a start could be made on the proposed building this summer.\n\nAs for the Indian children whose parents come and stay around Telegraph Creek a while every summer, if it is also thought that they should be given schooling facilities right away this coming summer, I spoke to the Bishop who has no objection for once that they be allowed to use our Church for that purpose. If the Dept could give $250-00 for a teacher for two months, I think I could get one from here, but perhaps you would rather wait and see what will be the result of the proposed meeting with the Indians when the Bishop comes up in the spring on or about the 14th of June.\n\nI will likely be back at Telegraph Creek on the first boat going up the river. If unable to let me know before what is to be done it will likely not be too late yet to let me know when I get back.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nSigned - M. Allard.\n\nRev. M.

The air-mail will be leaving here in a few days time, and this is the first chance of sending you a reply.\n\nYour letter covers three separate matters, the Mission work at Mc Dames, a proposed school at Liard, and a proposed school for the Klappan Indians within your Church - in Drytown.\n\nFirstly Mc Dames Creek affairs, everything has been settled in regard to the summer's work at this point, everything but the allowance for the Teacher, I believe, and that of course the Department will no doubt fix in due course. Even school supplies have been arranged for and some good few extras have been allowed for in equipment etc. Your school at this point is doing good work, but there is still much to be done in helping the families personally, especially towards a better state of general sanitation. By the end of August the families should be returning to the woods to put up their fat meat, if it is possible to get them to do so. All this really means a full summer's work.\n\nSecondly, Liard affairs. The matter of a school at this point received some little attention, quite awhile ago, and it was understood that the white men with Indian families were behind your efforts, and were intending to put up a school house. Your staking of an \"open\" piece of ground for this purpose was noticed last summer, but beyond that this Office has little information. However Mr. Anderson writes as follows - \"March 21st, Liard, will you please tell Father Allard that I am sawing the lumber for the school and I believe that we can muster up enough energy to stagger through with the job next summer\" so it would seem that the matter is already receiving attention, with no doubt the help of the white who have Indian families, a matter that they are quite capable of assisting with, for their fur catches, this winter have been very good indeed. Could you let me know more about this, and then the matter be submitted to the Department for their kind consideration, once more. There has been no request for a teacher's salary for this location submitted as yet, and you know how very difficult it is to have a grant placed at the last minute, all this should have received attention last fall and reported upon.\n\nThirdly, Telegraph Creek affairs. It is noticed that you desire a small grant to carry on a School within the Church Building, This also should have been submitted to the Department at an earlier date. It is impossible to expect the Department to find these odd amounts, which total seems to amount to around $1000-00, at a moments notice, however the matter shall be submitted, and that, at once.\n\nNo mention is made of the proposed Klappan School, which is admitted by everybody, including yourself, to be the very best way of handling the Klappan Indian children who visit this town in the summer time.\nNo store in the townsite wish to have these Klappan Indians hanging around the district, in fact this office has been requested to \"keep them out in the woods.\" They have little revenue, but have been provided with good trapping grounds, but they will not get out and trap. The stores would put up with them if they were on steady relief, and the department were to pay their accounts, but this the Department, I am very much afraid, will not do. It would be the best way possible of killing them off, and all the help given to their children would be of no avail. This was evident last summer, as we found out. Their girls were around town, and disgusting events took place - too bad to report upon. Also they begat children from the cultus \"whites.\" For example Mary Tashute has now a child by Kennedy, the details of whom you are well acquainted with. It is to stop all this, and obtain a better sanitary condition that the Klappan School was mooted and thought by everybody to be the best move possible.\n\nHowever, as you state the matter will receive the attention of His Lordship Bishop Bunoa, upon his arrival at this point, but it is certain that the Indians will be \"laying\" around the reserve, and hanging around the townsite, during the time of His Lordship's visit to the interior, awaiting his passing south again. Other action by this Band can not be expected, unless they are personally conducted out to their chosen location, and a small school mission started at such a point. This office has to hold this viewpoint, it is an Indian office, and exists for the betterment of the Indian with his family. In no way whatever is this viewpoint to be taken as acting adversely in connection with any valuable services given to the children in the District who happen to have white fathers and Indian mothers, possibly 10 or a dozen; it is only expressed on behalf of the Indian whose families have in the past suffered by their summer stay in and around the Town of Telegraph Creek.\n\nEverything will be done that it is possible to do to help forward such a good work, and as stated the Department shall be reported to, upon the matters contained within your letter.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.,\nJune 15th, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit hereunder, the Agency's Annual Report, covering the past year, ending on the 31st March 1936.\n\nEDUCATION.\n\nSmall Winter Schools for trapping Nomads have received much attention during the year. It seems to be the only way, up to now whereby these youngsters can learn anything at all, it also helps to break down their wild nomadic ways. Two such places are really required. One for the Klappan Band of Indians and the other for the Caribou Hide Band.\n\nThe first Bands requirements have been gone into, and has now, after much trouble been reduced to supplying a teacher with school material, at their Big Camp on Kluchon Lake, all under the R. C. Mission of these parts. Father Bosse', O. M. I., in charge of such Missions here has written His Lordship, Bishop Bunoz, and requested him to supply a teacher. For such long winters work, and in so remote a place, a salary a little above the ordinary is expected. Upon the matter being investigated by Inspector Pragnell, shortly, a full and detailed report will be submitted to the Department.\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.,\nJune 17th, 1936.\n\nSTIKINE INDIAN AGENCY REPORT FOR MONTH OF MAY 1936.\n\nThe Klappan Band of Indians, who come to the town of Telegraph Creek during summer-time, might be provided with a Winter School out in their own District, which would do a lot of good during the long winter months.\n\nH. Reed\nIndian Agent.\nStikine,\n\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.,\nJune 10th, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit, hereunder, the Agent's Monthly Report covering the month of February last, which it has been impossible to submit until this late date.\n\nThis Band of Klappan Indians wish some sort of schooling for next winter, so the site of Morchusa Lake Reserve was looked over. It was found to be not suitable but a very fine site was located nearer the Reserve Graveyard, with good heavy timber thereon. A special report on this subject will be submitted after Inspector Pragnell has interviewed the Indians concerned.\n\nAt this camp, the end of February Month arrived.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed\n(Signed)\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 29th 1936, in regard to Schooling for the Klappan Band of Indians.\n\nIn future, as suggested, all correspondence in regard to this matter, no matter what location is chosen, will be rendered under the heading of \"The Klappan School\".\n\nFather Bosse' is travelling with your Agent on a visit to this Band of Indians, and each family will be seen individually, and made to sign up the exact number of children who can and will attend the school. This applies to the Summer School at the Mission house, and also the more favoured Winter School cut in their own district.\n\nMore than ever this is necessary. The B.C. Game Department now considers that the Indians have too big an area, for their various bands. Of course they know nothing of the Cassiar, and the shortage of Fur, and absolutely nothing of Nomadic conditions. The new game warden, now at McJames Creek in the Interior was asked this winter if he thought the Indians had \"too\" much grounds; his reply being \"that the Indians can't live on what they have got now\".\n\nIf the winter school is established, then the Indians can leave their families under correct protection, and use their grounds, which would create happy conditions all around.\n\nThe visit to the Klappan Band is being made right now, and Father Bosse' intends going with your Agent to Caribou Hide Band, another 200 miles further on, then on his own, south to Bear Lake, and so on to Prince Rupert, where he reports to his Bishop.\n\nA report on this will be submitted in due course.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nMuch has been written and many reports submitted on the question of schooling for the Klappan Band of Indians. This Spring and summer the matter has received more attention and is therefore again being reported upon.\n\nThe Klappan Band of Indians are nomads and live by trapping in the Klappan River District to the southeast of here about 150 miles. They are all of the R.C. Church, and have very large families. This Band of Indians must not be confused with the Caribou Hide Band, living another 150 miles further south east from this point.\n\nIt will be remembered that the late Father E. Allard wished for a Summer School within the Townsite of Telegraph Creek; for this Klappan Band, but it was considered generally that a Winter School in their own district, would result in a far better condition for the Indians, in the long run. With the coming of Father Bosse* O.M.I., now in charge of R.C. Affairs in these parts, the Winter School is the only idea aimed at, and wished for by the Indians and also Father Bosse*.\n\nDuring the late visit of Inspection by Inspector Pragnell the matter had his very careful attention. Father Bosse was interviewed several times on the matter. Also the Indians concerned with their families were inspected on the Klappan Reserve, by Inspector Pragnell and all wished for the Winter School during the winter of 1936-7. Father Bosse has written His Lordship Bishop Burns, requesting him to find a teacher for his winter school, and Inspector Pragnell has been asked to kindly call upon the Bishop, when passing through Prince Rupert, and come to final arrangements. The Inspector is reporting upon the whole matter.\n\nThe site settled upon is the Kleueehoem Reserve, with its good fishing lake nearby. Moose is here in plenty, also good timber. Father Bosse* with your Agent inspected the location and find it a fitting place.\n\nThe cost of establishing a community in this location will be a little expensive, mostly owing to pack-horse transportation, the aid of equipment (Windows Doors & Sheet roofing; Heater etc.) with also the extra Salary that should be allowed to any Teacher that will go out there for at least 5 months and take charge of the large Camp. Two important matters will be settled by the establishment of this community:\n\nFirstly schooling for the large families, secondly the settlement of the surviving trappers on individual trapping and Registered rap Grounds. The latter event will produce revenue.\n\nTherefore Sir, it is humbly considered that the matter should now be allowed to go ahead, and a school started this coming Winter.\n\nAttached, and submitted for consideration is an outline of such equipment as will be necessary, with the costs as far as it is at present possible to arrive at.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Need,\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department will expect you to keep all expense in the establishment of this school to the lowest possible point. You should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of all materials, also receipts for the cost of the freighting. These accounts, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nIt is noted that the site settled upon for the establishment of the school is on the Kleuechoen reserve, that you inspected the location and find it a suitable place.\n\nIt is understood that this school\n\n- will be\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.

I would request that you will inform the Department of the dates, covering the five month period, between which the school will be in operation.\n\nThe continuing of the school after the present winter will depend upon the success achieved and the number of Indian children who attend. Returns, on the forms for the purpose, should be prepared by the teacher, showing attendance, days taught, etc., and forwarded at regular intervals, when payment of salary at the above rate will be made.\n\nThe supply of classroom material considered necessary will be forwarded, addressed to you.

Mission affairs. Going into the matter it was discovered that the Father has obtained a Trappers License from the local Game Warden to go into partnership with Indian Society Dennis, and trap on his ground. All of which had taken place without notification being allowed the Indian Office. Indian Dennis is a good tempered, well liked nomad, his family consists of 11, including twins - is hopelessly in debt, and of necessity on relief allowances. Last fall he with his wife accepted an offer by this office, whereby he and all his affairs would be carried by the Office- i.e. generally supervised, for the period of two years, when it was considered he would be again, out of debt, and on his own. But with Father Bosse owning 76 traps came along with his offer, it was irresistible, and the office supervision forgotten. This event lead to some little ill feeling amongst the other Indians, and dissatisfaction grew up.\n\nAbout this time it was also learned that Mr. J. Moran had been teaching the Klappan school. As explained in letter to the Department under date of December 21st, it had been understood that Mr. Moran was only up to help Father Bosse' with the school, the same as happened the previous year when Father Gulette, O.M.I. came up to help the school along. Later Mr. Moran was asked to come in for a chat, which he has done, and it is hoped matters will go ahead now without further hitches. The school attendance is up over that of last winter and Mr. Moran is well liked by the Indian parents and the children. He is quite strict, is certainly a teacher, and is not over bearing on religious routine. It is hoped that the matter of his salary has now been adjusted.\n\nThe matter of the local Game Warden granting \"whites\" permission to trap on Indian Registered Grounds, is of course a difficult matter to handle. It is thought that some arrangement that the Indian Office should be first consulted. The view taken by this office is that such action is fatal, and that eventually the Indians will be roving with the \"white\" trapper, and so get away and then the white trapper has the line in his own hands, to keep or sell. Indians should take other Indians along if they require help on their lines. Some traplines are so remote that this is necessary. Scotty Dennis was asked why he didn't trap now he has a partner, and he replied that it was no use to do that now -with 76 traps working all the fur would be caught, or enough anyways, and some must be left for next year. It is thought that Father Bosse intends to let Dennis have the traps next year, for his own use.\nUp to the end of the month only one good fur catch had been brought in and sold, it consisted of foxes from the Nass Divide. Fur returns are not as good as last year and we are supposed to live over half the year on such revenue.\n\nHarper Reed.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 25, 1938.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your recent letter the Department approves the appointment of Mr. J. Moran as teacher of the Klappan Seasonal School.\n\nIn future it would be appreciated if you would write the Department before any teacher is sent to a school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. E. M. Bunce, O.M.I., D.D.,\nVicar Apostolic, Yukon,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nMr. R.A. Hoey  \nSupt. of Welfare & Training  \nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI trust you have read before this my letter to the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs re-Teacher of Klappan school.\n\nIn reply to yours of the 11th inst. I can only repeat what I have written then, viz: that Mr. J. Moran is certainly a competent teacher for that school. For several years he has filled with success the functions of disciplinarian and teacher at Lejac Residential school. He is an intelligent man, knows bookkeeping and stenography, is well acquainted with the Indian mentality and is willing to take all the pain necessary to discharge his duties in a satisfactory manner. Above all he is well behaved man.\n\nRe-Lower Post (or Liard) School.\n\nI wish to say in regard to that school that Mr. H. Reed, Indian Agent at Telegraph Creek, is right when says that a few half-breeds will have to frequent that school. But it is also true to state those half-breed children are real Indians in fact and can be and will be nothing else. Their Fathers themselves live like Indians.\n\nHowever I'll write again in regard to that matter when I have ascertained what the Provincial Government, for the education of those poor, isolated half-breeds.\n\nRe-Moricetown School\n\nAlthough I have no official notice that this school has been granted, I am told that it has been. Hence I have had some correspondence with Mr. McKay, Commissioner at Vancouver in connection with the appointment of a teacher. But so far no substantial headway has been made in the matter. Some confusion has arisen from the fact the first teacher appointed resigned in favor of her Brother who was refused, it seems by Capt. Barry. On hearing that her Brother could not succeed her, the girl appointed, Miss Bernice Sargent, now insists in holding the position herself. And that so far as we are concerned in that affair, I hope that some satisfactory solution will be found soon.\n\nYours very Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Moran took charge of that school last Fall replacing Father Bosse O.M.I. who taught there the Winter previous.\n\nIt seems that through some confusion of ours Mr. Harper Reed of Stikine Agency was not notified of the change of teacher at Klappan although he knew that Mr. Moran was with Fr.

Moran is in charge of the school during the current season and a cheque for October, November and December 1937, amounting to $300.00, should be issued in his favour and sent to him, c/o Harper Reed, Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nStaff questionnaire will be forwarded in the near future.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit herewith the Day School Returns of the Klappan Winter Day School for months of October and November. It will be seen that a certain Mr Moran is now teaching this school, and that Father Bosse O.M.I who was last winter's teacher is not now doing so.\n\nA mix-up of sorts has taken place, due entirely to Father Bosse' not observing the routine laid down, and it was certainly understood by this Office that he intended to perform his duties for this winter. A letter directed to Mr Moran (copy) is attached which covers the whole subject in detail.\n\nIn regard to Father Bosse' and his mission work in these parts, a word or so is in order. Father Bosse is a real French-Canadian, a real woods outside liver. At starting up matters and construction of cabins etc he simply cannot be excelled, and as often reported; great work has been accomplished. But that is where it seems to end, for the Indians themselves after a while hint that a different Teacher would be acceptable, and wish for a less energetic personage. Perhaps that will account for the assistance that the Father has brought up with him over the last two winters.\n\nHowever the correct papers have not been submitted to The Department covering Mr Moran as a teacher, but same will be obtained from him as soon as seen. It is intended to obtain a dog-team and pay this school a visit personally, as it is expected that some trouble amongst the Indian families around the school, has taken place. If this is so it must be stopped at once or else the winter school effort will prove a failure.\n\nIt is hoped that His Lordship Bishop Bunoz has by now written The Department explaining the circumstances, and that it will now be possible to allow payment to Mr Moran who is the actual Teacher.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nThe Dept. Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed, Indian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit hereunder, a special report on the progress accomplished by the R.C.Mission with their various schools etc throughout the southern part of this agency.\n\nKLAPPAN WINTER DAY SCHOOL\n\nThe location of this school is out in Klappan District, south of telegraph Creek. It serves a whole lot of nomads and acts as a concentration camp for the very large families during the winters, when the head of the family has to travel long distances for trapping purposes. The school ran all last winter in one or two very good cabins erected for this purpose - it is on a reserve nearby a Lake. The school was successful from its start, and good progress was made by the children. Through its establishment more fur for the families was obtained, and this winter they will reap its full benefits. Requirements have been met, for this winter and from now on it needs only worn out school supplies - restocked. The salary allowed the teacher is $100.00 (158-7-1) and Father Bosse' O.M.I. conducts this during winters and the Dease Lake school during the summer time. However, this winter Father Bosse has with him a certain Mr. Morgan, most capable person, and he in turn has brought up, as an extra help, a certain halfbreed named MacStephens. It is thought that this lad will be going out again next spring.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nIt is expected that the Klappan Day School & H.C.

Next winter it will fully repay the efforts gone to, were it possible to establish more schools on the lines of the Klappan effort, it would be done, but this is the only Band that can be so treated, except perhaps the Caribou Hide Band situated 200 miles to the eastwards.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your three letters dated March 24th in regard to the advanced School Masters Salaries allowed the R.C.

It will be remembered that this school was a new venture, the idea being to train the Indian youngsters of nomadic families, during the winter time, on their own trapping grounds, which allowed the head of the family to give more time to his traps etc. Last Fall saw for the first time some Big Game Hunters, out hunting during the first snow fall\u2014i.e., late hunt parties. This held back, somewhat, the starting up of this winter school, but never-the-less, during the five months that it has operated, very good work has been accomplished. The fact has now been proven that it is certainly worth the expense gone to, and that the Indians concerned, all of which have huge families, do certainly wish for the school next winter and will all get together early in the fall, and help the school affair over good. Some views taken of the completed school house, now gone below for printing, shall be forwarded as soon as possible.\n\nHarper Reid,\nIndian Agent.\nKlappan Bay School.\n\nFall 1936 Construction.\n\nViews.\nOttawa, March 24th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of February 18th, it has been decided to allow salary for the teacher of the Klappan Indian Day School at the rate of $100 a teaching month. Salary will be paid at this rate for next winter, as it is understood from previous correspondence that the Klappan School is only to be in operation from October to the succeeding February. We have already issued cheques for the teacher's salary at this school from October 1st, 1936, to February 28th, 1937, at the rate of $90 a teaching month.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\nSir,\n\nThe R.C. Missions of these parts have again requested this Office to place before The Department for their kind consideration, the matter of the rate of Pay allowed the R.C. Mission teachers.\n\nThe various missions are as follows:\n- Klappan Day School. 60 miles out in the bush. South Dease Lake School. (starting 1937) 73 miles from Telegraph Creek.\n- Mc Dames School - Down the Dease River, middle of the Cassiar.\n- Liard Post (proposed to be started). Near the Yukon border line and on Liard River.\n\nA standard of pay is that of the Tahltan Mission (Anglican) out on the Tahltan Reserve -12 miles from this point, which is at $90-00 per month.\n\nIt has been suggested that owing to remote places and expensive transportation - high cost of food - and only a short season, that a little more pay should be considered in accordance with the distance the school is away from the Head of Navigation - i.e. Telegraph Creek.\n\nYour Agent here cannot but sympathize with their views on the matter, especially as it costs at least $50-00 to come up, and return to Wrangell from where the C.P.S/ship is left. The Cassiar is much more difficult, and expensive to get into and live than is the Yukon, so the actual savings of a Teacher can be but very little.\n\nA rate of Pay which would be considered reasonable, is suggested as follows:\n- Klappan Day School @ $100-00 per month.\n- Dease Lake Day School $100-00\n- Mc Dames Creek -- $110-00\n- Liard Post Day School (if allowed) $115-00 per month\n\nIf the Department could see their way clear to allow such increases, it is felt that the Teachers would render that value in return by being more contented and happy with their berths.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs.\nThe Dept. Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed, Indian Agent.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.,\nFebruary 10th, 1937.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit hereunder, a report covering\nthe month of January 1937.\n\nThe Klappan Day School is progressing favourably,\nand the Caribou Hide Boys stated that perhaps next winter\nsome of their children might be able to attend this school,\nwhich would be a very good thing. Father Ouellet, assistant\nto Father Bosse' arrived in town at the end of the month, and\nwas pleased with work accomplished, He is staying in town\nuntil the river opens, and suggested that he teach some of the\nIndian children who are camped two miles out of town, and who\ndid not get out to the Klappan school location, this winter.\nHe was at once offered a tent and stove, but it seemed he\nwished the children to come in to his Church in Dry Town, daily\nand be taught there. It was at once pointed out that if that\nwere started, all the families concerned would at once move in,\nand it was precisely that event that was to be avoided. After\na while he considered that if a Sunday School was started, that\nwould be sufficient and with that view an agreement was\nreached.\n\nHarper Reed.\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit herewith the KLAPPAN DAY SCHOOL Reports for the months of November and December 1936.\n\nIt will be seen that the attendance is not quite up to expectations, which has come about through no real intentions of the Indians concerned. Three more large families should have been located at this school, by now but owing to no snow at all in places on this Klappan Trail, the families could not move. Moreover this fall two big game parties stayed on and hunted in the first light fall of snow, and this held the families of the Guides here. However, everybody states the project a fine venture, especially the fathers of the children attending, for they have been able to get out and bring in more revenue, by trapping. The Indians who did not get their families there, are remorseful, and intend next year to be there\u2014on time.\n\nFather Bosse informs this Office that a travelling R.C. Bishop, flying in a plane owned by a Flying Priest stated to be a German, will be visiting this District, within two months\u2014if possible. Father Bosse or perhaps Father Oulette, will come in to this point to meet them.\n\nThe Rev Fathers have been requested to come in prepared to submit all their requirements\u2014requisitions etc.\u2014names of Schoolmasters, and an outline of their intentions for next summer's Mission work, and also that for next winter\u2014in this part of the Stikine Agency. It will then be possible to report fully on these Missions.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept. Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nTelegraph Creek., B.C.,\nDecember 24, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit, hereunder, a report covering the month of November, 1936.\n\nOn the 10th inst., Rev. Father Bosse' O.M.I., who is in charge of the Klappan Mission Day School, out in the Klappan District, reported in. His School report has been submitted. He reports success with the establishment of the school and its attendance. However this could be bettered, when it is possible for the Indian families, now on their way there, to arrive; there being very little snow down at present. Next year, no doubt, the families will arrive at the site much earlier, as all consider the project very good.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 23rd October 1936.\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 20th October, 1936, from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, recommending the establishment of an Indian Day School, under Section 9(a) of the Indian Act, for the benefit of the Indian children of the Klappan Band, residing on Lot 5972, Kluachon Lake, Cassiar District, Stikine Indian Agency, northern British Columbia.\n\nThe Minister observes that there are approximately sixty children of school age residing at this point, for whom at present no educational facilities are provided; and\n\nThat funds have been included in the Main Estimates for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, 1936-37, to provide the cost in the establishment of this school.\n\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing recommendation and submit the same for approval.\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nCOPY FOR FILE\n\nSynopsis of Memorandum to Council of October 20th, 1936.\n\nEX'D.\n\nThere are approximately sixty Indian children of school age, whose parents are members of the Roman Catholic Church, residing on Lot 5972, Cassiar District, British Columbia, for whom no educational facilities are provided. They are known as the Klappan Band and are trappers. They have prepared logs and erected a building - the Department providing materials for doors, windows, etc. The school will at present be conducted during the winter months, only.\n\nThe reserve at this point has not yet been established for this Band. The local Indian Agent and His Lordship Bishop Bunoz have strongly urged the establishment of school facilities during the coming winter months. Funds, to provide for the fitting up of the building and for the payment of teacher's salary, are available in our Main Estimates for the current fiscal year.\nOttawa, October 20, 1936.\n\nHis Excellency\nThe Governor General in Council:\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to recommend the establishment of an Indian Day School, under Section 9(a) of the Indian Act, for the benefit of the Indian children of the Klappan Band, residing on Lot 5972, Kluachen Lake, Cassiar District, Stikine Indian Agency, northern British Columbia. There are approximately sixty children of school age residing at this point, for whom at present no educational facilities are provided.\n\nFunds have been included in the Main Estimates for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, 1936-37, to provide the cost in the establishment of this school.\n\nSuperintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters, in regard to The Klappan Indian Day School to be opened this winter at KLUACHON LAKE in the Klappan District south of Telegraph Creek, B.C. This Agency is very thankful for the consideration given to this project by The Department\u2014it will help to settle the Indians on their Trapping Grounds.\n\nAll steps possible have now been taken to get this matter well under way, and the cost of same will have exact attention.\n\nSubmitted are two maps\u2014one Official showing the location of the site. The other is a copy of the B.C. Land Surveyor's Map, when same was surveyed, and which, it was considered, was an Indian Reserve. Perhaps this is not officially so, yet.\n\nA green line shows the extent of the Stikine Agency to the south of Telegraph Creek, a huge district, and the best within the Agency. It is thought that sometime in the future several more Indian Reserves should be allowed these Indians.\n\nThe District is just now receiving the attentions of the Whites, trappers and what not, who are coming north.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed\n\nHarper Reed Indian Agent.\nThis band comes from the south and east of Telegraph Creek, in a very wild country, with access by trail only, about 60 miles from Telegraph Creek. As already reported, I saw most of this band camped on the opposite side of the river at Telegraph Creek. There are swarms of children, all uneducated. In this case an attempt is being made by the Indian Agent, in conjunction with the R.C.Missionary to establish a winter school. The elder Indians are very keen that their children should learn something, and have promised to leave their wives and children at some suitable and selected spot, prepare firewood, deer flesh and kill game and fish food. If necessary they will leave a hunter to kill game. They will also erect log shelter and the sides of a school room, while we could fit tent top over this and put in a heater; also quarters for a teacher. Much expenditure would not be required to start off with, as it would be in the nature of an experiment. I hope that it will meet with success. Considerable organizing will be required of Mr. Reed. I understand that Bishop Bunoz would arrange for a teacher.\n\nG. S.

A. Hovey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nH. Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit herewith a Petition from the Klappan Band of Indians requesting that their winter school be allowed to continue until the end of May Month.\n\nThis would be a most excellent arrangement and much to be desired, in fact a saving on Rations and Relief would take place.\n\nAs the attached School Report will show, many children are in this Band, and they are all nomads. The Winter School was partly started with the object of keeping these Indians \"out of Town\" as they are not suitable for wage hire and employment.\n\nIf this can be allowed, then these families will arrive in Town after the Beaver Trapping season, and will be just in time for the Salmon Run on the Stikine River - that also helps on the Ration viewpoint.\n\nMr J.E. Moran the Principal of this school was requested to come in and see the Office, which he has just done, and all minor troubles have been settled, and we both consider the extra school period is well justified.\n\nTherefore may this Petition have the Department's kind consideration.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nThe Dept Mines & Resources\n\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nDebut Lake, B.C.\nJan. 24/38\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nMr. Harper Reed\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nSir:\n\nThe undersigned parents of children attending the Telegraph Creek School, situated at Debut Lake, B.C., do hereby petition the Department of Indian Affairs to allow us the privilege of prolonging our school term through the months of April and May in order that our children may profit from the advantages of schooling.\n\nSigned:\n\nDouglass Dennis\nBill Male\nJack-Pete\nMette Joseph\nAlex Dennis\nAntoine Pete\nJohn Quick\nMary Pete\nXmas Jackson\n\nIndian Office Note:\nIf granted it means that 49 souls would stay out of Town until conditions were suitable for them to come in.\nNo Moose in and around Town.\n\nH.R.\nThis afternoon whilst waiting for a south bound Plane to arrive here, the enclosed School Report and covering letter has arrived. Therefore it is forwarded as in connection with all that might have been reported on this School during the last month. If more such as Mr Moran were undertaking the work of the R.C. Missions, we should be able to get ahead much faster.\n\nIt is intended to drop in there with the Plane on my winter rounds of inspection - obtain views and generally make a full Report on the situation, which shall be submitted as soon as possible.\n\nIn the mean while Dr Patchett shall visit the camp generally - by dog-team- a little later on when the weather is more settled, and his report will cover the Medical Aid required - if any.\n\nIt is a pleasure to see that after the trouble this Fall and winter that the school is now going along much better - it should do, and can do a whole lot of good to these Nomads.\n\nWhen visiting this Camp the Indians will be told very straightly that it is their school and assistance must be given- there is no excuse for their not doing so. May it be again mentioned very respectfully, that had this Agency a \"Red coat\" (R.C.M.P.) handy, all these personal matters would never be allowed to take place.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper\n\nIndian Affairs. (R3 10, Volume 6419, file 857-1, part 1)\nDear Sir:\n\nHerewith I beg to submit a report of the Klappan Indian Day School.\n\nHealth:\n\nIn general it might be said that the health of the children is extremely good. The outdoor environment in which they are associated has no doubt played an important part in maintaining their healthy conditions which, apart from such minor troubles as colds and inflamed eyes, has not been attacked by any disease of a serious nature.\n\nTwo rather advanced cases of trachoma exist among adult members of the encampment but do yet have not spread to the eyes of the children. Steps are being taken to combat any infection and it is to be hoped that the cooperation of the present victims can be had.\n\nI might state here that the treatment of trachoma is not a new undertaking with me. Having acted in the capacity of disciplinarian at the Tyee Residential School for 5\u00bd years, I have had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Hall and witnessing...\nmany of his operations and treatment\ncases as well as receiving several\nlectures on how to care for and assist in\nthe prevention of Trachoma. The treatment\nadvised by Dr. Hall to the several boys\nunder my care was each day personally\nsupervised by me.\n\nThe eyes, however, seem to be a weak\nfactor among the children of this\nschool and an inflammation of the eyes\nhas kept a number of the children from\nattending classes for some time. That\nhas the appearance of a cataract has\nbeen forming on the eye of one youngster\nand caused her to miss the entire\nautumn term of school. Another child\nshows a decided weakness of the eyes\nwith a slight turning of one. The parents\nof both children have been advised to\nhave the youngsters examined by a\ndoctor at the first opportunity.\n\nAmong the older members of the\ncamp there is one very evident case of\ncataract which has been brought to the\nattention of the Indian Agent who, I am\nsure, will do all in his power to have\nthis sad malady remedied.\n\nClassroom:\n\nI do not consider it will be necessary\nfor me to go over in detail the progress\nmade in the school since its inauguration\nin October 1936; but let it suffice for me\nto remark upon conditions since I took\nover the teaching position just four\nmonths previous.\n\nThe pupils here show a decided aptitude\nto study with a firm desire to attend\ndaily class. Progress is rapid and\nan anxiousness for advancement is\nquite noticeable. Attention in class is keen and any new place in the work is eagerly anticipated.\n\nThe monthly report forwarded to your office shows the splendid attendance of the children and for this I must congratulate the parents for the cooperation they have given in seeing that no child is detained at home unnecessarily.\n\nGeneral Remarks:\n\nTaking advantage of a short interim in which I was relieved of classroom duties by Father Ross, I took the opportunity of visiting Telegraph Creek and interviewing the Indian Agent at that point regarding some of the conditions existing in that Lake.\n\nIt was a rather pleasant surprise to Mr. Reid (IA) to learn that the school now boasts an enrollment of 81 pupils with an expected increase of from 3 to 5 more for next year. Such a number in excess of last year's attendance makes the seating capacity of the present building inadequate.\n\nAt the time of construction things were rather of an undecided nature and work had to be rushed. It was expected that at the most the enrollment would not exceed 15 pupils and in consequence a building was erected to accommodate that number with teacher's quarters in the rear. Today the entire unit would not be too spacious.\n\nThe school is situated some 65 miles from Telegraph Creek from which point supplies have to be brought in via horse train in summer and dog team in winter making the cost of feeding excessive and at times inconvenient. Because of the high rates prevailing one has to deprive himself of many necessities which, to the good of one's health, should be on hand.\nThe wood supply is an item of much concern. It is procured from a distance of about 1/2 mile and the trees have to be felled, sawed into lengths and hauled to the schoolhouse where they are sawn into stove lengths. All this is done by the school staff without any assistance from the native settlers.\n\nThe amount of fuel required can only be realized by one who has encountered a northern British Columbia winter and suffered the draughts of a log building constructed more for educational purposes than for protecting the teacher and children from wintry blasts.\n\nAt one time the building was covered with moss but this material has since dried out and though repeated requests have been made to have the school re-roofed no effort has been made to do the work. To this end I cannot give commendation to the Indians for the support they have given in maintaining the school.\n\nAs much as the school was opened for their convenience and good of their children I do believe that some means should be taken to make them support the school at least with a little labor for which they have plenty of time.\n\nIn closing, I wish to express my gratitude to Mr. Reed for his kindly interest he has shown me in my \"habitation\" and pioneer existence and also offer my thanks for his assistance and timely advice so kindly proffered.\n\nRespectfully Submitted,\n\nJ.E. Moran\nTeacher Flappan Indian School\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter in regard to the Klappan Day School Affairs, and the payments due for salary, to its teacher Mr Moran.\n\nThe cheques therein mentioned have not yet been received, however they might have been forwarded direct to him.\n\nSubmitted herewith is Mr Moran's completed questionnaire, which has just been received from the school district.\n\nAlso is submitted the Teachers Day School Report covering the month of February. This report is considered good, and it is seen that two separate Indian fractions, are now working together and their youngsters attending school.\n\nAs stated previously, it is hoped to pay this school a visit in the near future, when all future requirements will be listed and reported upon.\n\nThere seems to be no reason now why this venture in the way of a Bush School should not go right ahead, and very good results obtained.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C., Jan. 17th, 1939\n\nREPORT ON STIKINE AGENCY FOR MONTH OF DECEMBER 1938\n\nThe Klappan winter day school has been carried along by school master Moran, in the usual efficient manner and the fur returns are showing up better than ever.

This was a new venture started some three summers ago, and as reported is no doubt a success. Bishop Coudret thinks highly of this idea, and goes so far as to say that all schools should be \"winter Schools\". However, he intends to let Mr. Moran return to this point for next winter, and all the Indians wish this. From the Office point of view it is a fine idea. Supplies have been submitted by Recquisition, it is hoped that same can be allowed. They might seem to be much, but it must be remembered that the old Cabin was not too big, and now the school is working, it could be set on its feet once and for all. The School Masters job is not a nice one, and some comfort should be allowed him.\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Klappan Seasonal School\n\nReturns have just been received for the months of April and May, 1938, in connection with the above school.\n\nPlease issue cheque for $200.00 and forward same to the teacher, J. E. Moran, care of Harper Reed, Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, B. C.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSir,\n\nSchool Master J. Moran, of the Klappan Day School; having finished up his term for the winter, reported in today. He has done some very good work out at the Klappan School, and this is the first winter that no reports have been heard of in regard to making \"home-bread.\" His school returns are herewith submitted.\n\nHe states that up to now only three cheques for his services have come to hand viz.: $300-00 Apr 2, $100-00 Apr 11, the $100-00, and he thinks that payment for March is still to come. Owing to delayed mails this is quite possible.\n\nAs he is also the schoolteacher for the Dease Lake Summer School he will be moving out to that point as soon as the roads will permit his passage out. This school will be opened up as soon as ever it is possible.\n\nA report on his winters work will be submitted at a later date.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nThe Dept Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa,\nMay 20, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Klappan Seasonal School.\n\nReturns have just been received for the month of March, 1938, in connection with the above school.

This cheque was sent in your care and should have reached him before this.\n\nPayment of his salaries for the months of January and February will go forward this week.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

C.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nJanuary 23rd, 1939.\n\nThe Indian Office,\nTELEGRAPH CREEK, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to submit a report of my visit to, and inspection of; The Klappan Winter School, situated about 60 miles to the south east of this Town. The reason for such visit was a letter received from Indian Guy Reid that his wife was seriously ill, after a confinement, and expected to die - and also a letter from the School master informing me that the Chicken Pox Epidemic had reached that remote area, and several cases needed a Doctor's attention.\n\nTherefore on the morning of January 16th a start was made by J. C. Dennis's team of 6 dogs, which allowed of my arrival at the School Area at 5 P.M. on the 17th inst.\n\nThe indian woman was at once seen, and found to be in a very weak condition, due to loss of blood. This received immediate attention and by the next morning all hemorrhaging bleeding had ceased, and the woman was on a fair way to recovery. It was found that the Chicken Pox epidemic had nearly gone its course with the children of this community and there were no fresh cases. Attention was given this matter and further need for worry need not be given this outbreak.\n\nWith regard to the general health of this camp, this was found to be good as a whole. Situated here were fourteen families - 29 Adults and 42 children. It was found that 21 children were in attendance at school. Upon inspection of these children, several were found suffering from enlarged tonsils and adenoids, with two cases of septic tonsillitis. It is considered that these latter cases should receive attention during the summer months, when they come in to Town. Several cases of Myopia were discovered, these should be supplied with glasses, so that their efforts at the school might be brought to full benefit. Indian Dougan Dennis whose eyes received attention in Vancouver last summer, was now found to be totally blind. This man requested an advance in the issue of his relief, as he is now helpless to fend for himself. I wish to report that there were two cases of bone tuberculosis, both of which were in the hands, and one of which the finger should be removed. One Girl age 16 showed signs of T.B. Pulmonary, and this case will receive further attention when she arrives in town next Spring.\n\nIn regard to vaccination, it was found that 10 youngsters had not been vaccinated at all, and five others were found upon whom the last vaccination had not \"taken.\" This summer it is my intention to look over all the Indians and give attention where due.\n\nAt the Indian Agent's request an inspection of the School itself was undertaken, and the following data is rendered.\nDr. G.W. Meyer's Inspection Report\u2014contiu.\n\nMr. J.A. Moran the Schoolteacher, was found to be doing splendid work. As stated there were 21 children in attendance, they were well disciplined and their ability to sing a number of well selected songs was quite a revelation. The children were well dressed and neat appearing to enjoy their training. Also the parents were well satisfied with the progress made, and spoke highly of Mr. Moran's ability as a teacher.\n\nThe school building consists of a log house 30 x 19 which has been divided by a partition into school room and a small living quarters for the Teacher. Father Bosse O.M.I. has built a lean-to at one end of the building, which it is stated was at his own expense, and when visiting the community holds his services within this school-house. Mr. Moran assured me that he allows no interference with the regular school hours by the Church.\n\nThe flooring of this school is extremely rough, and difficult to keep clean, but Mr. Moran is endeavoring to persuade the Indians to whip-saw enough lumber for a better floor, which they can do with the equipment supplied last Fall. The lighting of this building is not what it should be. There are only two long narrow windows supplying the daylight. Whilst these windows are in the right position, being behind and to the right of the children, there should be another window on their left side. This Mr. Moran intends to correct in the near future.\n\nIn conclusion it is mentioned that I consider this a very happy venture; the parents seemed most satisfied and there is no doubt but that the children are receiving much benefit from their school attendance.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDr. G. W. Meyer, M.D.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nSubmitted Sir, in connection with R.C. Mission School Work within the Stikine Agency.\n\nHarper Reed Indian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit attached a Report on the activities of the Klapan Winter Day-school of the R.C. Mission in these parts, rendered by Dr G.W. Meyer, M.D., to which area he was called on urgent medical matters. As it was almost impossible for your Agent to visit this school in the near future, the Doctor was requested to carry out an inspection of the whole affair out that way, as much expense and equipment has been allowed this school effort.\n\nThe Doctor who is quite conversant with such matters, is quite pleased with what he found, and the many matters contained in his report will receive attention in the Spring-time, when these nomads come into Town.\n\nAgain it is wished to state that this venture of a Bush-Winter-School is considered a success, not only are the Indians providing their own up-keep but they are far healthier in their native environment, than they would be in this Town-site, from which the Sun is absent for some time in the winter months.\n\nThe number of children are not many, but it is hoped that next winter two more families will be located out that way\u2014one of which is now living in this townsite\u2014destitute, with 12 small children in shocking conditions.\n\nThis school has now received all the equipment that is considered necessary, and for the future only school material\u2014fuel and light will be called for issue, with possibly a few odd drugs.\n\nIn connection with the above state of affairs, it is to be mentioned that the Heads of the Families, now their families are under protection, find it more easy to stay away on their distant trapping grounds for longer periods\u2014thereby increasing their fur catches.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources\nOTTAWA.\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo enclosing a report on the work that has been done during the past few months at the Klappan seasonal school. I was glad to note that you are well pleased with the results of the current season's work. If any supplies are required for next winter you should let me know as soon as possible and at the same time give full shipping directions. In your letter you should state whether the articles recommended by you can be secured locally and, if so, give the approximate cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter dated January 11th in regard to the Salary Cheques, covering three months, that have been paid to Mr J.B. Moran of the Klappan Day School.\n\nIt appears that Mr Moran came to Town and collected the Mail and obtained his pay cheques, but did not mention the fact when calling at this Office.\n\nLast Fall both he and Father Bosse requested this Office to settle up an Indian freight bill, to value of $78-00, for taking their private freight out to Klappan - which was done and this favour has not yet been cancelled. It is thought now that Mr Moran considers that the Department should pay such expenses, which of course cannot be done.\n\nHowever he has now been written to, and requested to settle the outstanding amount, which he will no doubt do.\n\nMay it be respectfully mentioned that the routine in use last summer, in regard to Teachers Salaries - cash paid from the Indian Office; operated extremely well and was most flexible. Moreover it somewhat \"held\" the Mission Operators, as they are rather given to running their various Missions without consulting the Indian Office more than is possible, and have become, lately, rather independent.\n\nThe local Postmaster has now promised to turn the pay envelopes into the Indian Office for the future, and so it is possible to settle the matter, that way.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI beg to respectfully submit herewith a few views in connection with the Klappan Winter School, and some work accomplished by Dr. G.W. Meyer, M.D. C.M., during the late Chicken Pox Outbreak.\n\nIt is regretted that these views were not submitted at the same time as the Reports were rendered, but they have only just been received from the South.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nSTIKINE AGENCY.\n\nViews re Klappan Winter School & Chicken Pox Outbreak.

Moran as Teacher to the Klappan Winter School.\n\nMr Moran went out there some little time ago, and as no runners have come in from that point since it is not known exactly when the school did open up.\n\nThe payment for his services as Teacher will no doubt be as that of last year, viz $100-00 per month, and it is wished to know if the Department intends to pay this salary direct to him, or in bulk funds through this Office.\n\nThe school supplies have now arrived by Air Mail and will be forwarded to this school as soon as some Indian comes in.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nDept., Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nOctober 30, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 4th instant regarding the appointment of Mr. J.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\nDr. G.W. MEYER  \nPhysician and Surgeon  \nTelegraph Creek,  \nB.C.\n\nJanuary 12, 1940.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,  \nIndian Agent,  \nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAt request of Indian Office I made a trip to Klappan Day School, situated on Iskut Lake, 60 miles south-east of Telegraph Creek, at which J. E. Moran is teacher.\n\nOn January 2nd some Indians, parents of children attending Klappan School, had reported at Indian office that a good deal of sickness prevailed at the camp, chiefly sore throats, and that a woman expecting a child was suffering from a heart ailment, and expected trouble at her approaching confinement.\n\nWe left Telegraph Creek on the 5th inst., the Indian Office providing dog team and driver, headed for the Klappan School area. This year the trail was very difficult, owing to scarcity of snow, especially over the Lava Beds, and progress was slow on account of open water due to mild weather and necessitating a relay over the Goat Mountain as the South Fork of the Stikine was wide open. However, Klappan was reached on the evening of Jan. 8th. A runner from Klappan met us on the trail 20 miles out and reported that the childbed case was in serious condition and had been in labor for two days without being able to effect delivery. I therefore decided to continue the trip after dark, and we arrived in the camp long after nightfall. Here immediate attention was given to the woman in trouble, which was found to be a case of mal-presentation, impossible of delivery without aid, by their own efforts. By midnight the child was delivered, and both mother and child left in good condition.\n\nOn the following morning a medical inspection was made of the camp and several cases of adenitis and sore throats attended to. It is considered that the recent epidemic of septic sore throat which had swept over Telegraph Creek and vicinity had about exhausted itself, leaving behind as after-effects quite a few cases of adenitis, all of which are receiving treatment.\n\nAt Klappan I found the following families in residence:\n\n(1) Antoine Tashoots, wife, and two children;\n(2) Maggie Pete, living with Tashoots family, and two children;\n(3) Frank Pete, wife, and one child;\n(4) John Quok, wife, and eight children, including Julia baby;\n(5) Alec Dennis, wife, and three children;\n(6) Joe Mutz, wife and four children;\nMr. Harper Reed, page #2\n\nJan. 12, 1940.\n\n(7) Doggan Dennis and wife;\n(8) Bell Nole, wife and three children.\n\nThere were two cases of trachoma, Jos. Nats and Mrs. John Quok, both of which received treatment.\n\n1. Case of suspected T.B. A boy 17 years old whose sister died nine months ago of pulmonary T.B. This case was instructed as to isolation and care of his sputum.\n\n2. Case of acute tonsilitis.\n\n3. Cases of adenitis with discharging glands.\n\nAll of which were given appropriate treatment.\n\nAt the request of the Indian Agent, affairs of the school were enquired into, and the teacher was asked why no reports had been rendered. Mr. Moran explained that he was not responsible to the Indian Office and took all his instructions from the Bishop, and that it was not his duty to report births and deaths to the Indian Office. After discussing the matter with him, he agreed to do so in the future, and gave me a report to hand to the Indian Agent at Telegraph Creek, notifying him of two births. He also stated that in October there were no Indians here and hence school had not been held. In November there was too much sickness, such as septic sore throats, and there were only two school children, which increased to 9 children by November 15th, but these were ill. Therefore school opened on December 1st with an attendance of eleven (11) children, and this was the number of children in attendance on my visit.\n\nAs my visit fell due on Saturday and Sunday, I did not see any children at the school. He expected a better attendance shortly as several families were moving in, and were now on their way. The school building seemed to be in fair shape, but required some roofing material to stop leaks caused by holes in the roofing material. Mr. Moran also asked me to request permission from you to be allowed to close school early in April, which would enable him to bring in his supplies before the winter trails broke up.\n\nAfter completing inspection and giving all medical aid, as far as possible, we commenced our return trip to Telegraph Creek, visiting en route all Indians' camps, including Guy Reid and family, Scotty Dennis and family, Nelson Reid and Isabel Reid, and reached Telegraph Creek on the evening of January 10th.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted by\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\n\nSubmitted Sir.\n\nHarper Reed Indian Agent.\nSir,\n\nRe:- Klappan Day School - Winter.\n\nI beg to submit herewith, a Day School Report, covering the month of December 1939 for the above school. This Report was brought in by Mr. Meyer, upon his return from a medical inspection for the school area, and is the first information of the schools affairs received this winter. Mr. Moran visited Telegraph Creek a day or so during the first of the Year, but did not call at this Office. A call would have been paid him, had it not been stated by one of the Klappan Indians, that Mr. Moran would call later on; but he returned to Klappan without my seeing him.\n\nTeacher Moran's remarks on this Report call for some explanation and they are as follows:\n\nIn regard to the month of October, Mr. Moran was in this Office on the 9th of that month and signed his Teachers Papers, and we were both well aware of the fact that the Indian families were late in moving out to their winter Quarters. There was some delay again this year on the arrival of the school supplies, but with a few extra school supplies purchased from the H.B. Coy., sufficient was supplied to carry the school along. These went out by pack train on the 16th of that month.\n\nThe real fault with this fall down of attendance can be laid to the fact that all the Indians of this district made very good wages over the summer months, and at the end of the season, delayed their movement out to the woods for the enjoyment of Town life as long as possible. Then as it happened an epidemic of Septic Sore Throats attacked through this district, and caused a further delay, so that no doubt such sickness hindered the opening-up of this school.\n\nDr. Meyer, who has just returned from an inspection of that point, reports that the epidemic has worn itself out and that the month of January should see a better attendance. Mr. Moran questioned the Doctor as to if the Department would allow his salary over that time it was impossible to operate the school; but that, as the Doctor stated was a matter entirely for the Department to decide upon.\n\nAlso a request was received from Teacher Moran, that he be allowed to close up this school earlier this year than usual. It seems he wished to come into Town to freight out some supplies of what kind is not known, but in time to do so are the winter trail thaws out. All the school supplies forwarded for the use of this school are already out there, and there are no more departmental supplies to be forwarded until next summer. It is considered that as the school started so late, that the school term should be continued as long as possible, this year.\n\nIt is my duty to report that for the last two seasons, matters generally have not been going along as smoothly as could be wished for in connection with this Winter School's Affairs. The reason for this is unknown, and the Parents of the children attending the school upon being questioned, avoid a direct reply.\nIt is thought however that perhaps some little extra attention is allowed some families, whilst others think perhaps they are being slighted, but whatever it is, Indian style, no information can be obtained to go upon.\n\nTeacher Moran has done excellent work at this point, for which we are very thankful, and he is an excellent Teacher, but if it were possible to have an exchange of Teachers, if only for one season; it is considered it would improve the situation to some extent.\n\nThis winter bush school was started as an experiment, with the object in view of giving training to these nomadic children, and at the same time allowing their fathers to continue their trapping with less family troubles to look after. At the start it was very successful, and everybody was delighted. The fur returns showed some improvement. This carried along until Father Joseph paid more attention to trapping affairs than to the conduct of the school, and the necessary family affairs that always claim consideration in such a camp; and to speak truthfully we have not yet recovered from the unsettled state of affairs that then came about.\n\nHowever, it is hoped that this Agency may be granted a visit by the Inspector of Indian Agencies for B.C., this coming summer, and then it will be possible for him to interview some of the parents and find out exactly what steps to take, for the continuation of a very useful, and much wanted winter school.\n\nUnder separate cover is submitted Dr Meyer's Report upon his visit to this point, in which it will be seen that he arrived just in time to save the life of an Indian woman, who was in child-birth trouble. Also he mentions one or two items that are required at this school, all of which will receive due attention ere the next school season opens up.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nDept. Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa:\nApril 4, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Klappan Seasonal School\nNo. 657\n\nThe above-mentioned school was in operation during the month of March, 1940, and consequently a cheque for $100.00 should be issued in favour of the teacher, Mr. J. Moran, and sent to him in care of Harper Reed, Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, B. C.\n\nNo further payment will be made to this teacher at the present time as it is understood that the school closed on March 31, 1940.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nApril 4, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th ultimo regarding the Klappan Seasonal School a cheque will be issued in favour of J. Moran for the month of March and will be forwarded to him in your care.\n\nAs intimated to you in official letter of February 8 the Department considers that this school should not be opened during the winter of 1940-41. When a decision is made to re-open this school it should be on the understanding that the Indians will provide the fuel required without cost to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\nStikine,\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter in regard to the Klappan Seasonal School affairs, dated February 8th, in which it is seen that Mr Moran will be paid as from November 1st, last and that this school will close on March 31st of this year.\n\nAn Indian runner happened to be in Town when the mail arrived so it was possible to notify Mr Moran, without delay, and this has been done. He has also been requested to have such Indians that wish the school continued next winter, to sign their own names, or make their marks, to that effect; which same can be checked up at a later date.\n\nI am told unofficially that Mr Moran wishes to take up some mining during the coming summer, hence the supplies he wishes to take in to that district. However this might not come about, as His Lordship Bishop Bunoz has mentioned Mr Moran as the Teacher for the Mc Dames Summer Seasonal School.\n\nYour Agent rather thinks it would be a very good object lesson, were this school discontinued over one winter; and upon the re-opening, the Indians should provide their own heating fuel. Both the Indians with their Teacher, lately, have taken matters much for granted and hold the impression that the Department have \"got\" to provide schools.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed Indian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 10th regarding the salary payment due to Teacher J.E. Moran of the Klappan Winter Day School.\n\nThis matter was reported upon under date of January 13th, 1940, and since that date no further reports have been received from this teacher.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nAtlin, B.C., Feb. 14th, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON STIKINE AGENCY FOR OCTOBER 1939.\n\nThe R.C. Mission School teachers arrangements, for moving to their various points met with a little delay at the beginning of the month. It was not known then as to if the Dease Lake Winter school would be opened or not. Later on it was decided not to open this school, so therefore Mr. Moran intended to take up his duties at the Klappan school, as in years past. Mr. Anglin had tried in vain to obtain a plane to carry him out to the Caribou Hide School site, which had he done so would carry the school supplies also, but this was not possible, owing to lack of planes. Therefore the only way out of this situation, was the use of dog teams and a pack train that was wintering out that way. On the 16th inst. both Mr. Moran and Mr. Anglin left Telegraph for their posts.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nMoreover some sickness came about, also a bad birth case so serious that the native women could not handle same and therefore Dr. Meyer was requested to visit the school's location. The Doctor was also asked to look over the school and report how matters were progressing there as no word had, as yet, been received from the teacher Mr. J. Moran.\n\nA report has already been submitted on the findings, and it is again considered that if a change of teacher could be allowed, even for a season, at this school, the small dissatisfaction now evident amongst the Indians in that camp would no doubt vanish.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 10th, 1940.\n\nREGISTERED\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSalary - November 1/39 - January 31/40\n\nI am inclosing herewith cheques as follows in payment of your salary for period November 1st, 1939, to January 31, 1940:\n\nCheque No. 51050 - $100.00 November, 1939.\n# 26547 - 100.00 December,\n# 17107 - 100.00 January, 1940.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIncls.\n\nL.

Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nWAB/J\nOttawa,\nFebruary 8, 1940.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 12th ultimo enclosing letter received from Dr. Meyer with reference to conditions at Klappan Seasonal School.\n\nAfter considering the contents of the two letters it is felt that it would be fair to allow Mr. Moran salary from November 1, 1939, at the rate of $100.00 a teaching month, the same rate as allowed last year, but, as we were only able to provide a total amount of $500.00 in the current year's appropriation for the salary of the teacher of this school, we can only pay him to March 31. Consequently you should inform him that this school should close on March 31, 1940. Unless you feel assured that there would be a larger attendance if the school were open during the winter of 1940-41 the Department is inclined to feel that it would be inadvisable to have the school in operation during that period. Due to present economic conditions it is necessary to carefully survey all expenditures and if the number of children in attendance during next winter would not be any larger than the number that are apparently attending during the current winter I feel that it would be economically unsound to continue the school until such time as the Indians are prepared to give it greater support.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 8, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Klappan Seasonal School\nNo. 857\n\nMr. J. Moran was appointed teacher and began duties at the above-mentioned school on November 1, 1939, at a salary of $100.00 a teaching month.\n\nThis is the same teacher and the same salary rate as was paid during the last winter.\n\nWhen issuing salary cheques at the end of February Mr. Moran should be sent a cheque for the period November 1, 1939, to February 29, 1940, a period of four months. The cheque should be drawn in favour of Mr. Moran and should be sent to him in care of Harper Reed, Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, B. C.\n\nMr. Moran's name should also be included on the pay list for the month of March, 1940, and for this month he should be paid an amount of $100.00. His name should be taken off the pay list at the end of March and no further payments made to him until further advised.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSir,\n\nRe:- Klappan Winter Day-school. 1940-1.\n\nWith further reference to your letter dated February 8, 1940, regarding the affairs of the above Winter School, it will be remembered that some little trouble existed in connection with the prompt attendance of those Indians, at the commencement of school term.\n\nThe instructions contained in the above mentioned letter, was passed on to Teacher Moran, and the Indians concerned, which produced a very salutary effect. They were instructed to get up a Petition to have the school continued over the coming winter, and worded in such wise that it mentioned they would be there on time. Submitted herewith is a copy of the petition as received, but it will be noticed that Mr Moran has not mentioned the vital question of the children being at the Camp and ready to attend school, when it is opened next Fall. Therefore a special typewritten petition was sent out for them to sign, mentioning the fact of the time agreement. This has not yet returned.\n\nHowever, several Indians have been in to say that they wish the school opened up again, in fact they will not know what to do, or where to camp, should it not open up. Mr Moran the Teacher called at the office, and seemed quite concerned in the matter also.\n\nTherefore it can be stated that they have received the required lesson, and they are all set to open up this school next Fall, on time with a good attendance.\n\nIt is considered that the school should be allowed to remain in operation over the coming Winter, and for a period of 6 months and not until the end of May as stated in their petition. Six months is thought quite long enough for these families to remain in that one camp.\n\nSubmitted herewith is a Requisition covering the above school term, if same can be granted. It is understood that Mr Moran will again be the Teacher for the coming winter term.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nWith reference to part of the monthly reports from Mr. Indian Agent Reed, particularly that dated January 1940 and attached extracts handed to me by Inspector Coleman, I may say that the matter of the continuation of part time and summer schools in the northern part of the Province was discussed with His Excellency Bishop Bunoz, O.M.I., yesterday.\n\nI pointed out to His Excellency that Mr. Reed's reports in connection with Mr. Moran's work appeared to be far from satisfactory. It should be noted that Mr. Moran is not a Catholic Priest. His Excellency did not of course support Mr. Moran in the foolish idea that this man's responsibility was to him alone and agreed with me that all necessary reports and returns called for by the Department should be submitted to the Indian Agent.\n\nI suggested to His Excellency that the Department might not have sufficient funds to carry on Summer and part time schools in the northern part of the Province this year, and was informed that so far no official letter had been received by the Bishop to this effect. His Excellency is anxious to know at once what can be done as the teachers in some cases come to British Columbia from a distance for this summer work, students from Edmonton, etc. His Excellency also pointed out that if the Department had decided to discontinue these schools the question of the dismissal of Mr. Moran would solve itself.\n\nMay I suggest that this letter be forwarded with your recommendations to Mr. Hoey, and that the Department be asked to write as soon as possible to His Excellency Bishop Bunoz, O.M.I., to inform him that along with the part time and summer schools of other denominations the grants made to Catholic Summer schools and other part time schools will be discontinued for the duration of the war.\n\nI explained to Bishop Bunoz that the Department had not sufficient funds to carry on the whole of the educational work previously attempted in British Columbia, that the Catholic Church was not being particularly picked out for a reduction of grants, and that we were making an effort to so reduce expenditures where this could be done that the regular Indian schools might be carried on. Bishop Bunoz was informed of my recommendation that in several non-Catholic schools I had recommended a reduction from a ten month academic year to one of nine or eight months. Bishop Bunoz was assured that the United Church and Anglican schools were being dealt with in exactly the same way as the Catholic schools.\n\nThe Bishop did not raise any objection to the closing of these part time schools under the present circumstances, but wished to be informed of the Department's decision as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H.

(R3 10, Volume 6410, file 857-1, part 1)\nStikine.\n\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nJuly 23rd, 1940.\n\nYOUR REVERENCE,\n\nIt is wished to acknowledge, and to also thank you, for your letter dated July 3rd 1940, in regard to the affairs of the Klappan Seasonal School.\n\nThe question as to who the Teacher shall be is not within my authority to pass upon; it is only possible for an Indian Agent, to state the views held by the Indians concerned; supplemented by his own views that he considers, would benefit an Indian community.\n\nHowever, there is little need to mention that the Klappan School with that of Caribou Hide, are very important, family winter training communities; and above all things, call for a fatherly care and attention continuously. It is considered that the actual teaching of the children is hardly as important as keeping a good orderly, and moral tone, in the camp itself - in between school hours and this a Reverent Father would be most capable of achieving.\n\nThe above is only a viewpoint held by this office, caused by the many local half-breed lads, that visit this area, during the winter months. However, your letter shall be submitted to the Department for their consideration and advice.\n\nHis LORDSHIP,\nBishop Bunoz, O.M.I.,\nPRINCE RUPERT, B.C.\n\nI am, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\n[Signature]\nHarper Reed Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nAugust 2, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Hanson:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of July 26 enclosing copy of a letter which you received from Mr. J.

Moran who has been in charge of the Klappan Seasonal School for the past three terms:\n\n\"He keeps dogs and spends little time around the camp but mostly over at White Packer Bill Elder's camp. He will not be co-operative. He is in the habit of going into Telegraph Creek and returning to the school without conferring with the Agent. Though requested for co-operation in securing vital statistics for the locality in which he is teaching he claims that he has only responsibility to the Bishop. Apparently also he has been encouraging a white friend named MacStephen to trap over Indian territory.\"\n\nThe Agent's complaint was brought to the attention of His Lordship Bishop Bunoz and apparently he discussed the matter with Mr. Moran as the latter has recently forwarded to us the enclosed letter.\n\nYou will note that this letter appears to answer very satisfactorily the complaints made by the Indian Agent. It would be appreciated if you would give the matter your kind consideration and let me know if you are aware of any reasons why Mr. Moran should not be again employed as a teacher. When replying Mr. Moran's letter should be returned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.

In corresponding with Mr. Hoey, Supt. of Welfare and Training, I have reflected each one as each is a lie.\n\nI think, Mr. Hanson, you are well acquainted with Telegraph Creek and also with Mr. Reed, therefore I can say to you what I cannot say to Mr. Hoey and that is that the Indian Agent is not a dependable source for information.\n\nTo be truthful, I have my difficulties with Mr. Reed but can you name one who doesn't?\n\nAn investigation into the matter would reveal that several minor matters and of a personal nature are at the bottom of these allegations. Also, that in three years I have made several friends and am well spoken of.\n\nAt the present time my position is in jeopardy and should I lose it I shall always feel that a grave injustice was done me.\n\nI trust that you, with your knowledge of local affairs, will give me your support.\n\nVery truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

Father Carpentier, O.M.I., called again this month on the subject of the coming winter's schools. He was told the war might have an effect on such affairs but that it was too early at present to say or know what the Department could do. However, it is mentioned that the personnel of the R.C. Mission in these parts has somewhat grown by the addition of two more Rev. Fathers, both young. No doubt they are up this way on a visit, but should they stay on, as indeed they might, the salaries allowed by the department to their school teachers will become very useful. Father Carpentier was nicely given to understand that in no case will the Department consider any expenses connected with the fuel supplies needed for the Mission schools. There is no doubt, what-so-ever, that the parents and grown up lads should supply their own heating wood. This they can easily do, and as instructed by the Department; they have been advised to this end.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C., June 10, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON STIKINE AGENCY FOR MONTH OF APRIL\n\nThe R.C.Mission Seasonal schools are nominally under the supervision of the Rev. Father Carpentier, O.M.I., and during the winter three such schools have been in operation viz. Klappen Day School - Dease Lake School, and that of Caribou Hide. Reports on all the above have been rendered to the Department whenever it was possible to do so. As this month sees the breaking of winter into the summer season, it is mentioned that three summer season schools will be in operation this year, viz., Thalton Reserve Anglican, as mentioned above. The McDames Reserve Day School, in the middle of the Cassiar and the Laird Post Day School, near the Yukon border Line at which several Yukon children attend. The latter two schools being carried on by the R.C.Mission.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 21st, in regard to the Klappan Seasonal Day School (Winter) and the decision arrived at, which grants a term of schooling this winter; of four months.\n\nRev Father Carpentier, who is in charge of all R.C. Mission affairs in this district, has now been advised of this fact, and at the earliest moment, will submit the name of the Teacher.\n\nIt is expected, however that Mr Moran will resume the duties here, as in past years.\n\nMay therefore the school supplies now requested be forwarded as soon as possible, as a chance to have same transported out to that point, by some party going that way, is most probable today.\n\nI am.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nRe:- Klappan - Winter Seasonal School.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 7th, in regard to the opening up of the above school for the coming season (winter).\n\nHere again, as with the Caribou Hide School, it is really considered that these Indians could very well \"miss a season\" and devote their time to their trapping grounds, and build up some cabins etc., thereon. The matter of correctly \"run\" trapping grounds is most important, should the War continue for long. Not only from the Revenue point of view, but also from one of Health.\n\nTo report on this matter in September is rather late, and if a ruling is made now, then the Indian families \"make up their minds\" to go trapping etc., which is a far different matter to their going out to a community School Camp - and then the men proceed to trapping.\n\nThen again, were they to \"miss\" a season; there is no doubt that the re-opening, when possible, would be more appreciated.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nAs you were promised on the occasion of your recent visit to the Department Indian Agent Reed is being advised that the Klappan Seasonal School can be operated for a period of four months; namely, from November 1 to February 28, 1941. During that period the teacher will be allowed salary at the rate of $100.00 a month.\n\nThe following complaint has been received regarding Mr. Moran who was in charge of the school during the past winter:\n\n\"He keeps dogs and spends little time around the camp but mostly over at White Packer Bill Elder's camp. He will not be co-operative. He is in the habit of going into Telegraph Creek and returning to the school without conferring with the Agent. Though requested for co-operation in securing vital statistics for the locality in which he is teaching he claims that he has only responsibility to the Bishop. Apparently also he has been encouraging a white friend named MacStephen to trap over Indian territory.\"\n\nIt is most important that a teacher of an Indian day school should co-operate fully with the Indian Agent and, besides, the teacher should not encourage anyone to trap on Indian territory. As a consequence of the report received I feel that it would be most inadvisable to re-appoint Mr. Moran to the Klappan Seasonal School next winter and I should, therefore, appreciate your securing the services of some other teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRt.

With special reference to the Klappan School I may say that Bishop Bunoz visited the Department recently and it was decided to operate this school for a period of four months during next winter. Indian Agent Reed is being so informed.\n\nI have noted the complaints against Mr. Moran and Bishop Bunoz is being requested to secure the services of another teacher for this school next winter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

C.\nOttawa,\nMay 21, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of April 24 and my reply of the 7th instant in connection with the Klappan Seasonal School.\n\nRt. Rev. E.M. Bunoz, O.M.I., Bishop of Prince Rupert, visited the Department today and urged that this school be kept in operation. Our appropriation has been considerably reduced and we advised His Lordship that we could only allow teacher's salary for a period of four months during the winter of 1940-41. I presume the school will open about November 1 and, if so, could operate until the end of February. During that period we are prepared to allow the teacher salary at the rate of $100.00 a month. You should advise me later regarding the name and qualifications of the teacher whom Bishop Bunoz nominates.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI would advise that according to Mr. Indian Agent Harper Reed of the Stikine Agency, some difficulty arose last winter in respect to what he describes as the Klappan Summer School which was very late getting started, which is dealt with in Mr. Reed's report of January 12, 1940, to you. In his monthly report for January, 1940, he also states:\n\n\"Dr. Meyer reported on his visit to Klappan----Found some disagreement regarding Mr. Moran as teacher - states he has dogs etc., and spends little time around that camp, but mostly over at white Packer Hill Elder's camp.\n\nNo doubt teacher Moran wishes a change as also do some of the Indians.\"\n\nMr. Reed's reports indicate that this tendency may give some trouble and will not be co-operative. He is in the habit of going into Telegraph Creek and returning to the school without conferring with the Agent. The Agent has requested his cooperation in securing vital statistics for the locality in which he is teaching but he claims that he only has responsibility to the Bishop for same. Apparently he has also been encouraging a white friend named Mr. Stephen to trap over Indian territory. There was previously considerable trouble with Father Bosse, a former teacher, engaging in similar trapping operations over this ground.\n\nIt is my opinion that, in view of the present need for the most stringent economy in connection\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nThe Secretary\n\nMay 15, 1940.\n\nwith the schools in British Columbia, it would be advisable to close the two summer schools in operation in the Stikine agency in accordance with Mr. Inspector Barry's recommendation, enclosed herewith.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would kindly advise me as soon as possible if you concur in this recommendation.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nfor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\n[GR]\n[Enc.]\nMr. Harper Reed  \nIndian Agent  \nTelegraph Creek B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Reed,\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mr. R.A. Hoey, Supt. of Welfare & Training in which he asks to not re-appoint Mr. Moran as teacher at Klappan school because of complaints made against him, such as encouraging his friend MacStephen to trap on Indian territory, not spending the due time in the Indian camp and especially refusing to co-operate with the local Indian Agent.\n\nI am sorry to hear these things of Mr. Moran because I always considered him as a good Indian teacher. I assure you that I have never encouraged him to take such wrong attitude towards you, on the contrary. In fact I always thought his relations in your regard were harmonious and satisfactory.\n\nHowever the situation may not be beyond mending. If he would apologize and promise you hearty co-operation in the future, I wonder if you would still insist in having him removed. Of course it is up to you; I would be glad myself to give him another chance. The lesson should bear salutary fruits and make him more docile in the future.\n\nE.M. Bunoz O.M.I.  \nBp.\nSir,\n\nRe:- Klappan Day School-Seasonal-Winter.\n\nI beg to submit herewith a letter received from Bishop Coudert, O.M.I., requesting that the above school might be allowed to operate during the winter of 1941 - 1942. Also is submitted a Requisition for school supplies, the material part of which could be obtained locally. The last Report on this school was rendered under date of November 1st 1940.\n\nDuring an interview recently, with His Lordship, the affairs of this school was gone into, and we both considered that as this school served a very large winter Camp of Indian families, which prevented them congregating around the Town of Telegraph Creek, everything possible should be done to keep them out in the Bush, and give them schooling at this point.\n\nThe school term should be for four months, at least-i.e. November-December-January & February; but of course if the period could be extended over March month also, it would be the correct thing to do. The Teacher's Salary at this school has been at $100-00 per month.\n\nHis Lordship then thought that it might be possible to have the same Teacher take charge of this school, with also that of Caribou Hide; by moving on to the latter point, early in the Spring. Perhaps this might be managed, but it shortens each school term, making progress rather difficult. Father Carpentier, O.M.I., who is in charge of all these affairs locally, will be seen when he next comes to Town, and the best arrangement possible will be arrived at, and reported.\n\nThis school has served its purpose over last winter, and fair progress has been made, but an exchange of Teachers is necessary, which matter is being submitted under separate cover.\n\nDuring the visit paid by the Doctor and the Agent last winter, the school was found to be \"off\" the local Reserve, but near-by same; and the camp itself was not in a too clean a state. Better supervision should be exercised by the Teacher in charge. The Indians now understand that they have to supply the winter fuel for their school and have applied for a 6Ft Saw, 2 Wedges, I.Maul, and a heavy splitting axe should also be allowed. This equipment was not listed on the regular School Supply Requisition.\n\nHowever Inspector Cokman, whom here, will hold a meeting with this small Band of Indians, and even might pay the school Site a visit. The affairs of this school are considered of much importance, and its correct operation must be assured.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nSir,\n\nRe:- Mr J.E. Moran / Teacher R.C. Mission Schools.\n\nI beg to submit some correspondence in regard to the above Teacher, which are self explanatory - but it is quite evident now, that Mr Moran has rather out-worn his usefulness as a Teacher of the Seasonal Schools of this Agency.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing at all against this Teacher, personally, but simply he does not wear well, and discord comes about under his supervision. A Rev. Father as a teacher for these schools is far more preferable.\n\nBishop Coudert, O.M.I., recently seen was spoken to on this matter, altho the indian letter has been received since; and His Lordship agreed that a change should be made. Recently three illegitimate children have been born to girls connected with this winter camp, altho perhaps this could not be avoided through, or by, school routine affairs.\n\nMr Moran is an excellent teacher, but far more suitable for some more civilized schooling than that of this wild Stikine Agency.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept.

O.M.I.\n\nIndian Office Note- Apr. 15th, 1941.\n\nAfter this Mr Moran went \"below\" and called at the Indian Commissioner's Office for an interview. Then permission was granted at a little later date, for him to go back as Teacher to Klappen Winter School. Harper REED. I.A.\nSTIKINE\n\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nMarch 25th, 1941.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit, hereunder, a report covering the activities of this Agency over the month of February 1941.\n\nThe Klappan Day School, about 55 miles to the S.E. of this Town has never been visited by your Agent. Therefore taking along Dr Meyer a visit to this school was made on the 7th inst., and Mr J.E. Moran, the Teacher was interviewed, and the Indian Camp inspected. It was understood that Father Bosse' who started this bush-school had erected the school house on that Indian Reserve, but upon looking over the site, it was found the school and camp were away off same. The area was found in a rather dirty condition, and the school-house itself not too favourable. In fact we considered that some better supervision could be allowed this area by the R.C. Mission concerned. Later in the month, when Bishop Coudert was seen in Atlin, the whole matter was talked over, and the suggestion advanced that some Rev Father, of the Missions be placed in charge of this indian camp, and school, for at least one term. Some dissatisfaction exists amongst the parents of the children attending school, and a change of Teacher would no doubt do some good. A further report on this school will be submitted shortly, when all the school reports are rendered.\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nSTIKINE AGENCY\n\nTELEGRAH CREEK, B.C.\n\nFebruary, 12th, 1941.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit, hereunder, a Report covering the Agency's activities over the month of December 1940.\n\nThree such Indians as mentioned above, came in from the Caribou Hide District\u2014200 miles away\u2014and meeting Father Carpentier at the Klappan School location, en route in, mentioned that as a school had not opened up out at their Camp, they were seriously considering coming in to the Klappan School; so that their children might attend that school. Father Carpentier, returning from his short inspection of the Klappan School over the New Year, stated that it would be better for him to send out Father Plain O.M.I., to Caribou Hide at once, as he could now be spared from assisting at the Dease Lake School,\u2014rather than have the Caribou Hide Indians mix up with the Klappan Band.\n\nAs such a movement as that proposed by the Indians is to be avoided at all costs, it was agreed to that Father Plain at once proceed to Caribou Hide and do whatever was possible over the end of this winter. It is expected that he will be able to manage a two and a half months term, at any rate, but will be able to prevent these Indians migrating. Were they to do so, all trapping arrangements would be seriously mixed up, and a loss of revenue result.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\n\nRe: Klappan Seasonal School\nNo. 857.\n\nMr. J. Moran was appointed teacher and began duties at the above mentioned school on November 1, 1940, at a salary of $100.00 a teaching month.\n\nThis is the same teacher and the same salary rate as was paid during last winter.\n\nThe above school will be in operation for a period of four months; viz.: from November 1st, 1940, to February 28th, 1941.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nI beg to submit a Report on the above Winter School as far as it is possible to do so at this date.\n\nUnder Authority 158-7-1 May 21st 1940 permission was granted to reopen this school to cover 4 months in the present winter of 1940 - 1941. The salary granted was at the rate of $100.00 per teaching month, and the name of the Teacher was to be arranged at a later date. The usual replacement of school supplies were granted, with also some few extras such as fuel for light and odd ends. These were received and forwarded in due course.\n\nThe re-appointment of Teacher Moran was in debate for some time, as there had been some dissatisfaction at this school over last winter, and that the Indian women requested a Father for a Teacher. However under authority 158-7-1, Mr Moran was again established as the Teacher for the school, and his duties have proceeded by the Dalziel private Plane, on or about October 27th. Calling at the Indian Office ere he left for a few supplies, which were granted, he stated that the school would most likely open as at the first of November. The duration of this school, this winter is only for four months, and it is to be expected that the R.C. Authorities will be requesting an extension on that period.\n\nSince Teacher Moran departed for his duties he has not been heard from; and this for the simply reason that there has been no traffic cut that way. It is hoped that matters will go along correctly this winter, but owing to two families being retained in Town owing to the results of a Court Action, against the Heads of these families, the number of children in attendance at the commencement of School, will be lower than usual.\n\nIf at all possible, here again, a dog-team will be hired and a visit paid this camp during the winter months. Teacher Moran's Reports will be forwarded as soon as same are received.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nAugust 15, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 23rd ultimo with reference to Mr. J. E. Moran, employed as teacher of the Klappan Seasonal School. I am also in receipt of a letter from him with reference to the various matters about which you wrote.\n\nAfter carefully considering all sides of the case, and after communicating with Commissioner MacKay, it has been decided to advise His Lordship Bishop Buncz, that if he desires to nominate Mr. Moran for appointment as teacher at any seasonal school the Department will approve.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Moran who has been employed as teacher of the Klappan Seasonal School for the past two or three winters. I am also in receipt of communications from Indian Agent Reed and Mr. Moran himself.\n\nAfter carefully considering the various matters placed before us it has been decided that if you desire to nominate him for appointment as teacher of a seasonal school the Department will approve.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Moran, teacher in charge of the Klappan seasonal school by Indian Agent Reed of the Stikine Agency, I would advise that this matter was referred to Mr. Inspector Barry on his trip north last May, at which time he interviewed Bishop Bunoz.\n\nInspector Barry is satisfied that Mr. Moran has made satisfactory reply to the complaints, with which I concur, and under the circumstances I would recommend re-employment of this teacher for the next four months winter term.\n\nThe Inspector of Agencies will be visiting this Agency in September and while it may not be possible for him to see Mr. Moran as the school will not be in session, he may be able to secure some information on the matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nGold Pan Creek\nTelegraph Creek, P.O.\nJuly 16th\n\nMr. H. A. Hoey,\nSup't of Welfare & Training,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nI am today in receipt of a communication from His Excellency Bishop Buno where he quotes certain charges against me that have gone forward to you from Mr. Reed the local Indian Agent.\n\nIf you will allow me I shall refute each and every statement made therein.\n\nFirstly, Mr. Reed states that I keep dogs and spend most of my time at White Passer Bill Elder's. The former is correct; but these are sleigh dogs, the necessity of which can only be realized by one who has spent much time in the bush. I am located 70 miles from Telegraph Creek and all winter freighting and packing are by means of dogs. The keeping of these animals do not disrupt my school.\nHours in the least as I procure their feed on Saturdays. If keeping them is contrary to any rule of the department\u2014I was never made aware of it\u2014and had I been such never would have happened.\n\nAt times mine were the only dogs in camp and on one occasion when having to send for the doctor I was glad to have had them.\n\nAs to the latter portion of Mr. Reed's statement I can only say the derivation of his information is unfounded. Mr. Elder is the only white neighbor between me and Telegraph Creek and is located some 15 miles west. I visited him four times all winter going over on Friday evening and returning on Saturday evening sometimes on Sunday.\n\nSecondly, I am accused of being unco-operative. To refute this I think it will suffice to relate a recent incident.\n\nMr. Reed requested me this spring to have the Indians sign a paper relative to their school. Immediately set about having\nthe matter attended to and in due course forwarded home the paper duly signed. However, it appeared that what I had sent was not precisely what he desired. Two weeks after the school closed Mr. Reed wrote me requesting that I have another sheet drawn up. At the time I had left Klappan and the letter reached me a month later in Telegraph Creek. All mail between Telegraph and Klappan is by courier on occasion.\n\nIf I were failing in my duties of co-operation do you think Mr. Reed would make requests of me after my work as teacher was at an end?\n\nMr. Hoey, I am constantly anxious to be co-operative with Mr. Reed but the matter in question must not involve anything personal and not relative to the school.\n\nThirdly I am of the habit of visiting Telegraph Creek and fail to call on the agent.\n\nSir, I am located 70 miles from the agent's office and Telegraph\nWeek and therefore it would hardly appear that I could make a habit of visiting Telegraph.\n\nI was in town at New Year's and again at Easter for supplies and on both occasions called on the Agent. On the latter I bought supplies to the end of May which I presumed to be the end of the school year. I got report forms from Mr. Reed and he never as much as informed me that the school would close March 31st. On my return to Klapapan I received the letter of information which had gone through to another Indian village by the courier. Mr. Reed gave me the report forms.\n\nIn justice to Mr. Reed I wish to state that the closing of the school was a mis-understanding of a request I had made to him in January.\n\nEach time I am in from the school I call on Mr. Reed that any business can be talked over while before leaving for Klapapan each fall I call on him beforehand.\nThe only occasion on which I was called to conduct business was in connection with the last request from Mr. Reed, aforementioned. This letter was brought to me by the Indians just as I was preparing to leave for the interior. Mr. Reed, so I was told, had left that same morning for Attlin. Under the circumstances I used the local mail.\n\nFourthly, it is stated that I refuse vital statistics. On my files at the Klappan School at the present time I have Mr. Reed's acknowledgements of the vital statistics reported by me. My reports relate to births and deaths there not having been any marriages. Are there other vital matters that I have failed to report? If so, it is because I have been kept ignorant of their nature.\n\nFifthly\u2014I claim to be responsible to the bishop alone. Nothing could be further from the truth. This statement can only date back to a more or less personal matter which I do not deem necessary to mention here. I am fully aware...\nOf my responsibilities to the Indian Department.\n\nMr. Reed's sixth accusation is in connection with one Mac Stephens, whom it is said I have encouraged to trap on Indian trap lines. Mr. Hoey, believe me when I say, Mac Stephens has not been with me for two years except on occasion to visit which lasts two days at the most. I think, if my memory serves me correctly, I saw him three times all last winter. He is located 35 miles from me down the Skeine River with another white man.\n\nBy corresponding with the local game department you will learn the gentleman in question had not even a trapper's license.\n\nThree years ago an Indian offered him the right to trap and I advised against it as no one knows better than I what trouble arises therefrom.\n\nYou may wonder why such accusations should be made.\nSir Mr. Reed if they are not true. For myself I know him and my own opinion is that he never expected me to be confronted with the statements. Personal matters and business should, in my sense of reckoning, be separated but under the conditions I think I am justified in saying that our first fall-out was due to lie in which Mr. Reed's own letter will act as his accuser. I have it on file also.\n\nIf my services, Mr. Hoey, are not satisfactory I am willing to relinquish my position. The Indians, as can be attested to by a petition forwarded to Bishop Buno, are pleased with my work while a glimpse over my requisition for supplies will show you my time is not wasted.\n\nI thank you kindly for your attention and realizing your position I know I can rely on you for justice in this case.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.E. Moran\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nOTTAWA, Ontario,\nAugust 3, 1940.\n\nDr. H. W. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nThis is merely to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of the 2nd instant with regard to Mr. J. E. Moran who has been in charge of the Klappan Seasonal School for the past three terms.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nOlof Hanson.\nSir,\n\nRe:- Klappan Seasonal (Winter) Day School.\n\nI beg to submit herewith a letter received from His Lordship Bishop Bunoz, O.M.I., of Prince Rupert B.C., regarding Mr Moran, who has in past times acted as Teacher for this school. Also attached is the Indian Office acknowledgement to the above letter.\n\nLittle can be added to the correspondence that has already passed on this subject. Both the Doctor, and your Agent consider that a Reverent Father should be placed in charge of this winter Camp, for at least one season. The late unsettled conditions caused by Rev. Father Bosse O.M.I., has not yet passed away, and today this camp is looked upon, as a \"place to stop\" by all the half-breeds that travel out that way and some that go there, specially. This unruly state of affairs would no doubt cease were a Father placed in charge.\n\nAs the Department will understand, it is not necessary to have a \"straight\" Teacher in charge, these nomadic youngsters will learn almost as much from a Father as they would otherwise. Some of the older Indians concerned have been discreetly questioned on this matter, and they certainly would like to have a Father in charge, over the winter months.\n\nNo doubt but what Mr Moran is a very good teacher, but a \"hurry-up\" and \"get-away from the camp\" routine has come about, and so the Indians, mostly the women consider that the Mission is not thinking very much of their welfare. Moreover Mr Moran has taken up mining during the summer time, which is excellent of course, and it is thought that perhaps he would prefer to carry on such interests, the whole year around.\n\nAll preparations have been made for the opening up of this school, next winter, and the school supplies will go out at the first opportunity, after the arrival at this point.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept.

The teacher had no more than casually mentioned that he had two Indians working for him at the school.\n\nThe account is somewhat misleading in that it shows both Jack and Frank Tashoots as having cut 530 feet of lumber at 35\u00a2 a foot. Actually only 530 board feet was cut; the Church paid the men the very high price of $700.00 per thousand board feet for the lumber. Although it had to be logged and whip-sawn by hand the price of $371.00 for 530 f.m. is still very high. Milled lumber could be purchased in town and hauled out to Iskut Lakes Camp by dog-sled (60 miles) for not more than $250.00.\n\nThe school building had a very rough floor in it with wide cracks between the boards which made the school room drafty in cold weather. The school certainly needed a new floor and a new toilet, and if the cost had been reasonable the work would be justified under ordinary conditions. Unfortunately an unforeseen circumstance arose which prevented the operation of the school this season; the majority of the Indians who usually camp at Iskut Lakes remained at Buckley Lake on account of the mild weather and difficulty of transporting their families over bare ground and open rivers. They were also undoubtedly influenced in staying nearer town by the demoralizing epidemics they went through last winter without any medical assistance. These people will probably return to the Iskut Lakes Camp next winter but of course there is no assurance they will do so. The Camp is central to most of the Indians' traplines, the wood supply is good and fish and game are not too hard to procure from the Camp.\n\nThe school building was constructed by the R.C. Church with about $300.00 assistance from the Department in 1937.\n\np.t.o.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nWith reference to the item of $115.00 in the 1944-45 Estimates for repairs to the Klappan (Seasonal) Day School, I wish to advise that this amount is not required for this purpose, and said sum can be released and allotted for another project.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa,\nMay 31, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 28th instant, enclosing letter from Indian Agent Sampson regarding the ownership of various Indian seasonal schools in the Stikine Agency. The Department concurs in your recommendation that the title to these buildings remain with the churches which erected them.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nExtract from Indian Agent Sampson's letter dated April 28, 1944.\n\nThe alternative to this suggestion would be to endeavour to purchase the Missions' share in the schools but I would definitely not recommend this course as I believe that it would be far less expensive, even over a period of years, to pay an annual rental of $75.00 in the case of the Dease Lake and Klappan schools and possibly Lower Post or McDame Creek if either operates, than to purchase these crude log buildings and try to improve them. From past experience it seems that the operation of these bush schools is quite provisional, depending as it does upon whether or not the Indians camp at the location of the school during the usual term. At the present time it seems that any extensive outlay for establishing day school buildings would be unwise, especially in the more remote locations because it is evident that the Indians in this area as a whole are still not inclined to settle permanently in one location. Their houses in and near Telegraph Creek for the most part are used only as stopping over places between their trapping and fishing camps. This has been more evident during the past fall and winter when these people have had to earn their living from the country, as they did prior to the freighting boom from 1941 to 1943 when supplies were going in by this route to Watson Lake Airport. It seems that the life-long habits of the Indians will not easily be changed, even to ensure the education of their children and the more or less temporary bush schools will probably have to serve, at least for the present.\nCopy sent to Father Flourde\n\nOttawa,\nApril 14, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, with reference to the Klappan Seasonal School. Speaking in a general manner the Department feels that extensive repairs should not be paid for by this Branch for any building for which we are paying rent. It is difficult to make a hard and fast rule in a matter of this kind, as certain exceptions may arise.\n\nThe account which has been submitted to the Indian Agent for a new floor cannot be considered, due to the fact that the expenditure was incurred without any authority being given from this office. You realize, of course, that we would have no control over expenditure if we favourably considered payment of all accounts incurred by persons who may be interested in the work and should be fully aware of Departmental regulations requiring Departmental authority before expenditures are incurred for which we are expected to pay.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nAs Mr. Indian Agent Sampson had written me in connection with repairs to Klappan Seasonal School, his letter being enclosed herewith, he forwarded me a copy of your letter of the 9th instant stating that it had been decided to allow the Church authorities to charge a rental of $15.00 per teaching month for the use of this building.\n\nWhen Mr. Inspector Coleman visited the Stikine Agency in 1941, he found considerable confusion in respect to the ownership of the various Seasonal Schools of this Agency as the Department had contributed largely towards the construction of these buildings and the Church were permitted by Mr. Indian Agent Reid to claim the schools, this particular school being an instance. The Inspector instructed Mr. Sampson to investigate each school and clean up the question of ownership with the Church authorities, his suggestion being that if we had contributed by far the larger amount and the Church based their claim on a comparatively small contribution that it might be better to extinguish their claim in each case by some adjustment.\n\nMr. Sampson has been asked to report what action he has taken to carry out the Inspector's instructions, and the department will be further advised on receipt of same.\n\nD.M.

Forget, O.M.I., for period April 1st to May 15th, 1945.\n\nRev. J.F. Tanguay, O.M.I., who had to give up duties on account of a serious accident, was paid for the period from January 25th to March 9th, 1945. This cheque was mailed to Father Tanguay's address in Edmonton.\n\nFather Forget's cheque was mailed to him c/o Bishop Coudert, O.M.I., Whitehorse, Yukon.\n\nSalary at rate of $110.00 allowed in both cases.\nOttawa, 30th November, 1945.\n\nMr. R.H.S. Sampson, Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant, we have recently issued a cheque in favour of Father Carpentier for his services for the period April 1st to May 15, 1945, and forwarded same to Bishop Coudert.\n\nIt is not our usual practice to forward advances in order to pay the salaries of teachers at Indian Day Schools. If either the teacher or yourself would notify this office regarding the exact date on which any particular seasonal school opens and also give us an idea of how long it will be in operation, we can arrange to have a cheque forwarded so as to reach the teacher before the date of the closing of the school. This cheque may not be for the full amount but any balance could be adjusted later.\n\nIn many cases in the past, we did not know that the school had been in operation until we received the return which was very often several weeks or even months late. We are willing to co-operate with the Agent and the teachers but of course this co-operation must be mutual.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nThe teachers of the seasonal schools in this agency have complained from time to time of the delay in receiving their salary cheques. For instance, recently Father Carpentier, O.M.I., who taught at Klappan School from March 26 to the end of April, 1945, advised that he has not yet been paid for his services. In this particular case it was no doubt Father Carpentier's delinquency in submitting the required tax exemption forms which held up payment, but there is usually a delay of a month or two after the conclusion of a quarter, before the salary is received.\n\nThe teachers state that this delay causes them some embarrassment when prompt settlement of their accounts is expected by stores. It often means that a store is obliged to wait several months for payment of an account. The teacher of Klappan School must take his supplies out in December, or even earlier, and yet it is perhaps the middle of May before he receives a cheque for the quarter ending March 31. In the first place there is frequently delay in getting the quarterly returns in to this office owing to difficulties of transportation. Then there is the usual tie-up in the mail service during the spring break-up, which may cause a further delay of two months or more.\n\nWould it be possible for an advance to be deposited with this office, and payment of salary made at the end of each quarter, or monthly if the latter could be approved?\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 3rd October, 1945.\n\nMr. R.H.S. Sampson, Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nI note from your letter of the 12th ultimo that Rev.

Sampson, Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, B.C., dated September 12, 1945.\n\nThis office has been informed by the local Roman Catholic Mission that Rev.

Phelan.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI beg leave to quote the two following paragraphs from a letter written to me by Bishop Coudeurt, on December 7, 1945:\n\n\"The Fathers of Telegraph Creek also complains about the extreme difficulties of transportation to some of their schools, such as Iskut Lake. If you remember one of their schools had to be closed a few years ago, just on that ground; because I did not want to expose my missionaries to freeze to death or to starve on the 250 miles trip to Cariboo Hide; we beeged the Department for three years to charter a plane for the transportation of the school teacher and the supplies as well as the relief rations to that point, but without success; now another reason would militate in favor of that policy, as Family Allowance rations would also have to be shipped to that point. The same condition, to a somewhat lesser degree, exists at Iskut Lake or Klappan; the trip to get there and come back in the spring, along with the carrying of the supplies to that point, absorbs all the money which our fathers get as salary.-I wish, therefore, that clear instructions be sent out from the Branch to the local Indian agent, Mr. Samson, to the effect, that he must see himself about the expenses of transportation of school supplies, and even of the teacher to those points, if the school is to be maintained in Klappan. We would not have any objection to reopen the school at Cariboo Hide or have a school at Shesley (75 miles north-west of Telegraph Creek) if the Branch gives full authority to the local Indian Agent to arrange for transportation of the teacher and supplies to those points.\n\n(2......)\n\nIndian Affairs. (R3 10, Volume 6419, file 857-1, part 1)\nFinally, in connection with the same Telegraph Creek fathers, I am told that the Dease Lake School will probably have to be closed this winter on account of the Indians having moved elsewhere. Right now we have a good number of Indian Catholic Children who reside at Telegraph Creek proper and have no school facilities in the overcrowded white school of the village. Would it not be possible for the Branch to arrange to have the Dease Lake School taught at Telegraph Creek and call it (as we have done at Lower Post) the Seasonal Dease Lake at Telegraph Creek? If the Branch would instruct the local Indian Agent to that effect and ask him to find a suitable location for said school in the village of Telegraph Creek proper, the matter could be quickly arrange to the satisfaction of all. The difficulty in all said matters is that the local Agent is always afraid to act.\"--\n\nIt seems that we who live in the settled parts of Canada, have not as yet grasped the transportation difficulties of our Norther country. The above paragraphs of Bishop Coude's letter clearly demonstrate that fact. I, therefore, hope that you will be able to meet with the Bishop's wishes in the matter of the transportation of the teachers and school supplies for those out of the way points and that you will take immediate steps to so instruct your Mr. Samson.\n\nI will be glad to hear from you as soon as this has been done.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nRe: Klappan - Regarding my previous report for the Rent of the Building and other services for the Klappan School, I got somewhat confused over the months during which our buildings were occupied for that purpose, on account of the interruption caused last winter by Father Tanguay's sad accident.

I do not know what Father Forget would tell the pilot that for, because as you know my offer was to pay 1/3 the cost. My offer was based upon the weight of our respective loads.\n\nThe load which this department had originally arranged to send out was:\n\n- Nurse Dunn 150\n- Medical supplies 50\n- School Books & tools... 50\n- Rations for Indi. 150\n- Total: 400\n\nbut I am informed that we didn't actually have that much weight. The total load taken by Mr. Callison was 1200 lbs., which means that out of that total probably 850 lbs. was Father Forget's load. Under the circumstances, and considering too that Father Forget had previously obstinately refused to take up my offer of 1/3 cost, and stated he was chartering the plane himself and didn't wish the assistance of my office, I certainly cannot consider asking the Department to pay for 2/3 of the cost.\n\nI also learn from the Northern Airways that the cost of the charter will be about $225.00, as it took them 2 1/4 hours flying to get in to the lake. Bad weather made them turn back on their first attempt after they had got within about ten miles of their destination. Then on the final return trip to Telegraph Creek they found the area around the town fogged in and had to return to Buckley Lake for two hours to wait until it cleared. Personally I do not think that the Northern Airways Company should expect you to pay for all that flying time when the complete trip under normal conditions would have taken 1 1/2 hours at the very most. I would therefore suggest that you take this up with Mr. George Simmons when he returns.\n\nWhen you arrived at an understanding with Mr. Simmons I would suggest that you bill this office for a third of the cost arrived at and I will submit the account to the Department for payment.\n\nAs stating that in no sense was this airplane charter requisitioned by\nMr. H.H.S. Simpson, Indian Agent\nStikine Agency\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nJanuary 28, 1946\n\nRe: Airplane Charter to bring School Teacher and other supplies to Klappan\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour recent communication dated January 23 came to me as a shock. No one is to be blamed but you and I concerning the arrangements made by Father Forget with pilot Pat Callison for the trip to Klappan. When you visited me recently on your return trip from Lower Post and discussed this matter with me, I clearly pointed out to you that I was not prepared to pay a charter to Klappan and that I considered it to be the duty of the branch to arrange for the transportation of the teacher and school supplies, as well as other Indian supplies to such an out-of-the-way place.\n\nI told you of the difficulties we had in the past with your predecessor over a similar matter concerning the season's school at Cariboo Hide, after our school teacher Jim Anolin, and later on Father Plaine nearly lost their lives trying to reach Cariboo Hide over land with all their supplies, and actually spent more money for the trip and back than they actually received from the branch for their work as teachers, besides having to live most of the time during the school term on an Indian fare of dried straight moose meat and fish. Following such hardships, and owing to the lack of adequate cooperation from the branch, I then decided to close the School at Cariboo Hide, though we had at that point the most interesting band of Indian children anxious to receive some education.\n\nA somewhat similar situation exists at Klappan; about every year the missionary teaching at Klappan has to risk his life to reach the place overland, breaking through the ice or falling in the rivers to be drowned; on the only occasion I had to make the trip overland to Klappan two years ago, I myself met with a serious accident and came back crippled to Telegraph Creek. On the other hand the hiring of horses or dog sleds with experienced drivers has proved as expensive as the charter of a plane and far less satisfactory for the time and difficulties involved.\n\nOn Dec. 7th last, I wrote to the Superintendent of our Indian Affairs in Ottawa, protesting against such a state of affairs and asking him to take this matter up with the Officials of the Branch so that clear instructions be given to you from Ottawa regarding the expenses of trans-\nIskut Lake, B.C.\n\nFebr.10,1946\n\nTo His Excellency\nBishop J.L.Coudert O.M.I.\nVicar Apostolic of Whitehorse\nWhitehorse,Y.T.\n\nYour Excellency;\n\nThis letter brings to you all the details regarding my chartered trip to Klappan Indian School on January 16th,in company of the local nurse Miss Nancy Dunn.\n\nAs you already know,after the Indian Agent refused to keep up with his previous vocal agreement to share the fare of the chartered trip with the mission,I referred the solution of this affair to Your Excellency and continued to prepare myself for the trip.\n\nUpon receipt of your night letter of January 12,stating that you had made arrangements with Mr.Sampson and asking me to charge the chartered plane to the Indian Department and to refund to the Indian Agent one third of the incurred expenses,I followed your instructions.\n\nWe left Telegraph Creek on January 16 with a ship of the Northern Airways carrying a load of 1225 pounds,viz.\n\n| Item                        | Weight |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| Food and House supplies     | 591    |\n| Rations for Indians         | 150    |\n| Medical and School Suppl.   | 100    |\n| Passengers;Miss Dunn        | 150    |\n| Fr.Forget                   | 150    |\n| Other personal effects      | 84     |\n| **Total**                   | **1225** |\n\nMay I state that a normal trip to Iskut Lake(Klappan School) should take at most one hour and a half flying time.But we made a double trip,due partly to bad weather and partly to the fact that the pilot,as he himself stated\"got mixed up in the line of lakes\".On his way back to town,with the nurse,I heard that the pilot could not land at Telegraph Creek on account of fog and so had to fly out to Bukley Lake waiting for the weather to clear up.\n\nBefore leaving Telegraph Creek I paid to Mrs.Sampson,in the absence of the Indian Agent,one third of a normal trip to Klappan viz.$43.00,the actual rate of a chartered trip by plane with the Northern Airways being $87.00 per hour.\n\nDear Excellency,I hope that these details concerning our trip to Klappan Indian School last January will give full satisfaction to your office and all those therein concerned.\n\nI beg to remain yours very truly in Our Lord and M.I.\n\nJoseph Forget O.M.I.\nVICARIATE APOSTOLIC OF WHITEHORSE\n\npromising school of Cariboo Hide.

Je pense que la grippe dont vous avez souffert m'est arriv\u00e9e avec votre lettre; je me sens fi\u00e9vreux depuis que je l'ai lue, et je me h\u00e2te de vous faire suivre tous ces documents avant de prendre une bonne doze d'aspirine et me mettre moi-m\u00eame au lit; je p\u00e8re que je n'y serai pas dix jours.\n\nC'est d'une nouvelle difficult\u00e9 qu'il s'agit au sujet du transport du p\u00e8re Forget \u00e0 l'Ecole de Klappan. Ce que je craignais est arriv\u00e9; tant que nous avons tout pay\u00e9 comme de bons moutons tout allait bien; maintenant que nous commen\u00e7ons \u00e0 \"kicker\" avec Mr. l'Agent, \u00e7a ne va plus du tout. J'ai fait tout mon possible pour essayer de le reconcilier avec le p\u00e8re Forget; et apr\u00e8s les arrangements clairs et pr\u00e9cis que j'avais faits avec ce Monsieur, voil\u00e0 qu'il veut nous obliger \u00e0 payer les 2/3 du voyage \u00e0 Klappan, dont le plus grand b\u00e9n\u00e9fice a \u00e9t\u00e9 pour le D\u00e9partement et pour la nurse.\n\nLisez ces documents avec soin, et portez les vous-m\u00eame \u00e0 Mr. Phelan.\n\nJ'ai re\u00e7u de lui une lettre m'annon\u00e7ant le paiement des rentes; cela va nous \u00eatre une grande aide; je le remercierai d\u00e8s que les ch\u00e8ques seront arriv\u00e9s et que je me sentirai mieux.

If, as the Agent states the journey could be made in two days, it would not appear that flying at the cost indicated would be justified. It might be explained that travel by airplane is only justified by considerable urgency, that does not appear in the present instance.\n\nD. M.

He pointed out\nthat the length of time they are employed is very short\nand travelling expenses in the North country are quite\nheavy, as in many cases air transportation has to be used.\n\nIt is not our practice to pay travelling\nexpenses of day school teachers, but at the same time Mr.\nHoey and myself thought there was considerable merit in\nBishop Coudert's contention.

Henry, Superintendent\nWelfare and Training\nIndian Affairs Branch\nBooth Building, Ottawa\n\nRe: School Teachers at Shesley, B.C.\nand Klappan, B.C., in the Stikine Agency\n\nDear Sir;\n\nReferring to my letter of Dec. 18, 1946, whereby I notified Your Department that Father Jh. Forget would be available to teach in October, November and December at Shesley, B.C., in the Stikine River Agency, I now find it impossible to send Father Jh. Forget to teach at that point, at such a time. I beg, therefore, to submit for your approval the name of Father M. Turcotte O.M.I., who had some experience already last winter when he conducted the school at Klappan.\n\nIf the attendance proves to be satisfactory, Father Turcotte may continue on the school for a longer period of time after Christmas. I will, in this case, suggest Father Jh. Forget's name as the school teacher in Klappan, as soon as weather conditions allow the Indians to gather at that point.\n\nIn order to make the conduct of these two schools possible, in this particularly difficult district, I was obliged to send a third missionary, at least for the winter months, so that our missionary work elsewhere in the district would not be neglected, such as in Cariboo Hide, Dease Lake, and Telegraph Creek.\n\nI am sure that Your Department will appreciate the tremendous sacrifices we are making for the educational benefit of the Indians located in that area, and will, therefore, give us directly or through your local Agent, all the encouragement our missionaries stand very much in need of. I was placed between the alternative of closing completely this field or sending some reinforcement to our missionaries.\n\nYours sincerely In Christ\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.J.

I also received your cheque of $456.00 for his work at the Lower Post Seasonal Schools in June, July and August of this year.\n\n1.-Regarding his school reports concerning his work at Lower Post, I understand that he sent the Monthly Report for June through Mr. Samson, the local Agent; and has followed the same procedure for the past two months. It may be that the reports have been held back at Telegraph Creek. Whatever may have been the delay, I am forwarding his cheque today, and will advise him to send you directly in Ottawa the copy of his reports for July and August; the school has been officially closed at the end of August and had been conducted most successfully for three full months.\n\n2.-In regard to the school to be conducted last winter at Klappan, I wish you would refer to my letter of Febr. 5 regarding the Klappan School at Telegraph Creek... promised to write to you concerning the whole situation after my visit to Telegraph Creek in March; I was prevented to do so, on account of my many travels and other pressing duties.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Indians of Klappan failed to return to Klappan after New Years, and also failed to come back to town; so, it was impossible last winter to reach them. Father Forget profited, therefore, of this contretemps to go and visit the Indians of Cariboo Hide and Dease Lake, who were in an urgent need of spiritual assistance.\n\nAs to Father Turenne, he went to Shasley for two months and taught school there for some time, but did not think it worthwhile to send in any report on account of the contrary reports sent the previous year by the local Agent.\n\n3.-I expect to be in Ottawa in October, and firmly expect by that time to have a full report on the whole school prospect at Telegraph.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBishop J.L.

To-day it is found necessary to request 5 Rolls of heavy roofing so that this building might be recovered.\n\nThis requisition should have been submitted last summer, but it has been possible to delay same until now. The reason being that with a good winter snow trail the freighting to the location of this bush-school, can be undertaken by one of the Indians that live out that way. The cost of doing will be $5-00 which will be given out in staple provisions, to some family in need of such assistance.\n\nThe new roofing will be held in abeyance at the school and placed on the roof in the late Fall.

This school was visited March 9th and is being reported on in the regular form.\n\nBuilding. Some improvement in the way of flooring, increased floor space and increased lighting, could be effected. Floor boards are hand-sawn spruce with edges and thickness very uneven causing wide cracks and uneven surface. The floor is difficult to clean and was rather dirty at the time of the inspection. With the aid of a whip-saw better floor lumber could be made and when an even surface was obtained, the whole floor covered with roofing paper and painted. The school-room could be enlarged by eliminating the present space of approximately 10 x 15' used as living quarters by the teacher and separated from the school-room by a firman partition. The teachers could be accommodated in the large lean-to at the rear of the school with very little fixing up. Lighting can be improved by enlarging existing windows.\n\nEquipment. Desks and seats are also made of hand-sawn spruce and are very crude but serve the purpose. The blackboard consists of about 12 feet of rubberized cloth backed by more hand-sawn boards. Difficulty in transport precludes the possibility of providing better desks and blackboard unless an airplane is used which at present is very expensive.\n\nFuel. The teacher complained that only one or two of the Indians in camp had supplied wood. This matter was brought up at a meeting held during the visit to Isnat Lake and the Indians promised to supply all the wood needed for heating the school. Apparently the difficulty was that most of the men were away trapping most of the winter and it was not often that they were all in camp long enough to get together and cut and haul wood.\n\nGeneral; This little school is serving in a limited way the much needed education of Indian children in this Agency. In the past, few children have obtained more than the equivalent of two or three years public schooling and this lack is terribly noticeable when youths have great difficulty in writing even their names.\n\nR.H.S.

This account will receive favourable consideration when it reaches here.\n\nI note that you again refer to the possibility of making the payment of rent retroactive. As you know, the funds provided in any one fiscal year expire at the close of that fiscal year. We do not provide funds in each year's estimates which would permit us to make retroactive payments. You will, therefore, realize that much as we might have liked to do so it was impossible for us to give favourable consideration to your request in this particular regard.\n\nThe other parts of your letter have been carefully noted.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. J.L. Coudert, O.M.I.,\nCatholic Bishop of the Yukon,\nP.O. Box 95,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\nCatholic Missions of the Yukon and Prince Rupert\n\nP.O.B.95\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nFebruary 22, 1944\n\nR.A. Hoey, Superintendent\nWelfare and Training Service\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI wish to thank you for your letter dated Feb. 9 inst., regarding repairs which have been made on the Klappan seasonal school. I am sorry to learn from the content of your letter that the mentioned improvements, so strongly recommended by your local Indian Agent, cannot be covered by any grant of the Department. It would seem reasonable in the part of the country such as ours, so very different and so far distant from Ottawa, that Government officials should show more confidence in their local representative, and grant them more authority to act.\n\nWith pleasure, however, I am taking note of your recognition of the Department's indebtedness to us in regard to the use of our mission buildings as school buildings; your proposition of allowing us a monthly rent of $15.00 for the use of our mission buildings in such places as Klappan and Dease Lake seems reasonable enough, and I fully agree to it, though I do not see why such an arrangement could not have any retroactive effect; if the Department officials feel under an obligation in our regard for the present in connection with the use of our buildings, I fail to understand why they would refuse to acknowledge such an obligation in our regard for the past. In accordance with your proposition, I am instructing our missionaries of Telegraph Creek immediately to present to Agent Sampson a bill in three copies for the rent of our mission house at Dease Lake, used as a school building from September last to the end of January just elapsed.\n\nYou may be aware, by this time, that, owing to fear of further sickness as well as to difficulties of communication between Telegraph Creek and the Klappan country, with the soft weather prevailing this winter, the Klappan Indians were unable to reach the place where we had, at such an expense, erected a decent mission school known by the Department as the Klappan School, referred to in my last letter; as a result the building will not be of any use this winter and no school shall be conducted at that point; consequently your proposition concerning the payment of a rent for the Klappan School Building cannot be of any help to us in the settlement of our debts.\nI am taking occasion of this communication to urge again the officials of the Indian Department to take into serious consideration our oft repeated request that something be done early in northern British Columbia and the Yukon about the erection of a Catholic Boarding School and Preventorium for the destitute and orphan Indian children of that area whose number is daily increasing owing to the high mortality rate of the parents.\n\nI also urgently ask for the erection of standard school buildings for the day schools conducted at Dease Lake and in the Klappan country; owing to the experience we had this winter with the Klappan Indians and their trapping ground so difficult of access, it would appear that a school building at Bulkley Lake might prove a better location, closer to Telegraph Creek and less expensive to put up than in Klappan. Pending the realization of this project we shall be ready, according to your proposition contained in your letter dated Feb. 8, to rent our present mission buildings for school purposes at the rate of $15.00 a month.\n\nI wish to call the attention of the officials of the Department that according to our files, the question of a boarding school in the extreme northern portion of British Columbia or along the boundary line of the Yukon was taken up by our Church Officials with the Department of Indian Affairs as early as August 1925. I am sending copies of said files to Father Plourde for reference.\n\nI sincerely hope to see such an important question finally settled along the lines suggested by our missionaries before the present generation becomes altogether extinct.\n\nYou may admire our patience and perseverance over these twenty years of begging and knocking at the door of the government for the sake of its most derelict wards; but, for our part, I must admit that we feel rather scandalized at the attitude of indifference, not to say of utter callousness, assumed by the responsible Officials of the Government in regard to the treatment of those entrusted to their care.\n\nThanking you for your own personal interest and earnest endeavours in the settlement of all afore mentioned problems, I remain,\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nYours sincerely in Christ\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.J. Coudert, M.I.\nCatholic Bishop of the Yukon\nFebruary 9, 1944.\n\nMr. R.H.S. Sampson, Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from His Excellency Right Reverend J. L. Coudert, O.M.I., with reference to the amount that he has expended in improving the Klappan Seasonal School. It has been decided to allow him rent for this building, at the rate of $15.00 a teaching month, and to date this back for the period during which the school was open during 1943. In that year we allowed salary to the teacher from January 21 to May 21, or a period of 4 months. You may forward a voucher for the amount of rent due at the rate mentioned. A similar voucher may be forwarded for the period the school is open during 1944.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, February 9, 1944.\n\nDear Bishop Coudert:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to repairs that have been made to the Klappan Seasonal School. I note the amount that you have expended, but I regret that present regulations do not permit our making a refund. All expenditures have to be authorized previous to being made and, in addition, supplies have to be purchased through our Purchasing Branch. I think you will realize that we could not possibly control expenditure if these regulations are not strictly followed.\n\nI have given careful thought to the manner in which we could assist you in the work at this school, and it has been decided to allow rent for the building at the rate of $15.00 a month. We cannot make a payment for any year previous to 1943. During that year the school was open from January 21 to May 21 - 4 months - and we are requesting Mr. Indian Agent Sampson to forward an account for this period at the rate mentioned. He will also be instructed to forward a similar account for the period this school is in operation during the year 1944.\n\nReverend Father Plourde had already spoken to us about the above matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRight Reverend J. L. Coudert, O.M.I.,\nCoadj. of the Yukon and Prince Rupert,\nP. O. Box 95, Whitehorse, Y.

Indian Day School.\n\nI have immediately written to the Father in Charge to announce him the good news and forward to him the necessary forms to be completed by the teacher, Father A.Drean O.M.I., I instructed the latter to forward the completed forms directly to your office.\n\nI wish to take occasion of this communication to inform you that, on the suggestion of Mr. Samson, the Indian Agent of the Stikine Agency, the priest in charge of the Klappan School had a new floor put in the Klappan School and new toilets built for the children; owing to the difficulties of transportation from Telegraph Creek to Klappan, the Indians had to make all the necessary boards by hand, which made the cost of those necessary improvements quite high; our missionary had to pay $400 approx. to the Indians of Klappan for that work. May I remind you that during the six years the mission house has been used for the school at Klappan not one cent has been contributed by the Department in the way of rent; I hope, therefore, that the Department will help us to pay for the improvements mentioned above. I requested Mr. Samson to mention the cost of said improvements in his next report to the Department.\n\nThanking you and Mr. Phelan for the interest your Department has shown of late in our difficult work in northern B.C. and the Yukon,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely in Christ\n\nJ.L.

Owing to distances and the difficulty in securing prompt action, it is quite likely that Father Arsenault presumed too much, and I am willing to admit that point and to admonish him that in the future all repairs to schools in the Yukon or Northern B.C. districts must first of all be authorized before they can be proceeded with.\n\nHaving this in mind; I hope that you will do your best to have this account settled at least in part.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6419, file 857-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nMay 1st, 1945.\n\nTo Department of Mines and Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nIn account with the Roman Catholic Mission\nTelegraph Creek.\n\nMay 1945.\n\nTo wood cut and hauled for Klappan Seasonal School\n5 cords @ $10.00\n$50.00\n\nSigned...

The school generally closes towards the end of May.\n\nAlthough it is understood that lunches such as biscuits and cocoa are customary in day schools and may be purchased from public funds, this office is not aware of the amount allowed per pupil.\n\nWould the Department authorize the local purchase of biscuits, cocoa, milk and sugar for the native children attending Klappan School during the coming winter adequate for a pupilage of twenty?\n\nP.A.

It is rented from the Roman Catholic Mission at the rate of $15.00 per month for the period in which it is in operation.\n\nWhile the Department is prepared to spend money on buildings which are owned by the Indian Councils, we are reluctant to do so on buildings owned by Churches. Even when buildings are owned by Indian Councils and repairs are carried out by the Department, we usual stipulate that this will be in lieu of the rent which we would normally pay.\n\nAs this is a Church-owned building, therefore, we do not have funds available for such repairs in the amount quoted, and you can so advise Mr. Sampson.\n\nBernard F.

Of Indian Education.\n\nAJD: MMcN\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Klappan Seasonal School\n\nI am enclosing a letter dated July 18th from Superintendent Sampson, Telegraph Creek, wherein he recommends various improvements to the building used as a seasonal school at the Iskut Lakes Indian Camp. The total expenditure involved, including transportation of materials by air, will be approximately $600.00 and although Mr. Sampson suggests that it might be advisable to defer action in the matter of repairing the building until it is seen whether or not the families formerly staying at Iskut Lakes continue to do so after the new school at Telegraph Creek is in operation, I feel that if by an expenditure of $600.00 we can improve the educational facilities in the Telegraph Creek Agency we should do so. Furthermore, it is doubtful if attendance at the Klappan Seasonal school will be effected by the new Telegraph Creek school.\n\nI would recommend that the Department approve an expenditure of $600.00 for improvements to this school building.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nStikine Agency\n\nMINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.,\nJuly 18, 1949.\n\nW.S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nI am forwarding herewith requisitions for building materials for improvements to the Klappan Seasonal Indian School at Iskut Lakes Indian Camp. Father Studer, who taught this school from November to April this past season has asked that these repairs and improvements be undertaken this fall before the school opens.\n\nIt will be noted that the largest item of expense is the transportation by air, $300.00. This is apparently the least expensive, and most simple means of carrying the materials out. The school is about sixty miles to the east of Telegraph Creek, and is reached only by a very rough trail. Pack-horse transport has been considered, but this method is somewhat unreliable because of the uncertainty of securing enough horses at the right time. Hauling by dog-sled during the winter would also be just about as expensive as air transport. It is rather difficult to estimate the exact cost either by pack-horse or dog-sled.\n\nWith the possibility of a new school at Telegraph Creek to provide accommodation for Indian children I feel it might be well to defer action on the teacher's request for improvements until it is seen whether the families formerly staying at Iskut Lakes during the winter continue to do so with the new school operating. There is already talk by a few of these people, of staying in town this winter. It is also worthy of consideration that there is no certainty that they will travel to Iskut Lake every winter. Three winter seasons during the past eight years they have not gone all the way to Iskut Lakes, and the school has therefore not operated.\n\nThe improvements are to consist of: (1) covering old floor with felt and new shiplap flooring (2) caulking cracks between logs (3) painting interior walls & varnishing desks.\n\ncont.\nW.S. Arneil, Esq., July 18/49\n\n(4) Puttying window panes.\n(5) Enlarging area of school room by removing partition, thereby providing additional eight feet of length.\n\nThere is no question of the improvements not being necessary. The floor is very cold and draughty; the windows leak air because they are 'home-made' and were never putted; the school room is too small; it is also too dark.\n\nRequisitions are accompanied by tenders from local sawmill and Vancouver firms.\n\nWhile Father Studer did not specifically ask for an allotment for paying labour it is felt that this will be needed, and an amount of $100.00 should be provided. An advance should not be necessary; wages could be paid in kind at a local store.\n\nR.H.S.

Summer Day school.\n\nI beg to submit herewith School-teacher Moran's Report for the month of August, and also a special report from him covering the season's work.\n\nUnder Authority 158-1-1, June 4th, this school was to have continued until the 15th of September, but the Indian families went away, and so Mr Moran closed his work out there at the end of August. He was paid for three months only, leaving on the grant another half months pay at $100.00 per month (viz $50.00 not used). This amount he wishes to have allowed him when he opens up the Klappan Winter school, which he hopes to do on the 15th of this month (September). This is hardly possible however, as the time now will not allow.\n\nIt will be seen from his seasons report that the Dease Lake Summer School has not come up to expectations, and that they now wish to have a winter school in operation for the winter of 1939-1940. This means that there will be no summer school at this point for next summer.\n\nHowever, the R.C. Mission have completed a very fine school House & Church combined, which can be used during the winter months proposed. Why this school has not been a success has yet to be discovered, and during the next few weeks such data will be obtained.\n\nMr Moran was informed that he would have to obtain all the Indians signatures to a Petition if the proposed winter school is considered, so that The Department can be certain that the Indian Families will send their children to the school, if considered, during the full winter term.\n\nAs the matter is not urgent now, data will be obtained and a further Report of this matter submitted later on.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nDEASE LAKE INDIAN SCHOOL.\n\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\nSept. 2, 1938.\n\nMr. Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHerewith I beg to submit my report on the Dease Lake Indian Summer School for the term ending August 31, 1938.\n\nClose observation has been given the advantages to be gained by the operation of a summer school and I have found that the cooperation to be had in winter schools is much in advance. This is not due to any lacking desire of the Indian to gain an education but more to the fact that these people are nomadic by nature and the summer months offer them every pleasantness to enjoy that nature.\n\nAt the beginning of the term (June 1st.) attendance was extremely good and the children showed much aptitude and attention to their studies progressing very favorably in all grades. Towards the middle of August preparations are begun for winter trap lines with the result that the entire family moves there for the remainder of the season.\n\nIn the fall the families return to the reservation and there remain throughout the entire winter.\n\nAt your request I have gone deeply into this matter with the parents and from them have received the unanimous approval for a winter school.\n\nPersonally, and from experience, I favor this latter system of education as the heat and long days of summer months greatly retard the progress of the children who otherwise and under other circumstances keenly delight in attending classes.\n\nShould the Department favor the opening of a winter school at this point for the winter of 1939 it would be expedient to add that the enrollment would number a possible 17 pupils with an average daily attendance not less than 12 pupils.\n\nThe facilities to be had at Dease Lake are of the best and the school has been constructed to meet all the requirements for space and health of the children.\n\nVery respectfully submitted,\n\nJ. E. Moran, Principal.\nExtract from letter dated July 27th, 1938, from Indian Agent Harper Reed, original on file 160-5:\n\nDease Lake Summer Day School. This school was rather a venture for a small set of Indians living at Dease Lake. It was thought proper to start a school especially as Inspector Pragnell was requested to do so by these Indians, and they gave their promise to attend. Therefore Father Bosse went out there and started a school in an old cabin, much too crowded, but preferred to do that than use a special tent that was supplied. In the meantime the Church House was being erected, and last Fall completed. This Spring it is in use, being a very fine building. However, it seems that some sort of difference in views has come about between the Indian Families, cause not known, but which can no doubt be settled. Here His Lordship seems to think another winter school could be established which would do much better than the present summer school. This office is inclined to agree to this, taking into consideration the trapping affairs of these families, which are situated all around that Dease Lake District. This matter will be taken up with the Indians later this season when that area is inspected. However, the school has done some good work up to now.\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit hereunder a report covering the month of May 1938.\n\nDuring the month the various teachers for the summer day schools arrived, they were given their supplies which have been checked, and sent forward. Owing to a very late spring with ice still in Dease Lake it will not be possible for the McDames teacher to arrive at McDames Creek until about the middle of June. Next year it is hoped he will be able to arrive at an earlier date, and go down to McDames over the lake ice, and so start his teaching on the first of June, at the latest.\n\nIt has been possible to have the Dease Lake Day school open on June 1st.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 10, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer you to previous correspondence with reference to conducting a school during the coming summer at Dease Lake.\n\nHis Lordship Right Reverend E. M. Bunoz, O.M.I., has nominated Mr. John Moran as teacher of the school and the Department is prepared to allow him salary at the rate of $100 a month.\n\nPlease let me know as soon as possible for what period you consider this school should be in operation during the coming summer. If any supplies are necessary you should send full particulars in order that the necessary authority may be given you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\nOttawa,\nMarch 10, 1938.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant nominating Mr. John Moran as the teacher of the Dease Lake Seasonal School. The appointment of Mr. Moran is approved and I am writing to Indian Agent Reed in connection with the necessary arrangements for conducting this school during the coming summer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. E. M. Bunoz, O.M.I.,\nBishop's House,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nPrince Rupert, B.C. March 1st, 1938\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey  \nSupt. Welfare & Training  \nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to recommend Mr. John Moran as the teacher at the Summer school at the head of Dease Lake. Mr. Moran is teaching now at the Winter school of Klappan. He is really competent.\n\nMr. James Anglin who was in charge last Summer of the Indian school at McDames will resume his work there next June, I believe. He is an old soldier and has done a great deal of good in enforcing some discipline in that camp.\n\nIt may be difficult to find a teacher for Liard Post this Summer but Father P. Poulet O.M.I., who resides at the Post might start the school if accepted by the Department.\n\nIt will be impossible to find a teacher for Caribou Hide unless the Dept. give him free transportation by plane (go and return) from Telegraph Creek to that point. Access to that place is very difficult especially in Summer.\n\nYours very truly\n\nE.M. Bunoz O.M.I.\n\nEp.\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 26th January 1938.\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 15th January, 1938, from the Minister of Mines and Resources, stating:\n\nThat there are twenty-five (25) Indian children of school age on the Dease Lake Indian Reserve, in the Stikine agency, province of British Columbia, for whom at present no educational facilities are provided;\n\nThat funds are available in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1937-38 \u2014Vote No.169\u2014 for the establishment of a day school on the Dease Lake reserve.\n\nThe Minister, therefore, recommends that a day school be established on the Dease Lake Indian reserve, Stikine agency, province of British Columbia, in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act, Chapter 98, R.S.C. 1927, to be known as \"The Dease Lake Indian Day School\".\n\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing recommendation and submit the same for approval.\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Minister of Mines and Resources.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nI enclose herewith draft of Report to Council with reference to the establishment of the Dease Lake Indian Day School, Stikine agency, province of British Columbia.

For this purpose an excellent Church-school house building has now been completed, situated on the reserve. Father Bosse' O.M.I. has acted as Teacher and is expected to do so next summer. Attendance was rather good, and will be better next year. Little can be said regarding the progress, as the effort is new. The teachers salary (158-9-1) allowed is $100.00 per month. Supplies needed for 1938 season will be a re-stocking of school books with odds and ends. It is considered that whoever is installed as the reserve teacher of this school, should also act as a Reserve Constable, and look after the general morals of the reserve\u2014reporting all incorrect affairs for Indian office attention.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C., June 17, 1937.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith a report covering the month of May 1937.\n\nEquipment arrived for the new Dease Lake Summer school on that reserve, and Father Bosse went out to start up same.

However, in view of the recommendation contained in your letter of the 18th ultimo, salary will be allowed at the rate of $100 a teaching month.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\nOttawa, March 16, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant, the Department has already received a report from Agent Reed with reference to the conducting of a day school at Dease Lake.\n\nMr. Reed has been authorized to expend an amount not exceeding $220.00 in making the necessary repairs to the building which is to be used as a school. Instructions have also been given to him regarding the engagement of a teacher, for whom a salary of $90.00 a teaching month will be allowed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nLt. Col. G. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nP. O. Box 752,\nKamloops, B. C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOFFICE OF\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nP.O. BOX 752\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\n\nMarch 10th, 1937.\n\nSt-G-2549\n\nDear Sir:\n\nCopy of a letter dated December 31st, 1936, from Indian Agent Reed, of the Stikine Agency, to yourself upon the matter of part time schooling for the Indian children in his Agency, was forwarded to me.\n\nAs, to my mind, the matter of some kind of schooling, if only for a few months in the year, is most important to the Indian children in this Agency, I am writing to find out whether the Department has been able to decide anything in the matter. These children, if they are going to hold their own even in trapping with the white man, their prospects will be seriously handicapped if they cannot at least read and write and figure a bit.\n\nAccording to Mr. Reed, and I know he is correct, the children residing on the Reserve at the head of Dease Lake are of mixed denominations. This might lead to the Anglican and Roman Catholic Missions acting at cross purposes. I should suggest as a way out of the difficulty that this would be an excellent opportunity for some young student from one of the Universities to earn a little money by holding school for three months up there. No doubt, our School Inspector could find such a lad. A tent for himself and a cook stove, and a large enough tent to hold class for about 10 or 12 children, with a movable blackboard and rough benches and tables, would be sufficient equipment, which equipment could be stored at Dease Lake when not in use. Further this is an excellent situation, as it is handy for getting stores, mail, etc., being only about half a mile across the lake. As a matter of fact I see no objection to the school tent being actually erected at Dease Lake itself and the children could go there by boat from the Reserve. It would have this advantage that the young school teacher would not be so lonely, and secondly, Mr. Harper Reed has a shack of his own which a school teacher could use.\n\nIf, therefore, we have some kind of day schools at Dease Lake, Klappan, Thaltan and McDames Creek, with also some teaching going on at Cariboo Hide, the Indians of this Agency will not suffer too great a handicapped when they grow up. I am very much interested in this matter and would like to hear what the Department thinks of it.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Geo. S. Pragnell)\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6410, file 858-1, part 1)\nOttawa, March 12, 1937.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 5th instant which refers to the Dease Lake Reserve, the Department received a report from Indian Agent Reed early in January. He recommended that a school be conducted there during the coming summer. He also reported that the Roman Catholic Mission has a small cabin which could be used for school purposes and he further advised that most of the Indian children of school age are members of the Roman Catholic Church. It was decided to approve the operation of a school at Dease Lake during the coming summer and arrangements have already been made to secure a teacher.\n\nWe intend to allow this teacher $90.00 a month, but present regulations do not permit our paying travelling expenses.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. G. A. Rix, D.D.,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nThe Anglican Synod of the Diocese of Caledonia.\n\n3473 University Street,\nMontreal, Que., March 5, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am, as you will see by the letterhead, in Montreal a long way from my western Diocese and as mails are very uncertain to and from the Telegraph Creek region so that I cannot well communicate with you through your agent there. I am therefore bringing the following matters directly to your attention.\n\n2. I have been informed that is the purpose of the department to build a school at Dease Lake this spring. There are a number of our Anglican natives there and I believe some Roman Catholics and that the department wishes the school to be run along non-denomination lines. Would your department give me the particulars re this enterprise?\n\n(a) Is the school to be built, and when ready for use?\n(b) How long a time in the summer will it be expected to be carried on?\n(c) What salary will be paid to a teacher in this very difficult place?\n(d) Will the government pay travelling expenses of a teacher going in for the short time the school is to be in operation? I would be glad to get this information as early as possible so that if necessary I could set about the task of getting a suitable man.\n\nAsking for consideration of the above, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG. A. Rix,\nBishop of Caledonia.\nOttawa, January 23rd, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, with reference to the conducting of a day school at Dease Lake.\n\nYou may, therefore, expend a sum not exceeding $220 in the necessary repairs to the building to be used as a school also in the purchase of the equipment that is necessary.\n\nThe R. C. Church authorities should be requested to nominate a teacher, and you should let me know the name of the teacher and his qualifications, also the date on which it is intended to open this school. A salary of $90 a month will be allowed for the teacher.\n\nA Staff Questionnaire is enclosed, which you should have the teacher complete and return to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nSir,\n\nDuring the inspection of The Stikine Agency, last summer, by G.S. Pragnell Esq., Inspector of Indian Agencies for British Columbia, the Indian Reserve at Dease Lk was visited. Here resides, during both winter and summer, about five indian families, who have between them, about a dozen children needing, and requesting schooling.\n\nThe Inspector considered that a rough summer-school should be established here, consisting of the usual school supplies, and conducted under tenting. All indians concerned considered this to be excellent arrangement, and were glad to know that a school was being considered.\n\nThe Inspector also thought that the R.C. Klappan Bay school Mission Schoolmaster might be able to conduct the proposed Dease Lake Summer School - during the summer.\n\nThe R.C. Mission of these parts, have already a small Cabin used as a church also, on the Dease Lake Reserve, and most of the Indian children belong to that Mission.\n\nHowever two families have do not really belong to the R.C. Mission - that of Heals with four children who can attend school; and that of Billy Frank with three children who could attend, the latter having already attended the Anglican Mission at Tahltan Reserve. Heals wife is an R.C. and therefore his family can be considered such, but not that of Billy Frank's. It is felt that the Anglican Mission would mention the matter were Frank's children allowed to attend a school conducted by the R.C. Mission.\n\nThat some schooling should be afforded these children seems reasonable, and therefore in the Estimates now submitted appears an item under \"Schools - Repairs etc\" of $150-00 & Schools Equipment etc - a further sum of $70-00 for materials. A salary of $90-00 per month seems to be the lowest rate possible to offer a Schoolmaster.\n\nMay it be requested that instructions be allowed, as to if this Summer School is to be considered, or not, as up in these remote parts, much care and attention has to be given, which takes up much valuable time ere the opening up of such a school, if considered.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept. Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nHead of Dease Lake, necessity for day school here.\n\nThere are about ten to twelve children here of school age, and all children of progressive and hard working parents. Their houses were well kept and tidy and the children well fed and kept. The parents are anxious that their children receive education. This reserve is 80 miles or more from any possibility of education. I should suggest that a teacher do three or four months here annually, in the summer. A large fly-proof tent for the school being supplied and a good, equally fly-proof tent for the teacher, with a cookstove. All tents and supplies could be stored a mile away at the white settlement when not in use. This school could be run by the same teacher as takes the winter school at Klappan.\n\nG. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nStikine.\n\nMr J. S. Moran,\nThe B.C. Mission School\nKLAPPAN.\n\nDear Mr Moran,\n\nRe: - Dease Lake B.C. Mission School.\n\nYour Requisition for school stationery for the above School, dated January 4th, last has been forwarded to the Department. It has been requested that these supplies be sent to this point, early next spring so that they will be here, when ever re needed.\n\nMight it be requested that you take the matter of re-opening this school, up, with His Lordship Bishop Duncan, and find out his wishes on this matter. It is understood at the present time that it will not be in operation for this coming summer, as you requested, and therefore no Grant for a Teachers Salary has been considered.\n\nAs you know some of the families of Dease Lake have moved away. The Beals have gone to Mc Lamos, and are employed by the B.C. Provincial Police, and their children are attending your summer school at that point. Freddy Ludoecker has come to Town, and perhaps will not return. This leaves only the Hunter Frank family and perhaps two children from the Middle Jimmy family, which it would seem, are hardly enough to keep a school open for. However, in any case the families concerned should be made to sign up their intentions to send their youngsters to school, and in this way, it will be known what can be done.\n\nTherefore the whole matter is left entirely in your hand until such a time as further information can be obtained, and then The Department will be advised.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHarper Reed Indian Agent.\nSir,\n\nRe: Dease Lake Reserve - R.C. Mission School.\n\nThe above School was inspected, as reported in Agent's Monthly Report covering September, 1938, and all matters regarding same taken up with the Schoolmaster Mr Moran, and was also talked over with His Lordship Bishop Bunoz, when seen on August 4th, last in Juneau, S.E. Alaska.\n\nA report of the operations of this summer school was submitted under letter dated September 3rd, last - and it was mentioned a further report would be submitted.\n\nOn January 4th of this year, Mr Moran called at this Office, and he was questioned as to what was desired in connection with the Dease Lake School. This winter Mr Moran is of course conducting the Klatsen Winter School, and he does not wish to give this up - next winter, and go out to Dease Lake for winter work at that point. Therefore he cannot exactly state what is proposed for the future, excepting that a summer school at Dease Lake is not possible. However he has submitted a list of school requirements and desires that they be forwarded to care of this Office, so that same will be here, no matter what is decided upon. This Requisition is therefore attached. Also attached is a letter to Mr Moran (copy) in which it is left for him and His Lordship Bishop Bunoz to decide all future events.\n\nDuring last Fall's inspection it was found that some of the Dease Lake families had moved away from that location. Beal family of 10 have gone to Mc Dames Creek, and Freddy Loudec-korn family of 6 have moved into Telegraph Creek, leaving about 5 or 7 youngsters only that would attend that school were it reopened. But of course these Indians may return to their old quarters at Dease Lake, but that is doubtful at present.\n\nIt is respectfully considered that the supplies might be allowed forwarded to here, and that when the R.C. Mission submits their intentions, with a signed list of children who will attend, it would be time enough for the Department to decide as to if this school should be opened up or not. This Mission School effort has been allowed a liberal supply of school house material, and it is thought that no more should be allowed, or granted them, until a school has been started and placed in running order, over some period.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 3, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd ultimo in which you state that it is not advisable to conduct a summer school at Dease Lake Reserve during the summer of 1939.\n\nAs no school will be conducted at this point the Department does not see any necessity for forwarding any supplies.\n\nI am writing to you under separate cover in connection with your recommendation with regard to Liard Post.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nH. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\nAtlin, B.C., March 16, 1939.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR MONTH OF OCTOBER 1938.\n\nAt Dease Lake the question of a summer school was taken up with the Indians concerned, and it was thought by them that if a school was opened up again at this point, it would be better to have a \"winter\" school instead of a summer one. However looking into the matter very closely, it was found that two families had moved out of the district, one to McDames Creek, and the other to Telegraph Creek and taking all matters into consideration it is thought that perhaps it would be better to allow the question of opening up this R.C. Mission School, to rest in abeyance until more members of the Dease Lake Band of Indians, return to this point; or the present number of youngsters grow up to school age. Meanwhile the R.C.Mission have established a very fine Church and School House, and will no doubt give some supervision to the general good being of the Indians now there.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nYour Reverence,\n\nThe Rev Father Carpentier O.M.I., who it is understood in now in charge of all R.C. Mission Affairs in these parts, has called at the Indian Office to know if the Department would consider the opening up, for the winter months, of the Dease Lake Mission School.\n\nThe Rev Father submits a list of about 20 children that might attend. It is thought that about ten of them might be \"steady\" at the school during the winter. On the list are some that do not belong so they deserve and it is allowed to put them. Trapping matters are greatly interfered with, and that as you know is a very vital matter in the winter life of the Indian families, and might lead to endless troubles with the B.C. Game Authorities. For the husband will trap where their families reside, and care should be exercised in obtaining school attendance \"lists\".\n\nHowever the matter has been submitted to the Department, and it is considered here that if ten children are in attendance all winter long then the school should be in operation, and if not it should be closed. Also that the Indian families must supply all heating wood. That of course is an easy matter, for good wood is there but they should do something to help matters along.\n\nMr Moran, through Father Carpentier has suggested for a teacher, his lad Mr Stephen, a half-breed it is thought from some way. As you know the lad is young and in no way fit to take on such work. I am surprised that Mr Moran suggested such a person, it would lead to camp \"rows\". Some other Teacher must be found and may the person's name be submitted to Ottawa direct when decided upon.\n\nThe Salary has been mentioned as at $100-00 per month, as paid at this point last time the school was in operation, and that the school should start as at November first and close at the end of April 1940.\n\nIt is hoped that this will meet with your favour, and that this Office will be advised further in the matter.\n\nHIS LORDSHIP,\n\nBishop Bunoz.

Mission Winter School.\n\nReports have already been submitted on the situation of this Reserve School. It was found that a summer school here was not very useful, as a lot of the families moved out of Dease Lake in the summer time, much movement depending upon \"work\" obtainable in the District. However when winter comes they move back to Dease Lake, and so quite a few children winter at this point.\n\nFather P. Carpentier, O.M.I., who is now in charge of the R.C. Missions in these parts has paid a visit to Dease Lake, and herewith please find a letter in regard to a Winter School at this point for the coming winter.\n\nHe states that the following families have the following children that might attend.\n\nSammy FRANK - Ernest 9 Freddy 7 Mabel 6\nTommy FRANK - Arnot 9 Hazel 7\nArchie NEHASS - Louise 9 Raymond 7\nLame DICK - Alfred 15 May 14 Peter 11\nBeal CARLICK - Ethel 17 Wilson 16 Newton 13 John 6\nBetty 9 Bluebell 5\nJimmy JACK - Verna 9 Viola 7\nFreddy LOUDECKER Fully have two children that intend to reside at Dease Lake next winter.\n\nThe list looks good, but it is certain that they will not all attend, and whilst they do come at first, a steady attendance cannot be expected. At least ten children will attend all the winter long. It is considered that these children might be allowed this schooling. The Salary allowed this Teacher was at $100-00 per month, during the summer of 1938. Should the operation of this school be considered it is thought that it should open November 1st, which allows the obtaining of fat winter meat and fish, as a supply for the winter. It should close about the end of March, as it is impossible to keep Indians in winter camps after that date. Moreover the late Teacher of this school (and also of the Klappan School) has suggested a Lad named Mc Stephen (a half-breed from down south and under his care here) to be the Teacher, but this is not thought at all correct and some other person will have to be appointed by His Lordship Bishop Bunoz. A copy of a letter directed to His Lordship is herewith submitted.\n\nA Requisition List of supplies now needed was submitted under letter dated February 3rd 1939, and these supplies would be required should the school be opened up. Some restrictions should be made in this case, and are as follows. Indians must supply all heating wood for their School. That if the attendance falls below 10 children the school will close down. They must be made to understand that they are being granted help by the Department, and that this schooling is worth helping forward. May this Agency be instructed as to the Department's decision on this matter, please.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept.

Hoey a half salary for Fr. C. Carpentier for his services as teacher at the Dease Lake Winter Day School for the time said school will be in operation. I did not ask full pay on account the special circumstances under which that school was started in the beginning of last November.\n\nFr. Carpentier writes that he has an average attendance of twelve pupils and that they are doing well.\n\nI trust therefore that my demand will appear reasonable to all.\n\nYours very truly\n\nE.M.

Rev. Father Carpentier arrived in from Dease Lake with a \"List\" of Indian children that were supposed to be wintering at that point and that might possibly attend a winter school at the Mission there, if same were allowed by the Department. The Rev. Father had been requested to have all the Indian parents sign such application, but this it seemed could not be obtained. Looking over this list it was seen that some thereon shown were known to be going elsewhere and would not attend school. Other families would have gone destitute were they allowed to remain at the Mission, and send their children to school. The Beal Carlick family must get out into their trapping grounds, to exist. Therefore, the department was reported to, to this effect, and a school over this winter was not put into operation. However, writing at this date, Father Carpentier does not like to reside at Telegraph Creek, so has spent the winter at Dease Lake, and it is understood that he has been giving attention to such Indians as are there. It is hoped that the trapping returns have not suffered by his kindness.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nAtlin, B.C., Feb. 14th, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON STIKINE AGENCY FOR OCTOBER 1939.\n\nThe R.C. Mission School teachers arrangements, for moving to their various points met with a little delay at the beginning of the month. It was not known then as to if the Deas Lake Winter school would be opened or not. Later on it was decided not to open this school, so therefore Mr. Moran intended to take up his duties at the Klappan school, as in years past. Mr. Anglin had tried in vain to obtain a plane to carry him out to the Caribou Hide School site, which had he done so would carry the school supplies also, but this was not possible, owing to lack of planes. Therefore the only way out of this situation, was the use of dog teams and a pack train that was wintering out that way. On the 16th inst. both Mr. Moran and Mr. Anglin left Telegraph for their posts.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter 158-9-1 of the 13th instant with reference to the Dease Lake Indian Day School, and of copies of letters from and to the Right Rev.

I enclose a copy of a letter dated February 1 received from Rt. Rev. E.M. Bunoz, O.M.I., also a copy of our reply to him. You will note that we have decided to allow salary at the rate of $50.00 a month to the teacher for the period November 1, 1939, to April 30, 1940. Payment of this amount will be made when the returns are received from Indian Agent Reed's office. A copy of our letter to Bishop Bunoz is also being forwarded to Mr. Reed.\n\nIn view of the representations of the Bishop it is felt that we should make one more attempt to provide educational facilities for these children but if the average attendance falls below 10 it is not our intention to continue this school another year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 13, 1940.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant with reference to the Dease Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIn view of the contents of your letter it has been decided to allow an amount of $50.00 a month from November 1, 1939, to April 30, 1940, for the winter school which is being taught by Rev. G. Carpentier, O.M.I.\n\nThis allowance is being made on the understanding that the children mentioned in Father Carpentier's letter will attend regularly. Previous information received indicated that there would not be an average attendance of 10 children and the Department has no intention of allowing a teacher's salary when the number of children is reduced to that number.\n\nOur funds are so limited that it will be impossible to consider payment for any other service than the amount allowed for the salary of a teacher.\n\nAm I to understand that white children also attend this school? If so, what amount are the parents paying toward its operation? As you are aware this Department has no obligation to provide school facilities for white children. As a matter of fact we are only permitted to expend the money provided by Parliament for the education of Indian children.\n\nFather Carpentier should forward a return for the months of November and December to Indian Agent Harper\n\nRt. Rev. E. M. Bunoz, O.M.I.,\nBishop's House,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nReed who will transmit it to the Department. I enclose a supply of the required forms and all information requested should be given.

Hoey  \nSupt. of Welfare & Training  \nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe-Dease Lake Indian Day School, Strathcona Agency.\n\nYour records will show you that an Indian Summer Day School was duly established by the Indian Department at Ottawa at Dease Lake. In 1938 the school was conducted by an excellent teacher named J. Moran, who is now teaching at Klappan (Iskut). In the Summer 1939 Mr. Harper Reed, Indian Agent, thought that the school should not be reopened for want of pupils, and that it would be better to have converted into a Winter school. Then Winter came Mr. Reed hesitated again.\n\nHaving received petitions for the reopening of the school and statements affirming that the number of pupils would be sufficient I have sent Rev. C. Carpentier O.M.I. to Dease Lake and teach at the Indian school as if he were a regularly appointed teacher. I hoped that on account of the worthiness of the cause the Indian Department would give him some compensation for his labor if the school was justified by the number of pupils.\n\nNow I herewith enclose two statements, viz: one showing that the average attendance at the school has been 12, the other from the White Residents of Dease lake affirming that Fr. Carpentier has strictly fulfilled the duties of a teacher at said school.\n\nFr. Carpentier is asking some compensation for his work and it is for this that I am writing myself. On account of the circumstances, I would not exact a full salary but only a half salary, viz: $50.00 per month during the time the school will be kept in operation.\n\nI trust that you will find this demand just and reasonable and that it will be granted by the Department.\n\nYours very truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.M.

I decided to come up and to open the school with your consent. I started the school on November 2nd with 15 children, school age and very well disposed, two of them have gone to their trap line but the 12 others come every day and their improvement is very satisfactory.\n\nI keep all the records carefully as if I was an appointed teacher.

In that letter Mr. Reed stated that a list of supplies which he forwarded last February and which had not been purchased would be necessary if the school were to be re-opened.

It is sincerely thought that now, as this school is really on its feet and doing real good work, the length of schooling term might be allowed at 4 months.

Heater-stove.(Reserve)\n\nThe above building was created for a summer school, but later it was turned into a winter habitation for school purposes. It is in want of a heater wherein to burn wood.\n\nFather Carpentier has requested a heater, and he was told that it was nearly impossible to get a grant for same, but that if he would obtain a gas drum, and be willing to fix this up as a heater, perhaps the Department might allow the cast-iron trimmings to complete a heater.\n\nThe cost of that will be around ten dollars, the parts being, the frontage of the drum, cast iron door etc., a cast-iron collar for the stove pipe, and four cast iron legs. It will be supplied from the H.B. Coy's usual stock.\n\nWere this permitted, they would then have a very fine heater that would last for ten years at least. May this Office be kindly advised, as to if it is possible to allow this mission such assistance.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nHarper Reed Indian Agent.\nRe:- Dease Lake Reserve - Winter School-1940-1\n\nWith further reference to your letter dated May 7th and the reply thereto; since that time the department has been visited by His Lordship-Bishop Bunoz O.M.I. and no doubt the above matter was settled.\n\nHowever, should it be considered that the school should open up for the coming winter the attached data is herewith submitted.\n\nIt is seen, in the Rev Father's letter that the Indians have supplies their own wood - as indeed they can do in all cases.\n\nIt is thought that if The Department can consider the opening up again of this school, that the term might be to the extent of three or four months.

Father Carpentier, O.M.I., and during the winter three such schools have been in operation viz. Klappen Day School - Dease Lake School, and that of Caribou Hide. Reports on all the above have been rendered to the Department whenever it was possible to do so. As this month sees the breaking of winter into the summer season, it is mentioned that three summer season schools will be in operation this year, viz., Thalton Reserve Anglican, as mentioned above. The McDames Reserve Day School, in the middle of the Cassiar and the Laird Post Day School, near the Yukon border Line at which several Yukon children attend. The latter two schools being carried on by the R.C.Mission.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJune 8, 1940.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo regarding the Dease Lake Seasonal School provision was made in the estimates for salary for the teacher for $3\\frac{1}{2}$ months at $90.00 a month.\n\nYou may, therefore, communicate with Rt. Rev. E.M. Bunoz, O.M.I., and arrange to have him appoint a teacher for the school. You should advise me later the dates between which the school will be operated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nSir,\n\nRe:- Dease Lake Seasonal School - Winter.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter on the above subject, dated May 7th, regarding the question as to if the above school should be reopened for the coming winter - or not.\n\nThe date of September for reporting on the matter is rather late, as supplies etc would have to sent in over the Dease Lake Road etc, and some of the Indian families notified ahead of time so that they do not all move out to their trap grounds.\n\nThe situation here is slightly different from the other schools, for the Indians here mostly obtain their Revenue from Summer Wages earned from Whites. The Reserve is partly settled to meet those ends, and some families will not move away in any case. Moreover, the Fathers do not like to stay in Telegraph Creek over the winters, and so move out to Dease Lake. It is thought that were the school shut down, a Father would carry on the school anyways - with or without a Salary.\n\nHowever, again should the War continue, the school could be shut down, and some families move out to their trap-ground, as done in the old days.\n\nIt is most thoroughly understood that in any event fuel wood must be supplied by the Indians concerned in all school affairs.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMay 7, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo with reference to the Dease Lake Seasonal School.\n\nI have carefully noted the contents of your letter but owing to present conditions I am not in a position to decide at the present time whether or not funds will be available for the operation of this school next winter.\n\nI am prepared to review this matter again about September 1 provided you write to me at that date and state definitely whether or not you consider a winter school should be operated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nApril 24th, 1940.\n\nSir,\n\nRe. Dease Lake Winter School, R.C. Mission.\n\nI beg to submit hereunder a short report on the above winter school located on the Dease Lake Reserve.\n\nNo doubt that the Department will remember that this school was marked as closed for this present winter, but that Father Carpentier, O.M.I., went out that way to spend the winter (it is thought now that he was induced to do so by the Hunter Frank family - Indians with the help of the local Store Manager at that point) and when there started up the Day-school, Bishop Bunoz then requested some payment for the Teacher, which resulted in the Department's letter to His Lordship, dated February 13th, 1940.\n\nTherein is rightly stated that funds are only available for a Teacher's salary of $50-00 per month\u2014for a period of six months. Also that an attendance of ten children or over must be maintained.\n\nFather Carpentier called at this Office recently, and submitted his Reports, and as of January & February months\u201417 children attended.\n\nThis point presents difficulties, the children are there but these nomadic families have to go out trapping now and again, and then take their children with them. The result being that the attendance is erratic, but it is thought that a school should be provided in spite of that fact. A better attendance is possible later on. The final reports are not yet to hand, but about ten children will be in attendance, no doubt.\n\nHowever, Father Carpentier mentioned that no wood had been provided for the school's use, and that it had cost him privately the sum of $60-00. A promise was given him that the Department would be advised of such a fact, but that the Indians there really should provide their own fuel, as they were camped there most of the year. He quite agreed with that idea, but could not make the Indians do this. No hope of payment for this wood cutting expense was given him, but regrets were expressed.\n\nThe best Indians out there are the Hunter Frank Family who are steadily employed by the H.B.Coy\u2014they earn good wages, and have Radios etc. These Indians should give some help if they wish a school for their children, and the least they could do, would be to supply the cord-wood that is near-by and handy.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6419, file 858-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nFather Carpentier mentioned that a Winter School at this Reserve brings in better returns than a summer school, and with this point of view your Agent fully agrees.\n\nIt is considered that Father Carpentier had better get together with the Indians out there, obtain a signed list of the children that will attend this school - if allowed for the future, and also a signed promise that the Indians provide their own school cord wood for the future. Also that of course the attendance will be of ten children or over all the winter.\n\nThe living conditions at this point are about the same, but perhaps a little more expensive than the living conditions at the Tahltan Reserve, and at this latter point the Teacher is allowed the salary of $90-00 per month. (summer school).\n\nDease Lake is the head of water-ways for the Inside generally, and therefore a lot of White Prospectors etc pass through this small settlement. Each and every one has some advice to give the Indians, and it is thought they believe that the Department simply has to supply them with any thing they require, when such is desired.\n\nShould the Department consider a winter school at this point during the winter of 1940 - 1941, the period of such could well be for 3 months, ending on April 1st, 1941. At this time such families that wish to get out Beaver Trapping, or for the usual spring get-away, could leave the Reserve, and the school attendance would not be affected.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed Indian Agent.\nSir,\n\nUnder separate cover will be found a Report rendered by Dr. G. W. Meyer, M.D., C.M., who has just completed a visit to Dease Lake, and who was requested, whilst there to look over the Dease Lake Winter Day School, that this winter has been conducted by Father Carpentier, O.M.I.\n\nThe Doctor states that up to the end of last year about 16 children were in attendance, but that at the start of the New Year, many went out to their trap grounds leaving about 10 children in attendance. This is exactly as has been reported, and as expected. However such a winter school at this point certainly causes some loss in obtaining fur revenue by the Indians concerned. The Beal Garlick family can be taken as an instance, they remained in until after the Xmas - Mission Show-down, and then as no relief from this Office is allowed (for Beal is a very bad case of a sit-down indian -no work) he moves out to his trap-ground and starts trapping when the fur-fox and marten, are going down hill in quantity. Marten have been fetching very good prices this winter, and Beal's trap ground is a very fine area for such fur.\n\nHowever Father Carpentier is intending to come in shortly, when a further Report on this School will be rendered. Also it is mentioned that Father Bobillier, O.M.I., was staying at Dease Lake this winter, as a help, which is quite all right, but it was understood this Father was to be stationed at Liard Post B.C. where help is indeed needed.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper\nReed Indian Agent.\nTelegraph Creek, March 13, 1940.\n\nMr. Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAt your request also I examined the reserve day school, under charge of Rev. Father Carpentier, O.M.I. There were 10 children attending upon my visitation, and the Roster showed a total of 16 children in attendance, up to January 1st of this year. After this date some of the families moved out to their trap grounds and so took their children with them; leaving 10 children still attending this school. These children looked well and appeared in good health. The following are listed:\n\nMay & Peter Jenska, Freddy, Hazel & Mabel Frank, Fern & Viola Juneau Jack. Mona & Raymond Nehass, Jessy Thibert.\n\nDr. G. W. Meyer.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of a \"copy\" of a letter, from The Department to His Lordship Bishop Bunoz, in regard to the Dease Lake Seasonal School that has been in operation during the past few months.\n\nThe last action taken by this Office was to post up a Notice that this school was unable to be opened for this season, but matters have turned out differently; and the school has done some good after all said and done.\n\nIt is noticed that Father Carpentier is being allowed salary at the rate of $50-00 per month, which is very considerate of the Department. The attendance will drop slightly as the Beal Carlick family have now moved out to their Trap-ground, but at that there should be about 8 to 10 children in attendance.\n\nThis Office knows nothing about \"white\" children attending as Father Carpentier has reported nothing at all, to this point. These Indians are steady H.B. Coy river-men and can well afford to supply their own heating wood for the use of the school. The School Reports will be forwarded, as received.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nDept. Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nMarch 15, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo with reference to the Dease Lake School.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to my letter of February 13, 1940, addressed to Rt. Rev. E. M. Bunoz, O.M.I., and a copy of which was forwarded to your office. As this letter may have gone astray in the mails I enclose another copy for your information.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\nSir,\n\nRe:- Dease Lake R.C. Mission, Winter Day School.\n\nI beg to submit herewith a letter just received from His Lordship Bishop Bunoz, O.M.I. As there is no information on my files regarding the opening up of this Winter School no reply has been sent His Lordship, until advice on the subject has been received.\n\nUnder the above Reference this school was not to be opened during this winter, and Father Carpentier was so advised on October 1st 1939; and Public Notices were posted at the Hudson Bay Store, to this effect on the same date. This Notice read as follows \"Owing to lack of funds the proposed Winter Day School for the Dease Lake Reserve, will not be in operation for the coming winter months.\"\n\nFather Carpentier, sometime last Fall did mention he was going out to Dease Lake to \"live\" as he did not like remaining in Telegraph Creek. Later it was understood he was giving attention \"to the Indians\". He came into Town during the Xmas Time but did not come up to the Office, and he was not met with. This Office has not been advised that a school was in operation, and no School Reports have been received.\n\nThis Office did at first favour a Winter School here, but when it was doubtful as to if some of the children would be there over the winter to attend, it was doubtful as to if a school should be opened up or not. The Frank Family are the main stay here, and they are rather off-hand, and expect to be maintained by the Indian Department. They are in steady pay from the H.B.Coy as river men, own Radios and do not need help. They considered last Fall that the Department should supply wood for school fuel etc., and none of these Indians would do anything to help matters forward. However they have some children out there, who should no doubt receive schooling. Attached is submitted a Census List of the Indians living at Dease Lake. Note is made of Minnie Jack being a T.B. case, and it was thought that her children should not be allowed to attend school, until at least the Doctor has passed on them. A letter received from Dease Lake states that Beal Carlick is now (Jan 9th 1940) moving out to his trap-line with his family. This Indian has produced under $75-00 of fur this winter and with this he cannot keep his family\u2014he should have been out trapping earlier. May this matter receive the Department's consideration, and this Office be advised.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed, Indian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(Winter)\n\nThis school was visited during the month and the children appeared clean and happy. A few were absent suffering from colds. A brief inspection was given and it was noted that the children did not appear to be up to \"grade\". This is no doubt due to the long period (9 months) which they are absent from school in the year. There were no children past grade 3 although some of them are 12 years and older. Only one latrine was in use by both sexes and the teacher was instructed to arrange for the building of another. The teacher is a Roman Catholic Priest and he resides in the upper part of the school building.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nActing Indian Agent.\nSir,\n\nRe: TEACHERS - R.C.

(RG 10, Volume 6419, file 858-1, part 1)\nOttawa,\nApril 28, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant the Dease Lake Seasonal School may be operated during the winter of 1941-42. The Department will allow an amount of $90.00 a month for a period of 3\u00bd months. I regret that the funds at our disposal will not permit our increasing the length of the term. I understand from your letter that Father Carpentier will be in charge of the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nThis school is a log building, a combination of mission missionaries residence and school. At present it is under the direction of C. Carpenter, O.M.I., of French birth, not long resident in Canada. His English is only fair, but he is, in my opinion, the best of the missionaries (of any religion) in the agency. The Indian children are fond of him and apart from the language difficulty, I believe he would be capable of doing excellent work if properly instructed.\n\nI understand from the late Agent, Mr. Reed, that the Department expended about $500.00 in the construction of the school, the missionary at that time contributing some labour. The remarks previously made regarding combining church and school in one building apply equally to this school.\n\nThe school is equipped with homemade desks etc., which will probably do for the time being, but two sheets of blackboard material and chalk rail should be provided. The agent will secure a list of school texts in use and forward same to the Commissioner in quadruplicate. There is only one latrine for both sexes.\n\nNo information is available from the records of the office to show what are the grades and average attendance. It is reported by the Indian agent that at a visit made subsequent to my inspection, there were fourteen pupils present in Grades one to four, half of these being girls.\n\nMr. Simpson was able to return to Dease Lake after the school opened and states that he heard the children read but that they were not very good. They were anxious to demonstrate their singing and started off with \"Little Brown Jug\" and \"There is a Tavern in the Town\".\nMONTHLY REPORT\nStikine Indian Agency\nDecember 1941.\n\nSCHOOLS:\n\nDease Lake Seasonal Day School. During the trip made to Dease Lake this month this school was visited. A separate report is being submitted on the usual form. This school closed December 19th after having operated since about the middle of last September.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nActg. Indian Agent.\nSince writing the foregoing I had an opportunity of visiting Dease Lake School while awaiting plane transportation the school being in session under Father Carpentier O.M.I.\n\nAt that time, October 6th, there were present,\n\nGrade 1a - 5 pupils\n\" 1b - 4 \"\n\" 2 - 2 \"\n\nthese ranged in age from 8 years to 12 years. Several reported absent due to illness, there being 21 on the roll, (11 girls, 10 boys.).\n\nThe children were examined by myself in reading and arithmetic. In reading only one girl, Mona Nehass, aged 12 was found able to read anything more advanced than \"Two Little Indians\". A few of the remainder could struggle through it with assistance from the teacher and the balance could not read it at all.\n\nWriting was fair as compared with the reading.\n\nThe teacher was anxious to show the children's ability in arithmetic on the \"Blackboard\" but it was noticed that this was the simplest addition of two three figure numbers. When I substituted a figure involving a \"carry over\" they were unable to do the work, apart from Mona Nehass.\n\nThe children were anxious to sing and did very well, their repertories including \"There's a Tavern in the Town\". They were unable to sing \"O Canada\" at my suggestion, having no knowledge of the words. The Teacher is anxious to be supplied with a book of well known songs.\n\nAs previously stated, Father Carpentier is by far the best missionary engaged in this work in the Agency, and if the work in this school can be considered relatively high in comparison the rest must be indeed deplorable.\n\nThe children appeared to be well up to average in intelligence and I am satisfied that with proper tuition they would make considerable headway, even in a short term school.\n\nThis visit emphasizes the necessity of a survey and instruction by the Inspector of Indian Schools for this Province.\nStikine Agency  \nTelegraph Creek, B.C.  \nJuly 29, 1942.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reference to the Dease Lake Seasonal School, will you please advise if it is the Department's intention to operate this school this year for the usual term of three and a half months, from about September 1st to December 15th.\n\nRev. C. Carpentier, who was in charge of the school last year, states that although he has as yet had no word from his Bishop, he expects to take charge again.\n\nIt is anticipated that the attendance will continue to average about 15 as in past terms.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.H.S.

Coleman,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDease Lake and Iskut Lake (or Klappan) Day Schools\n\nThe winter day schools of Dease Lake and Iskut Lake, conducted under very hard circumstances, without adequate help from the Department in regard to housing accommodation, wood supply and appropriate furniture, have accomplished a considerable amount of good in those two camps; the devotedness of the local missionary in charge, Father Cl. Carpentier, O.M.I., is above all praise, and according to the testimony of all disinterested persons who have seen him at work, we really think that it would be hard to find a better qualified man for the task. Those two schools must, by all means, be continued.\n\nN.B. -- Referring to the above mentioned schools, I beg to submit to the Department the names of the school teachers for the school year 1942-43:\n\nDease Lake -- Father Cl.

Elder\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo and to state that you are authorized to allow the children of the marginally noted woman to attend the Dease Lake Seasonal School.\n\nI have today discussed the subject matter of your report of October 26, 1941, with an official of the Trusts Division. It is my understanding that this official will write to you in respect to the racial status of Mrs. W. H. Elder and her children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. R.H.S. Sampson,\nActing Indian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to refer the Department to my report dated October 28, 1941, regarding MRS. W.H. ELDER, TRESPASS, DEASE LAKE I.R. #8, on which subject I have not yet received any instructions.\n\nMrs. Elder approached me recently at Dease Lake and asked that her two school age children, Jessie age 9 and John age 7, be permitted to attend Dease Lake Seasonal School when it opens about September 1st. As pointed out in the aforementioned report, these children are the illegitimates of Mrs. Elder and the late Charlie Tibbet, an Indian of Tahltan Band. They have attended school at Dease Lake for the past two years and have done very well in their work. Mrs. Elder moved away from Dease Lake Indian Reserve No. 8 last June and has been warned that she must not again reside there without permission. She plans on living in a tent near the Reserve so that the children can attend school.\n\nAs there is no public school available for these children to attend I would respectfully recommend they be permitted to attend the Dease Lake School provided that they in no way interfere with the education of the other Indian children.\n\nIt may be mentioned that although Mrs. Elder holds the status of a white person she is a full-blooded Indian and Charlie Tibbet was also a full-blooded Indian, consequently the children, although they may hold white status, are actually full-blood.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H.S.

Sampson regarding the marginally noted school.\n\nMr. Inspector Coleman visited this school during his inspection of the Stikine Agency in 1941 and, refers briefly to same on page 31 of his report.\n\nAlthough I am far from satisfied with the results being obtained from the operation of our seasonal schools in the Stikine Agency, nevertheless I think it would be as well to continue this school for the present term, at least.\n\nIt is my intention to discuss the school situation in the Stikine Agency with the Bishops' concerned, as soon as I can find sufficient time to make a trip to Prince Rupert.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 8, 1942.\n\nMy dear Bishop Coudert:\n\nYour letter of September 23, addressed to Mr. Philip Phelan, has been passed on to me for consideration and comment.\n\nIt is my intention to ask Mr. Phelan to communicate with you direct in respect to the schools which in the judgment of the Department should be kept open and in operation during the present academic year. I am sending forward your communication also to the Acting Superintendent of Medical Services.\n\nI am, of course, particularly interested in the operation of the schools and in the educational facilities provided for the Indians of the Stikine Agency and the Yukon Territory. The Stikine Agency was inspected by Inspector Coleman during the months of September and October of last year. His report was very carefully reviewed by the officials of this Branch and was later sent forward to the office of the Minister, for the information of the Minister himself and his officials. Later I sent a letter to the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, Major D. M. MacKay, in which I expressed certain views in regard to an educational program that might be provided for the Stikine Agency, just as soon as times become normal. In this letter I expressed the hope that the Indian Commissioner would find it convenient to discuss this matter with the Bishops concerned. A copy of this letter is enclosed, for your information. I trust that he will have an opportunity to interview the Bishops before any definite action is taken.\n\nI am sending you forward also a statement showing the number of Indian residential schools in Canada, the number operated under the auspices of the Catholic Church and the number operated under the auspices of the non-Catholic denominations. You will readily see that while no Catholic residential school has been established in the Yukon, the number of Catholic schools in operation in the Dominion indicates that there has been no discrimination on the part of the Government at any time in the establishment of residential schools - certainly no discrimination against the Catholic Church.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRight Reverend J. L. COUDERT, O.M.I.,\nCoadjutor of the Yukon & Prince Rupert,\nBishop's Residence,\nWhitehorse, Yukon Territory.\nOttawa,\nMay 31, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, enclosing letter from Indian Agent Sampson regarding the ownership of various Indian seasonal schools in the Stikine Agency. The Department concurs in your recommendation that the title to these buildings remain with the churches which erected them.\n\nP.H.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nExtract from Indian Agent Sampson's letter dated April 28, 1944.\n\nThe alternative to this suggestion would be to endeavour to purchase the Missions' share in the schools but I would definitely not recommend this course as I believe that it would be far less expensive, even over a period of years, to pay an annual rental of $75.00 in the case of the Dease Lake and Klappan schools and possibly Lower Post or McDamn Creek if either operates, than to purchase these crude log buildings and try to improve them. From past experience it seems that the operation of these bush schools is quite provisional, depending as it does upon whether or not the Indians camp at the location of the school during the usual term. At the present time it seems that any extensive outlay for establishing day school buildings would be unwise, especially in the more remote locations because it is evident that the Indians in this area as a whole are still not inclined to settle permanently in one location. Their houses in and near Telegraph Creek for the most part are used only as stopping over places between their trapping and fishing camps. This has been more evident during the past fall and winter when these people have had to earn their living from the country, as they did prior to the freighting boom from 1941 to 1943 when supplies were going in by this route to Watson Lake Airport. It seems that the life-long habits of the Indians will not easily be changed, even to ensure the education of their children and the more or less temporary bush schools will probably have to serve, at least for the present.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI feel the Department should be aware of the excellent service given by Reverend Father Carpentier, O.M.I., the senior Roman Catholic missionary for the Cassiar district, during the many epidemics of sickness which have been prevalent amongst the Indians of this Agency since September, 1942.\n\nIn September, 1942, Father Carpentier spent many hours helping and nursing Indians on the Stikine Nomad Reserve at Telegraph Creek who were sick with a particularly severe type of influenza. His efforts in supervising the care of these people, without benefit of a doctor or nurse, were splendid.\n\nAt the expiration of the severe measles epidemic in January, 1943, amongst the Indians of the Iskut Lakes Camp, the Father again gave unselfish service in attending the wants of the many cases of lingering illness following the measles. He did this single handed as no medical or other help was available.\n\nIn May and June, 1943, another severe influenza epidemic struck the Telegraph Creek district and Father Carpentier did much to comfort and alleviate the suffering of sick Indians, visiting many infected homes and finally contracting the disease himself.\n\nA dysentery epidemic broke out on the Stikine Nomad Reserve in August, 1943 and Father Carpentier was on hand to supervise and help stricken families, even spending whole nights watching with sick children. And at Dease Lake in November and December of the same year the Father, with only brief instructions, from Telegraph Creek, 75 miles distant by trail, nursed 12 children through this disease again and only one died and that one before the proper instructions for treatment had reached him.\n\nFather Carpentier's work amongst the Indians has always been unselfish and devoted and his co-operation with this office very gratifying. As the Department is no doubt aware, this\n\np.t.o.\nREPORT ON STIKINE INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER, 1943.\n\nSchools:\n\nDease Lake Seasonal School. This school was visited December 6th and the attendance had been exceptionally good. Some progress was noted and the children seemed to be enjoying school.\n\nR.H.S.

Sampson, Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to the Dease Lake Seasonal School. In view of your recommendation this school will be operated from as early a date as possible in September, 1943, until January 31, 1944. It is noted that Rev. C. Carpentier, O.M.I., will again be in charge of the school. Salary will be allowed him at the rate of $90.00 a teaching month, plus bonus.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRE: Dease Lake Seasonal Indian School.\n\nI beg to advise that it is planned to open this school early in September and Rev. C. Carpentier, O.M.I. will be in charge again this season.\n\nMay it be respectfully suggested that the Department consider extending the length of the school term for this school which at present is only 3\u00bd months. This short term does not give the children a fair chance to make much advancement as they forget a large amount of what they learned before the next short term arrives. It is suggested that the school open as early as possible in September and continue until January 31st. Usually the Indian families remain on Dease Lake I.R. #8 all winter.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nIndian Agent.\nAGENT'S REPORT ON STIKINE AGENCY FOR MONTH OCTOBER 1942.\n\nBEASE LAKE SEASONAL\n\nVisited October 26th and attendance not good owing to sickness. At the beginning of the term it was suggested to the teacher that a salvage drive be organized amongst the school children and by the end of October they had collected 185 lbs. of rubber. This will be sent to the Red Cross together with more material expected to be collected by children in the other schools.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson.\nActg.

Indian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of August 13th last, file 158-9-1, regarding the operation of the seasonal day school at Dease Lake in the Telegraph Creek Agency, I enclose herewith Mr. Acting Indian Agent Sampson's letter of the 26th ultimo advising that the School in question was opened on September 15th by Reverend C.

C. Carpentier, O.M.I. is in charge. The attendance on September 22 was only six children but two families were keeping their children at home on account of an epidemic of colds. These people have been instructed to send their children to school as soon as they are over their illness and I have asked Father Carpentier to advise me immediately if the children do not return to school in a reasonable time. There are six children in these two families. Besides the twelve children already mentioned, there are three others who will be attending shortly, making a total attendance of fifteen.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,  \nActg. Indian Agent.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,  \nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,  \nP.O. Box 70,  \nVancouver, B.C.\nCopy sent to Mr. Sampson\n\nOttawa,\nOctober 14, 1942.\n\nDear Bishop Coudert:\n\nWith reference to that section of your letter of the 23rd ultimo which refers to the Dease Lake Seasonal School, I may say that Indian Commissioner MacKay was written on August 13 and advised that the Department would allow an amount of $90.00 a month, for a period of 3\u00bd months, to cover the operation of this school during the winter of 1942-43. The Acting Indian Agent understands that Rev. C. Carpentier will be in charge of this school. A copy of this letter is being sent to him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRt. Rev. J.L. Coudert, O.M.I.,\nCoadjutor of Yukon & Prince Rupert,\nP.O. Box 1614,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa\n\nAttention: Mr. P. Phelan,\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nSeasonal day-schools are now being conducted in northern British Columbia and the Yukon at Dease Lake, Iskut Lake or Klappan, Cariboo Hide, McDame and Lower Post, and Teslin Lake.\n\nAt present, salary cheques are made out and mailed to each individual teacher. Due to distances and infrequent mail deliveries, His Excellency Bishop Coudert suggests that the cheques be made out to the order of his episcopal corporation as it is now being done for the McKenzie R.C. missions. This would simplify the Vicariate bookkeeping, and enable the treasurer to estimate the cost of each school as well as the amount which is allowed for its maintenance.\n\nSince these seasonal Day-schools have been established, income tax has been deducted from each pay cheque made out to the missionaries. There are two reasons why this practice should cease: 1. because the teachers in all these schools are members of the Oblate Order and as such are obligated to remit to their Order all their earnings less what is essential for their upkeep; 2. in no case is the total income of each teacher within the range of taxable income. The missionaries concerned are Rev. Fathers C. Carpentier, J. Plaine, M. Bobillier, B. Arsenault, and P. Poulet. Apparently the cheques received by the above were issued by the agent of the Stikine Agency. Would it then be possible for you to trace the amount paid to each and to have the necessary income tax refund paid back to each of them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6419, file 858-1, part 1)\nOttawa, July 3, 1944.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to Seasonal Day Schools in northern British Columbia and Yukon.\n\nWe understand that Klappan and Caribou Hide are operating during the winter months only.\n\nOur files show that it was impossible to secure a teacher for the McDame School.\n\nWe have no record of any teachers operating schools this summer at Dease Lake, Lower Post and Iskut Lake. With reference to the latter we have no school of that name. Possibly there is another name for this particular point. We have received the name of the teacher at Teslin Lake, Reverend A. Dean, O.M.I.\n\nPresent regulations regarding salary cheques for teachers of Indian Day Schools, are that cheques are to be issued in favour of the teacher. We could, however, forward these cheques to some special address. If you will let me know to whom this should be sent arrangements will be made for the mailing of such cheques.\n\nWith regard to the third paragraph of your letter, I regret that no refund of any amount can be made by this Branch of any amount deducted for Income Tax purposes. Anyone considering himself entitled to a refund of Income Tax must file a return with the Income Tax Officials.\n\nRecently a new form has been provided which covers the case of those only working for a short time. I inclose a supply of these forms and any teacher in a Seasonal School should complete this form and forward it to this office immediately upon beginning duties at a Seasonal School.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6419, file 858-1, part 1)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to advise that the Dease Lake Seasonal School which usually operates from September until January will not open this year owing to lack of pupils. There are now only three Indian children of school age living at Dease Lake, the remainder having moved to Lower Post.\n\nThis office has been informed by the local Roman Catholic Mission that Rev. Father Joseph Forget, O.M.I., will be in charge of the Klappan Seasonal School this winter. It is anticipated that the school will start operating after Christmas and will continue for about five months.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 6, 1945.\n\nRe: Dease Lake School\n\nIn letter of April 6, 1945, on File 158-7-1 the Department approved the appointment of Rev. Cl.

Sampson, Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nI note from your letter of the 12th instant, that Reverend G. Carpentier, O.M.I., opened the Dease Lake School about October 1st, 1944 and closed it at the end of January, 1945.\n\nWe had not received any previous official notice of this matter nor had we received any other recommendations.\n\nI am inclosing Staff Questionnaires, T.D.1 Forms and Cost of Living Bonus Form all of which should be completed and returned at the earliest possible date.

Box 95, Whitehorse, Yukon.\nEXTRACT from letter received from Bishop Coudert dated 19th January, 1946.\n\nORIGINAL ON FILE: 166-17-1\n\nRe: Dease Lake - Father G. Carpentier has taught in Dease Lake up to February 16th of last year, and therefore, occupied our buildings for School purposes and used them up to that date. However, as the school was not approved for a period extending beyond January 31st, Father Carpentier thought it useless to send a report for the two extra weeks he taught.\n\nSimilarly last fall Father Cl. Carpentier went to Dease Lake for the purpose of conducting the School; he stayed there from the beginning of October to the middle of November, some four children attended the school the other Indians having gone down to the Alaska Highway last summer and having failed to come back for the winter. I instructed Father Carpentier to send in a report of the time he had taught those four children since he had gone purposely to Dease Lake to conduct school but he has been reluctant to do so under the circumstances and I doubt whether he will turn in any report for such a short period of teaching and for so few pupils.\n\nYet our buildings were used just the same during the stated periods for school purposes and I think that it would be only fair that we receive at least the money covering the rent and other extra services which were practically the same for four children as they would have been for twenty.\n\nTherefore I still maintain my previous claim for three months rent at Dease Lake and other additional services (fuel and janitor's work) for the year 1945.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\nFile 158-9-1\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\nPay to: Right Rev.

The teacher left school in winter due to school at Klappan before this return was checked & consequently a correction could not be made, and cannot now be made until the teacher comes in from Klappan School in the spring.\n\nFair progress seems to have been made by the children but owing to the short school term results are bound to be below average.

Sampson,\nIndian Agent,\nStikine Agency,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThat the Indian Department would supply Dease Lake School with gas for \"lamp\", considering that children have to use artificial light from 9 a.m. until 10:30 a.m. most of the time, is still expected. One \"4 gal\" tin would be much appreciated.\n\nWater Pail, Broom, and 9 ft blackboard cloth is also needed.\n\nMay we hope that the supplies presently ordered would be on hand for next Fall? New books being expected for change.\n\nLast year supplies still on their way will be needed anytime.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nRev. C. Carpentier, O.M.I.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.,\nFebruary 19, 1943.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI beg to submit herewith requisitions for school supplies for the Dease Lake Seasonal School.\n\nThe materials requisition January 5, 1942 have not yet arrived and the teacher is very anxious to have these things, especially the song books and water colour sets.\n\nI am enclosing a letter in which the teacher asks for gasoline, water pail and a broom. I would respectfully recommend these items be supplied.\n\nenc.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nActing Indian Agent.\nStikine Agency,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.,\nDecember 20, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nEnclosed herewith is S-D slip No. 99377 dated March 13, 1942, for school supplies to be shipped to this office for the Dease Lake Seasonal School. This slip was being held pending receipt of the supplies but it does not appear that these supplies have been received to date. A check was made with the school teacher of the Dease Lake School but he does not remember having received them. This seems to be borne out by the fact that he is still without the charts that go with \"Two Little Indians\".\n\nIn order that the teacher might have supplies to start the 1942-43 term rulers, pencils, crayons and drawing books were supplied from a small extra stock on hand at this office in September, 1942.\n\nR.H.S.

The teacher has previously asked for such song books but they have not been supplied. As the children derive much pleasure and benefit from singing I would respectfully recommend that these books be supplied.\n\nGeography books were also previously requisitioned but the type received (Canadian Geography for Juniors) is too advanced for the pupils of this school and a more elementary book is needed.\n\nThe teacher has also asked for 6 gallons of lamp gasoline; during three months of the school term a lamp is needed in the school-room for one to two hours a day.\n\nR.H.S.

Of this amount $72.16 was spent and an order for lumber amounting to approximately the full amount of the balance was placed by Mr. Harper Reed with Messrs. Robertson & Hackett, of Vancouver. Unfortunately, there was such a delay due to loss in the mails of certain letters, that before the order was finally received by the above mentioned firm, it was too late to complete the transaction before March 31st. I have asked Mr. Reed to re-apply for authority to cover the materials required so that purchase can be made and the order prepared for shipment as soon as navigation opens on the Stikine River. If the Department does not receive an application from Mr. Reed at an early date, it will likely be due to difficulty in getting mail out, in which case if the necessary authority is passed to this office, arrangements will be made for purchase of the lumber and other materials from here.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

In the case of any expenditure above this sum it is necessary for full details to be forwarded to this office. We then submit the matter to the Purchasing Branch and the Purchasing Agent issues the necessary purchase order. I feel certain that you are quite willing to co-operate with us in complying with the purchasing regulations and would, therefore, appreciate if you would submit detailed information regarding the lumber and other building materials that are required to complete the Dease Lake School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

(RO 10, Volume 6419, file 858-11, part 1)\nStikine Agency,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.,\nFebruary 28, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKey, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver,\n\nI beg to submit herewith a requisition for manual training tools and lumber for the Dease Lake Seasonal school which operates from September 1st to January 31st each year.\n\nThe attendance at this school has been good and the children are bright and eager to learn. In order to initiate the manual training work the tools supplied to the Tahltan Seasonal School were loaned to the Dease Lake School and a good start was made by the teacher although he was handicapped by lack of material. The teacher is very anxious to have a manual training class and has also organized a sewing and knitting instruction class for the girls. The boys show an inclination toward wood-work and manual training instruction would be valuable to them in later life when making boats, and doing general carpentry work.\n\nIt would be appreciated if the authorization for these tools could be expedited as much as possible because when Rev. Father Carpentier, the teacher of Dease Lake School, returned to town at the close of the school term January 31st he overlooked bringing the tools back with him and it will not be possible to get them before early June. This means that the Tahltan School will be without its tools until that time unless the requisition for Dease Lake is filled and shipped by the first boat in May.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nenc.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Sampson's letter of February 28th and requisition for manual training tools and supplies for the Dease Lake Seasonal School.\n\nThe cost of the tools and supplies, f.o.b. Vancouver, will be $32.09, which together with the lumber to be purchased at Dease Lake will make a total expenditure of $59.59 plus freight on tools and supplies to Dease Lake.\n\nI would recommend that authority be granted for the necessary expenditure.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\n-HN\nOttawa, May 1, 1944.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O.

Besides payment of teacher's salary, we would allow rental for use of the building, at the rate of $10 per month, during the period the school is in operation.\n\nShould this school prove a success, the question of assisting in the erection of a building, by supplying flooring material, windows, doors, etc., could then receive consideration.\n\nIt is assumed that the Indians of this Band are Roman Catholic. If the church authorities could nominate, in due time, a qualified teacher, we would be prepared to allow salary at the same rate as has been paid at the two above named summer schools. You might advise\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof,\nB. C.\nadvise when you would recommend that the school should open, and, in due time, you should forward a list of the classroom equipment that would be necessary. Please state, also, the cost, including freight, of the lumber that would be necessary to make desks.\n\nWhen the Department hears from you, later, giving the information regarding teaching services, the cost involved in fitting up the building you propose to rent for classroom purposes and as complete a list as possible of the classroom equipment required, favourable consideration will be given to establishing a school for a period of four months during the coming summer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

You will please note my reply of March the 10th instant wherein I stated that I thought the boy was too young and inexperienced to take this position, especially at Takla. Then by last mail I got a letter from His Worship, Bishop Munoz recommending this same boy for the position.\n\nI am submitting this correspondence in the hope that you may be able to advise me in this matter as I still feel that it would be most unwise for us to put a boy of this age to teach school at Takla Lake. Please understand that this point is one of the hardest to keep the Indians under control in the Agency and I am of the opinion that a more experienced teacher is necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H.

Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI recently returned from North Takia Lake where I had an opportunity of visiting the summer school and checking up on how it was received by the Indians generally and the parents and children in particular.\n\nI am pleased to be able to report that the School, so far, is getting along splendidly. There has been 100% attendance every day since it opened and we are going to have 40 children enrolled by the end of this week, when I was there last week there were 36. The teacher informed me that with one or two exceptions none of the children had ever attended school before so you can imagine what a boon this summer school is to these Indians who are really too far away from Lejac to send their children there. After my return from Takia I had to order some more lumber to make another desk (which seats 8) and for that reason I may run a few dollars over the amount of $50-00 allowed in your letter of April the 6th. last, File No. 163-26-1. However, I will not need to use the $15-00 which I asked for stove pipes as this will not be necessary.\n\nI expect to pay another visit to Takia Landing about the middle of July and I will give you further particulars of the progress being made after my inspection at that time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 13, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the summer school at Takla Landing.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter, the Department approves your action in agreeing to pay $20.00 a month rent for the building.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B. C.\nVanderhoof, B.C., May 5th, 1937.\n\nSir:\n\nI would respectfully direct your attention to official letter No. 163-26-1 of November the 17th, 1937 regarding establishing a summer school at Takla Landing for the use of the North Tacla Lake Band.\n\nIn that letter I was authorised to spend $10.00 per month for the rent of the building, this amount was what I thought I would get the building for, as mentioned in my letter of November the 9th last. However, it has only been possible for me to get in touch with the owner of the building a few days ago and he definitely states that he will not let us have the building for less than $20.00 per month, for the 3 months. His reason for asking this amount is reasonable and owing to the activity at the present time at Takla Landing the value of houses have gone up considerably even in six months.\n\nTaking into consideration all the facts and the lateness of the season and no other building available, there was nothing else for me to do but agree to pay the $20.00 per month. Trusting that my action in this matter is approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 6th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letters of the 17th and 25th ultimo, with reference to a teacher for the Takla Landing Seasonal School.\n\nIn view of your recommendation, the Department approves the appointment of Mr. P. J. Downey as teacher. He will be allowed salary at the rate of $90.00 a teaching month.\n\nYou may expend an amount of, approximately, $35.00, for various small articles required for the school. You may, also, expend an amount not exceeding $50.00 for material for desks and a stove and stove pipes may be purchased at an approximate cost of $15.00.\n\nPlease advise Rt. Rev. E. M. Bunce, O.M.I., that, in view of the many difficulties that may occur in opening this new school, the Department considers it advisable to send to that point a teacher who has had previous experience. For this reason, we have approved the appointment of Mr. P. J. Downey. Mr. E. Sargent, about whom Bishop Bunce wrote you, is a very young man and inexperienced and the Department did not believe it advisable to consider his application.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B. C.\nSir:\n\nPlease refer to official letter No. 163-26-1 dated November 17th, 1936 with reference to establishing a summer school for four months at Takla Lake, B.C.\n\nI have arranged that Mr. R.J. Downey, who was teaching last year at Fort Grahame, do the teaching this year at Takla. He is a very good teacher and his previous experience will be valuable in opening a new school. A new teacher will be sent to Fort Grahame in his place but I am not quite sure yet who it will be but as soon as I know definitely you will be advised.\n\nWe can get the building at Takla for $10.00 per month and it should be opened on or about May 15th., next.\n\nIf the Department would please arrange to send me a supply of necessary classroom equipment, for 36 to 40 children, the majority of whom are beginners or in the lower grades, with only about six in grade four or five, I would be greatly obliged. A list very much like that sent to Mr. Shiel at Fort Grahame Schools would do, as well as the additional list sent in April last, (please refer to Mr. Shiel's letter of April 10th, 1936, File No. 163-12-4). Coloured chalk as well as white should be sent, also blackboard brushes, scissors for cutting out and a School Register.\n\nAn expenditure of approximately $35.00 will be necessary for janitor's supplies, including hand bands, soap and paper towels; this will include freight.\n\nIt will take approximately fifty dollars to cover the cost of material for the desks plus the freight from Vanderhoof to Takla, as well as fifteen dollars for a cheap stove and stove pipes. One hundred dollars altogether should cover everything.\n\nThe supplies can be shipped next month and I would like to have authority to purchase the lumber & other supplies as we may have to send out for some of them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nApril 21, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant the Department approves the appointment of Mr. Dan O'Neill as teacher of the Takla Landing seasonal school for the period this school is open during the coming summer.\n\nHe will be allowed salary at the rate of $90.00 a teaching month. It is noted from your letter that he will reach the school about May 20 and the school should remain open for approximately three months.\n\nI enclose staff questionnaire which you should have Mr. O'Neill complete and return to the Department as soon as he begins duties. This form should show the date on which Mr. O'Neill's duties commence.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR. Howe, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B. C.\nVanderhoof, B.C., July 31st, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith a general report of affairs in this agency during the month of July 1938.\n\nThe school at Tackla was visited and a meeting held with the parents. I told them that unless the parents took more interest in the school and saw to it that their boys and girls attended regularly, and on time every school morning, I would recommend that the school be closed this year and not opened again next. I understand that my talk and threats had some effect for the attendance has been doubled since I was there and things are very much improved. I am not so sure that the new teacher wasn't to blame, as he is much too lax in his discipline and does not seem to have any control over the children when they are out playing during recess. In watching the teacher attend to ordinary routine in the school he is, I think, quite capable, but he certainly can stand to be a lot stricter with the pupils during recess and while they are on the school grounds. I told the teacher this when I was there and think that he may improve, but he is a timid young chap anyway and I am not so sure that he will ever be much of a success in an outlying seasonal school like Tackla anyway. Outside of that I think real progress is being made in the school and it is kept spotlessly clean and neat.\n\nR. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nVanderhoof, B.C., June 3rd, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit below a general report covering the affairs of this agency for May 1938.\n\nThe school teachers for the summer schools at Fort McLeod, Fort Grahame and Tackla Landing were sent in to their respective schools during the month. So far I have not visited any of these but hope to do so during this month.\n\nR. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nApril 19, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant the Department will allow an amount of $20.00 a month for rent of the building to be used for the Takla Landing Seasonal School this summer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI would respectfully direct your attention to official letter no. 162-26-1 and dated May the 13th, 1937 in connection with the rental for a building suitable for the Indian Summer School at Tama Landing.\n\nLast year the sum of $20-00 monthly was paid the Indian for the use of his house, for three months, and I have just received a communication from the same Indian today in which he advises that the rental this year will be the same as last. I would respectfully request that I be authorised to engage this building for the three months that the school is in progress at a monthly rental of $20-00 a month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.H.

Please give him every possible assistance.\n\nI enclose staff questionnaire which you should have Mr. Parent complete and return to the Department as soon as he begins duties. This form should show the exact date on which Mr. Parent takes charge of the Takla Landing School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR. H.

So far as I am personally concerned no complaint was ever made regarding the conduct of Mr. Downey although Bishop Coudert told me verbally a few days ago that he had complaints about him drinking last year at Takla.\n\nR.

The attendance is good, pupils clean and some improvement is shown in reading, writing and arithmetic. Since my previous visit a month ago, Lejac Residential school pupils are at present on holidays and the staff are busy with the usual clean up, redecorating, etc. Work commenced on the sewerage and septic tank on the 29th. A full Indian work crew was obtained for Mr. W.G. Warren, Engineer in charge.\n\nRobt. Howe,\nIndian Agent.\nAGENT'S REPORT ON STUART LAKE AGENCY FOR MONTH OF JUNE 1940.\n\nOn the return flight from Bear Lake we landed at Takla Landing and inspected the seasonal school. There were 14 pupils in attendance. I found the school very clean and sanitary and the pupils exceptionally clean about their person; discipline excellent. I would judge Miss Finan to be a capable teacher and particularly adapted to teach the Indians.\n\nRobt. Howe,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 9, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to Miss Catherine Finan, teacher of the Takla Landing Seasonal School. I understand from your letter that this school opened about June first. As you are aware, the teacher is allowed $90.00 a month for a period of three months. In view of the information contained in your letter, it has been decided to allow her slightly more than $90.00 for the month of June.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Robert Howe,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to enclose herewith the first monthly day school return submitted by Miss Catherine E. Finan, teacher for the Takla Laming Seasonal School for the period ending June 30th., 1940. Kindly forward Miss Finan's salary cheque care of this office.\n\nI would advise that Miss Finan was extremely unfortunate making boat connections between Fort St. James and Takla Landing. The boat was delayed several days due to adverse weather conditions and on top of this engine trouble developed enroute to Takla making it necessary to return to Fort St. James for repairs causing further delay. These delays cost Miss Finan $30-00 for lodgings over and above ordinary transportation charges from Calgary to Takla Landing which amount to approximately $50-00 each way. I would strongly urge if at all possible that Miss Finan be recompensed to the extent of $30-00, being additional expense for board and lodgings caused by incidents mentioned above.\n\nI paid a visit to Takla School on return from an emergency flight to Bear Lake on the 11th. I found conditions excellent, the school spotlessly clean and the pupils particularly so about their person. I would judge Miss Finan to be a capable and efficient teacher and especially well suited to Indian work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRobert Howe,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRH/L.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEnclosure.\nVanderhoof, B.C., June 6, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON STUART LAKE AGENCY FOR MONTH OF MAY.\n\nMiss Finan, teacher appointed for the Takla Landing Seasonal School left Vanderhoof for Takla on the 24th of May and Mr. N.

By the end of the coming week, I will have completed two and one-half (2\u00bd) of the three months, having made use of the Saturdays.\n\nShould my Cheque come through your Office, I would appreciate it if you would hold it there for me, and I will pick it up on my way through.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nNunzio J.

He was put to considerable expense for transportation from Edmonton to Takla Landing and return and I must admit he was engaged for a three month period.\n\nIn fairness to Mr. Defoe I would recommend that he be compensated for the full term.\n\nA statement showing salary, cost of living bonus and deductions would be appreciated, for his information.\n\nR. Howe,\nIndian Agent.\n9948 - 110th St., Edmonton, Alta.,\nSept. 7, 1943.\n\nR. Howe,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAccording to letters of March 22nd, and April 20th last, from your Department, I was informed that the salary for teaching at Tahla was $90.65 a teaching month, plus bonus, for a period of three months. You stated: \"The schools are operated for three months.\" It was on such information and understanding that I assumed the position and endeavored, at great odds, to keep the school open. Then when my efforts to keep the school going failed, you ordered it closed.\n\nA short while ago I received from your Office, cheques covering the first two months. Today I received, supposedly as a final settlement, a cheque for the sum of $37.36. Needless to say, I refuse to accept this as final payment. First of all, I was employed by the month, for three months. The expense\nentailed in taking such a position would have ruled out acceptance of such a position for any shorter length of time. Secondly, the Dept. ordered the school closed when, through incompetency, they could not control the children's attendance at school. Thirdly, I had been informed by other teachers, and you confirmed it, that three teaching months was considered 60 days. I operated the school for 52 days. Last year the school wasn't even operated for 60 days either, yet the teacher was fully compensated. Fourthly, the amount of money sent me is equivalent to slightly more than a third of a month's salary. Yet, I had put in 10 days when the school was ordered closed. And ten days is a good deal more than a third of a month! (a teaching month).\n\nI trust that I shall receive very shortly a cheque for $67.94 covering the balance of my salary.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nNancy J. Befoe.\nEdmonton, March 19, 1945.\n\nMr. R.

It has not been successful. Solution (2) would involve mixing up the Residential School and Day School pupils, which is not desirable inasmuch as it would most certainly cause discontent amongst the former owing to the wide freedom enjoyed by day school pupils in comparison with the restrictive character of residential school life. Dr. Morrison, Mr. Ashbridge and the writer are agreed that solution (3) appears the best under the circumstances.\n\nThe Indians suggested that the old church building on the Opetchesahlt Reserve could be repaired to meet our needs until such time as a new school could be built. I examined the building referred to by the Indians and concluded that it was too far gone to warrant the extensive repairs that would be necessary to put it in shape. The building has been unused for many years and appears to be on the verge of collapse. However, I instructed Mr. Ashbridge to secure a report from a competent builder on the condition of the building. The Agent's report in this connection has now come to hand and is to the effect that the building is beyond repair and should be torn down. Mr. Ashbridge is being asked to ascertain if there is any suitable accommodation in the locality that could be secured on a temporary basis for use as a classroom.\n\nJoint Meeting of the Sheshahlt and Opetchesahlt Bands\n\nAs already stated the Indians of these Bands requested a meeting with the Commissioner to discuss school matters. The meeting was presided over by Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge and was orderly throughout. The particular matters which the Indians wished to discuss had to do with the following:\n\n(a) Visiting hours at the school.\n(b) Allowing children out of school to visit in Alberni and Port Alberni with their parents.\n(c) Use of the wash rooms on the girls' side.\n\nI found the regulations covering (a) and (b) quite reasonable and in line with those in force in other residential schools. The Indians were informed that these\nrules were designed to protect the health and general well-being of the pupils and, although some exception might be made because of unusual circumstances, any general relaxation of them could not be permitted. With respect to (c), it was disclosed that the use permitted of these wash-rooms was altogether too limited and, in some cases, had resulted in the children having to go elsewhere to relieve themselves. I instructed the Principal to remove the existing restriction and permit the use of these facilities consistent with the needs of the children. It transpired that Mr. Caldwell was not familiar with the restrictions placed on the use of these wash rooms which had been imposed by the girls' matron, Mrs. Mackenzie, apparently without consulting him.\n\nThe question of establishing a day school to meet the needs of the local reserves was discussed at considerable length and resulted in the meeting unanimously declaring in favor of a day school being established on the Opetchesah Reserve or some suitable alternative site between the town of Alberni and the residential school. There were twenty Indians eligible to vote present at the meeting, 16 from the Sheshat Band and 4 from the Opetchesah Band.\nMEMORANDUM TO:\nThe Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nFrom Inspector of Indian Agencies\n\nRe: Day School, Alberni\n\nIn accordance with your instructions I visited Opetchesht Indian Reserve No. 1 at Alberni in connection with the proposal to establish a day school there to serve children of that Reserve and Seshart Indian Reserve No. 1, in order to relieve school administrative problems at Alberni Indian Residential School and make available accommodation at the school, now taken up by these pupils, for children from Reserves having no educational facilities.\n\nThere is an old church building situated on the north side of the highway following the river and at the s.w. corner of the Reserve, which it was proposed at one time to repair and convert into a school house. I examined the building and agree with the Indian Agent's report of March 28th, 1945, to the effect that it would cost less to tear it down and rebuild. It is a very old structure in an advanced stage of interior and exterior decay. I would recommend against using any material that could be salvaged from it in a new school building. If it is torn down this site would make an excellent location for a new school building as it is a good building site, mostly covered with brush and reasonably easy clearing as many of the larger trees could be left for shade and ornament. Indians could be employed for clearing, unless the Agent's proposal to me to have it done with a bulldozer was adopted.\n\nAs stated, the highway is on the south of this site and there is an excellent road along the west boundary of the Reserve. There is an excellent view of the river from the site and the surroundings could be made quite attractive. As the Indian houses on this Reserve facing the highway are fairly modern design bungalows with good gardens, the whole would create a good impression of the Reserve to travellers using this main road.\n\nIf it is intended to build a school I would recommend that we acquire from the Indians a rectangular area of about one to one and a half acres on this corner, which would be bounded on the south by the main road, on the west by the side road and east boundary of the Reserve, on the north by existing Indian cultivation and on the east by a north and south boundary about three...\nhundred feet from and parallel with the west boundary. This would probably include a small area immediately east of the old church on which some Indian may have a claim as it contains an old, small, unoccupied and dilapidated building surrounded by a heavy second growth of brush. If necessary, compensation should be paid to the Indian claimant, which would probably not exceed $100.00.\n\nAccording to the Commissioner's report of March 31, 1945, on Alberni Indian Residential School, there are 31 children of school age on Seshart Reserve (about 1 1/4 miles distant) and 13 on Opetchesat Reserve, total of 44, with preschool children of 33 and 12 respectively, total 45. This would point to the possible future need for two classrooms and the design of any new building could provide for a necessary addition, or possibly a basement classroom.\n\nThere is an acute shortage of housing accommodation in the district, which will probably continue well into the post war period due to the expansion of the timber industry here. Further, any school should be planned with a view to its becoming an Indian community center with a resident teacher, particularly if these may be employed on a year round basis at some future time. It is much easier to secure fully qualified teaching personnel where the accommodation problem is disposed of. Such a school in this location would probably cost $6,500.00 to $7,500.00, and could be patterned after the Bella Bella or Kitimat schools if a two room and community structure. The entire cost, equipped, would probably run well up towards $10,000 or two thirds of the amount for a one room school with residence. A simple one room school without residence would probably cost about $3,000.00.\n\nThese suggestions are made as, with the Indian Agent, I was unable to find that any temporary accommodation was available.\n\nI visited the Ucluelet school on this inspection and found that the church on the Reserve was in use as a classroom, now closed, and had the following desks stamped \"C.O.& S. Fdy Co\"\n\n| No. | Description |\n|-----|-------------|\n| 1   | 8 complete and 1 front |\n| 2   | \" and 1 front and 1 back |\n| 3   | 2 fronts and backs |\n| 4   | 10 complete and 2 fronts and backs |\n\n1 Cosy Glow stove, needing repairs.\nThese could be brought to Alberni on the Agency boat or by freight.\nI attach photographs of the site taken as follows:\n\nNo. 1 - From the highway at the S.W. corner of the Reserve looking N.E. and showing old church.\n\nNo. 2 - About 300' east of above and looking N.W.

Coleman,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nYour File 159-1-1\n\nIn my report on the Alberni Indian Residential School dated March 31st reference was made to the need of a Day School in the vicinity of the Residential School to provide accommodation for Indian school children of the Sheshahht and Opetchesahht Reserves not attending the Residential School. During a discussion of the matter, a site on the Opetchesahht Reserve was suggested as suitable for this purpose, following which the matter was referred to the Indian owners by the Agent for consideration. The Band met on April 2nd and following an explanation of the requirements of the Department by Mr. Ashbridge passed the attached resolution indicating their willingness to surrender sufficient land for school purposes.\n\nMr. Inspector Coleman discussed the subject with Mr. Ashbridge during a recent visit to Alberni and I enclose a copy of his memorandum, with accompanying photographs of the site, for your information. If it transpires that the equipment at Ucluelet, to which Inspector Coleman refers, is not needed at that point arrangements can be made for its transfer to Alberni.\n\nI should like to suggest the Department proceed to secure the necessary authority for the establishment of a Day School on the Opetchesahht Reserve in order that construction may proceed once funds and materials become available.\n\nD.M.

This is the old Primary Room of the Indian Residential School. There is a basement which contains about 16 small single desks and a quantity of Manual Training equipment and several Singer sewing machines none of which are in use at the present time.\n\nNumber of desks in each classroom: There are twenty-six single desks. This includes some eight almost new larger desks which were obtained for the older children when this school was established last September.\n\nName of teacher: Miss Ketha Pitts. Age 31.\n\nHealth: Very Good\n\nRemarks relative to methods employed by teacher:\n\nMiss Pitts was trained at the Winnipeg Normal School. She holds a Second Class Certificate in the Province of Manitoba and a First Class Certificate in B.C. Miss Pitts attended a Summer School in Victoria in the year 1920 and received credit for Primary Work.\n\nHer experience includes some nine years in the Primary Division of the Alberni Indian Residential School and one year here, having been appointed to her present position in September 1927. I may say that neither the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia or I were consulted when this appointment was made. It has not proved a very suitable one as Miss Pitts has had very little experience in the teaching of older pupils and despite all that I have done for her the attendance here has fallen off. This she puts down to the Indian parents taking the children out of the local village during seasonal migrations. A teacher more experienced with older children and one who had no connection with the very unhappy conditions at the former Indian Residential School would have made a much better success in this Indian Day School.\n\nI wish to say that Miss Pitts is doing as well as she knows how, and has made an effort to follow my suggestions. She has limited her use of corporal punishment. The schoolroom is clean and bright. A number of very good posters have been constructed by the teacher. I am very sorry for this girl as had she been in another school her work would have met with much greater success.\n\nI am not satisfied that the former Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School, the Reverend Mr. Pitts, father of the present Day School teacher, has done his best to encourage a good attendance at this Day School.\n\nMiss Pitts told me today that a Day School could not be a success here as the people moved about so much. I explained that her duty was to see to it that all possible pupils did attend and to leave the question of the policy of the Department to be settled by others.\n\nA male teacher who had no previous connection with Alberni and with some years of successful experience would make a great difference at this school, though I do think that Miss Pitts should not be too greatly condemned for the possible\npolitical and other actions of her father.\n\nRemarks relative to the examination of the pupils.\n\nAs there were only seven children present four of whom were in the lower part of Grade 1 and the three most advanced only in Grade 3 I can say very little about the actual work done this year.\n\nIn Reading Grade 3 are working at Highroads Reader Book Z and also using with success the Reading Exercise Work Book suitable for their Grade. The children's reading was fairly good. The little people in Grade 1 who were present are just beginners and as such read in a satisfactory if rather slow manner.\n\nFar too little ORAL LANGUAGE has been done. I again taught a type lesson to aid the teacher. Oral Language in the case of Indian children who do not speak English at home is so necessary that I fail to understand why teachers do not give much greater time to it. The English Usage and Composition Work Books in Language are used with some success in Grade 3, who however failed to convince me that they knew much about the proper way to answer simple questions, or to speak about the simple objects to be found in the classroom.\n\nWriting is satisfactory. I suggested material for printing in Grade 1C and found that the change to script was being made correctly in Grade 1C and to ink in Grade 2. I asked that Grade 3 should reduce the size of the writing to the usual Half space taught in this Grade.\n\nIn Arithmetic I taught a Demonstration Lesson in Simple Problems for Grade 3. The teacher took notes. Other suggestions were also made. Grade 3 has made some progress and is up to standard in Arithmetic. Grade 1 is rather weak. Quick drills will be still necessary with all the pupils.\n\nI found that the new Pathways in Science texts were being used in the school. Grade 3 has finished Book 2 and is now working in Book 3, while Grade 1 is listening to the stories in Book 1.\n\nSome Art Work has been done. I explained with some care the object of the forthcoming Arts and Crafts Exhibition and instructed the teacher and older children with regard to suitable work for this exhibition. This school will be represented by a few baskets and woven mats, and by a few drawings.\n\nThis is a bright clean schoolroom. There is plenty of work on the boards for the children. The teacher has satisfactory control of the pupils. In reply to my question she stated that she had only resorted to corporal punishment once this year.\n\nOne boy REGGIE GUSO Age 9 in Grade 1A broke his wrist on Friday afternoon March 11th, the teacher informs me. This boy was permitted to go home with the other small pupils at 2.30 p.m. as is correct for Grades 1 and 2 in 1C. The teacher was still in the schoolroom with the older pupils till 5.30 p.m. Some time during the interval 2.30 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. Reggie fell off a swing and broke his wrist. A Doctor Jones who is perhaps a substitute medical officer here has the case in hand and though I did not see this little boy, I understand that he is again coming to school with his wrist and arm in a plaster cast.\n\nI do not believe that Miss Pitts was to blame in this though an experienced rural school teacher would have seen to it that the small children started for home at 2.30 p.m. and did not play at the school without supervision.\nAttendance problem: remedies suggested, etc.\n\nThe attendance has not been very good, and appears to be even worse now than when the school was first opened.\n\nI have instructed the teacher in the proper manner of entering records in the school register.\n\nGeneral Remarks:\n\nThe attendance is highly unsatisfactory.\n\nThe school is not a success.\n\nIt is essential that the teacher at such a school as this believes in the possibility of making an Indian Day School a success, even under rather adverse circumstances. Miss Pitts being so closely connected with the late Indian Residential School, which itself was anything but a success, should not have been chosen as the first teacher of the Day School here. Miss Pitts has done her best in a limited way but would do far better in a \"Provincial School\".\n\nThe question of transfer of Mr. and Mrs. Von Storch from Ucluelet to take charge here should I think be taken into consideration. Mr. Von Storch has been quite long enough at Ucluelet and Mrs. Von Storch is no longer required there as Field Matron. If Mr. Von Storch had done better work at Ucluelet this last year I should have recommended this transfer, as it is I can only suggest that he be moved here with the consent of the United Church as a temporary teacher, as from September 1938.\n\nThe future of this Alberni Day School is bound up with the Department's policy in regard to the building of an Indian Residential School at some point on the West Coast. Any appointment at the Alberni Indian Day School for the school year 1938-39 should be in my opinion of a strictly temporary nature.\n\nThe present standing of this school is only \"Fair\".\n\n(sgd.) Gerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nPort Alberni, B.C.,\nMarch 18, 1938.\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nSomass Hotel,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nMarch 18, 1938.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 8,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am forwarding herewith my report on the Alberni Indian Day School, West Coast Agency, which I inspected this morning.\n\nI am not satisfied with the condition of this school. The teacher considers that no Day School would be a success here. This is of course the opinion of her father, the Reverend Mr. Pitts, the late Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nWhen Dr. Wilson nominated Miss Pitts for her present position as teacher of the Alberni Indian Day School and forwarded her name through United Church officials to the Indian Affairs Branch, I was not consulted nor were you as far as I know.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that in conversation with Dr. Wilson later it came out that he had never seen the girl, and that he had telephoned to Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge asking if the nomination of Miss Pitts would be satisfactory. Dr. Wilson, Superintendent for the United Church Missions south of the Bella Coola-Bella Bella line, informed me that Mr. Ashbridge said it was satisfactory for Miss Pitts to be nominated to the Department.\n\nMr. Ashbridge asked me at the same time or shortly afterwards to protest the appointment of Miss Pitts to the Department. I told him I could not do any such thing as I had not been consulted. You will remember that it was about this time that I suggested that all nominations for Indian Day School teachers be made through your office in order that the Department might be properly informed with regard to qualifications of candidates. This has since been arranged and is working very well indeed.\n\nMr. Ashbridge would no doubt like a change of teachers made here at the end of the present school year. His wishes do not carry much weight with me as he is entirely responsible for the present state of things at this school, where Miss Pitts should never have been appointed, but once appointed must be given every consideration. Her work has not been poor enough to justify a dismissal, and not good enough to make a success of the school under the political conditions in Alberni. I must just leave it to you and the Indian Affairs Branch to decide what it is best to do under the circumstances.\n\nMr. Caldwell, Principal of the Ahousaht Indian Residential School, considers that the Rev. Mr. Pitts is doing all he can to keep the children away from the Alberni Day School to force the Department to build a Residential School at Alberni. I am not prepared to say that this is a fact.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT ON ALBERNI INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nUnited Church: West Coast Agency.\n\nDate of inspection: March 18, 1938.\n\nNumber of pupils present:\nBoys: 5\nGirls: 2\nTotal: 7\n\nNumber of classrooms: One. This is the old Primary Room of the Indian Residential School. There is a basement which contains about 16 small single desks and a quantity of Manual Training equipment and several Singer sewing machines none of which are in use at the present time.\n\nNumber of desks in each classroom: There are twenty six single desks. This includes some eight almost new larger desks which were obtained for the older children when this school was established last September.\n\nName of teacher: Miss Ketha Pitts. Age 31.\n\nHealth: Very Good.\n\nRemarks relative to methods employed by teacher:\n\nMiss Pitts was trained at the Winnipeg Normal School. She holds a Second Class Certificate in the Province of Manitoba and a First Class Certificate in B.C. Miss Pitts attended a Summer School in Victoria in the year 1930 and received credit for Primary Work.\n\nHer experience extends some nine years in the Primary Division of the Alberni Indian Residential School and one year here, having been appointed to her present position in September 1937. I may say that neither the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia or I were consulted when this appointment was made. It has not proved a very suitable one as Miss Pitts has had very little experience in the teaching of older pupils and despite all that I have done for her the attendance here has fallen off. Thus she puts down to the Indian parents taking the children out of the local village during seasonal migrations. A teacher more experienced with older children and one who had no connection with the very unhappy conditions at the former Indian Residential School would have made a much better success in this Indian Day School.\n\nI wish to say that Miss Pitts is doing as well as she knows how, and has made an effort to follow my suggestions. She has limited her use of corporal punishment. The schoolroom is clean and bright. A number of very good posters have been constructed by the teacher. I am very sorry for this girl as had she been in another school her work would have met with much greater success.\n\nI am not satisfied that the former Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School, the Reverend Mr. Pitts, father of the present Day School teacher, has done his best to encourage a good attendance at this Day School.\n\nMiss Pitts told me to-day that a Day School could not be a success here as the people moved about so much. I explained that her duty was to see to it that all possible pupils did attend and to leave the question of the policy of the Department to be settled by others.\n\nA male teacher who had no previous connection with Alberni and with some years of successful experience would make a great difference at this school, though I do think that Miss Pitts should not be too greatly condemned for the possible political and other actions of her father.\nRemarks relative to the examination of the pupils:\n\nAs there were only seven children present four of whom were in the lower part of Grade 1 and the three most advanced only in Grade 3 I can say very little about the actual work done this year.\n\nIn Reading Grade 3 are working at Highroads Reader Book 3 and also using with success the Reading Exercise Work Book suitable for their Grade. The children's reading was fairly good. The little people in Grade 1 who were present are just Beginners and as such read in a satisfactory if rather slow manner.\n\nFar too little ORAL LANGUAGE has been done. I again taught a type lesson to aid the teacher. Oral Language in the case of Indian children who do not speak English at home is so necessary that I fail to understand why teachers do not give much greater time to it. The English Usage and Composition Work Books in language are used with some success in Grade 3, who however failed to convince me that they knew much about the proper way to answer simple questions or to speak about the simple objects to be found in the classroom.\n\nWriting is satisfactory. I suggested material for printing in Grade 1C and found that the change to script was being made correctly in Grade 1B and to ink in Grade 2. I asked that Grade 3 should reduce the size of the writing to the usual half space taught in this Grade.\n\nIn Arithmetic I taught a Demonstration Lesson in Simple Problems for Grade 3. The teacher took notes. Other suggestions were also made. Grade 3 has made some progress and is up to standard in Arithmetic. Grade 1 is rather weak. Quick drills will be still necessary with all the pupils.\n\nI found that the new Pathways in Science texts were being used in the school. Grade 2 has finished Book 2 and is now working in Book 3, while Grade 1 is listening to the stories in Book 1.\n\nSome Art Work has been done. I explained with some care the object of the forthcoming Arts and Crafts Exhibition and instructed the teacher and older children with regard to suitable work for this exhibition. This school will be represented by a few baskets and woven mats, and by a few drawings.\n\nThis is a bright clean schoolroom. There is plenty of work on the boards for the children. The teacher has satisfactory control of the pupils. In reply to my question she stated that she had only resorted to corporal punishment once this year.\n\nOne boy REGGIE GUSO Age 9 in Grade 1A broke his wrist on Friday afternoon March 11th; the teacher informs me.

The teacher was still in the schoolroom with the older pupils till 3.30 p.m., some time during the interval 2.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. Reggie fell off a swing and broke his wrist. A Doctor Jones who is perhaps the substitute medical officer here has the case in hand and though I did not see this little boy, I understand that he is again coming to school with his wrist and arm in a plaster cast.\n\nI do not believe that Miss Pitts was to blame in this though an experienced rural school teacher would have seen to it that the small children started for home at 2.30 p.m. and did not play at the school without supervision.\nAttendance problem: remedies suggested, etc.\n\nThe attendance has not been very good, and appears to be even worse now than when the school was first opened. I have instructed the teacher in the proper manner of entering records in the school register. The attendance has been marked daily and from this I worked out the following:\n\nAverage Attendance by Month and Quarter:\n\nAverage Monthly Attendance:\n- September 1927 14.0\n- October 1927 19.02\n- November 1927 12.0\n- December 1927 14.86\n- January 1928 12.0\n- February 1928 7.65\n\nAverage Quarterly Attendance:\n- Quarter ending September 1937 14.0\n- Quarter ending December 1937 15.29\n- Quarter ending March 1938 ?\n- Quarter ending June 1938 ?\n\nClassification of Children on School Roll:\n\n| Grade | Boys | Girls | Total |\n|-------|------|-------|-------|\n| Grade 6 | 2    | 0     | 2     |\n| Grade 5 | 0    | 1     | 1     |\n| Grade 3 | 4    | 1     | 5     |\n| Grade 2 | 1    | 1     | 2     |\n\nThese have been away since Christmas time.\n\nMost of these attend well.\n\n| Grade | Boys | Girls | Total |\n|-------|------|-------|-------|\n| Grade IA | 1   | 3     | 4     |\n| Grade IB | 3   | 4     | 7     |\n| Grade IC | 3   | 2     | 5     |\n\nNone of the Grade IA were present at my inspection and only one little boy from Grade IB.\n\nTotals: Boys 14 Girls 12 26\n\nThe attendance is highly unsatisfactory.\n\nGeneral Remarks:\n\nThe school is not a success.\n\nIt is essential that the teacher at such a school as this believes in the possibility of making an Indian Day School a success, even under rather adverse circumstances.

Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nOttawa,\nApril 14, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 9th instant enclosing Inspector Barry's report regarding his inspection of the Alberni Indian Day School on March 18.\n\nThe Associate Secretary, Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, was in my office today and I discussed with him Inspector Barry's recommendation that Mr. Von Storch be transferred. He promised to give the matter immediate consideration.\n\nI might add that Doctor Dorey is leaving for the West at the end of this week and he hopes to have an opportunity of interviewing you in Vancouver about the end of the month.\n\nIn reading the report it is noted that 16 small single desks, a quantity of manual training equipment and several Singer sewing machines are stored in the basement.\n\nAny of the above that are not likely to be required at the Alberni Day School for some time might be distributed to other Residential or Day Schools. I would appreciate your advising to what schools you consider the above equipment might be sent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 8,\nVancouver, B.

C., together with his letter of 18th March, covering his inspection on the same date of the Alberni Indian Day School, West Coast Agency.\n\nThe Inspector's remarks regarding this School have been noted.\n\nShould the United Church approve of the transfer of Mr. Von Storch of the Ucluelet Indian Day School to Alberni, the question of a satisfactory exchange for Miss K. Pitts would, no doubt, be also considered. These matters will be taken up with Inspector Barry after he has had an opportunity of reviewing the situation at this School with the Rev.

There would be a considerable saving of time if the grade 2 and 3 groups were taken together for flash card and other word drill exercise. The teacher is endeavouring to bring up the standard of language by a variety of games and other interesting devices. More use could be made of the blackboard for assignments. The pupils are permitted to use the library books freely. The girls appeared to be neat and fairly clean. The standard was lower for the boys.\n\nMiss Smith is a well qualified and conscientious teacher. The response of the class would be better if her class-room manner displayed the same enthusiasm which her planning and preparation show.\n\nIt is too early to judge the progress which will be made during the term but I believe this will be better than satisfactory.\n\nR.F.

The pupils' exercise books indicate that careful supervision is given to the work. The teacher has prepared a time-table. The general atmosphere of the class is good. The grade 4 group is attempting to read material too difficult for them. Mrs. Conroy apparently has no grade 4 readers and these are being supplied to her by an emergency order which will correct this situation. The fitting up of the small annex to the hall for class-room purposes is a considerable improvement to the arrangements prevailing last year. It is too early in the year to judge the progress of the pupils but it would seem that this will be satisfactory.\n\nVII\n\nWhy not stop at Grade six?\n\nR.F.

Unfortunately she took ill before completing her course and has not returned to finish her training. She is very enthusiastic about her work and is doing excellent work with this large ungraded class. She has been handicapped by the lack of supplies, some of which arrived on the day of my visit. It has also been impossible to secure desks which have been on order for nearly four months. The army tables and benches are most unsuitable, but there appears to be no alternative until desks are available. Mrs. Conroy has prepared a large amount of supplementary material, and has borrowed a limited supply of books from the Residential School. The way in which she has taken hold of this difficult situation is most commendable. Mrs. Conroy assumed her duties at this school about the middle of October.\n\nR.F.

The attendance has therefore been somewhat better.\n\nEither hot soup or hot cocoa is served at Noon.\n\nThe room is certainly in a much less untidy condition than on the occasion of my last inspection. This report should I consider be read in connection with that forwarded to you on December 8th 1938. There has as you will note been some improvement since then, but I do not consider that Mr. Glover will ever be a success with small Indian pupils for he has little idea of the energetic teaching necessary to produce any worth while results in Primary Grades. He is a rather negative type of teacher.\n\nI do not consider that it will be necessary for the Department to take any action to have him replaced by a better qualified instructor, for of course this day school will be absorbed in the new Alberni Indian Residential School now building.\n\nI wish to note here for your future reference that very few if any of the Manual Training tools supplied to the former Alberni Residential School are available for the new school when it opens.\n\nThe following desks are however available:\n- 11 only Single School Desks No. 5\n- 21 only Single School Desks No. 4\n- 11 only Single School Desks No. 3\n- 1 only Single School Desk No. 2\n\nThe new Residential School appears to be of standard design and to have reached a stage of construction, as far as the main building is concerned, of the completion of the cement work for the basement. It occupies a site roughly equivalent to that of the older school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

Primary Reading in Grade 1 is \"Fair\". Writing in general is not very good. The teacher's own writing is poor. Singing is very poor, many of the pupils sing \"flat\". Language is very weak in Primary Grades, and I much doubt that these little people have been taught along the lines I have over and over again suggested. One word answers are common.\n\nArithmetic is perhaps the best subject, and this may perhaps be described as \"Satisfactory\". The correct texts were being used with the various Grades.\n\nThe teacher was given notice of my visit, and was neater in his person than on former visits. The room was somewhat cleaner, and books etc., better arranged. Some of the pupils might well be cleaner and hair was certainly not brushed in some cases. Girls are taught to sew by Mrs. Glover. The Indian Agent has taken considerable trouble to rectify many of the weaknesses noted in my report of December 8th 1938, but he will never be able to make Mr. Glover an efficient teacher.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nNanaimo, B.C.\nDecember 8, 1938.\n\nMajor D.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major Mackay:\n\nI am forwarding herewith my report on the Alberni Indian Day School, West Coast Agency, which I inspected this morning.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Ashbridge was with me during the inspection.\n\nThe present teacher, Mr. J. Glover, B.A., was moved here in September from Kletmu, where he had been for three years. I hope that the change will be good for Mr. and Mrs Glover who had been quite long enough in Kletmu. Their children will benefit in any case as they are able to attend High School at Alberni and there was no school for them to go to at Kletmu.\n\nThe Alberni Indian Day School needs to be kept in a much more tidy condition. Papers and books were all over the place. Pupils coats and hats were in the actual schoolroom and the large windows of the room were closed though the day was mild and damp. I of course pointed out these matters to the teacher and had the windows opened.\n\nThough a trained teacher Mr. Glover so far has not made much of a success with small children. I have done what I could for him, and hope that when I next visit the school there will be a great improvement.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT ON ALBERNI INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nUnited Church West Coast Agency\n\nDate of inspection: December 8, 1938.\n\nNumber of pupils present:\nBoys 12\nGirls 12\nTotal 24\n\nThere were only three children absent, one being in Grade 5 and two Beginners.\n\nNumber of classrooms: One. This is the old Primary Room of the Indian Residential School. There is a basement which contains about 14 small single desks and a quantity of Manual Training equipment. There are also several Singer sewing machines which the Indian Agent proposes to make use of in the Day Schools of the Agency. I certainly consider he should do this as the equipment will only spoil by disuse. Many of the Manual Training tools would appear to have been lost (?) at the time of the fire. Saws and hammers to mention only two items appear to be missing.\n\nI hope that later the boys attending this Alberni Indian Day School will be taught Manual Training in the basement of the school.\n\nNumber of desks in each classroom: There are twenty-eight desks larger desks now about a year in use which it was necessary to get to accommodate the older pupils when the day school was established in September 1927.\n\nName of teacher: Mr. James B. Glover B.A.\n\nHealth: Good.\n\nRemarks relative to methods employed by teacher:\n\nMr. Glover was educated at the University of Alberta where he obtained his B.A. He was trained at the Calgary Normal School and holds a First Class Certificate in Alberta. His experience includes three years as teacher of the Indian Day School at Klemtu. He has been here on transfer since September 1938.\n\nMr. Glover has managed to interest the older children who would not attend when Miss Pitts was in charge of the Day School. He has in fact greatly increased the attendance.\n\nThis teacher is I believe trying to carry out my suggestions made from time to time during inspections at Klemtu. He does not think very clearly and has not any definite idea even now of how much each child knows or does not know.\n\nI found a few children in wrong Grades and Mr. Glover appeared none too certain just which Grade certain pupils were in as they appear to work with more than one Grade.\n\nEvery possible help was given and as the teacher took notes I hope for an improvement by next spring, when I shall try to visit this school again.\n\nRemarks relative to the examination of the pupils:\n\nSinging is fairly good. Some pupils sing very flat. Writing is in general satisfactory. It is good in Grade 3. Reading from Grade 3 to 6 inclusive is good. Grade 1 do not read well. Grade 1C and 1D are backward. They may not have been in school very long as yet for some came late.\n\nLanguage Work Books are in use.\n\nI asked that definite lessons be given daily in Health and suggested where material could be obtained.\nRemarks relative to the examination of the pupils continued:\n\nArithmetic is about average. I tested the older pupils in the Fundamentals with the All, Canada Test.\n\nGrade 6 made a Mid Score of 29 Norm 30\nGrade 5 made a Mid Score of 22 Norm 25\nGrade 4 made a Mid Score of 14 Norm 19\nGrade 3 made a Mid Score of 9 Norm 8\n\nIn Vocational Work Mrs Glover is teaching the girls to sew. The boys will later be started on simple Manual Training. It is not much use talking of Arts and Crafts till the teacher has organized his academic work better. I however supplied him with a large sheet of Indian designs for use in Art Work. Later these can be applied to Manual Training projects.\n\nI noticed that the older girls help with the Noon lunch of cocoa soup etc., prepared in this school.\n\nThe response to my own teaching was not very good. I believe that the older pupils are regaining some ability to express themselves. Most were at the Residential School here and there learned very poor classroom manners. It will take years to get over the very poor training given at the old Alberni Indian Residential School. I very much doubt that the training given at that school was of any great advantage to the children. In an Indian Day School the Indian Agent and Inspector of Schools have much greater opportunities to make certain that real instruction is being given to the children.\n\nThe teacher's control of this class is \"Fair\".\n\nAttendance problem: remedies suggested, etc.\n\nAttendance has greatly improved since Mr. Glover took charge of the school. This does not appear below.\n\nThe average attendance has been:\n\n| School Year | 1937-38 | 1938-39 |\n|-------------|---------|---------|\n| September   | 14.0    | 7.5     |\n| December    | 15.2    |         |\n| March       | 9.6     |         |\n| June        | 8.2     |         |\n\nThe December Quarter will be much better.\n\nClassification: Grade: Boys: Girls: Total:\n6: 1 0 1\n5: 3 2 5\n4: 0 1 1\n3: 1 2 3\n2: 1 0 1\n1A: 2 2 4\n1B: 0 2 2\n1C: 2 3 5\n1H: 2 2 5\n\nNo promotions should be made till June. The teacher has been so informed. Totals 12 15 27\n\nGeneral Remarks:\n\nI asked the teacher to tidy the room. Things were all over the place. The room was clean but very untidy. Coats and hats should be placed on hooks in the hall and not in the actual schoolroom. The Indian Agent was requested to insist on the room being kept in a much better condition and he will insist on this when he visits the school monthly.\n\nThe general standing is still only \"Fair\".\n\nNanaimo, B.C.\nDecember 8, 1938.\n\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nGerald H.

It is noted, however, from a copy of Rev. Mr. Pitts' letter which you forwarded that he considers a two-roomed school is required. If you are personally assured that sufficient children will attend this school to justify the employment of two teachers, the Department will approve of such arrangement. In that event, you may communicate with Indian Commissioner MacKay and have him arrange for the purchase of the desks mentioned in your letter.\n\nYou may expend an amount not exceeding $100 in repairs to the building and installation of toilets.\n\nIf you consider that it is necessary to supply a midday meal, you may purchase the equipment necessary, at a cost not exceeding $50. Please let me know what action you decide to take and also let me have a detailed statement of the food which you consider should be purchased for midday meal purposes and its approximate cost per month.

Ashbridge, Indian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAt your request as to what will be required to start a two-room school after summer holidays, I have looked over the equipment on hand and have made an estimate of the number of children available to attend while residing at their homes, and beg to report as follows:\n\n15 pupils in Grade I\n6 \" II\n9 \" III\n2 \" IV\n\n3 pupils in Grade V\n3 \" VI\n4 \" VII\n2 \" VIII\n\nSome from other reserves would probably come to stop with friends on these reserves as their parents frequently did when the children were in the residential school. The possible number would be between 45 and 50 pupils.\n\nThe primary classroom is intact with primary supplies and seats for 30 pupils. A cottage near it could be used for the little ones.\n\nAs the seats in the primary room are small, we would require\n\n5 #2 desks\n1 front and 1 back #2\n5 #3 desks\n1 front and 1 back #3\n\ncost about $150.00\n\nText books and supplies for:\n\n6 pupils, Grade 2; 9 pupils Grade 3; 2 pupils Grade 4\n3 pupils, Grade 5; 3 pupils Grade 6; 4 pupils Grade 7\n\nWe would require some blackboards for cottage; toilets for boys and girls and playrooms. This could all be arranged with the present buildings for about $100.00.\n\nThe children should get a noonday meal at the school. The equipment for this would cost about $50.00 as the second cottage belonging to the school is in use and will be available for cooking and dining room.\n\nThe basement of the classroom could be used as playroom for the girls and a large shop in the boys playground could be used as playroom for the boys.\n\nI think this covers what you have asked for.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Affairs.

At that time a representative of the United Church expressed regret that the Government had not seen its way clear to re-adjust and consolidate the Indian residential schools on the west coast of Vancouver Island. In any event, nothing but good can result from a thorough investigation of local conditions.\n\nIt is impossible, of course, for me to do anything here to stop local rumors that will arise from time to time as to what the Government is doing and what it should do. These rumors are likely to multiply steadily until a final decision is reached. The United Church authorities have communicated with me in recent weeks, in an attempt to find out what our programme at Alberni is likely to be. I have intimated to them, as I am now intimating to you, that no decision can be reached at any time in the immediate future.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, June 8, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Indian Commissioner MacKay, in which he states that he recently discussed with you the question of starting a day school at Alberni for the academic year 1937-38.\n\nIt is understood that the primary schoolroom is available and would accommodate 30 to 35 pupils. Please let me know if any school desks were saved from the fire, or will it be necessary to purchase new desks? If so, the different sizes of desks and the number of each size should be stated. You should let me have, also, a list of any other equipment necessary and its approximate cost. Please forward the above information as soon as possible, in order that arrangements can be completed for opening this school on September first.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Heey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith requisition for school books and supplies for Alberni Day School, as instructed in your letter of July 5, 1937.\n\nA recent check of the pupils who may be expected to attend this school shows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| 1     | 12     |\n| 2     | 5      |\n| 3     | 8      |\n| 4     | 2      |\n| 5     | 2      |\n| 6     | 2      |\n\nTotal of 31, inclusive of 11 children having attained school age of admission.\n\nMaking allowance for absentees and other causes, it is estimated that the school attendance will not exceed 25, or even less, and I would say that one teacher would suffice for the present. As there is another room already available, it would simply mean employing another teacher in the event of the pupilage increasing.\n\nWith regard to the proposed mid-day meal, this is respectfully recommended, due to the distance the children have to go to school, also as a health insurance for the undernourished, and as domestic training for the girls who would prepare the meal. This meal would be very simple consisting of a hot soup or milk, bread, etc., and could be provided at a cost of ten to twelve cents per meal per capita, and should be provided throughout the academic year.\n\nAs instructed, I have today written to Mr. Indian Commissioner MacKay, with respect to desks required, and to appointment of a teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

Jackson,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, July 29th, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Neill,\n\nI have, for acknowledgment, your letter of July 22nd, addressed to Mr. Pratt, in which you express disappointment at our failure to supply you with information until now with respect to the establishment of a temporary Indian day school at Alberni.\n\nI may state, by way of comment, that it has been impossible to supply you with this information for the simple reason that a final decision was not reached until a few days ago.\n\nYou can readily appreciate that a great many letters had to be written to the Indian Agent and to the United Church authorities before the matter could be intelligently considered and a decision reached. The view was expressed at first that the enrolment might justify the establishment of two rooms and the employment of two teachers. The Agent, however, in his letter to the Department of July 14th, expressed the opinion that the enrolment would not justify the employment of more than one teacher. Dr. Cochrane was then asked to nominate a teacher and his letter containing the nomination is dated Toronto, July 26th, and did not reach the Department until July 27th. I simply desire to assure you, therefore, that everything possible has been done by the officials to expedite the negotiations so that arrangements could be made for the opening of this school at the regular opening date on September first.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nSecretary.\n\nA.

We think Miss Pitts has done fine work as a Teacher in the Alberni Residential School. In visiting this School a year ago, I was very much impressed with her interest in the children and their evident affection for her.\n\nI will be glad if you will let us know as soon as possible if you agree to the appointment of Miss Pitts to this position.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nRBC:BJ\nOttawa, July 24th, 1937.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Dr. Dorey,\n\nFollowing considerable correspondence with Indian Agent Ashbridge, it has been decided to open a one-roomed day school at Alberni on September 1st, next.

Mrs. Conroy, although not a certificated teacher has apparently given good service in our schools and her resignation from Klemtu was fully justified. I should like to recommend, therefore, that she be assigned to the position at the Alberni School at the same salary she received last year and in anticipation of the Department's approval I am arranging for her to report for duty early next week.

(RG 10, Volume 6420, file 860A-1, part 1)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa\n\nDistrict School Inspector Davey considers that the enrolment at the Alberni Indian Day school is such that a second classroom should be provided. Supt. Garrard's letter of October 16th attached indicates that the Band hall on the Sheshaht Reserve will provide adequate temporary accommodation and that desks and heating facilities are available.\n\nA qualified teacher, Miss Margaret Mary McArthur, reference the attached application, is also available and I would recommend that the Department authorize the opening of a second classroom at the Alberni school. You will note that the Band will require compensation at the rate of $25.00 a month for use of the building.\n\nW.S.

Arneil Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nBox 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Alberni Day School\n\nIn reply to your letter of October 6, 1948, File 16-11-2 I wish to advise that I have contacted Mr. Caldwell regarding the accommodation at his school for an additional teacher should one be employed at the Alberni Day School. Mr. Caldwell advises that at the present time the Residential School is full to capacity but that if no other place was available Mrs. Caldwell would be prepared to accommodate the teacher in the residence and that she could obtain her meals in the staff quarters.\n\nRegarding the use of the Hall on the Sheshaht Reserve I would advise that as this will be a temporary measure the accommodation there would be adequate. Desks which would not be required in the present school would be moved to the hall and additional seating could be obtained by the use of the tables and benches which we had before the desks arrived. There is at present a drum heater and a large cook stove in the hall and this would, I think, be sufficient for heating purposes.\n\nThis Band would like compensation for the use of the hall to the extent of $25.00 per month to take care of ordinary wear and tear.\n\nN.W.

It is presumably a first or second class certificate but we cannot tell from the information which she provides on her application form.\n\nNo doubt, Inspector Davey will be able to provide this information after he has interviewed this teacher. When Miss McArthur assumes her teaching duties, please forward the usual forms so that she can be added to our salary list.\n\nBernard F.

These sets must not be removed from the premises.\n\nA prospective tenderer may obtain one of the remaining sets of documents for tendering purposes, upon deposit of Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) for the set; but no contractor must be allowed more than one set of tendering documents. Cheques for the use of documents must be certified and made payable to the Receiver General of Canada. Contractors should be advised that the deposit will be refunded only upon the return of drawings and specifications in good condition to the Chief Engineer, Engineering and Construction Service, Ottawa, within two weeks from the date upon which tenders close.\n\nCertified cheques shall be forwarded directly to this office, together with a list of names and addresses of firms or individuals from whom they are received.\n\nP.

However the old one room class-room building at the Alberni Residential School will not be used by the Residential School in the 1947-48 term. This would serve temporarily until it is possible to secure other accommodation, if the children of six years of age are excluded. This would give a maximum enrolment for the 1947-48 term of 39. If this building is used it should be moved on to the Sheshant Reserve to be away from the Residential School. It would be difficult to move it to the Opetchesah Reserve as the bridge across the Somas River is too narrow to take the building, and as the river banks are very steep. At any rate twice as many pupils would attend from the Sheshant Reserve as from the Opetchesah Reserve. This one room school would serve for two or three years, and would give a clear picture of the actual requirements.\n\nSite:\n\nThere is an excellent site to the north of the Sheshant village playground. This is well located with respect to the population on this reserve, and has the advantage of an already prepared playground. The distance from this site to the farthest home on the Opetchesah Reserve\nis 1.8 miles and 1.5 miles to the closest home. The Alberni School Board transports pupils who live over three miles, and generally in this Province pupils living over two miles from the school are carried by bus. In this particular case the road which the pupils will have to travel carried heavy traffic and has no sidewalk. If the local bus schedule is improved it will be possible to carry the twelve pupils from the Opetchesht Reserve to the border of the Sheshaht Reserve for 5\u00a2 a head for each trip.\n\nI suggest that Mr. Indian Agent Garrard be asked to report on the availability of this proposed site, and the cost of moving the building. If these two factors present no difficulty, I shall recommend the establishment of the Day School on the Sheshaht Reserve, and the temporary use of the old classroom building.\n\nR. F.

(RG 10, Volume 6420, file 860A-5, part 1)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe - Alberni Indian Day School -\n\nI enclose herewith Inspector Davey's memorandum of the 28th ult., reviewing the educational requirements of the Opetchesahlt and Sheshahlt Indian Reserves of the West Coast Agency, indicating that while a two roomed school would be required to provide for the present estimated enrolment, and a three roomed building within the next few years, a one room school, for the present, would enable us to better determine our future requirements. He recommends that the old day school located on the Alberni Residential School property, which has been in use by them since fire destroyed the classroom shortly after its construction, could be moved to a suitable location on the adjoining Sheshahlt Reserve for this purpose. He estimates that about two-thirds of the pupils would be from Sheshahlt Reserve, and one third from Opetchesahlt Reserve, which is about 1\u00bd miles distant.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Garrard has secured the enclosed quotation for $1,232.25 from a contractor, Mr. Thompson, for clearing the new site, moving building to it on new footings, painting exterior and interior and generally putting it in condition for occupation, which appears quite reasonable under present conditions. He also provides for a circulatory heater at a cost of $85.95, a total of $1,309.20. Also forty new desks will be required, on which quotations will be secured, if you approve of the opening of this school.\n\nIf it is found necessary to transport the Opetchesahlt children to and from the school, this will cost, at the\nIndian Affairs Branch. #2.

Thompson's contract, being composed of an amount of $40.00 charged for levelling off the site where the day school was originally situated, a voucher for which has already been forwarded to the Department, and an amount of $2.00 for levelling the grounds around the Neshaht Band Community Hall. Payment of this latter amount has been requested by the Band from Band funds, which will be the subject of a separate communication. The item \"remaining on painting - $38.00\" does not enter the picture being included in the contract price, but apparently was shown separately for the reason that the painting was not completed at the time the statement was prepared, but according to advice received from R. Indian Agent Gerrard has now been completed in accordance with the contract.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I wish to advise that the distance these children are transported is approximately 1\u00bd miles. The road on which they travel is a main highway and no sidewalks are on either side making a condition where it is necessary for the children to walk on the main highway. As a greater portion of these children are quite small and traffic is heavy and fast along this roadway it was considered advisable that transportation be found to convey these children over this stretch of road. Arrangements were therefore made with the District School Board for these children to be carried in the School Bus when it was returning from taking the High School children to their school in the mornings and again in the evenings when the bus was going to pick the High School children up.\n\nN.W.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa\n\nRe: Education - Alberni Residential School and Day Schools\n\nThe writer has visited Alberni Residential School on two occasions while at the West Coast Agency and during both visits the subject of classroom accommodation was discussed at length with the Principal, Mr. Caldwell. It will be recalled that while a four room block was built in recent years two additional classrooms of a temporary nature have had to be added to prevent overcrowding.\n\nIn addition to the lack of classroom accommodation referred to, a serious problem of classroom facilities exists on the Indian Reserves immediately adjacent to the Residential school where an old one-room school, at present in use, is entirely inadequate for the pupilage on the Reserves. I attach hereto a memorandum from Mr. Davey, our School Inspector, dated September 29th, in which he submits a proposition to adequately care for the educational requirements at the Residential school and adjoining Reserves.\n\nDuring Dr. Dorey's recent visit to Vancouver a meeting was arranged at this office with Dr. Dorey, Mr. Caldwell, Mr. Davey and the writer to discuss various phases of our school administration at the Residential School. Mr. Davey's memorandum, with which I fully concur, was touched upon and I gather that Dr. Dorey and Mr. Caldwell feel that the erection of an additional four room block catering to the Residential school pupils and the Indian Reserve Day school pupils on a full day basis and under the jurisdiction of this Branch would be a decidedly forward step and one leading to an adequate and worthwhile educational program.\nI strongly recommend the erection of this additional four-room block to be operated under the jurisdiction of this Branch by adding to the existing recently built four-room block at the Residential School.\n\nIn addition to the above subject and recommendation, I attach hereto a self-explanatory memorandum from Mr. Davey, dated September 1st, covering the problem of the ever increasing number of pupils from Indian Day schools and Residential schools who desire to go forward to higher education. You will note from this memorandum that Provincial high school and technical school courses are available at present and will be to an even greater extent in the future at Alberni where we have always enjoyed excellent cooperation from the local High School Board. It seems logical that we should take advantage of entering possibly up to forty pupils from our Residential school and surrounding Indian Reserves where higher education is not available and this could readily be reached by arrangements with the Alberni School Board and by the erection of two moderate, separate dwellings upon the Residential school property providing dormitory space (one for boys and one for girls) for up to twenty pupils each, where the pupils could reside and be under the direct supervision of the Residential school Principal after school hours. The suggested location is ideal from, I think, every point of view for such a plan and with the pupils living in pleasant surroundings with regular evening study periods and supervised recreational activities at the Residential school and in Alberni it is my opinion that such an arrangement would prove successful and go a long way towards the desired assimilation of the pupils concerned.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncls.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTo: The Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nFrom: The District School Inspector.\n\nRe: Alberni Day and Residential Schools.\n\nThe large enrolment at the Alberni Day School makes it imperative that an addition be constructed to accommodate one more classroom at this school. At the same time the Residential School, which is some 200 yards from the Day School, has a four-room classroom block to accommodate approximately 235 pupils. In addition to the four classrooms two temporary rooms have been provided in the basement to relieve the overcrowding in the four regular classrooms. It would seem logical therefore that a single unit be constructed to relieve the serious overcrowding in the Day School and at the same time provide for accommodation to enable all pupils at the Residential School to attend the classroom on a full-time basis. The authorized enrolment at the residential school is 225 pupils but normally carries in the neighbourhood of 235 and the anticipated enrolment for the current academic year at the Day School is 48. In order to provide for this number of pupils and the anticipated increase in the next five years at least eight classrooms should be available. There are four classrooms at the Residential School which we can continue to use. The Day School building is an old structure formerly used at the old Alberni Residential School, which has been temporarily fixed up to serve the Opetchisahlt and Seshahlt Reserves. I suggest that the solution for this problem is to construct a four-classroom block on the Residential School grounds adjacent to the present building and operate the eight classrooms thus provided as a day school to which the pupils of the Residential\nSchool would attend. This proposal is made not only because of the need for increased classroom facilities, which is obvious from the foregoing figures, but also because of the present financial condition of the Alberni Residential School as shown in the recent audit. It will be noted from this that the school has a very heavy bank overdraft and its financial position is most precarious. If this condition is allowed to continue we will undoubtedly be faced with the rapid deterioration of the school because it will be unable to pay salaries sufficiently high to secure a competent staff. The operation of the eight classrooms as a day school would bring all the teachers under the provisions of the day school salary schedule and also make the teaching positions more attractive by enabling teachers to be classified as Civil Servants for salary purposes, and probably give some relief to the financial problems of the Residential School.\n\nI recommend the separation of the normal classroom work from the operation of the Residential School so that we would have at this point an eight room day school to which children in residence at the Residential School will attend as day pupils. The teachers employed at this school would be subject to the regulations that apply to day school teachers.\n\nIn addition to the classroom block accommodation will have to be provided by way of a teacherage for four teachers.\n\nWith regard to the per capita grant, I would suggest that for the first year of operation there should be no reduction because it would appear that with the full time attendance of senior pupils in the classroom additional staff will be required in the residence and it is possible that the saving of expenditure by the residential School will not be great enough to put the finances on a firm basis. At the end of the year's operation an audit will indicate the grant which would be suitable for the operation of the residence.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nInspector of Indian Schools in B.C.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nSeptember 1, 1948.\n\nTo: The Indian Commissioner of B.C.\n\nFrom: The District Inspector of Indian Schools.\n\nRe: Hostel for High School Pupils.\n\nThere is an increasing number of pupils in our Indian Day Schools reaching the level of High School, and this is creating a problem of finding accommodation in the white communities where these pupils may receive High School instruction. The greatest number of these pupils are members of bands residing on the coast and are of Protestant affiliation.\n\nWith this in mind, a possible location for such a hostel would appear to be at the Alberni Residential School. This school already has about a dozen pupils in attendance at the local High School and the results have been good. The Alberni Provincial School Board has an extensive building programme under way which includes a large, modern high school which will include a comprehensive vocational training programme, including industrial arts, home economics, and business courses.\n\nA second solution would be to establish a hostel in Vancouver, or one of the adjoining municipalities. Such a location would have several advantages over the Alberni suggestion. It would be easier for the Vancouver schools to absorb a large group of Indian pupils. A wider variety of opportunities for vocational instruction are offered both in the large Technical School already established and a second similar school now under construction, and in the large number of private institutions offering specialized instruction. However, the Vancouver location...\nhas the serious handicap of the size of the city, which makes\nthe problem of adequate supervision extremely difficult.\nPupils residing in Vancouver are likely to be subject to many\ndistractions and to the influence of certain undesirable\nelements always more prevalent in larger centres. This refers,\nin particular, to teen age girls.\n\nThe securing of someone capable and sufficiently\ninterested to operate such an institution might present con-\nsiderable difficulty. Although, for the above reasons, I\nfavour the establishment of a hostel at Alberni under the\ndirection of the principal of the residential School, I\nsuggest that it is practical to try, on a small scale, such\nan experiment at both points. These establishments should be\nof the cottage type along the lines of that in operation at\nthe Fairbridge Farm School. A beginning could be made with\nthe erection of a building at Alberni and Vancouver capable\nof handling ten to fourteen pupils at each point and expanded\nwhere warranted.\n\nBefore going any further, with these suggestions,\nI feel that it would be wise to secure the Department's reaction\nto the proposal.\n\nR.F.

Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Alberni Day School\n\nThe Sheshahlt Community Hall was used last year as a school classroom at the above-mentioned school. But, as this is an enormous room far beyond the requirements of the class and most difficult to heat, it is felt that this year it would be preferable to carry on classes in the entrance hall of the building, which is a room of most suitable size.\n\nSupt. Garrard advises that the cost of converting this room for school use will be possibly $255.00, and I would recommend that funds to this extent be made available. Approximately $60.00 of the amount is required for labour and I would ask that an accountable advance of this amount be send to Mr. Garrard.\n\nW.S.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Alberni Indian Day School\n\nReference your 16-11-3 (159) of August 1st.\n\nThe Department approves an expenditure of $255.00 to carry out repairs at the temporary building being used for the above school. In view of the expenditure of public funds on this building, it is presumed that an adjustment will be made in the rent, as we are improving the building considerably for the band.\n\nI would suggest that we receive the building rent free for the 1949-50 academic year.\n\nAn accountable advance of $60.00 is being sent to Mr. Garrard.\n\nBernard F.

Arneil, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Disposal Alberni Indian Day School\n\nWith reference to your letter dated June 19th, with regard to the disposal of the above mentioned buildings to the Sheshant Band of Indians.\n\nTo begin with, this building was never a Day School until it was moved off the Residential School grounds on to the Indian Reserve. From 1910 - 1927 this building was used as a detached class-room for the resident pupils. The Principal of the Residential school at the time was Mr. H. B. Currie, a resident from Alberni. Mr. Currie erected the Day School in 1911. It was on a cement wall, concrete floor with the basement used as a pupils playroom. The approximate cost of this building at that time was $1000.00.\n\nIn the early days of Indian Education the property and buildings were erected by the Churches. This Day School was built with Presbyterian Church money.\n\nThe Residential School was destroyed by fire on June 3, 1917. The new Residential school was constructed by this Department in 1920-21. In the meantime from 1927 until completion of the new school, classes were carried on in the Day School. This new Residential school was also destroyed by fire during Rev. Pitts Principalship, about 1934 or 1935. The Day school was again absorbing many children who attended the Residential School for a time.\n\nThe Presbyterian work in the Day School ceased when Church union was consumated, at which time it passed over to the United Church in 1925.\nW. S. Arneil:\n\nFrom 1925 - 1950 Departmental funds were used for repairs and upkeep to the Day School with no specific alterations made to the building itself.\n\nIn 1950 the Day School ceased to function as a classroom when the new Gill Elementary school opened at the Fall term with all local Indian children attending a Public school for the first time.\n\nWe are pleased to advise that the Indian children have adjusted themselves very satisfactorily to their new environment, and on the average are keeping up with the white children in their studies. We can foresee no future use of the old building as a classroom again. The local bands are extremely satisfied with the present school arrangements, and mark it as a great advancement in Indian Education.\n\nThe present worth of the Day School is considered to be approximately $400.00\n\nfor N.W.Garrard\nSuperintendent\nIndian Agency\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nWest Coast Agency,\n114-4th Ave. South,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nJune 1st, 1953.\n\nW. S. Arneil, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have been approached by the Sheshahlt Council regarding the possibilities of acquiring possession of the Alberni Indian Day School, and to be declared property of the band. This building, located on reserve No. 1, ceased to function as a school about three years ago, at which time the children proceeded to attend the new Gill Elementary Public school located in the Alberni district. Since then the school building has been occupied by the Sheshahlt and Opetchesault Homemaker's club and for Church services conducted under the auspices of the United Church of Alberni.\n\nThe reason for the Council's request is that it is their desire to have the building used exclusively as a church and to be named the \"Sheshahlt United Church\".\n\nAs the Council wish to proceed with repairs and alterations to the building, it is not considered advisable to have it altered or re-modelled until advised if it may be disposed of to the band. It has been erected at least 40 years, dimensions are 30 x 40, with its present worth considered to be rather low.\n\nfor M. Marrard\nSuperintendent\nIndian Agency\n\nJM:MP\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Old Alberni Indian Day School Building\n\nI am enclosing letters dated June 1st and July 28th from Superintendent Gerrard in connection with the proposed transfer of the above-mentioned building to the Sheshahlt Band for use as a Church.\n\nYou will note that the building originally was the property of the Presbyterian Church and was used temporarily as a classroom, maintenance being provided by the Department. There is no possibility of the building being required for school use and with the approval of the Department it is intended to turn it over to the Sheshahlt Band. It would perhaps be advisable to secure a waiver of interest from the United Church authorities.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n-JH\nEncl.\nAugust 7th, 1953.\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nThe United Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2E, Ontario.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nRe: Alberni Indian Day School Building\n\nAbout 1948, following the completion of the first of the two four-classroom blocks now in use at the Alberni Residential School, the old building formerly used as a classroom at the Alberni Residential School when it operated under Presbyterian auspices, was moved to the Sheshaht Reserve which joins the residential school property, and was renovated to serve that reserve as a day school. Subsequently, arrangements were made for the admission of the children of this reserve to the Gill Provincial Elementary School. Since 1950 it has been used for church services and to serve as a meeting place for the Homemakers' Club.\n\nI am now informed that the Sheshaht Band wish to acquire this building in order that it may be set aside for the exclusive use of the church. If the Band is successful, they propose to name it the \"Sheshaht United Church\". I presume that the clergyman doing the missionary work on the Sheshaht Reserve is fully aware of the circumstances, and you may wish to contact him concerning this matter.\n\nThe department is prepared to turn this building over to the Band for the use indicated above. However, the church, as well as the department, appears to have an interest in the building, and before making any definite commitment I would appreciate having your comments as to whether or not the proposal in connection with this building meets with your approval.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education\nAttention: Mr. Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nRe: Alberni Indian Day School Building\nYour File 159/6-1-860 (EL)\n\nSo far as this Board is concerned, there is no objection to turning over the old building to the Band for use as a church, but I shall make enquiries of the minister at Alberni, who looks after the religious work on the Reserve. Unless you hear from me to the contrary, this is approval.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6420, file 860A-5, part 1)\nAugust 27th, 1953.\n\nMr. W.S.

Two of the main subjects at the Meeting were the desire of the Moricetown Indians to have a Residential School built at Moricetown. Many of the Indians voiced their objections to sending their children to the Indian Residential School at Lejac B.C. I suggested a Day School, but they were strongly in favour of a Residential School, stating that a large number of children could be drawn from the Fort Babine, Hagwilget and Moricetown Reserves sufficient to authorize the building of a suitable School.\n\nKnowing that the Rev Father Coccola, Principal of the Lejac Indian Residential School would be in Moricetown on or about the 12th of July 1930, I delayed this Report pending an interview with the Rev Father Coccola.\n\nOn July 12th 1930, I met the Rev Fathers Coccola and Godfrey at Moricetown, and explained to them the desire of the Moricetown Indians regarding a Residential School at Moricetown. The Rev Father Coccola informed me that he had been approached by the Indians on the subject; he stated to me that the proposition would not be feasible at the present time. Father Godfrey agreed with Father Coccola on the matter.\n\nNo doubt a Indian Residential School at Moricetown would be a valuable asset to the Moricetown, Hagwilget and Fort Babine Indians, but the cost of same would be considerable, and I am of opinion there is not sufficient suitable agricultural land, either in the Moricetown Reserve or adjacent for such a purpose.\n\nHagwilget and Fort Babine Indian Reserves have Indian Day Schools, and both are largely attended by the Indian Children.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont\n\nYour obedient servant,\nG.J. Mortimer\nIndian Agent\nDear Sir,\n\nI am sending you the names of the children belonging to the Moricetown Reservation. There is One Hundred and twenty five names down on the list, up to fifteen years of age. If I were to put all the names of the children up to twenty years, there would be over Two Hundred.\n\nWe need a School in Moricetown for these children; if we try for six years we intend to get a School in Moricetown.\n\nWe want you to tell the Indian Agent (Capt. G.C. Mortimer) what you intend to do, and he will tell us all you say, he will never lie to us, and is a very good man to my people.\n\nWe have only a small Reservation, and we need more ground, because we have too many people for the reservation.\n\nPlease don't take any notice of Father Cocola, we need a school here alright, and will not send the children to Fort Fraser, it is too far, we need to see our children too, once in a while.\n\nWe need medicines very badly in Moricetown.

I note that the Principal of the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School and others do not recommend such an institution. The Department concurs and you may inform those interested that there is no intention of establishing a residential school for these Indians at the present time. Those children that cannot attend the day schools regularly should be recruited for the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nG. G. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazleton, B. C.\nRe Indian Day School at Moricetown Indian Reserve\n\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter received today from David Francis, Chief of the Moricetown Band. Before I pass any comments on an Indian Day School at Moricetown, may I be permitted to draw your attention to the attitude of the Moricetown & Hagwilget Indians towards the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School? They simply refuse to send their children there, and when I asked them to state their reasons, they set forth all kinds of complaints etc., many of them very unreasonable.\n\nDealing with the matter regarding an Indian Day School at Moricetown, I have made careful inquiries re same, and am firmly of opinion that the Rev Fathers Coccolia and Godfrey are doing their best under the circumstances. I find there are in the neighborhood of twenty children in and around Moricetown of school age who would benefit by an Indian Day School at that point.\n\nBoth Fathers Coccolia and Godfrey object to any Indian Day School at Moricetown, stating that the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School is for that purpose, and therefore the Hagwilget Indian Children must go there.\n\nI feel that this matter requires careful consideration and tact; I therefore kindly solicit your advice in the matter.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nG.C. Mortimer\nIndian Agent\nKamloops, B.C., Sept. 23, 1930.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith my report upon the Babine Agency.\n\nGeneral:\n\nIn connection with school matters, Mr. Mortimer informs me that there are about 40 children at Old Fort Babine (Nedoots 11 and 13) and adjoining Reserves, at Halifax (Todinlay 15, etc.) that should be in school. There is no room at Le Jac (Fraser Lake School) and I expect that this school will have to be added to. I was also spoken to by the Anglican Missionary at Hazelton about a residential school there. A school for Protestant children is being asked for on the Northern Coast. This has, I understand been already mooted, but the choice of its locality seems a somewhat controversial point. Personally I think Prince Rupert, owing to its central position, easy transportation access, power on the spot also water. Of course, some distance out of Prince Rupert along the road where these things are. However, against this is the fact that there would be no farming attached though where that could be procured other than Hazelton, I do not know.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, October 2, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your Ml3-5. 247 of the 23rd ultimo, regarding an Indian day school at Moricetown. I note that the parents object to sending their children any distance for residential school facilities and that there are twenty children who would be able to attend a day school. Do you believe that the parents would see that the children attended regularly if a day school was established?\n\nIn connection with the proposed day school, I note you say that Fathers Coccola and Godfrey are doing their best under the circumstances. Therefore, I am at a loss to understand your penultimate paragraph, wherein you write that they object to the proposal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B. C.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No 151-0-1 dated October 2nd 1930, I respectfully beg to state that on October 17th I attended another meeting of the Moricetown Indians, at an Indian Day School at that point.\n\nI must say that the Moricetown Indians are very anxious to get an Indian Day School; at the meeting about fifteen children of school age accompanied by their parents were in attendance, not one of these children ever attended a school, and their ages ran from six to seventeen years of age. I have only the word of David Tyee the Chief and members of the band, that from fifteen to twenty children would attend such school.\n\nPrevious to the meeting I had an interview with the Rev Father Godfrey and asked him to attend the meeting with me, this he promised to do, but when the meeting was called through some reason Father Godfrey was unable to do so.\n\nRegarding Para-2 of my letter to you No MI-5-247 dated September 23rd 1930, what I mean to infer is, that both Fathers Coccola and Godfrey are doing their best to get the Moricetown Indians to send their children to the Fraser Lake Residential School. I have no hesitation in saying that both Fathers Coccola and Godfrey strongly object to an Indian Day School at Moricetown.\n\nFrom personal observations I am of opinion that an Indian Day School would be an asset to the Moricetown Reserve, since taking over the Babine Agency a very friendly feeling has existed between Fathers Coccola & Godfrey and myself, on several occasions I have received friendly advice from both those gentlemen on affairs pertaining to the Indians of the Babine Lake Reserves, and therefore would that the Department of Indian Affairs should guide me in dealing with this matter.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nG.C.

I may say that the Department intends to give careful consideration to the educational needs of this part of the Babine agency, before extending the educational facilities.

Attached to their signatures is a list of the supposed children who are of School age; I am not in a position to ascertain whether the figures given are true; Father Dream, the missionary in charge, tells me that the children of School age at Moricetown would be around 30, if all were present.\n\nI mentioned the said petition to Inspector Barry of Victoria upon his last visit here some two weeks ago; he said that he would be willing to investigate the conditions of the Indians of Moricetown regarding a proposed day School, provided he would get instructions to that effect from the Department.\n\nI beg your Department, therefore, to take the demand of these Indians into consideration, especially in view of the fact that a day school at Moricetown would not interfere with our work at Lejac; so far very few children from that district have come to our boarding School, and the reserves surrounding Lejac can amply provide the Residential School here with the amount of children we are allowed to receive.\n\nI am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop J.

MacInnes, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nINSPECTOR'S SURVEY REPORT ON MORICETOWN INDIAN VILLAGE\n\nRoman Catholic Church Babine Agency\n\nPurpose of Survey:\n\nThis survey was undertaken, on the instructions of the Indian Affairs Branch, with a view to determine the necessity for the establishment of an Indian Day School at Moricetown, and if such a school should be found to be necessary to locate a proper site for the proposed school.\n\nState of Survey:\n\nOn May 22nd 1937, accompanied by the Acting Indian Agent of the Babine Agency, Mr. Mallinson, I made a very thorough inspection of the Moricetown Indian Village. Many of the Indians were interviewed and an inspection made of the larger houses.\n\nMap:\n\nA very rough sketch map or plan of the village was made, and from this the attached ROUGH SKETCH MAP was drawn. No map was available which could copy and the work had to be done on the spot in a few minutes. I must ask the kind consideration of all the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch who may read this report, for it is a very rough map indeed which is attached and it is only forwarded in the belief that any map is better than no map.\n\nAttitude of Indians:\n\nThe Indians of Moricetown were not all seen as quite a number were away from the village. The twenty or so seen were all very emphatic in their requests for an Indian Day School. They told me that they had asked for several years for a school, and in answer to my question told me that certainly they would send their children to school regularly.\n\nWere a school to be erected here, and the local Indians given some of the work under the direct supervision of a \"white\" carpenter, they would get in logs if necessary and work well, I am certain.\n\nThe Indians were very respectful and well mannered. They quite understood that I could not promise them a school, and were satisfied when I told them before leaving that I should certainly recommend the establishment of a school in Moricetown, but that I did not believe there were sufficient funds to build a school at present. I told them that the numbers attending would decide the question of whether a school should be built later. There are a number of HALLS available and the Indians all seemed anxious to have one or another of these selected. I was led to understand that the necessary work would be done, on the one selected, by the owner and the actual building rented to the Indian Affairs Branch in a state of good repair. I did not of course promise that any building would be rented.\n\nThe general attitude of the Indians was far better than in many of the villages where we have had a school for years. Mr. Mallinson did most of the actual talking to the Indians, but I talked to them myself to make perfectly certain that they did in fact want a school very badly. The children whom I saw said they wanted to come to school. Only one or two had been at any school ever. I saw one child from Le Jac.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6420, file 861-1, part 1)\nNumbers of Children Available:\n\nThe Acting Indian Agent, Mr. McMillinon, at my request has been good enough to prepare several pages of detailed information as to the actual children available and their ages, the names and ages of those children who are at present under school age but who would of course later be available. These pages are now incorporated in my report for the information of the Director of Welfare and Training.\n\nNames of parents are given, and when necessary the distances from the building which I suggest should be used as a school to the child's home is also given.\n\nIt will be seen that there are a large number of children of school age available for school now, and quite a number of children of under school age who will replace those leaving at the age of fifteen or sixteen years.\n\nWhat is much more important is the fact that if the school be located in Moricetown a number of Indians at present living in other villages, Smithers, Telkwa, etc., are said to be determined to return to Moricetown.\n\nSmithers, Telkwa, etc., are small towns and not Indian villages, and it will be to the advantage of the Indians to get them back on the Indian reserves.\n\nThere are a number of Indians living at TWO MILE, which is, as the name would imply, just about two miles north of Moricetown. These Indians still have their children walk daily to Moricetown to attend school. A school located near the mile post on the Hazelton to Smithers road which reads Hazelton 28 miles Smithers 31 miles might be considered the central point. It would be at a point a little to the north of my sketch map. It should be remembered that it is quite possible that some children will walk from Hudson Bay a place about three miles south east of Moricetown, and this has been taken into consideration in locating the best place for an Indian school.\n\nWhile the numbers given to me by Mr. McMillinon are accurate and may be relied on by the Indian Affairs Branch I certainly consider that the proposed school should be furnished with equipment for at least forty children. This will be necessary to take care of the children returning from the towns mentioned above in addition to those now living on the local Indian Reserves.\n\nPart of the time given to the survey was taken up in checking the names and ages of the Indian children, so that the attached lists might be as complete as possible.\n\nI would therefore recommend that an Indian Day School to accommodate at least forty children of ages from six years to sixteen be established at Moricetown to open on September 1st 1937.\nBuildings:\n\nThere are a number of Halls as they are called available. I do not recommend the building of an Indian school at the present time.\n\nIt is possible that later on a large Day School with accommodation on one end for a teachers' residence may be necessary, but at present this is not so, and a rented building will be most satisfactory here.\n\nThere are three Halls available. These are marked \"A\", \"B\" and \"D\" on the attached map.\n\nThere are also three possible places where a teacher might live. These are marked \"E\", \"F\" and \"G\" on the map.\n\n\"B\" Hall\n\nThis Hall belongs to Peter Michell (Indian). It was built in 1923. It is of frame construction. The logs on which it rests are set on concrete blocks. The outside is F. and G. weather boarding. While the floor is satisfactory, the upstairs is not finished and the whole of the inside needs to be lined. The construction is not very good. The location is not a good one for a school as there are houses quite near and there is no available space for a playground. The building is about 36 feet by 21 feet. I do not consider that this building is in any way suitable as a school.\n\n\"D\" Hall\n\nThis Hall together with the house marked \"E\" might do well enough for a school and a teacher's home. They are located in about two acres of partly cleared land fronting on the main road, which is not a good point.\n\nThe Hall is of log construction supported on cedar posts and logs. It is about 36 feet by 24 feet. It is not lined. It has a ship lap floor. The upstairs is not yet finished and there is no stairway at present.\n\nMuch work would be necessary on this building but the owner says he is willing to finish it if it were chosen as the school. It was built in 1934.\n\nThe location is in a place which could make a playground if it were fenced from the main road. The owner is Arthur Michell and this man is quite equal to carrying out his promises. He is an Indian who works in the supplying of poles to some of Mr. Hanson's camps, and is quite well off. He tells me that he would put up a fence and make this and the house marked \"E\" suitable for a school and teacher's home.\n\nHe told me he would want a rent of $12.00 a month for the two places and the surrounding ground, and he split this into $8.00 for the Hall and $4.00 for the little frame house \"E\".\n\nThe house \"E\" has a room downstairs and one upstairs. It is not very well constructed of ship lap. The windows do not fit. It is 15 feet by 25 feet and is the poorest of the three places located as possible teacher's residences. The location near the Church and Priest's house is good. There is back part of the cleared land around the Hall \"D\" is said to flood in the Spring. It lies low. The cars passing on the main road make this a dusty place.\n\nI do not think the Hall \"D\" and the house \"E\" should be chosen for a school and teacher's residence unless we could not obtain any other place at a suitable rent.\nBuildings Continued:\n\n\"A\" Hall. This Hall is the property of Tyee Lake David who lives at Telkwa. It is of frame construction with rough weather boarding outside and cedar ship lap lining inside. It has a good floor at present used as a dance hall. The upstairs is poor and has a lot of old beds and mattresses etc., in it now.\n\nThe building is about 35 feet by 25 feet. The supports of the upstairs are too weak and some three strong uprights should be placed to take the weight of the central beam. There are six windows, two on each of three sides. This is a poor plan but might do for the present.\n\nThe location is splendid as may be seen from the sketch map attached.\n\nThis building is on rather higher land than the remainder of the village. It is located in about an acre away from the rest of the village and is surrounded by short grass and a few small trees. This would make a very nice little playground.\n\nThere is a well at the back of the building. I found it to be dry, or at least with some snow in it. It seemed about 20 feet deep and about 4\u00bd wide. It is said to go to rock.\n\nNear this \"A\" Hall there is a small one room log cottage marked \"C\" on the map. It belongs to David Dennis who does not live there, and would I believe rent it. The little house is very well built and would be warm. It is about 16 feet by 24 feet. It would be worth about $4.00 a month for the twelve months of the year.\n\nIt is well located from a healthful point of view and near the \"A\" Hall which I certainly think would make a good school house.\n\nThe \"A\" Hall would be worth around $12.00 per month for the twelve months of the year.\n\nThe remaining possible teacher's cottage is that marked \"F\" and belongs to Tom Michell. It is nearly half a mile from the \"A\" Hall, is about 15 feet by 16 feet, and is built of logs with an upstairs room.\n\nThis \"F\" cottage is fairly well built and would suit a married couple.\n\nRecommendation on Buildings:\n\nI would recommend that the \"A\" Hall and the \"C\" cottage be rented if the sums asked are not greatly in excess of the valuation I have made above, the \"A\" Hall to be converted into the proposed Moricetown Indian Day School and the \"C\" Cottage used by the teacher if single.\n\nEquipment:\n\nI shall be very glad to help the Acting Indian Agent with a list of necessary equipment should the Indian Affairs Branch decide to establish this school as recommended. At least forty SINGLE CROWN SCHOOL DESKS will be required, Asbestoslate Boards and a teacher's Table and Chair. I do not consider it necessary to list here such things as a simple flag pole and Union Jack which are most necessary in any Indian school. On request from Ottawa I shall do my best to help the local Indian Agent in the establishment of this school.\n| Name of Parent | School Age | Remarks |\n|---------------|------------|---------|\n| Caroline L.

Many of the Indians were interviewed and an inspection made of the larger houses.\n\nMap:\n\nA very rough sketch map or plan of the village was made, and from this the attached ROUGH SKETCH MAP was drawn. No map was available which I could copy and the work had to be done on the ground in a few minutes. I must ask the kind consideration of all the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch who may read this report, for it is a very rough map indeed which is attached and it is only forwarded in the belief that any map is better than no map.\n\nAttitude of Indians:\n\nThe Indians of Moricetown were not all seen as quite a number were away from the village. The twenty or so seen were all very emphatic in their requests for an Indian Day School. They told me that they had asked for several years for a school, and in answer to my question told me that certainly they would send their children to school regularly. Were a school to be erected here, and the local Indians given some of the work under the direct supervision of a \"White\" carpenter, they would get in logs if necessary and work well, I am certain.\n\nThe Indians were very respectful and well mannered. They quite understood that I could not promise them a school, and were satisfied when I told them before leaving that I should certainly recommend the establishment of a school in Moricetown, but that I did not believe that there were sufficient funds to BUILD a school at present. I told them that the numbers attending would decide the question of whether a school should be built later. There are a number of HALLS available and the Indians all seemed anxious to have one or another of these selected. I was led to understand that the necessary work would be done, on the one selected, by the owner and the actual building rented to the Indian Affairs Branch in a state of good repair. I did not of course promise that any building would be rented.\n\nThe general attitude of the Indians was far better than in many of the villages where we have had a school for years. Mr. Mallinson did most of the actual talking to the Indians, but I talked to them myself to make perfectly certain that they did in fact want a school very badly. The children whom I saw said they wanted to come to school. Only one or two had been at any school ever. I saw one child from Le Jac.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6420, file 861-1, part 1)\nNumbers of Children Available:\n\nThe Acting Indian Agent, Mr. Mallinson, at my request has been good enough to prepare several pages of detailed information as to the actual children available and their ages, the names and ages of those children who are at present under school age but who would of course later be available. These pages are now incorporated in my report for the information of the Director of Welfare and Training.\n\nNames of parents are given, and when necessary the distance from the building which I suggest should be used as a school to the child's home is also given.\n\nIt will be seen that there are a large number of children of school age available for school now, and quite a number of children of under school age who will replace those leaving at the age of fifteen or sixteen years.\n\nWhat is much more important is the fact that if the school be located in Moricetown a number of Indians at present living in other villages, Smithers, Telkwa, Etc., are said to be determined to return to Moricetown.\n\nSmithers, Telkwa, Etc., are small towns and not Indian villages, and it will be to the advantage of the Indians to get them back on the Indian Reserves.\n\nThere are a number of Indians living at TWO MILE, which is, as the name would imply, just about two miles north of Moricetown. These Indians will have their children walk daily to Moricetown to attend school. A school located near the mile post on the Hazelton to Smithers road which reads Hazelton 28 miles Smithers 21 miles might be considered the central point. It would be at a point a little to the north of my sketch map. It should be remembered that it is quite possible that some children will walk from Hudsons Bay a place about three miles south east of Moricetown, and this has been taken into consideration in locating the best place for an Indian school.\n\nWhile the numbers given to me by Mr. Mallinson are accurate and may be relied on by the Indian Affairs Branch I certainly consider that the proposed school should be furnished with equipment for at least forty children. This will be necessary to take care of the children returning from the towns mentioned above in addition to those now living on the local Indian Reserves.\n\nPart of the time given to the survey was taken up in checking the names and ages of the Indian children, so that the attached lists might be as complete as possible.\n\nI would therefore recommend that an Indian Day School to accommodate at least forty children of ages from six years to sixteen be established at Moricetown to open on September 1st 1937.\nBuildings:\n\nThere are a number of Halls as they are called available. I do not recommend the building of an Indian school at the present time.\n\nIt is possible that later on a large Day School with accommodation on one end for a teachers' residence may be necessary, but at present this is not so, and a rented building will be most satisfactory here.\n\nThere are three Halls available. These are marked \"A\" \"B\" and \"D\" on the attached map.\n\nThere are also three possible places where a teacher might live. These are marked \"C\" \"E\" and \"F\" on the map.\n\n\"B\" Hall This Hall belongs to Peter Michell (Indian) It was built in 1929. It is of frame construction. The logs on which it rests are set on concrete blocks. The outside is T. and G. weather boarding. While the floor is satisfactory, the upstairs is not finished and the whole of the inside needs to be lined. The construction is not very good. The location is not a good one for a school as there are houses quite near and there is no available space for a playground. The building is about 36 feet by 21 feet. I do not consider that this building is in any way suitable as a school.\n\n\"D\" Hall This Hall together with the house marked \"E\" might do well enough for a school and a teacher's home. They are located in about two acres of partly cleared land, fronting on the main road, which is not a good point. The Hall is of log construction supported on cedar cedar posts and logs. It is about 36 feet by 24 feet. It is not lined. It has a ship lap floor. The upstairs is not yet finished and there is no stairway at present. Much work would be necessary on this building but the owner says he is willing to finish it if it were chosen as the school. It was built in 1928. The location is in a space which would make a playground if it were fenced from the main road. The owner is Arthur Michell and this man is quite equal to carrying out his promises. He is an Indian who works in the supplying of poles to some of Mr. Hanson's camps, and is quite well off. He tells me that he would put up a fence and make this and the house marked \"E\" suitable for a school and teacher's home. He told me he would want a rent of $12.00 a month for the two places and the surrounding ground, and he split this into $8.00 for the Hall and $4.00 for the little frame house \"E\".\n\nThe house \"E\" has a room downstairs and one upstairs. It is not very well constructed of ship lap. The windows do not fit. It is 15 feet by 25 feet and is the poorest of the three places located as possible teacher's residences. The location near the Church and Priest's house is good. The back part of the cleared land around the Hall \"D\" is said to flood in the Spring. It lies low. The cars passing on the main road make this a dusty place.\n\nI do not think the Hall \"D\" and the house \"E\" should be chosen for a school and teacher's residence unless we could not obtain any other place at a suitable rent.\nBuildings Continued:\n\n\"A\" Hall. This Hall is the property of Tyee Lake David who lives at Telkwa. It is of frame construction with rough weather boarding outside and cedar ship lap lining inside. It has a good floor at present used as a Dance Hall. The upstairs is poor and has a lot of old beds and mattresses, etc., in it now.\n\nThe building is about 35 feet by 25 feet. The supports of the upstairs are too weak and some three strong uprights should be placed to take the weight of the central beam. There are six windows, two on each of three sides.

It is nearly half a mile from the \"A\" Hall, is about 15 feet by 18 feet, and is built of logs with an upstairs room. This \"F\" cottage is fairly well built and would suit a married couple.\n\nRecommendation on Buildings:\n\nI would recommend that the \"A\" Hall and the \"C\" cottage be rented if the sums asked are not greatly in excess of the valuation I have made above the \"A\" Hall to be converted into the proposed Moricetown Indian Day School and the \"C\" Cottage used by the teacher if single.\n\nEquipment:\n\nI shall be very glad to help the Acting Indian Agent with a list of necessary equipment should the Indian Affairs Branch decide to establish this school as recommended. At least forty SINGLE CROWN SCHOOL DESKS will be required, Asbestoslate Boards and a teacher's Table and Chair. I do not consider it necessary to list here such things as a simple flag pole and Union Jack which are most necessary in any Indian school. On request from Ottawa, I shall do my best to help the local Indian Agent in the establishment of this school.\n| Name of Parent | Name and Age of Child Under School Age | Distance from School | Remarks |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|---------|\n| Kathleen Wilbou | Adam Louis 9 | Village | |\n| Josephine Charley | Alfred Charley 15 | Two Miles | |\n| Mary Michell | Bonnie Michell 12 | Two Miles | |\n| Lucy Nabe | Agatha Jeanie 8 | Two Miles | |\n| Elizabeth (by adoption) | Thomas Naziel 10 | Two Miles | |\n| Dick Maziel | Allan Raymond 5 | Two Miles | |\n| Alfred Namox | Baptiste Namox 13 | Village | |\n| Amelia Dennis | Dora Dennis 9 | Village | |\n| Magdalene Morris Dennis (now Mrs. David Dennis) | Leonard Norris 5 | Village | |\n\nTotal: 11\n| Name of Parent | School Age | Age of Child | Distance from School | Remarks |\n|---------------|------------|--------------|----------------------|---------|\n| Mary Kayget William | 13 | 7 | Two Miles | Village or Hudson Bay Ranch |\n| Gabriel Louis | 14 | 9 | Three Miles | Two Miles |\n| Josephine Michell | 14 | 2 | Two Miles | Village |\n| Esther Michell | 14 | 2 | Two Miles | Village |\n| Albert Tilljoe | 14 | 1 | Two Miles | Village |\n| Peter Bazil | 14 | 1 | Two Miles | Village |\n| Tommy J.

I was told by them that they left that to the Roman Catholic Church and the Inspector.\n\nMay I recommend in closing that a very experienced teacher be chosen for this new school, if it is decided to establish one here. Again I may say that I shall be glad to assist in the selection of the best candidate from several suggested by the Catholic Church authorities, or in any other way that the Indian Affairs Branch may require. I am anxious that no young man with little experience or without a B.C. Certificate be selected as teacher.\n\nThe Indian parents and children are alike eager for a school, and any mistake in the selection of the first teacher here would ruin the good feeling now being shown in the village.\n\nIt should be remembered that we have a Field Matron, Mrs Edith Maclean on this Indian Reserve. Mrs. Maclean lives some miles away from Moricetown. She tells me that the Indian parents are buying new clothes for their children in anticipation of there being a school at Moricetown in September.\n\nHazelton, B.C.\nMay 24, 1937.\n\nGerald H.

A very rough sketch map is attached to make parts of my report clear to the Indian Affairs Branch. This, I am afraid, is a very rough map indeed, but it is the best I could do with the few materials at hand.\n\nThe whole report is made at the request of the Indian Affairs Branch in Ottawa. I do not appear to have the number of the letter of instruction here, and I would ask to quote it when forwarding my report to Ottawa.\n\nIn gathering material and facts for the report I was helped greatly by the Acting Indian Agent, Mr. Mallinson, who accompanied me to Moricetown on May 22nd last. Transportation was provided by the R.C.M.P. stationed in Hazelton.\n\nI have no hesitation in recommending the establishment of an Indian Day School at Moricetown, and would recommend that if the necessary funds can be found the school be opened next September.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

This report was made at the request of the Department.\n\nIt will be noted Capt. Barry does not recommend the construction of a new school at this time at Moricetown, but that a Day School be established to open on September 1st of this year and that the available accommodation marked A and C on the accompanying sketch be approved to be used for the school and teacher's residence, respectively. From the description given by Inspector Barry on the present condition of the hall marked \"A\", some improvements of an inexpensive character should be made prior to the opening of the school, among them, additional uprights to support the upstairs section of the building. It may also be necessary to make some minor repairs to the doors and windows. The floors would appear to be in good condition.\n\nThere is evidently real need for an Indian Day School at Moricetown, and I am convinced it would be a definite step forward to approve of the recommendations made by Capt. Barry in this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M.

Minister of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Canada.\n\nHonorable Sir\n\nApplication has been made to your Department through your Babine Agency at Hazelton B.C. and I write direct to you to acquaint you of conditions in this connection.\n\nDuring 1935, the Natives of Moricetown requested through their spiritual advisor the establishment of a school on this reserve. Their request was made known to Capt. Mortimer, agent at above agency. Capt. Mortimer requested a survey be made towards ascertaining number of pupils who would attend proposed school. Survey disclosed 35 pupils between ages of 7 and 16 years, and Capt. Mortimer advised in detail as to their names and ages.\n\nDuring May 1937, Inspector of Indian Schools, Capt. Barry visited Moricetown looking over available place suitable for purpose.\n\nIn requesting your Department, Honorable Sir, for establishment of a school here, I as chief of Moricetown Reserve deem this an absolute necessity.\n\nI am, Honorable Sir, yours respectfully,\n\nChief JACK JOSEPH\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This request was renewed this year and Inspector Barry was instructed to make a survey of the situation.\n\nUnder cover of a letter dated June 8th, 1937, Commissioner McKay forwards Mr. Barry's report. This shows that there are approximately seventy (70) children of school age, none of whom have had the advantage of any education. The Indians themselves are extremely anxious for the establishment of a school.\n\nInspector Barry strongly recommends that a school be opened on September 1st and Indian Commissioner McKay concurs in this recommendation.\n\nIt will not be necessary to erect a building, as a vacant hall on the reserve can be rented at a very reasonable cost.\n\nThe funds required for incidental expenses in connection with the establishment of the school and paying rent, etc., and for the salary of the teacher, can be provided from the Appropriation for Indian Education. I feel that a school should be opened at Moricetown and would appreciate having your concurrence.

Hence, I have had some correspondence with Mr. McKay, Commissioner at Vancouver, in connection with the appointment of a teacher, but so far no substantial headway has been made in the matter. Some confusion has arisen from the fact the first teacher appointed resigned in favour of her brother who was refused, it seems, by Capt. Barry. On hearing that her brother would not succeed her, the girl appointed, Miss Bernice Sargent, now insists in holding the position herself. That is as far as we have gone in that affair.

Certain items have been deleted from this list which can be purchased locally by the Agent.\n\nActing Agent Mallinson has been instructed to make the necessary arrangements regarding the renting of, and repairs to, the buildings to be used as a schoolroom and teacher's residence, and also to purchase certain items of equipment for the school and teacher's quarters which should be available locally at reasonable prices.\n\nThe Acting Agent has also been advised to inform Miss Sargent of her appointment, and in case she does not accept the position to communicate immediately with the Right Rev. Bishop Bunoz and so inform him, and request His Grace to nominate a teacher having the necessary qualifications.\n\nWhen a teacher has been found and the school established, it may be that some additional articles ought to be provided.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nAugust 24, 1939.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn the authority contained in the second paragraph of Departmental letter 151-22-1 of the 18th instant I have accepted as teacher of the Moricetown Indian day school for the academic year 1939-40 Mr. George W. Cleveland, nominated by His Excellency Bishop Bunoz, O.M.I.\n\nMr. Cleveland's qualifications were set out in a letter from Inspector Barry dated August 3rd forwarded to you with my 15/1/727 of August 4th.\n\nIn brief he is a married man and aged 29. He has not had Normal School training but states that he passed the Ontario Senior Matriculation and taught manual training to unemployed youths in Manitoba. He is a Catholic and is willing to follow the advice of our Inspector of Schools. Mr. Cleveland has stated his willingness to take Provincial Summer School or Normal School courses later as advised by Captain Barry.\n\nWhile our Inspector of Schools is willing to recommend the appointment of Mr. Cleveland as teacher of the Moricetown Indian day school, he considers that as this man has no Normal School training he should be appointed for only one year in the first instance, and with this viewpoint I am in agreement.\n\nThe last teacher at Moricetown, Miss Sargent, was paid at the rate of $100.00 per teaching month though she had no particular qualifications for this work. The school is in a rather out of the way place and there is no furniture in the addition to the Indian hall, rented as a school, which is being used as a teacher's residence. Under the circumstances, and as it may be necessary for Mr. Cleveland to make arrangements for renting another house to accommodate his wife and children, I do not consider the above mentioned salary excessive.\n\nI should be glad to have the Department's confirmation of the action taken in due course, but as the time is so short Mr. Cleveland is being instructed to open school at Moricetown at the beginning of the academic year. He has been supplied with a copy of questionnaire C150-52. A copy of this letter has also been forwarded to His Excellency Bishop Bunoz md to the acting Indian Agent at Hazelton.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\n15/1/727\n\nOttawa, August 18, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 4th instant and also copies of correspondence received by you from Acting Indian Agent Mallinson, enclosed therewith.\n\nIn view of the limited time at our disposal prior to the opening of the school year, the teachers that may be nominated by Bishop Bunoz and approved by Inspector Barry will be acceptable to the Department. You might notify us of the appointments as soon as they are made and request the teachers to fill in and forward the attached questionnaires.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A.

C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith copies of correspondence received from Acting Indian Agent Mallinson, of the Babine Agency, enclosing resignation of Miss Orrice B. Sargent as teacher of the Moricetown Indian Day School. It will be observed that, in view of the late date of this resignation, Mr. Mallinson took up the matter of nomination of a new teacher direct with the Rt. Rev. Bishop Bunoz, whose letter of July 30th on this subject is enclosed.\n\nI am writing to His Excellency Bishop Bunoz giving him information regarding a married man suggested by Capt. Barry as a possible candidate for the Moricetown vacancy.\n\nAs no suitable candidates are available here for the Old Fort Babine Indian Day School, I agree with Inspector Barry that, under the circumstances, there would not appear to be any objection to the appointment of a married male teacher holding an Alberta certificate, at that point.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Mackay\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major,\n\nI am advised by Mr. S. Mallinson, acting Indian Agent at Hazelton that Miss Orrice B. Sargent has resigned from the position of teacher at Moricetown, and moreover I am quite certain that Miss Hughes will have to retire from the Old Fort School. That makes two vacancies which must be filled with good timber.\n\nPerhaps Capt. G. Barry School Superintendent of Indian Schools may have a list of applicants. If so I'll gladly accept them provided they are really recommendable for the places to which they are supposed to go. If not I think I could get good teachers from the Northwest provided the teachers certificates obtained in the Prairie Provinces are accepted in B.C. I have a married man not far away, of English descent who would accept Old Fort school, but his certificate is from Alberta. I would be glad to be advised as to the value of such certificates.\n\nWith best wishes I am\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"E. M.

Sargent tendering her resignation as teacher of the Moricetown Indian Day School.\n\nFor your information I may mention that the Indians of the Moricetown Band are Roman Catholics.\n\nAs there is none too much time before school opens in which to fill this position, I have taken the liberty of writing the Rt.

Kindly accept this as my resignation.\n\nMay I take this opportunity to thank all of the members of the Department of Indian Affairs, with whom I have had contact in my work, for their courtesy and cooperation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Mrs) Orrie B. Sargent.\nDear Bishop Bunoz,\n\nre - Teacher for the Moricetown Indian Day School\n\nI wish to advise you that Miss Orrice B. Sargent has resigned from the position as teacher of the Moricetown Indian Day School.\n\nAs time is short in which a successor can be nominated and appointment made by the Department, may I ask if you will kindly communicate with Major D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., P. O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C., and advise him whether you have a nominee or not?\n\nFor your guidance I wish to mention that the Department insists that all teachers to Indian Day Schools must hold full academic and professional certificates and that no candidate will be considered who does not possess such qualifications.\n\nYour early attention to this matter will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"S.

MacKay:\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have read the correspondence to date with regard to the Indian day schools at Moricetown and Old Fort Babine, in the Babine Agency, and the letters from His Excellency Bishop Bunoz, O.M.I. in connection with these schools.\n\nThis morning I visited the officials of the Catholic Church here in Vancouver in an attempt to discover any suitable Catholic candidates with B.C. certificates for the above mentioned schools. I have also had interviews with two or three teachers.\n\nIn general I may say that there exists a very great shortage of teachers with good qualifications, so that male teachers with B.C. certificates are almost impossible to find. For the above named schools we need married teachers and I am quite unable to find any married Catholic with a B.C. certificate.\n\nIn the case of the Moricetown vacancy I wish to put forward for the information of His Excellency Bishop Bunoz the below mentioned candidate:\n\nGEORGE W. CLEVELAND - Age 29, Married Mary (Crawford) age 26; the two children are 5 and 2 years of age. Mr. Cleveland has Senior Matriculation standing in Ontario. He has taught Manual Training to unemployed Manitoba youths. His wife is a teacher of music. Mr. Cleveland is in good health and has a very good personality. He much wishes to be a teacher and would later when he has earned a little money take courses at the Provincial Summer school and Normal school. He is willing to do what he is told and to follow my suggestions. I consider him a much better candidate than even the last teacher at Moricetown on whose work I reported favourably.\n\nMr. Cleveland is of course a Catholic and is recommended by the Catholic Church authorities of the Archdiocese of Vancouver. I have instructed him to write direct to His Excellency Bishop Bunoz in the hope that the Bishop might give him the Moricetown nomination. I am prepared to recommend Mr. Cleveland for such a position, and should he obtain the Bishop's nomination and the Department's appointment I shall give him several hours' instruction in this office previous to his departure for the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry.\n\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nre- Resignation of Moricetown Indian Day School Teacher.\n\nI enclose herewith a letter received from Miss C.E. Finan, together with copy of same, tendering her resignation as teacher of the Moricetown Indian Day School.\n\nAlthough Miss Finan does not say so in her letter, in a conversation with me she informed me that she would prefer to leave her contributions to the retirement fund with the Department for the present.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nS.

As Mr. Thistle, the father of the three children in question, is willing to pay any necessary fees for their education in the Moricetown Indian Day School, and,\n\n2. In such a small community as Moricetown, which is almost wholly Indian, the good will of the Canadian National Railway foreman might be a distinct advantage to the Indians, and,\n\n3.

I taught school (mostly graded) also separate in Ontario, Saskatchewan but mostly in Manitoba for about thirty (30) years, starting in the East whilst very young. I am at present over fifty (50) years of age and have never for long been off duty. My health is also perfectly good. I might add I completed a commercial course some considerable time ago. However, as you are doubtless aware, it would be necessary to have my certificates adjusted to British Columbia as I did for Manitoba and Saskatchewan. I will be pleased to furnish any further information required. I might say I have taught here in the west, both under my maiden name and my present name. My maiden name being Sadie Ann Doran.\n\nSo now as it is almost mail time I will close but trusting to hear from you in the near future.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSgd. Mrs. S.A.

She does not live with her husband and that a few years ago she applied for the school of Moricetown and that her application was not accepted because of her too quick temper; although clever and devoted in her work;\n\nI believe myself that Mrs. Chapman will do well but should your Department require absolutely a qualified teacher I would accept Mrs. Culton despite what is said above or again I would nominate Mrs. S.A.

We are renting these buildings at a cost of $12.00 a month from an Indian and, as the school on the Moricetown Reserve has now been operated for some five years and is apparently quite popular with the Indians, it would appear desirable to provide a new school at this point as soon as conditions will permit. In the meantime you might make some inquiries and advise me if a small amount of money expended now would make both the school and the teacher's residence more habitable.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nApril 3, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. Mackay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo enclosing T.D. 1 form and cost-of-living bonus form from Mrs. S.A. Amyot, teacher of the Moricetown Indian Day School.\n\nI am at a loss to understand where you obtained the information that there is only a deduction of 4\u00bd% from teachers' salaries for the retirement fund and an additional 1\u00bd% deduction for the unemployment insurance fund. We have never made any deductions from teachers' salaries for unemployment insurance and since April 1, 1940, we have been deducting 5% monthly from each teacher's salary for the retirement fund. As you are aware, this amount, plus interest, is returned to the teacher when leaving our employ.\n\nThe amount of $3.34 deducted from Mrs. Amyot's salary for retirement fund for the month of December was on the basis of 5% but the total deducted only amounted to $3.34 due to the fact that she was only employed for part of the month. For your information I might add that the deduction for the retirement fund is only made from the basic salary and, as Mrs. Amyot's monthly salary is $90.00, an amount of $4.50 a month has been deducted since January 1.\n\nAs you state in the second paragraph of your letter, if Mrs. Amyot's income did not exceed the non-taxable amount for 1942 she is entitled to apply for a refund. I enclose the necessary forms for this purpose which should be completed in quadruplicate.

Amyot.\n\nContrary to the information contained in the P.S. of your letter of March 2, it would appear, from an examination of the stub of Mrs. Amyot's December salary cheque, that a deduction of 5% was made from her salary for the retirement fund, and no deduction for Unemployment Insurance. The amount of $2.67 as shown on Mrs. Amyot's T.D. 1 form when previously submitted was 4% of the salary she received for the period of her employment from December 9 to 31. This has now been corrected in accordance with her December cheque stub, as follows:\n\n| Dec. Salary | Ret.

This building, which measures 31'6\" by 18', would need to be lined and insulated, partitioned off into rooms, and would also require a finished floor. The owner of the building, Mr. David, is the same man that owns the building at present used by the Department for a school, and he informs me that, should the Department be willing to finish this house in a manner suitable for a teacher's residence, he would be agreeable to the Department having the use of the house rent free, until the amount of the accumulated rent at the rate of $7.50 per month equaled the expenditure made by the Department for material and labour.

Mallinson,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nReplying to your letter of the 30th instant, file 151-221, regarding conditions of the Moricetown Indian Day School and the teacher's residence, I would advise that I took this matter up with Mr. Indian Agent Mallinson and enclose herewith his report of the 5th instant from which it will be noted that to place the small building adjacent to the school in repair suitable for a teacher's residence would cost $278.00 and that the Indian owner is willing to have this work done and rental of $7.50 per month credited to the cost of these repairs. By the time the amount deducted balances the expenditure it may be possible that the Department would be able to construct a school on the Reserve and provide quarters in the building for the teacher.\n\nMr. Mallinson also estimates the cost of improving the interior of the school building as $44.25, making a total of $323.05 for repairs to the residence and school building.\n\nIf funds can be found for this purpose, I would recommend approval of the application as the living quarters provided for the teacher in this school are very poor indeed.\n\nFor D.M.

It is noted that this amounts to $278.80 and that the cost of kalsomining the interior of the school is not likely to exceed $44.00.\n\nIn view of the condition of these buildings and the reports of the Public School Inspector thereon, you are authorized to proceed with this work at the earliest possible date. It is noted that the Indian owner of the home will permit us to use this building without cost, on the understanding that the rental of $7.50 per month will be credited to the cost of the repairs made to the building by this Department.\n\nR.A.

McKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWhile at Moricetown recently I found that the lean-to roof at the back of the school and the roofing on the teacherage are in urgent need of repair. The lean-to roof would require new supports and should be jacked up and new joists put under it requiring about 200 linear feet of two by four's. The teacherage requires application of two rolls of roofing paper. I asked Mr. Max Hedman, a carpenter, husband of the school teacher, to submit an estimate on the work. He offers to do the work on a contract basis at $35.00 including supplying material. While we do not own these buildings, the rent we pay for them, $12 a month, is very small. I would therefore recommend that we assume responsibility for these minor repairs.\n\nJ.J. Boys,\nIndian Agent.\nAir Mail\n\nOttawa, March 14th, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O.

Boys, Indian Agent\n\nFORM No. I.A. 413\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6420, file S61-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver,\nB.C.\n\nI enclose herewith a requisition from Mrs. A.C. Buddrus, teacher of the Moricetown Indian Day School who requires cooking utensils and furnishings as listed.\n\nThis Teacherage which we rent from a Moricetown Indian is very poorly furnished and I would recommend favourable consideration of the items requested. A quotation from a Hazelton Store is enclosed. I have inspected the goods upon which the quotation is submitted and consider they are quite satisfactory.\n\nIn order to make it livable this teacherage requires also paper and the ceilings and walls should be given a coat of Casein Paint and the woodwork trim should receive two coats of oilpaint. Materials required for this are 800 feet of Building Paper, 10 packages of Casein Paint and two quarts of white paint. The paints are obtainable locally but the Building Paper is not.\n\nReference to your files will show that upon taking over this building in March, 1944 the Department spent a sum of $364.27 to put it in order. This was to be debited from the rental at the rate of $7.50 per month until fully paid for. From this it will be seen that payment will not have been completed until June, 1948, but I would recommend that we undertake these small additional improvements, particularly because Mr. Buddrus the teacher's husband, a carpenter, is home at present and would willingly do the work without charge.\n\nJ.W. Boys,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJVB/HHC\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6420, file 861-5, part 2)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Boys' letter of February 23rd and requisition for furnishings and cooking utensils for the Moricetown Indian Day School teacherage. The items requested are immediately available locally, with the exception of the spring-filled mattress, at an approximate cost of $125.00 and if the Department has funds available I would recommend that authority be granted for the purchase of these items.\n\nWith respect to the mattress, although one is available locally at a cost of $55.50 it is thought that a suitable mattress can be secured in Vancouver for approximately $30.00 and I would recommend that purchase of this item in Vancouver be authorized.\n\nYou will note also Mr. Boys' reference to the need for redecorating the teacherage. The materials required for this work will cost not more than $30.00 and the necessary labour will be provided by the teacher's husband without charge. I would recommend that these improvements be authorized and if the Department has funds available now we shall endeavour to have the materials purchased and the accounts submitted prior to March 31st.\n\nW.

The total amount expended at that time was $384.27 which will not be paid up until July, 1948.\nThis has been explained to Tyee DAVID on innumerable occasions both verbally and by letter according to our files, but toward the end of each quarter we appear to receive a letter advising us that he is not getting his rental.\n\nJ.W.

The subscriber also agrees to pay all Long Distance charges at regular Tariff rates, together with all other charges, if any, monthly on or before the fifth day of the month succeeding that in which the service is rendered.\n\nThis request becomes a binding contract as soon as accepted by the Government Telegraph and Telephone Service and by furnishing said service, and the terms and conditions on the back hereof are made a part of said contract. Its terms cannot be varied or waived by any representations or promises of any persons, unless the same be in writing and signed by the Superintendent. The subscriber acknowledges that he has a duplicate hereof.\n\nOn behalf of Govt. Tel. and Tel. Service Subscriber.\n\n[OVER.]\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n1. The Government lines and instruments are furnished and maintained for the consideration of service charge made monthly to the subscriber payable in advance at the Government office. Connections at a distance from the Government lines will be subject to a special arrangement, not exceeding cost of installation. Should the location of the instrument be at any time changed at the request of the subscriber, the cost of making such change will be payable by the subscriber. The Government shall have the right to make such holes or other alterations in the walls, floors, ceilings and roofs of the subscriber's premises and to attach such brackets, wires or other appliances as it shall deem necessary or expedient for the purpose of installing and maintaining the said telephone service and shall not be accountable or held liable for any damage caused thereby.\n\n2. If the telephone in a residence is used in whole or in part for the purpose of a business or profession or otherwise than for the usual requirements of a residence, the Government may charge the same rate therefor as that charged for telephones in places of business at the location in question.\n\n3. The Subscriber shall take good care of the instruments and all accessories connected therewith, which are and remain the property of the Government and shall not damage, alter or remove the same or make any attachments thereto or allow them to be damaged, altered or removed or any attachments to be made thereto, and in any case, that any of the said instruments and accessories therewith shall be broken, injured, or damaged, ordinary wear and tear, or damage by fire excepted, the Subscriber agrees to compensate the Government for such breakage, injury, or damage on demand.\n\n4. The Subscriber shall permit the Government, its agents or workmen to have access at all times, to his, her, its premises or every other place under his, her, its control, through or over which its wires pass or apparatus is fixed, and in case the Government desires to inspect or to remove, or in any way deal with or handle its instruments and accessories on the premises of the Subscriber, it shall have the right to enter such premises whether occupied or unoccupied, and if unoccupied, or found to be closed or locked, or if entry be refused by the Subscriber or any occupier of said premises, the wires connected with the building in which the instruments are installed, may be forthwith disconnected (in the interest of the line as a whole) and the Subscriber will have no claim for interruption of service pending its restoration.\n\n5. The Government reserves the right to remove its instruments and accessories from the premises of the Subscriber at any time, on returning the unearned rentals if any, if the Subscriber or any other user makes any improper use of the said instruments and accessories by using foul, abusive or profane language, or by impersonating any other individual over the wires connected with his, her, its instruments or fails to pay the monthly service charge, long distance and other rates accumulated or otherwise fails to comply with the terms of this contract; the Government will not be liable for any damages caused by such removal unless the same are caused by the negligence of the Government servants.\n\n6. The service furnished under this contract is for the exclusive use of the Subscriber, his, her, its employees or members of his, her family, upon his, her, its business and the Subscriber shall not extend the use of this telephone to any other persons nor shall it be used by the Subscriber to transmit messages for any other persons with or without any consideration.\n\n7. The Government will endeavour to furnish as perfect and continuous means of communication between the Subscriber and other Subscribers as possible but will not be liable for any loss or damage that may occur during or through the connection or the failure of any connection of any Subscriber with any of its exchanges or through the employment of any messengers' vehicles or other service.\n\n8. All messages transmitted by the employees of the Government orally by telephone or by messenger will be at the risk of the sender or addressee. The Government will assume no responsibility in respect to such messages and will not be liable for loss or damage by reason of delays, errors, non-delivery or any other cause, and shall not be held liable for interruptions to the service or other annoyances from weather conditions, sleet or snow storms, atmospheric or induction disturbances, or from strikes, accidents or other causes beyond the Government's control.\nThe Moricetown Indian Day School is 20 miles from the nearest settlement at Smithers. On several occasions recently I have received complaints from Mrs. Buddrus, the teacher, regarding the conduct of Indians during night hours. There is no telephone within two miles although the Smithers-Hazelton line goes within 200 feet of the Teachorage. I feel that Mrs. Buddrus would be safer if she were in a position to contact the Police and for this purpose I recommend installation of a telephone at the Teachorage. The installation charge would be $2.50. Additional charges would be $2.30 per month rental plus the toll charges.\n\nThis installation, if permitted, would greatly facilitate administration of affairs at the very backward Moricetown Reserve. I would recommend departmental approval.\n\nContract forms are enclosed herewith.\n\nJ.V. Boys,\nSuperintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Proposed Telephone Installation\nMoricetown Reserve\n\nI am forwarding Supt. Boys' letter of June 14th and Telephone Contract referred to therein in connection with the proposed installation of a telephone in the Moricetown Indian day school teacherage.\n\nWhile I am familiar with the Department's policy in connection with the installation of telephones in teacherages, involving payment of the initial installation cost by the Department and subsequent rental by the teacher, in this case in view of the isolated location of the village, the absence of white residents in the near vicinity and the infrequent mail service, I feel that the installation of a telephone apart from any security it might provide for the teacher would, as suggested by Mr. Boys, be of considerable assistance to his administration and might also obviate the necessity of occasional journeys to the village.\n\nI would recommend that the Department approve the installation and payment of installation and rental charges for a period of six months at which time the matter should be reviewed by the Agent with a view to determining whether the expenditure is warranted.\n\nW.

For example, at Bella Coola on the west coast of Vancouver Island, we advertised for tenders for the erection of a two-room school and attached teachers' residence and the lowest tender for standard construction was $42,612. The same school has been built by the Department in Saskatchewan for $29,000. We finally erected a quonset school at Bella Coola.\n\nTherefore, due to the scarcity of contractors bidding on our projects and the high prices tendered by them, our officials in British Columbia came to the decision that prefabricated schools should be erected on the reserves listed above. Their decision in this regard has been due to the satisfaction obtained from the company which erected a two-room school and teachersage at Pemberton Meadows in the New Westminster Agency and a one-room school at...\nNetlakatla in the Skeena River Agency. This company is Prefabricated Structures, Limited, Post Office Box 489, Vancouver, British Columbia, and I attach photographs of the Pemberton Meadows school taken by Inspector Davey.\n\nWe are now erecting three such prefabricated schools in the Skeena River Agency and our officials in British Columbia have now recommended the purchase of two more such schools and one teachersage. You will be interested in the following comments concerning our prefabricated school at Netlakatla, submitted by Mr. Indian Superintendent Anfield, under whose supervision the present three schools are being erected:\n\n\"I am satisfied that it will wear well, operate economically and that the type of construction is suitable and most adaptable for the type of country in the Skeena Agency. The school has been viewed with considerable approval by the Provincial School Inspector, Mr. J. Shell, at Prince Rupert. It is recommended that two-classroom schools of this type, with teachersages attached, be constructed at Hartley Bay, Greenville and Kincolith, with the least possible delay.\"\n\nMr. Arnell, the Indian Commissioner, feels that these buildings are quite satisfactory and points out that they can be erected at a cost considerably less than we could get through standard construction. He also points out that the erection of these schools will provide employment for the Indians as much of the work involved is ordinary labour.\n\nThe only other company in British Columbia producing schools of this type is Precision Housing Company, which produce pre-cut schools. These are much more difficult to erect with the type of semi-skilled Indian labour we will have available and are, therefore, not recommended by our field officials. We already have in mind a foreman carpenter who would supervise the erection of these prefabricated schools during the coming summer.\n\n- Therefore\nTherefore, I would recommend to you the following action:\n\n(a) Approval of the submission to Council attached hereto covering the purchase of two prefabricated two-room schools with attached teacherages,\n\n(b) Approval from the Minister for the purchase of a teacherage for the Kispiox Reserve at a cost of $2,764. (I attach a requisition for signature by the Minister and passing to the Departmental Purchasing Agent for this latter building).\n\nEnc.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa 14 March 1950\n\nMr W S Arneil\nIndian Commissioner\nFederal Building\nVancouver British Columbia\n\nORDER IN COUNCIL REQUESTED FOR PREFABRICATED SCHOOLS\nand\nMORIGETOWN CHEHALIS -stop- MINISTERIAL APPROVAL REQUESTED\nPREFABRICATED TEACHERAGE KISPIOX -stop- DELAYING SUBMISSION TO\nCOUNCIL FORT BABINE PREFABRICATED UNTIL AUTHORITY OBTAINED\nCANCELLATION FORMER ORDER IN COUNCIL -stop- WILL ADVISE\nFURTHER BY SIGNAL -stop-\n\nBernard F Neary\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nCONFIRMATION\n\nTelephoned to: .......\n\" by: .......\nTime: ...............\n\nORIGINATOR'S INSTRUCTIONS\n\nSIGNATURE\n\nDEGREE OF PRIORITY\n\nTIME OF ORIGIN\n\nSIGNED\n\nCOPY 3\nCITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\n\nThe Board on a report and recommendation of the Honourable the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration recommend that, with a view to providing an Indian day school at the Moricetown Reserve of the Babine Indian Agency and at the Chehalis Reserve of the New Westminster Indian Agency, authority be granted to award a contract to Prefabricated Structures Limited, Post Office Box 489, Vancouver, British Columbia, for the supply of two prefabricated two-room schools with attached teachers' residences, at a cost of $10,475 each, f.o.b.

It should, in any event, terminate at the end of the 1947-48 school year, at which time we can consider its continuation.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclos.\n\nms.\nIndian Commissioner for B. C., VANCOUVER, B. C.\n\nMrs. A. C. Buddrus, teacher of Moricetown has informed me that she expects an additional fourteen children to attend school at Moricetown during the next academic year giving her a class of forty-five pupils. According to my count there should be forty-eight school age children. Mrs. Buddrus contends that I think correctly that this will be an unwieldy class and actually calls for a two room school. Some alleviation of the burden might be afforded by part-time employment of Mr. Max Buddrus to teach Manual Training in a room at the back of the school which is not, at present, being used for any other purpose. Mr. Buddrus is a qualified carpenter and tools are in the process of being procured. Will you kindly inform me upon what terms Mr. Buddrus might be employed.\n\nJ. V.

In view of the large class, and because it is believed that there is an opportunity for worthwhile work along vocational training lines, it is recommended that Mr. Buddrus be appointed on a basis of one day per week at the rate of $8.00 a day. This is in line with the arrangement at the Nanaimo Indian Day School.\n\nInspector of Indian Schools.\n\nR. F. Daney\n\n;ms.\nOttawa, September 4, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M.

We have a number of children of school age and they are most anxious of getting the benefit of an education.\n\nI have spoken with His Excellency Bishop E. M. Buenoz, O.M.I., who was highly in favour of the project. I therefore would like to further ask you to put this matter before the Government so that those people who come more and more in contact with white people will receive the benefit of an Education.\n\nWith best wishes, I beg to remain dear Sir.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is hoped to be able to start the school on September 1.\n\nAs this school will be conducted throughout the whole academic year it is felt that a qualified teacher should be engaged. In nominating the teacher you should give full particulars regarding the qualifications of your nominee.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRt. Rev. E. M.

Please let me know by whom these buildings are owned and whether or not they can be secured free of cost. If there is any rental for them you should state the monthly rate required. You should also let me know the approximate date on which you consider this school should be opened.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG. C.

The Indian Agent will be written next week with a view to making definite arrangements for the opening of this school.\n\nAs requested, I enclose the correspondence which you forwarded with your letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nClof Hanson, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ont.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nOTTAWA, Ont.,\nMarch 3, 1935.\n\nH.W.

C.\n\nI enclose herewith a letter, dated February 25th, from Father A. Godfrey, O.M.I., Smithers, British Columbia, together with recommendation from the Right Reverend Bishop E.M. Bunoz, O.M.I., Prince Rupert, and a petition, addressed to yourself, as Director of Indian Affairs, from Indians at the Old Fort, Babine Lake, under date of February 4th, with respect to the above application.\n\nI would appreciate it if it were possible to grant this request, as I realize that these people are situated quite a distance from civilization, and it would be beneficial to them to have a day school since they must more or less come into contact with the white population.\n\nI shall be glad to have your comments and advice so that I might advise the petitioners accordingly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nOlof Hanson.\n\nP.S.: Would you be good enough to return the enclosed correspondence for my files. Thank you.\n\nEncs.\nOttawa, July 6, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the proposed establishment of an Indian day school at Old Fort Babine.\n\nThe question of providing the funds necessary was considered when our Estimates for the fiscal year 1936-37 were being prepared. However, as it was found impossible to increase our Appropriation the necessary funds could not be provided.\n\nThe advisability of establishing a school at this point will be considered when we are preparing our Estimates for the fiscal year 1937-38. It may be possible to provide the necessary funds in the Appropriation for that fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazleton, B.C.\n\nF. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nIn his Estimates for the fiscal year 1936-37, Mr. G. C.

A suitable building has been erected for this purpose and it would be an easy matter to locate a teacher's house at low cost.\n\nI may say that the items of expenditure in connection with this school were entered on the Estimates for 1936-1937.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Mortimer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 21, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your S-1-648 of the 5th instant, with reference to the request you have received for the establishment of an Indian day school at Old Fort Babine.\n\nNo provision was made in this year's Appropriation for a school at this point, and, consequently, the request cannot receive favourable consideration at the present time. We will, however, consider the matter further when preparing our Estimates for the next fiscal year, and if it is possible to provide a teacher's salary, arrangements will be made to open the school in September, 1936.\n\nYou should write the Department again about May 1st.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nSir,\n\nre - Application for a New School at Old Fort Babine.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from the Rev. Father Godfrey - apparently approved of by His Lordship Rev. E. M. Bunoz - with reference to the establishment of an Indian Day School at Old Fort Babine.\n\nDuring my recent visit to the Babine Lake Reserves I carefully investigated the necessity of a day school at this point and have no hesitation in saying that it is necessary. There are approximately 25 children of school age at Old Fort and the nearest school is that at Fort Babine, about 40 miles distant.\n\nDuring the month of September each year, whilst the Indians are fishing North of the Fort Babine Reserve, a few Old Fort children attend the Fort Babine Indian Day School, this being the only tuition they receive.\n\nThe Indians of Old Fort are very anxious to have their children educated and they have offered a suitable building to be rented for the purpose. I have no doubt a residence may also be obtained for a teacher.\n\nMay I respectfully suggest that this matter receive the consideration of the Department, which I strongly recommend.\n\nEnc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.C. Mortimer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nJune 16, 1938.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL:\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT there are twenty-five (25) Indian children of school age at Old Fort Babine, in the Babine agency, province of British Columbia, for whom at present no educational facilities are provided;\n\nTHAT funds are available in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1938-39, Vote 168, for the establishment of a day school at Old Fort Babine.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that a day school be established at Old Fort Babine, in the Babine agency, province of British Columbia, in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act, Chapter 38, R.S. 1927, to be known as \"The Old Fort Babine Indian Day School\".\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa, June 16, 1928.\n\nPRECIS FOR THE CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL:\n\nEstablishment of the Old Fort Babine Indian Day School, in the Babine agency, province of British Columbia.\nOttawa, July 4, 1938.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI desire to refer Your Lordship to my letter of June 15th, with reference to the nomination of a qualified teacher to take charge of the new day school at Old Fort Babine.\n\nThe Indian Agent reports that the Old Fort reserve is completely deserted during the month of September, and he therefore recommends that this school commence each year on October first and close on July 31st.\n\nIn nominating a teacher for this school it should be understood that the school will not open this year until October 1, 1938.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Reverend E.

Thorne Hughes .......... $100.00\nTeacher,\nOld Fort Babine Indian Day School,\nTopley, B. C.\n\nStaff questionnaire will be forwarded when received.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir:\n\nThough I did not receive a copy of Departmental letter 151-9A-1 of July 4th last I did have a copy from Indian Agent Mortimer of his reply S-1-59 of July 15th and from this understand that authority has been given for the establishment of an Indian Day School in rented buildings at Old Fort Babine, Babine Agency.\n\nI am forwarding herewith a copy of a letter I have received from His Excellency Bishop Bunoz of Prince Rupert.\n\nI have discussed the matter with Inspector Barry and learn that of the candidates suggested by the Bishop the only one he is prepared to recommend is Miss M. Thorne Hughes of Victoria, who has been for the past few years teacher of the Songhees Indian Day School, Cowichan Agency.\n\nIt would appear that Miss Mary Bell accepted a Provincial appointment some time ago, and Captain Barry has not heard from Miss Moriaux for at least a year. At that time there was some doubt if Miss Moriaux would be given a B.C. certificate as she had to qualify in certain subjects. Captain Barry informs me that while he did instruct Miss Bell to apply to Bishop Bunoz as he himself had nothing to do with the nomination of teachers for vacant positions, he is not prepared to recommend the appointment of this girl even if available as she has had some difficulty with parents and children in the matter of too severe discipline while she taught in a Provincial School. Miss Wadel taught for us at the Inkameep and Sliammon Indian Day Schools in the past. She has no B.C. Certificate, though she has a Summer School qualification in Primary Work. Nothing is known here of Mr. Leonard J. Burns who would not appear to have a B.C. Certificate in any case.\n\nUnder the circumstances I would agree with our Inspector of Schools that probably Miss Mary Thorne Hughes is the best of these candidates, and I would therefore recommend that she be given the appointment.\nMiss Mary Thorn Hughes is living with her parents at 1259 Richardson Street, Victoria, B.C. She is now some 25 years of age. Trained at the Victoria Normal School Miss Hughes holds an Interim First Class Certificate in British Columbia. Inspector was not able to recommend that this Interim Certificate be made permanent when last reporting to the Provincial Department of Education, and the present certificate is being allowed to remain in force for the present.\n\nMiss Hughes was appointed teacher of the Songhees School on the nomination of the Bishop of Victoria in September 1936. This teacher has attended the Provincial Summer School on several occasions and has qualifications in Art and other subjects. She resigned in July 1938 more or less on the advice of the Inspector as the Indian parents were not quite satisfied. Captain Barry hoped to be able to arrange for a transfer to another Indian Day School, but all the candidates suggested to fill the vacancies were so highly qualified that he has not been able to place Miss Hughes.\n\nI have met Miss Hughes, who is a very nice quiet well behaved girl, anxious to follow the advice of the Inspector of Schools and other Departmental officials, and I am attaching a copy of a letter which she wrote to Captain Barry a few days ago. This letter indicates that she is available and anxious to go to any Indian school even in a remote part of the Province.\n\nNone of the candidates would appear to be very well qualified; but as Captain Barry is anxious that Miss Hughes is given another chance of qualifying for her Permanent Provincial Certificate I would recommend that she be appointed on a temporary basis in the first instance.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nGHB.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nJuly 31st, 1928.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 8,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been advised by the Indian Department Ottawa that the new school at Old Fort on Babine Lake is to be opened only on the first of October prox.\n\nAs I am asked to do so I hereby name for the teacher Mr. Leonard J. Burns who has experience in teaching and is now teaching in a Summer School at Fernie, B.C.\n\nHowever if the Department object to him because he has no B.C. Certificate I would present Miss Mary Bell who besides a First Class certificate holds a First Aid Certificate; she is recommended to me by Capt. Barry Or again Miss Mary Thorne Hughes of Victoria who has taught two years at the Songhees Reserve, now at Victoria 1259 Richardson str. or again Miss Wadel of Agassiz, or again Miss Victorine Moriaux of Victoria.\n\nI give you several names because I am afraid some may have accepted other positions by this time as their applications are from last year. And also owing to the fact that I am going to be absent in the Yukon for about two weeks\n\nYours very truly\n\n(Signed) E. M.

Mr. Watson informs me that there is a dearth of positions for women teachers this year.\n\nAs you know I would rather teach Indians, but I should be only too glad to accept any position in any part of the province.\n\nIf it would be possible for you to recommend me to the Dept. of Education or to the Superintendent of Schools for the Yukon, I should greatly appreciate it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) (Miss) M.

On my visit to the Babine Lake Reserves this month I was informed by the Priest that a male teacher had been recommended by Bishop Bunoz and I therefore made all necessary arrangements for his installation.\n\nI may say there are no white people on this reserve and, apart from the two or three Whites at Fort Babine, there are no white settlers nearer than Topley, some fifty miles away.\n\nThere are one or two Indians of questionable character on this reserve, one of whom served eighteen months for an indecent assault on an Indian woman several years ago.\n\nAs I feel strongly in this matter may I ask if you will kindly reconsider this question and substitute a male teacher for the Old Fort School? However, should the Department send in the lady teacher appointed, will the Department provide all the necessary furnishings needed for her residence in an unfurnished Indian house? The most necessary articles required would be: cook-stove, heater, table, chairs, lamps, bed, crockery, pans, cutlery, washing and cleaning materials, etc.\n\nAs an escort is leaving here on the morning of September 29th any further instruction by telegram would be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6420, file 862-1, part 1)\nDear Sir,-\n\nre - Teacher for Old Fort Day School.\n\nSince receiving Inspector Barry's letter of September 12th I have given serious thought to the question of the appointment by the Department of a lady teacher to the Old Fort Babine Day School.\n\nHaving always had a strong opinion that male teachers should be appointed to all isolated reserve schools, I have sent a night message to you today, part of which reads as follows:-\n\n\"Reference teacher Old Fort. Owing to complete isolation Old Fort Reserve am anxious regarding safety of female teacher STOP Could male teacher be sent?

C.\nBabine Agency,\nHazelton, B.C., July 26, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Babine Lake Reserve.\n\nI wish to advise you that I visited the Babine Lake Reserve between July 17th and 24th.\n\nMeetings were held at both Fort Babine and Old Fort. I inspected the school at Old Fort, which does not close until July 31st. The room has been kalsomined and has a good appearance. There were thirteen pupils in attendance, two of whom were adults. Miss Hughes, the teacher, informs me that a few adults have attended school quite regularly since its establishment.\n\nS. Mallinson,\nActing Indian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Hoey's letter of September 28th, File 151-9A-1, forwarding a copy of a letter from Capt. G. C. Mortimer, Indian Agent for the Babine Agency, regarding the appointment of Miss Mary T. Hughes as teacher of the Old Fort Babine Indian Day School.\n\nIn this particular case Miss Hughes was by far the best available teacher, male or female, at the time the nomination was made. Before Miss Hughes left for the North, I personally informed her of the isolated character of the School she had accepted and the dangers and difficulties that were usually associated with such appointments in remote sections of the country. Miss Hughes assured me that she understood the situation quite well and was quite prepared to undertake the task. Further, that her sister would accompany her to the North and live with her while she held the position there. Miss Hughes will be in touch with the R.C. Missionary and the Manager of the Hudson's Bay store at Old Fort Babine.\n\nUnder the circumstances that usually exist in such isolated places as Old Fort Babine, it would undoubtedly be much better to have male teachers appointed to our Day Schools and in this Inspector Barry fully agrees. When Captain Barry was in the Babine Agency recently he made enquiries regarding Miss Hughes and assured me that she was getting along well and that she will be quite safe.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nDM/HN\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nHazelton, B.C., Oct. 3rd, 1938.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON BABINE AGENCY FOR SEPT. 1938.\n\nSeveral schools were visited, the attendance of pupils being up to normal. During the latter part of September I proceeded to Old Fort Babine with the new school teacher, Miss Hughes. The school was put into shape for teaching to commence October 3rd. This school will be a great asset to the Old Fort Indians.\n\nG. C. Mortimer,\nIndian Agent.\nHazelton, Sept. 24th, 1938.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON BABINE AGENCY FOR SEPTEMBER 1938.\n\nI inspected the day school, there being twenty-five children in attendance who looked clean and healthy but their clothing was somewhat dilapidated.\n\nG.C. Mortimer\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, Sept. 28, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to the Old Fort Babine Indian Day School. A copy of your communication is being forwarded to Commissioner MacKay, for consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B. C.\nOttawa, Sept. 28, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a letter received by the Department from G. C. Mortimer, Indian Agent, Hazelton, B. C. This letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nI am anxious that you should discuss the subject matter of this communication with Inspector Barry, just as soon as you can conveniently do so. I regret to state that we have not found it possible to send in a male teacher to Old Fort Babine this year. I am personally, however, very much opposed to sending in female teachers to these isolated districts. This is a matter that might be discussed with the Church Authorities, particularly the Bishop. I feel confident that the Church Authorities will be glad to cooperate with us in the nomination of male teachers.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEncl.\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nP.O. Box 444,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nAugust 3rd 1939.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have read the correspondence to date with regard to the Indian Day Schools at Moricetown, and Old Fort Babine, in the Babine Agency, and the letters from His Excellency Bishop Bunoz O.M.I., in connection with these schools.\n\nThis morning I visited the officials of the Catholic Church here in Vancouver in an attempt to discover any suitable Catholic candidates with B.C. certificates for the above mentioned schools. I have also had interviews with two or three teachers.\n\nIn general I may say that there exists a very great shortage of teachers with good qualifications, and that male teachers with B.C. certificates are almost impossible to find. For the above named schools we need married teachers and I am quite unable to find any married Catholic with a B.C. certificate.\n\nUnder the existing circumstances I would recommend that in the case of the Old Fort Babine school His Excellency Bishop Bunoz be asked to nominate a married man with an Alberta or other Provincial certificate, and that such candidate be appointed by the Department on probation for a year. To allow me an opportunity to inspect the work of the teacher appointed to the Moricetown position I consider that the appointment might here also be temporary and for one year.\n\nIn the case of the Moricetown vacancy I wish to put forward for the information of His Excellency Bishop Bunoz the below mentioned candidate:\n\nGEORGE W. CLEVELAND Age 29 Married Mary (Crawford) Age 26. The two children are 5 and 2 years of age.\n\nMr. Cleveland has Senior Matriculation standing in Ontario. He has taught Manual Training to unemployed Manitoba youths. His wife is a teacher of music. Mr. Cleveland is in good health and has a very good personality. He much wishes to be a teacher and would later when he has earned a little money take courses at the Provincial Summer School and Normal School. He is willing to do what is told and to follow my suggestions. I consider him a much better candidate than even the last teacher at Moricetown on whose work I reported favourably.\n\nMr. Cleveland is of course a Catholic and is recommended by the Catholic Church authorities of the Archdiocese of Vancouver. I have instructed him to write direct to His Excellency Bishop Bunoz in the hope that the Bishop might give him the Moricetown nomination. I am prepared to recommend Mr. Cleveland for such a position, and should he obtain the Bishop's nomination and the Department's appointment I shall give him several hours' instruction in this office previous to his departure for the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith for your information report of Mr. Inspector Barry with respect to appointment of teachers for Moricetown and Old Fort Babine Indian Day Schools.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKey.\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n15/1/749\n\nOttawa, August 22, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant and also copy of a communication relating to the appointment of teachers at the Moricetown and Old Fort Babine Indian Day Schools, attached thereto.\n\nIt would appear from Captain Barry's letter that it is exceedingly difficult to secure Catholic teachers with full professional B. C. standing for work at Indian day schools. In view of this difficulty, I can see no objection whatever to the suggestion made by the Inspector, that fully qualified teachers from the adjoining provinces be employed. In view of the limited time at our disposal prior to the opening of the school year, any arrangement agreed upon by you and the Inspector with Bishop Bunoz will be acceptable to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nOn the authority of the second paragraph of Departmental letter 151-22-1 of the 18th instant I have accepted as teacher of the Old Fort Babine Indian day school for the academic year 1939-40 Mr. N.R. Barwick, nominated by His Excellency Bishop Bunoz, O.M.I.\n\nHis Excellency recommends strongly the appointment of this man, who is married, twenty seven years of age, and with one child. Mrs Barwick was a nurse before her marriage.\n\nIn Mr Barwick's application he states that he has a First Class Alberta certificate and a little over three years experience in that Province. He has taken some courses at the University of Alberta Summer School. He does not furnish copies of his inspector's reports but states that they were above average. The recommendation he received on his resignation from the Alberta Provincial School at Anahta is good.\n\nAs there are no available Catholic teachers, suitable for such a position, holding B.C. certificates, Inspector Barry recommends that the nomination of Mr. Barwick by His Excellency Bishop Bunoz be accepted.\n\nActing Indian Agent Mallinson of the Babine Agency is being instructed to have Mr. Barwick fill up the questionnaire Cl50-S2 and to render the new teacher all necessary assistance so that the Old Fort Babine Indian day school may be opened for the new term at the beginning of October.\n\nI should be glad to have the Department's confirmation of the action taken in due course. In the mean time a copy of this letter is being forwarded to His Excellency Bishop Bunoz, and to the Acting Indian Agent at Hazelton.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th instant the Department approves the appointment of Mr. N.R. Harwick as teacher of the Old Fort Babine Indian day school.\n\nIt is understood that this school will reopen on October 1, 1939, and continue to the end of July, 1940. Salary will be allowed him at the rate of $1000.00 a year. It is noted that you will forward staff questionnaire.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa,\nApril 18, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Old Fort Babine Indian Day School No. 862\n\nMr. N. R. Barwick, teacher of this school, is being transferred to the position of teacher at Fort Babine.\n\nNo further payment should be made to Mr. Barwick until you are further advised by this Branch. When I have definite information regarding the time the transfer takes place I will advise you what salary should be paid to Mr. Barwick.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nApril 18, 1940.\n\nMemorandum for file:\n\nOLD FORT BABINE SCHOOL\n\nOn file 131-5-1 letter of April 18, 1940, approved the transfer of the teacher, Mr. M.

Barwick's salary for April.\n\nMr. Barwick, teacher of Old Fort Indian Day School prior to his transfer to Fort Babine, informs me that he has not received his salary cheque for April, 1940. May I ask if you will kindly investigate this matter and oblige?\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nS. Mallinson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJune 8, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant regarding the transfer of Mr. N.R. Barwick from Old Fort Babine to Fort Babine Indian Bay School. It is also noted that Mrs. Barwick began duties as field matron on May 25.\n\nIn connection with the Old Fort Babine Indian Bay School I would refer you to the last paragraph of your letter of April 11. I should appreciate your advising for what length of time you consider this school should be operated during the academic year 1940-41. His Lordship, Rt. Rev. E.M. Bunoz, visited the Department recently and he expressed the opinion that this school should be kept open.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M.

In that capacity she has given full satisfaction to all concerned: Indian Agent, people and the priest in charge.\n\nBesides teaching she has rendered valuable services in maintaining sanitation among the school children and in their homes.\n\nShe is exercising an excellent influence in an Indian camp.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE.M.

I am anxious to know if, in your judgment, this school should be kept open and in operation and, if so, for what period during the coming academic year. Your immediate attention to this matter will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.

Mr. Phelan, to whom the letter was addressed, is, at this date, absent from the office on holidays.\n\nI am today communicating with Major D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., with respect to the operation of this school. Just as soon as the Commissioner replies I shall be glad to communicate with you again.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nWith reference to Departmental air mail letter 151-9A-1 of the 29th instant, in the matter of the re-establishment of an Indian Day School at Old Fort Babine, Babine Agency, I would report as follows:\n\nMr. Indian Agent Mallinson, in a letter S-1J-135, dated July 5, 1940, states that many of the Indians at Old Fort Babine take their families at the beginning of the hunting season to their traplines, returning about the middle of December. Apparently after Christmas the families of these trappers remain for some months in the village.\n\nMr. Mallinson further states that an Indian Day School at Old Fort Babine could be operated with success from January 1st to May 31st.\n\nThe monthly attendance at the Old Fort Babine Indian Day School has in the past been as follows:\n\n| Month    | 1938-39 | 1939-40 |\n|----------|---------|---------|\n| October  | 12.3    | 8.10    |\n| November | 9.5     | 6.52    |\n| December | 13.47   | 10.21   |\n| January  | 13.66   | 15.32   |\n| February | 9.53    | 9.70    |\n| March    | 9.26    | 9.07    |\n| April    | 10.27   | 10.96   |\n| May      | 9.18    | 9.75    |\n| June     | 6.90    |         |\n| July     | 10.79   |         |\n\nIt is obvious from the information given by Mr. Indian Agent Mallinson that if the Indian Day School be re-established at Old Fort Babine, it should be on the basis of a five month seasonal school, operated from January 1st to May 31st yearly.\n\nIt should, I think, be remembered that in a Departmental letter you were informed that the Department\nhad decided not to operate seasonal schools in the north, due to the need for strict economy. I am very doubtful that the average attendance in the past would warrant the establishment of even a seasonal school at Old Fort Babine.\n\nThe Department does not own any building at Old Fort Babine and if it is decided to establish a seasonal school at that point, it will be necessary to rent accommodation both for the school and for the teacher.\n\nIn Departmental letter 151-9A-1 of August 28th, quoted above, it is stated that His Excellency Bishop Bunoz has nominated Miss Catherine Finan for the post of teacher at Old Fort Babine. No information whatever is given with regard to the qualifications of the above named person who is quite unknown to me. I may say, however, that I am very strongly opposed to the appointment of single ladies at such out of the way schools.\n\nFinally, I may say that I regret that under war conditions necessitating strict economy, it is impossible for me to recommend the establishment of even a seasonal school at Old Fort Babine.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald M. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools.\n\nGHB:GR\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to refer to your airmail letter of the 29th ultimo, your file 159-9A-1, regarding the Old Fort Babine Indian Day School. The question of reopening this school has been carefully discussed with Capt. Barry, whose letter to me of August 31st in the matter is enclosed.\n\nIf the school is to be operated at all, it should be on a five months' basis, but as the Department has already informed this office that owing to lack of funds it was found necessary to close a number of these seasonal schools, there could hardly be much justification to open this one, especially in view of the low average attendance.\n\nIn view of the unfortunate experience we have had with the last single young woman who taught at the Old Fort School, I consider the Department would be well advised to insist on the appointment of a male teacher, if and when the school is opened.\n\nUnder existing conditions and in view of the small attendance and Inspector Barry's report, I can not see that we would be justified in opening the Old Fort Babine School at the present time. The matter could come under review again should there be reasonable assurance of a substantial increase in attendance. In the meantime I would recommend that no action be taken to reopen this school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 7, 1940.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to Your Lordship's letter of the 22nd ultimo and official reply of the 29th ultimo, with reference to the Old Fort Babine Indian Day School.\n\nThe attendance at this school has been very small and consequently does not justify us in re-opening it at the present time. If we were opening the school we would have to insist on a male teacher as it is considered undesirable to send in a female teacher to this isolated place.\n\nIn view of the above, I regret that favourable consideration cannot be given to the employment of Miss Finan. This school will remain closed for the current academic year, but if the number of children increases during the next year the Department will be prepared to consider operating it for the academic year 1941-42.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Reverend E. M. Bunoz, O.M.I.,\nBishop's House,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nOttawa, September 7, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the Old Fort Babine Indian Day School.\n\nIn view of your report, the Department is advising Right Reverend E. M. Bunoz, O.M.I., that it is not our intention to re-open this school during the current academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\nHazelton, B.C. November 1st, 1940\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR MONTH OF OCTOBER.\n\nThe Indian schools at Tsitsk, Glen Vowell and Kispiox were visited during the month. On account of influenza the Indian Day School at Fort Babine was close during my visit.\n\nS. Mallinson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 19th, 1947.\n\nMr. J.V. Boys, Indian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\n\nIn your recent quarterly report you refer to the fact that the Kitwencool, Kitsegukla and Old Fort Babine Schools have been closed during the current year owing to lack of teachers.\n\nOur files indicate that the Old Fort Babine School has not been in operation since 1940. It was closed at that time owing to unsatisfactory attendance.\n\nPlease let me know the number of children who would attend the school in the event of a teacher being secured.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: School Construction Projects in British Columbia\n\nYour file 141-5 (3)\n\nI refer to Mr. Neary's letter of November 1st concerning the provision of school facilities at Old Fort in the Babine Agency as included on our priority list submitted to the Department some time ago.\n\nThis point is located on Babine Lake about 30 miles S.E. of Fort Babine. A school survey indicates that there are 79 children 6 years of age and under at this point. Of this number 46 are in the age group 6 to 16. The pre-school age population is 33. Although the number of school age children would appear to warrant the construction of a two room school, due to the nomadic life of many of the families it is felt that a one room would probably meet the actual need.\n\nI might say that a school was operated at this point up until March of 1940 when the present teacher at Fort Babine was transferred from Old Fort. At the time of his transfer there were 23 pupils enrolled in the Old Fort School, with an average attendance of 11.3. The school apparently remained closed, partly because of the acute teacher shortage.\n\nThe building in use was an old structure rented from one of the natives belonging to the reserve. It is quite unsuitable for school purposes and is in very poor repair.\n\n(sgd.) W.S. Arneil\nW.S.

There is nothing here to indicate that the Department has at any time signed a formal lease when renting such buildings. I would suppose that such a lease, in order to be valid, would have to be approved by Order-in-council.

A school survey indicates that there are 79 children 16 years of age and under at this point. Of this number 46 are in the age group 6 to 16. The pre-school age population is 33. Although the number of school age children would appear to warrant the construction of a two room school, due to the nomadic life of many of the families it is felt that a one room would probably meet the actual need.\n\nI might say that a school was operated at this point up until March of 1940 when the present teacher at Fort Babine was transferred from Old Fort. At the time of his transfer there were 23 pupils enrolled in the Old Fort School, with an average attendance of 11.5. The school apparently remained closed, partly because of the acute teacher shortage.\n\nThe building in use was an old structure rented from one of the natives belonging to the reserve. It is quite unsuitable for school purposes and is in very poor repair.\n\n(Sgd.) W.J. Arneil\nW.J.

On the closing of the School in May 1940, all desks and equipment from the School building were transferred to the teacher's residence where Department property is stored. Since that time the teacher's residence has been constantly used by the Field Matron at Babine during her visits to Old Fort, and on occasions by myself and the Police when visiting the Babine Lake Reserves. Mrs. Earwick, the Field Matron and I are the only ones possessing a key to the house.\n\nIn my letter of May 30th, 1940 to the Indian Commissioner for B.C., the following was a part:\n\n\"All school equipment at Old Fort was transferred from the school building to the teacher's residence, thereby vacating the school building.\"\n\nI am therefore returning Voucher #444 in favour of the Indian owner of the teacher's residence for payment of the quarterly rent of $15.00, the amount which is most necessary the Department assume.\n\nS.

A second story to this building might, at first, be utilized as a teacher's residence until other arrangements can be made. A lease can be drawn up when I next visit Kitwancool.\n\nI would suggest that 26 desks of varying sizes be supplied, together with a teacher's table, chair and blackboards, the latter of the smaller size on account of transportation. All books and stationery, I presume, will be supplied direct from Ottawa and should be addressed to the Indian Agent, c/o Hudson's Bay Company, Kitwanga, B.C.\n\nWill you kindly give me authority to purchase the other necessary equipment, such as: heater and stove-pipes, wood, axe, brooms, pails, wash-basin, soap, towels, dust-pan, 26 cups, etc? These can be obtained locally.\n\nI enclose the copy of a self explanatory letter received from the Rt. Rev. G. A.

C. Mortimer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6420, file 863-1, part 1)\nCaptain Mortimer,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\n\nMy dear Captain,\n\nTo my own great satisfaction and I feel sure also to yours, I have obtained the promise of a man who fills all the conditions demanded by the Department to undertake the work of teacher at Kitwancool. His name is Norman Green and he has been a most successful teacher at Kincolith. He is fully qualified and can do something in the way of Manual Training, is a good musician, healthy and young. He is to be married this summer to a young woman who is trained in domestic science and understands something of nursing.\n\nIt is the finest combination in the Diocese and they will be ready to go in to Kitwancool in September. I know you have in hand the providing of a building for a school and a house to live in. I believe the Department also makes it a point to equip the school with everything necessary and supplies the necessary heavy furniture for the house.\n\nMr. Green has been getting $100.00 per month for ten months per year, so I hope the Department will do the best they can for him in this new and difficult field. Such matters as these I, of course, must leave with you. Mr. Green is writing you and you will probably receive his letter along with mine.\n\nDo you think it possible to get something for Mrs. Green as Field Matron, especially as she is trained in domestic science and nursing?\n\nI have not been so pleased for a long time as I am in securing the services of such excellent people and I am most anxious to have them made contented by their reception and treatment. I have known you long enough to be sure that you will do all possible for them.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Signed) G. A. Rix.\nExtract from letter from Bishop Rix of Prince Rupert dated April 5, 1938:\n\nI note your desires re Kitwancool and I will endeavour to get a qualified teacher, a married man if possible and one who understands Manual Training. It may not be easy to get all this, but at least I can get a qualified teacher. I suppose I may promise to a suitable man the usual $80.00 per teaching month and a house.\n\n(Sgd.) G. A. Rix,\nBishop of Caledonia.\nOttawa, March 26th, 1938.\n\nRight Rev. Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of November 24th, 1937, and Dr. McGill's reply of December 2nd, I am now in receipt of a report from Indian Agent Mortimer with reference to the proposed establishment of a day school at Kitwaneoool.\n\nMr. Mortimer considers that this school should open on September 1, 1938, and I am advising him that the Department is prepared to approve such action and requesting him to make arrangements for renting buildings suitable for a school and teacher's residence.\n\nThere are twenty-five children of school age at Kitwaneoool, and it is considered advisable to secure the services of a fully qualified, experienced, white male teacher, preferably a married man. Vocational training should form an integral part of the education at this school, and it is, therefore, desirable to have a teacher with a vocational training certificate.\n\nI would appreciate if you would nominate a qualified, white teacher, possessing the qualifications mentioned above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRight Rev. G. A. Rix, D.D.,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa, March 26th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to the proposed establishment of a school at Kitwancool.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter that there are approximately twenty-five children of school age, it has been decided to proceed with the establishment of a school.\n\nI note that you consider an experienced white, male teacher, preferably a married man, should be appointed; and I am communicating with His Lordship, Right Rev. G. A. Rix, D.D.\n\nI have further noted that you consider this school should open on September 1, 1938, and, in the meantime, you should make arrangements for securing suitable buildings, which your letter states you can rent at not more than $10 a month. You should advise me as soon as you have secured the buildings.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nre - Suggested Indian Day School at Kitwancool.\n\nWith further reference to Mr. Mallinson's letter of September 24th, 1937, in answer to yours of September 10th, regarding the suggested day school at Kitwancool, the following are the particulars for your information:\n\nThere are, approximately, twenty-five (25) children of school age in this village.\n\nSuitable buildings can be rented at reasonable amounts for both school and teacher's residence, that for the school being not more than $10.00 per month.\n\nKitwancool is some sixteen (16) miles from Kitwanga connected by a wagon trail.\n\nRegarding a teacher for this school I could not recommend an Indian for this position as suggested by the Right Reverend G. A. Rix, D.D., Bishop of Caledonia. If the Department approves of the school I would most strongly recommend an experienced white male teacher, preferably a married man.\n\nMay I add my recommendation that an Indian Day School be established in the village of Kitwancool to open in September, 1938?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Mortimer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 10, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe desire to refer you to official letter of February 17, 1937, addressed to Mr. S. Mallinson, Clerk in charge of the Babine Agency.\n\nThis letter referred to communication received from Right Reverend G.A. Rix, D.D., Bishop of Caledonia, recommending the establishment of day schools under Kitwaneoool and Kisegams Reserves.\n\nMy letter requested you to make further enquiries and ascertain definitely the number of children of school age on each reserve. As yet I have received no reply to that letter. The Right Reverend Bishop Rix visited the Department yesterday and again urged the establishment of a school on the Kitwaneoool Reserve and I would therefore appreciate having your report at the earliest possible date. The Bishop mentioned that there is a building owned by the church on the Kitwaneoool Reserve that could be used for school purposes.\n\nIn connection with the Kisegams Reserve, Bishop Rix stated that he intended to send an educated Indian to this reserve this year as an experiment. This man will endeavour to give some rudimentary training to the children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG.C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHaselton, B.C.\nOttawa, March 12th, 1937.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 5th instant which refers to the establishment of day schools on the Kisagas and Kitwancool Reserves, the Department wrote Mr. Agent Mortimer on the 17th ultimo, requesting full particulars regarding the establishment of these schools.\n\nHis reply has not yet come to hand but will receive careful consideration. However, it is doubtful if the necessary salaries can be allowed this year, as no provision for this expenditure was made in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1937-38.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. G. A. Rix, D.D.,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nThe Anglican Synod of the Diocese of Caledonia.\n\n3473 University Street,\nMontreal, Que., March 5, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am, as you will see by the letterhead, in Montreal a long way from my western Diocese and as mails are very uncertain to and from the Telegraph Creek region so that I can not well communicate with you through your agent there. I am therefore bringing the following matters directly to your attention.\n\nIn the village of Kitwancool there never has been any school, either building or teacher. There must be at least a score of children there of school age who are getting no education. Your agent in that district, Captain Mortimer, has discussed this with me and it may be that he has already brought this need to your attention. These people have had a turbulent history, but are now quite ready to work in harmony with the state and a great help to establishing this condition would be in placing a school there.\n\nAsking for consideration of the above, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG. A. Rix,\nBishop of Caledonia.\nOttawa, July 4, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the proposed day school at Kitwancool.\n\nIt is noted that you can secure a building at a rental of $10.00 a month, and final arrangements should be completed for this building, it being understood that rental will start from September 1, 1938.\n\nYou may purchase, locally, a heater, stove pipes, wood, an axe, brooms, pails, wash basins, soap, towels, a dust pan and 26 cups.\n\nRegarding the desks, these can be secured as follows:\n\n| No. | Pupils 16 to 20 years |\n|-----|----------------------|\n| 1   |                      |\n| 2   | 15                   |\n| 3   | 10                   |\n| 4   | 8                    |\n| 5   | 5                    |\n\nPlease let me know the number of each size of desk that is required.\n\nIn view of the transportation difficulties, it will be almost impossible to ship blackboard without breaking. I therefore believe that it would be advisable to use slated blackboard cloth for the first year, at least. When replying to this letter you should let me know the length of slated blackboard cloth that you consider should be supplied.\n\nI note that Bishop Rix suggests the appointment of Mr. Norman Green as teacher of this school for the academic year just closed. Mr. Green has been in charge of the Kincolith Indian Day School, Skeena agency, and no intimation has been received that he intended to give up duties at that school at the end of June. Please communicate again with Bishop Rix in regard to this nomination and let me have his reply\u2014at which time an immediate decision will be given regarding the teaching services at Kitwancool.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nG.

I would suggest that four lengths of 4 feet by 8 feet, approximately, should be supplied.\n\nI am informed by the Indian Commissioner for B.C. that he has forwarded to you an application from Mr. Norman Green for the position of teacher at the Kitwancool Day School with a covering letter of recommendation. I am fully of the opinion that Mr. Green's qualifications make him very eligible for this position and that both he and his future wife are sufficiently qualified to care for sick Indians.\n\nAs advised, the articles needed for the school will be purchased in time for the opening.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nG. C. Mortimer,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the proposed day school at Kitwancool, I would draw your attention to a letter forwarded by Indian Agent G.C. Mortimer, File S-1-35, Babine Agency, of June 22, in reply to Mr. Hoey's letter, File 151-21-1, of March 26, and a letter from the Rt. Rev. G. A. Rix, D.D., Bishop of Caledonia, Prince Rupert, forwarded to you at the same time.\n\nI am forwarding herewith a copy of letter from Mr. Norman Green making application for the position of teacher at the proposed Kitwancool Indian day school as his previous application, not made through this office, has apparently been lost.\n\nThe question of Mr. Green's nomination by Rt. Rev. G. A. Rix has been discussed with Captain Barry, who is entirely satisfied with the Bishop's nomination.\n\nI understand that Mr. Green is a graduate of the Victoria Normal School and holds a first class teaching certificate for the Province of British Columbia. He has had some four years teaching experience, two years having been spent in Provincial Rural Schools, one year at the Indian Residential School, Elkhorn, Manitoba, and one year at the Kincolith Indian day school. Mr. Green also holds a First Aid Certificate and appears well qualified for the duties he will have to undertake in a rather difficult district.\nIt will be noted that Mr. Green intends to marry in August and that his future wife has had some five years experience with Indians while at the Elkhorn Residential School. She appears to have assisted the nurse in that school and her experience will no doubt prove useful among the Kitwancool Indians.\n\nI would recommend that if the Department has decided to establish an Indian Day School at Kitwancool, the Rt. Rev. Rix's nomination be accepted, and Mr. Norman Green be appointed the first teacher.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Mortimer,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Collison paid a visit to this village Saturday night and brought me your letter. I was surprised to find out that you had not received my first letter\u2014I cannot imagine what became of it, for it was mailed here on May 23rd.\n\nSince it was written in the form of an application for the position of teacher at Kitwancool, I will briefly state my qualifications: I am a graduate of the Victoria Normal School and hold a First Class Teaching Certificate for the Province of British Columbia. I have had four years' teaching experience, two years in Provincial Rural Schools, one year (1936-37) in the Indian Residential School at Elkhorn, Manitoba, and for the past year I have been teaching here (Kincolith).\n\nI hold a Strathcona Trust Physical Training Certificate and a St. John's Ambulance First Aid Certificate. I have had a good musical training and am quite proficient on the piano or organ. I can give lessons on these instruments. While here I have assisted the Church choir in their work.\n\nI am very much interested in the welfare, moral, spiritual, and material, of the Indians, particularly the young. I will do all in my power to help the people of Kitwancool. As you advised, I will postpone my proposed visit to Kitwancool, and am leaving on today's boat for my holidays. My address will be Norman Green, P.O. Box 58, Fernie, B.C. I will most surely call on Capt. Barry while in Vancouver, as I had already intended to. I hope you have already communicated with the Department regarding Kitwancool and please let me know as what you hear as soon as possible.\n\nIf my appointment is certified by the Department I will be getting married in August. My fiance has been employed at the Elkhorn Indian School for the past five years and has worked in all the various positions filled by lady staff members. She has at times assisted the nurse and taken over part of her duties when the nurse has been away. She would be a great asset to an Indian village.\nWhen you write I would be very pleased if you would give me what information you can regarding a house available and whether or not it would be partly furnished.\n\nThanking you very kindly for all you may do, I will now close, trusting that I will hear from you again soon.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n\"Norman Green.\"\nOttawa, August 11th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th ultimo, in connection with the new day school at Kitwancool.\n\nThe appointment of Mr. Norman Green as teacher of this school is approved.

Whereas the Kitwancool Indians have been self-supporting people, from time immemorial and later become isolated people having no connection with all the other Indian tribes along the Skeena and Nass Rivers, therefore we, the Kitwancoolers, or Kitwancoolians, humbly pray The Dominion Government, not to connect the Kitwancool Affairs, with the said \"Indian Affairs\", and further, we humbly pray that the Dominion Government, to deal especially separately with regards the Kitwancool Affairs, beginning September 1938, A.D.\n\n2nd. That we, as Kitwancoolers, may not be furnished with free Medicine, Seeds, Hospital, Plows, Cattle and other implements, which is always furnished to all other Indians, to whom the Kitwancoolians, have never been in company or connected.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6420, file 863-1, part 1)\non the ground that we, as Kitwancoolians, are self-supporting, from time immemorial. But it is only the Education, Qualification and Intelligence facilities, that we humbly desire from the Dominion Government, in order that the Kitwancoolians, may be able to stand and walk in the Highway of Modern Civilization in the Great White Empire.\n\n3rd We humbly pray The Dominion Government, to allow our children, at the proper age, to take High School course in Kitwancool school, and if any of them is intelligent enough, then he or she, may be sent to college and then to university, because we have been frequently notified of the children's fault at the Indian Residential Schools and there are some with illegitimate children, which in spite of the Principal's proper care, more of them might go the same way.\n\n4th. We humbly pray that the Dominion Government might create an \"ACT\" as authorised, by the British North America Act, 30 Victoria, (29th March, 1867), Chapter 3. To be cited the Kitwancool Act, to enable the Kitwancoolians to pay a reasonable amount of money towards the school expenses, in order that the Kitwancool school expenses, might be reduced and to facilitate the more active learning and that some day the Kitwancoolians will be among the Active Patriots, as desired in our Petition for school, dated 9th October, 1937, sent through the Indian Office, Hazelton, B.C.\n\n5th.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nJanuary 21, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant advising of the temporary appointment of Mrs. Chapman as teacher of the Kitwancool Indian Day School at a salary of $85 per teaching month and to advise that the questionnaire has been forwarded to her and will be returned as soon as completed.\n\nI would advise that this school consists of a building rented from an Indian on the Reserve, the living quarters of which are completely devoid of furnishings and it would therefore be necessary to purchase these requirements as soon as possible. It is considered that similar furnishings to those supplied to the Moricetown Indian Day School recently will meet the requirements of this school and I would appreciate authority by airmail if possible to expend $203 for this purpose in addition to which there would be freight from Vancouver to Kitwanga and a road haul of sixteen miles from Kitwanga to Kitwancool.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 15, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant with reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Kitwancool Indian Day School. After carefully considering the contents of your letter it has been decided to approve the appointment of Mrs. Chapman on the understanding that her employment will be temporary to the close of the academic year at which time it is hoped that a qualified teacher can be secured for the academic year 1941-42. Your letter does not state Mrs. Chapman's age and her appointment is contingent on the fact that she is not more than 55. Salary will be allowed her at the rate of $85.00 a teaching month and you should have her complete the attached questionnaire form and you should also advise me the exact date on which she begins duties.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Right Reverend G.A. Rix, D.D., Bishop of Caledonia, Prince Rupert, B.C., has suggested the appointment of Mrs. A. Chapman as teacher of the Kitwancool Indian Day School. Bishop Rix further informs me that Mrs. Chapman was on the teaching staff of a Toronto Private School preparing pupils for matriculation, and that she was authorized to teach in Ontario by the Minister of Education of that Province.\n\nBishop Rix is prepared to appoint Mr. A. Chapman as Anglican Missionary at Kitwancool.\n\nThe suggested appointment of Mrs. Chapman as teacher at Kitwancool has been discussed with Inspector Barry who points out that at Kitwancool it is more or less essential to have either a single man or married couple and, while it would be better for such a man to hold a teacher's certificate in one or other of the Provinces of Canada, preferably in B.C., he has no objection to the temporary appointment of Mrs. Chapman, provided the Department is willing to have a married woman as teacher.\n\nCaptain Barry wishes it to be understood that he has no information whatever with regard to the professional qualifications of Mrs. Chapman nor has he, of course, ever met this lady. He further informs me that it would be highly unlikely that the Department could obtain the services of a suitable teacher with a B.C. certificate for this school in the near future.\n\nUnder the circumstances I am prepared to recommend the appointment of Mrs. Chapman, wife of Mr. A. Chapman, of Clearhills, Alberta, as temporary teacher of the Kitwancool Indian Day School.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe Secretary\n\nJanuary 13, 1941.\n\nI should be glad to have the Department's decision by airmail and to know what salary it is proposed to allow Mrs. Chapman at Kitwancool.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to Department letter 151-21-1 of the 23rd instant, Inspector Barry has been informed that Mr. Dixon, whose appointment as teacher of the Kitwancool Indian School, Babine Agency, was previously approved by the Department, is not now available.\n\nInspector Barry informs me that at the moment, as far as he knows, no Anglican teacher is available for appointment at Kitwancool.\n\nThe last teacher at this point, the Reverend N. Green, was transferred at the beginning of the academic year to Kincolith Indian Day School on the authority of the Department. It is understood that the Kitwancool school is carried on in an Indian house and that the unfurnished accommodation available for a teacher is strictly limited.\n\nThis school is located in a place difficult of approach, some sixteen to twenty miles north of the C.N.R. at Kitwanga. The school has lately been visited by Inspector Coleman and the need for its retention will be discussed with him on his return to Vancouver.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

It is hoped that their praiseworthy efforts in this regard will be successful.\n\nA new day school has just been opened on this Reserve and it is expected that all children of school age will attend regularly. You should point out to the Indians that children are not eligible for higher education until they have completed the elementary school course. Speaking generally it has been found that it is inadvisable to encourage Indian children to take higher education as in many cases the results do not compensate for the extra expenditure incurred. However, if at some time in the future there is any outstanding pupil in the Kitwancool school who has secured his entrance standing you might bring his case to our attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B. C.\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing petition to the Department of Indian Affairs, said to be on behalf of the Kitwancool Band, in the Babine Agency. This petition, as you see, deals with a request for higher education.\n\nI might point out to the Department that this Band have only just been supplied with a new school, and as far as higher education is concerned, if it should turn out to be advisable, which I doubt, it is a matter that can be dealt with at a later date. They also state in this petition that they want to be self-supporting, and I am sure the Department will not object to this.\n\nInspector Pragnell informs me that these Indians are very fond of long-winded petitions, particularly the so-called president and vice-president, and as you know they have given considerable trouble in the past. However, they are a fairly energetic Band, though the Chief and Councillors are rather inclined to be self-important. If the Department sees fit to answer this petition, through the Indian Agent, I should suggest that they be informed that the Department is pleased to hear that they do not wish to be a charge on the Government, and that the matter of higher education can only be taken up when these Indians show fitness for it, and when money is available, but it naturally means that they will have to use existing institutions for that purpose. To build and run such a one at Kitwancool, itself, would be too expensive and not reasonable, and a High School as suggested there would, unless there were large numbers, necessitate much expense.\n\nFurther, it might be pointed out that the younger Indians are by force of circumstances bound to return to the Reserves and\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nlive .....\nlive by fishing and trapping; that higher education seems to unfit them to earn their living this way.\n\nI also enclose copy of a petition that these same parties sent to the Lieut. Governor of British Columbia.\n\nColonel Pragnell informs me that it is very doubtful whether the members of the Band, other than Peter Williams and Walter Douse, have much to do with these petitions.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nP.S. I should be much obliged if you would have forwarded to me a copy of the Department's answer to the petition.\nDear Sir,\n\nre - Kitwancool Band.\n\nI enclose herewith a petition submitted by the Kitwancool Indians which is self explanatory.\n\nI may say that this Band is and has been self supporting, with the exception of hospitalization, the amount of which is infinitesimal.\n\nAs Kitwancool is now supplied with a school for the proper education of the children there I feel that higher education, as asked for in the petition, could be dealt with at a future date.\n\nOn October 20th, accompanied by Game Warden Martin, I met a large number of Kitwancool Indians at Kitwanga and talked over matters appertaining to their hunting grounds. The question is still a controversy between themselves and the Game Department. This meeting was the outcome of a petition sent to the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia, of which I am sending you a copy, such copy being forwarded to me by Game Warden Martin of Prince Rupert. Game Warden Martin informed me he would write a complete report for his Commissioner on the subject, a copy of which, I understand, will be forwarded to you.\n\nMay I kindly ask your advise in the matter of the enclosed petition?\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG.

Hayhurst of Kitwanga be given the position. As the Department is aware, Mr. Hayhurst is the husband of the teacher of the Indian Day School at Kitwanga. Kitwancool is about 16 miles by trail from Kitwanga.\n\nThere has been considerable discussion in the past with the Bishop who has been endeavouring to have Mr. Hayhurst appointed at other Indian Day Schools, one of which was discussed in my letter to the Department of December 5th last, your file 168-35-1, when the Bishop proposed to send Mr. Hayhurst to Lakalsap Indian Day School at Greenville, a very considerable distance from Kitwanga. It was pointed out at that time that Mr. Hayhurst had no professional qualifications as a teacher and that the employment of a man and wife at two different schools by this Department might be subject to criticism. I have no reason to change my opinion other than that Kitwancool is fairly close to Kitwanga.\n\nIf the Department wishes to accept the nomination and appoint Mr. Hayhurst in view of the present shortage of teachers, I would recommend that this be considered by a temporary appointment only and that an effort to secure a qualified teacher for the position be continued, and if one can be secured that Mr. Hayhurst be replaced by a teacher better qualified to fill the position.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nP.T.O.\nDear Sir,\n\nre- Appointment of Teacher for Kitwancool Indian Day School.\n\nI have been requested by Mr. J.

Mr. Hayhurst has had no professional training and, as you state, his wife is at present employed at the Kitwanga School. I must state frankly that our experience in the employment of teachers lacking professional training has been in no sense satisfactory. Some of the officials here feel that it is a sheer waste of time and money, and I am disposed to agree with them.\n\nI am anxious, therefore, that you should take up this matter with the Bishop again and have him put forth another attempt to secure a qualified teacher for this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

We are hopeful that this new schedule will be attractive to teachers and we would appreciate it if you would nominate a qualified teacher to take charge of the school on September 1st, 1947. I enclose two copies of our regular application form which you should have completed by your nominees and forwarded to Indian Commissioner Mackay of Vancouver.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would let me know by June 15th if you will be in a position to nominate a teacher, as otherwise it is our intention to advertise.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

As the natives there are anxious to have her as teacher, I have nominated her to Indian Commissioner as they feel his approval and appointment.\n\nThere will be a number of vacancies this year in the Day Schools of the Prince Rupert and Babine Agencies and it is well nigh impossible to get qualified teachers in the West where salaries and living conditions are more attractive, in the white schools and positions easy to procure. It would be an excellent idea to advertise in the East for teachers. If you can obtain any who are of the Protestant faith, I would be happy to nominate them. Advertising last year brought no results.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nJ.B. Gibson\nBishop of Caledonia.\n\nIndian Affairs.
