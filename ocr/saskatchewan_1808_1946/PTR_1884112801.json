Mr. Parker.\n\nFRIDAY, NOVEMBER 28, 1884.\n\nSECTARIANISM.\n\nExperience is daily furnishing fresh though unnecessary proofs of the fatality of expecting that men in general will govern their conduct by any standard, intellectual, moral or christian, when it opposes the furthest interests of themselves or their own grasping greedy ends or for the due inflation of their all absorbing self importance. It is none the less amazing to find men who are as pure and uncorrupted by the evil creatures in matters spiritual or political in the last quarter of the nine-teenth century, deliberately for their own selfish ends, setting to fan into a flame the very feelings, although sometimes smothered, of the spirit of sectarian feeling. It would be a doubt a chimerical and utopian hope, that men would enter upon this great undertaking in the North West Territories\u2014taking as its point of a fresh departure, those accumulated results of the experience of the world's history, sufficiently to act upon the ethical standard of aiming at the practical end to the greatest number, or the greatest degree of christianity to love our neighbours as ourselves, but we cannot understand the nature of those men, who professing superiority, are introducing the elements of religious discord into the fabrics of our history. Of the several instances of this most pernicious conduct at present painfully conspicuous, we now concern our selves with the recent attempt made by Riell\u2014whether an unassisted emanation of his own peculiar intelligence, or the reflected intelligent consciousness of some other individuality we know not\u2014on behalf of the French Catholics, for a grant of at least $1,000 for the establishment of an institution to be conducted by the nuns in each half-breed settlement. In getting them the same treatment as their brethren received in Manitoba, they would readily co-operate, but we unhesitatingly condemn the strong sectarian character disclosed in this. That the sectarian flavor has been deliberately imparted is obvious from the fact that the demand is in addition to one for schools, hospitals and such like institutions (whatever that may mean). The idea entertained by many that this is part of a good deal thrown in to keep the half-breeds in line, leaving ample margin for reduction on the whole demands, seems to be precluded by the fact of its being deemed worthy of a separate clause containing nothing else. As far as the proposal is an absurdity, and has either been prompted by those who, while anxious to keep in the background, yet hope to reap the profit of it, or else has been suggested by the business of Riell's own mind, as a likely means of eliciting sympathy with the movement among the Roman Catholic supporters of the Government in the east, whatever the intention behind the over the idea originated, it has very considerably succeeded in killing out the sympathy of the general public, and is just another instance of how greed and cunning will over reach every thing, and will even go so far from merely from an abstract sense of justice or love of fair play, would willingly have aided the half-breeds in the Territories to equal justice with the other Manitobans, are now the only ones who can be trusted with this one. It is naturally asked why any special grant should be made by the state to a denomination which so far as we know, has never been in the Territories materially a weak one. Surely the whole tendency of the age is against anything of this character. Is the recent dis-establishment of the church in Ireland, or the attempted dis-establishment coming late of a state church in France, or if the French prefer an example from their own mother country, the attitude of the state to the church in Germany, an indication that these things are here to remain? Are the half-breeds of other denominations to be left out in the cold? Should them movement of the ritualists fail fast over running a neigh-bouring province, spread over our own and religious differences following in the wake of these English Church priests\u2014why should they not receive support? Apart from its sectarian aspect, we are determined that the French are not good for the territories, knowledge of the probable require-ments of the country for long enough would lead us to suggest that when enough of bishops to teach in schools and doctors in hospitals have been provided, and enough funds have been devoted to the importation of wives, who will remember the divine in-junction \"Be fruitful and multiply,\" then all the rest will be addressed to the sufferers of the flood as they stepped forth from the ark.\n\nTHE FLOGGING OUTRAGE.\n\nFrom the commotion which recently occurred in Winnipeg over the disgraceful and disgusting outrage of rape committed on a prisoner for doing nothing but undress the opportunity being furnished by the carelessness of his guards\u2014and for which they would have been liable to suitable re-acts, and parsimonious judged necessary under the circumstances\u2014there is a good deal of comfort to be derived. It must be a matter of common sense to those who take pride in the Saxon blood in their veins to think that whenever the opportunity occurs, our countrymen can be depended upon to make use of every legal means to express their abhorrence of any outrage or attempt at interference with the liberty or right of the subjects, even should some of them, as in the case in point, be the fault of the individual held in lawful abeyance. It should furthermore be a matter for sincere rejoicing to find the press doing their duty to the public in fully ventilating a matter which ought to be known throughout the world have handled up so utterly discreditably to their city could their consciences have approved such a course. One more ground of pride might perhaps be found in the conduct of the people justly angered as they were did not lower the dignity of their expression of opinion, by one single lawless act. In the presence of so much that was justly deserving as a matter for contemplation it is incumbent to find something of an entirely opposite character, we mean the calling out by the authorities of a military force upon the occasion. It may be that the absence of the abnormal state of the provocation may have induced the expectation of really violent proceedings on the part of the people but even under such an aspect, different views may be taken. The shedding of the blood of justly and rightly incensed people, in defence of the instigators, could be justified. The law we take it is the will of the people put into force for better or for worse, as a whole, and there are occasions where rare ones, upon which the people are justified in temporarily superseding the ordinary machinery and taking it into their own hands, the spirit of the occasion and the authorities may be very thankful that the people had too much self respect, in addition to the coolness with which they faced a force of constitutional rights to accept what certainly looked very like a challenge. Perhaps those responsible for the ap-pearance of a military force addressed to the sufferer of the outrage are not good for the territories.\n\nPUBLIC NOTICE.\n\nAll parties are hereby notified that the undersigned, Mr. R.

Officer has been transferred to P. Division and is now stationed at Regina.\n\nThe weather here is very cold and unpleasant; the ground is covered with snow.\n\nThe creek in solidity frozen over and its glassy smoothness is attracting numbers of skaters who are enjoying themselves, displaying their prowess on its surface.\n\nThe severity of the weather and the utter barrenness of the country, which has been so richly endowed by nature's bountiful gifts, has driven an abandoned party into the \"valley of the Moose Jaw Creek.\" Fourteen chickens, two cows, a number of sheep and cattle and a few dogs have been ventured to meet there on a lonely stretch of this centre of civilization.\n\nMr. W. Hering Cooper, a few days ago killed near Caron a magnificent specimen of the wind swan.\n\nWhile skating on the frozen creek a little girl was swept away, disappearing amidst almost every train arriving from the east.\n\nMr. Purves joined here from the west with 300 steers bound for Winnipeg. The cattle were purchased from Mr. Craig of the Otago district.\n\nTwo or three prospectors round Buffalo Lake at present; numbers having been shot.\n\nLast week about 1,000 head of cattle passed westward on the trail from Moose Creek by the C. P. R. to Chicago.\n\nOn Thanksgiving Day the Methodist and Presbyterian churches had a joint service in the church hall.\n\nMr. Roy, D.L.S., and party arrived here on the 5th inst. They have been served by the Government agent at Bathurst. Their cattle have been stored here and their horses sent to be wintered in the vicinity of the Moose Jaw River.\n\nOn the 6th inst. a post office was opened at Caron, sixteen miles west of Moose Jaw.\n\nOn the 8th inst. acting Sergt. Major Gordon from Regina passed west for Calgary and Fort Macleod on special duty.\n\nOn the 4th inst. hospital Sergt. Wilson passed through here on Fort Macleod where he is to be stationed.\n\nCol. Irving, accompanied by Inspector Samuels arrived here on the 11th inst., via Caron. His journey from Bathurst to Swift Current was not accomplished without considerable trouble. The river was rising deep round the island and the ferry boat was delayed. Col. Irving decided to make the journey on skates. Next day after leaving all signs of life were visible, but the river was still rising and the ferry boat was delayed. This was an impossibility; however, a body of freighters were met with, the journey was continued and the journey was completed. Until half the distance was done, when a police wagon was found, which had been delayed by the last detachment of the militia. This was promptly requisitioned and everything went well until the South Saskatchewan was reached, where their disappointment was great. The ferry dropped up high and dry on the opposite bank, and the ferry men went to work to get it off. The ferry was then done by means of a small canoe; the horses swimming across, and the wagons and goods being taken across by hand to the other side after repeated trips. This was their last difficulty, the remainder of the journey being done without any delay.\n\nA new grain mill is in course of construction. It is erected by Mr. A. E. Ogden and will be a great convenience to the stock. This ought to be a great boon to the farmers in this vicinity.\n\nMr. Roy is about to start a skating road on the frozen creek.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, the 11th inst., Mr. and Mrs. Sealey gave an oyster supper to the frequenters of the skating hall. An excellent time was enjoyed, the supper finishing with an old fashioned tally pull.\n\nMEDICINE HAT.\n\nFrom our own correspondent.\n\nMr. Sutherland shipped 300 head of cattle to Winnipeg. Mr. McLeod has also come from the Mole Lake Ranches and Mr. Medicine Hat is the nearest point of shipment for a large number of cattle.\n\nThe famous Moose Jaw Mine is working in full blast now, over 80 hands are employed, more being taken on every day.\n\nA special train with Mr. Egan and Party passed through here on Monday, the inglenook at the end of the track.\n\nOn Thanksgiving Day the weather was almost tropical warm the thermometer standing at 70 degrees in the shade at noon.\n\nMr. W. Smith, M. P. P. for Brandon, has been here for several weeks arranging for the winter supplies of the Saskatchewan Mines.\n\nMr. J. M. Guthrie, has removed his residence from Main to Ingram Street.\n\nThe proprietors of the American Hotel gave a ball on the evening of the 15th inst., to celebrate the opening of the hotel. It was highly attended, and all were pleased.\n\nInspector McMillan, who is under orders from Regina, arrived here on the evening of the 15th inst., from Regina.\n\nInspector Murray, N.W.M.P. Calgary, arrived here for Regina where he had to be stationed.\n\nThe Citizens gave a ball on the evening of the 15th inst., in the N.W.M. P. Barracks. Over 150 people were present, dancing, eating, drinking and enjoying themselves. The ballroom was filled with the most elegant of society, and the most charming of the officers, gave the scene a peculiar charm to the onlooker.\n\nThe weather continues to be very fine, and the atmosphere is warm enough to make tea very delightful in summer clothes a pleasant pastime.\n\nSwelling Fits\u2014Symptoms and Cure.\n\nThe symptoms are moderate, like peritonitis, intense itching, increased by scratching, very difficult to cure, particularly in children.
