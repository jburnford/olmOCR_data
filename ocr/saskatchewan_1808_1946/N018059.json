Conolly, seconded by Bro. M. Keenan, and Resolved\u2014That Bros. J. M. Robinson, Rev. F. M. Finn and H. Douglas be a Press committee.\n\nThe Right Worshipful Grand Master then delivered his address.\n\nGRAND MASTER'S ADDRESS.\n\nTo the Members of the Grand Orange Lodge of Manitoba and the North-West Territories.\n\nBrethren,\n\nIt affords me pleasure to again meet the representatives of the Order from the different lodges in Manitoba and the Northwest.\n\nOn entering on a new decade it is earnestly hoped that the same prosperity will attend the order which has marked its progress since the first meeting of Grand Lodge, this day 20 years ago.\n\nProtestants of Canada have been much disturbed during the past few years owing to the favoritism shewn its enemies by powers in high authority, and nothing was more natural than in the late general election differences of opinion should exist, even in our own ranks; but now that the elections are over and that the people have expressed their opinions at the polls as constitutional abiding citizens, we have no alternative but to bow to that decision, and let the principles of our institution be the guiding star of our actions, more so in the future than in the past.\n\nAs will be seen by the reports of your Grand Secretary and Grand Treasurer, the Order in Manitoba and the Northwest Territories was never in a more prosperous condition, numerically, financially and fraternally, than at the close of the past Orange year. This success must, to a large extent, be attributed to the energy and zeal of your Grand Lodge Officers, particularly that of your Grand Secretary, Brother Kernaghan, than whom no better officer could be desired. In this connection I would take the liberty to suggest the propriety of increasing the remuneration of your Secretary, as I am aware that he is not sufficiently paid for the work done. In looking over his correspondence and work it will be perceived that his duties are increasing in proportion to the rapid progress of the Order, and now that the Grand Lodge is financially in a position to afford ample remuneration to its officers there is no reason why it should not be considered immediately.\n\n12th OF JULY CELEBRATION.\n\nIn accordance with a resolution of the Grand Lodge at last meeting, deciding to have a Provincial demonstration in Winnipeg on 12th of July last. The special committee appointed took steps early in the year with a view to the successful accomplishment of the undertaking. Most reasonable passenger rates were obtained from the Canadian Pacific, Manitoba & Northwestern, and the Northern Pacific Railroads. Special trains were engaged for the day requiring a guarantee deposit of $2000 before the\ntrains left the station. Through the liberality of some of the Brethren of Winnipeg and Portage la Prairie, this amount was paid the railroad companies on 11th of July. Your committee of arrangement held meetings daily for over two weeks, and did every thing in their power to make the demonstration a success. The price of tickets was so arranged that they would press more lightly on those who had long distances to come. The 12th, however, arrived and as usual a most beautiful Manitoba mid-summer morning, and I cannot better describe the success of the celebration than read you the following from a city of Winnipeg newspaper by no means too friendly to the Order.\n\n**Thousands in the City.**\n\nThe Orange Celebration to-day -- Nine Special Trains arrive this Morning and Afternoon--The Procession.\n\nLoyal Citizens of the Dominion\u2014the Orangemen of Manitoba and the Territories\u2014are in the city to-day by thousands. It is needless to bid them welcome. We are a free people, living in a free country, where all classes and creeds demand and have a right to think and act in accordance with the free doctrines upon which our constitution is founded; so that to-day the Orangemen are asking no favors or special privileges. Winnipeg is glad to have them. Yesterday afternoon the Canadian Pacific railway allayed all fears of the demonstration committee that the train accommodation would be too limited, by sending out word that there would be a place for everybody who desired to come in. What a scene there was throughout Manitoba to-day. Fathers, mothers, sons and daughters, grandfathers and grandmothers, people who never saw the city and those who have, but were anxious to see it again and honor the 12th, turned many a home into a state of excitement as they rumaged around for their Sunday best, and got to the train in good time, so that, as the Irishman said, if they forgot anything they would have time to go back and fetch it. What a tooting of band instruments and playing of 12th of July airs, \"The Protestant Boys,\" and so on. The like was never before seen in the country, and it may be many a long day before there is such another wholesale excursion on the part of the western people. Nothing short of the mountain steeps of the Rockies in the west and the wilds of Keewatin in the east prevented the celebration being national in extent. Orangemen are here from Calgary in the west to Rat Portage in the east, from the extreme south to the extreme north; from the United States 'o the south\u2014in fact people from all parts of the compass. Nearly 300 excursionists arrived Friday night.\nThis morning and afternoon, when the specials began to come in, the scene was beyond description. A novice calculator of crowds would have affirmed that the outside districts must certainly be completely depopulated. The first train to arrive at the C. P. R. depot at 10:45 was from Manitou. Every car was loaded with hundreds of the finest people on earth\u2014the tillers of the soil in the garden district of the province. Forty-five minutes later a Carberry train arrived. It was a toss-up as to which train contained the better looking lot of folks. The M. & N. W. Ry., Boissevain, Glenboro, Brandon local and West Brandon trains brought in thousands upon thousands. Careful estimators said that not less than 10,000 alighted from the cars. The Stonewall train increased the already large influx, and the regular eastern express and the Great Northern trains now arriving caused the depot platform to be jammed, and a perfect sea of humanity swayed to and fro for hours. The moment one contingent moved off there was another to take its place. Poor Mr. Swain, the depot master. He was patient as anyone could be, and answered a thousand or more questions that were asked of him. A half-dozen in one place were asking when the trains bearing friends would be in, and others were asking when they would have to be onboard so as not to miss the train going hom. One fortunate matter was the scarcity of baggage. Ninety-five per cent. of the folks had nothing with them but what was on their backs. There were numerous vacancies\u2014within\u2014and it didn\u2019t take those lodges long to form into procession and make a bee line for their hotels, where they were consigned as follows:\n\nNo. 891, Souris, at the Park hotel.\nNo. 165, Glenboro, at the Park hotel.\nNo. 1531, Souris, at the Park hotel.\nNo. 1545, Boissevain, at the Park hotel.\nNo. 1501, Elton, at the Park hotel.\nNo. 1490, Carman, at the New Douglas house.\nNo. 1514, Carman, at the New Douglas house.\nNo. 1355, Holland, at the Cabinet hotel.\nNo. 1352, Foxton, at the Cabinet hotel.\nNo. 1646, Stonewall, at the Cabinet hotel.\nNo. 1512, Brandon, at the Cabinet hotel.\nNo. 1511, Carberry, at the Windsor house.\nNo. 1507, McGregor, at the Grand Pacific.\nNo. 1353, Thornhill, at the Mansion house.\nNo. 1494, Neepawa, at the Grand Union.\nNo. 1497, Manitou, at the Clifton house.\nNo. 1522, Fairburn, at the Nicollet house.\nNo. 1457, Morden, at the Winnipeg hotel.\nNo. 1351, Portage la Prairie, at the Clarendon.\nNo. 1354, High Bluff, at the Clarendon.\nNo. 1534, Rowland, at the American and Russell.\nNo. 1504, Carberry, at the Whelan house.\nNo. 1558, Creecord, at the Gault house.\nNo. 1567, Treherne, at the Palmer house.\nNo. 1519, Virden, at the Leland house.\nNo. 1443, Meadow Lea, at the Porteous restaurant.\nNos. 1500, 1503, 1508, 1513, Rock Lake, at the Brunswick hotel.\nNo. 962, Greenway, at the Grand Central.\n\nButchers, bakers, market gardeners, grocers have done a rushing business for days past in supplying the great demand made upon them by the hotels preparing for the 12th. It is well that elaborate preparations were made, as thousands of hungry farmers, many of them not having partaken of food since daybreak, had gorgeous appetites and got away with a lot of Winnipeg victuals in a surprisingly short space of time. Dinner over, and an immense task it was to feed the people, the lodges began to fall in by counties, shortly before two o'clock, taking their positions as under:\n\n| MAIN STREET | |\n|-------------|---|\n| Alexander St. W. | Alexander St. E. |\n| True Blue Lodges | Brandon County |\n| McWilliam St. W. | McWilliam St. E. |\n| Norfolk County | Turtle Mount'n Co. |\n| Rupert St. W. | Rupert St. E. |\n| Rock Lake County | Dufferin County |\n| James St. W. | James St. E. |\n| Minnedosa County | Minota County |\n| Market St. W. | Market St. E. |\n| Portage County | Lady True Blues, G. |\n| Markt City Hall | L. Officers and Speakers in carriages |\n| William St. Orange | |\n| Young Britons | |\n\nSelkirk Co.\nBy falling in on the streets indicated there was little difficulty in forming the procession, and the Orangemen marched up Main Street as follows:\n\n**GRAND TYLER, MOUNTED.**\n\n**WINNIPEG TRUE BLUE BAND.**\n\nMembers of Winnipeg True Blue Lodge, Brandon True Blue Band, members of Brandon and Souris True Blue Lodges.\n\n**BRANDON BRASS BAND.**\n\nLodges 891, 1501, 1503, 1504, 1510, 1511, 1512, 1523, 1531, 1558, of the Orange County of Brandon.\n\nLodges 1355, 1464, 1568, of the Orange County of Norfolk.\n\n**BOISSEVAIN BRASS BAND.**\n\nLodges 1522, 1541, 1545, of the Orange County of Turtle Mountain.\n\nLodges 1400, 1502, 1573, 1585, 962, of the Orange County of Rock Lake.\n\n**MORDEN BRASS BAND.**\n\nLodges No. 1353, 1457, 1490, 1497, 1514 and 1534, of the Orange County of Dufferin.\n\n**VIRDEN BRASS BAND.**\n\nLodges No. 1531, 1519, 1524, 1567, 1569 and 1583, of the Orange County of Minota.\n\n**PORTAGE LA PRAIRIE BRASS BAND.**\n\nLodges No. 1351, 1354, 1443, 1507, of the Orange County of Portage la Prairie.\n\n**CARBERRY BRASS BAND.**\n\nCarberry Orange Young Britons lodge.\n\nWinnipeg Orange Young Britons lodge.\n\n**WINNIPEG BRASS BAND.**\n\nLodges No. 243, 1307, 1352, 1467 and 1520 of the Orange County of Selkirk.\n\nLady True Blues in Carriages.\n\nGrand Lodge Officers and speakers in carriages.\n\nIt was a grand procession. Winnipeggers and the visitors from the country lined the streets in thousands and gazed on the grand parade as it passed along Main street to Broadway; up Broadway to Smith street; down Smith street to Notre Dame street west; along Princess to Market street; from Market to Main street; down Main street to Logan street; up Logan street to Dufferin Park, where the speechifying was to take place. A large platform was erected about fifty feet out from, and facing the grand stand, which was crowded with ladies.\n\nI deem it my duty as your chief officer and chairman of the management committee, to thank the officers and members for their co-operation, and more particularly for their exemplary conduct during the whole day, to\nthe credit of the Orangemen and those who accompanied them be it said that not one man could be seen under the influence of liquor and it was the universal exclamation that in the history of the Capital no more numerous, no more orderly, and no more well-conducted body of people ever paraded the streets of Winnipeg. While the demonstration of the past 12th was numerically and morally all that could be desired, you will perceive by the report of the committee that it also proved financially a success, your committee being able to place to the credit of this Grand Lodge, over and above all expenses, a sum ranging between eleven and twelve hundred dollars.\n\nDuring the year past I have been asked many questions in connection with the working of the Orange order, some of a legal character, which I found myself unable to answer. Our association in this Province being incorporated by a Provincial as well as a Dominion charter, different in Substance and in form, questions may at any time arise which require the attention of a legal gentleman. I would therefore suggest, as a corporation, that this Lodge appoint an additional officer, to be called the \"Grand Solicitor,\" whose duty it would be to advise this Grand Lodge on all matters connected with it as a corporation.\n\nI am glad to perceive that my recommendation at last meeting for the establishment of a Grand Lodge for the Territories, are about being carried into effect. It will be the duty of the brethren of Manitoba to aid our brethren in the West in every possible manner.\n\nFor 20 years I have devoted some time and attention to promote the interests of the Orange Association, and in early days at a great personal sacrifice. I have tried hard to remove in this country the prejudices existing against it in other places. I have struggled hard to make Manitoba a place where every man, of whatever creed, clime or country, could enjoy the benefits of his own opinions undisturbed. I believe our Province today bears testimony to our efforts in this respect.\n\nA few years ago when we sought incorporation for the Orange association in this Province our Bill passed through the Legislature with the almost unanimous support of the peoples representatives of all sides of politics, a circumstance unparalleled in the history of the order in any other Province. I consider then, as I firmly believe now, that in this Province particularly the policy of the Orange institution should be independent, in other words more patriotic than partizan, more Protestant than party. On these principles I stand, in defense of these principles I am prepared to fall. If you agree with me, so much the pleasure; if you disagree, I am sorry. If I have served you so long blameless, to me it is gratifying; if I have displeased anyone lately, love for the institution prompted it, duty, in my estimation, required it.\n\nYours Fraternally,\n\nSTEWART MULVEY,\nGrand Master.\nMoved by B. O. J. M. Robinson, seconded by Bro. F. D. Stewart, and\n\nResolved\u2014That the able, eloquent, and opportune address of the Grand Master be referred to the Committee on Correspondence.\n\nThe Grand Secretary then presented his annual report as follows:\n\nGRAND SECRETARY'S REPORT.\n\nTo the R. W. Grand Master, Officers and Members of the R. W. Grand Orange Lodge of Manitoba and N. W. T.\n\nR. W. Sir and Brethren:\u2014It is with feelings of gratitude to God, that I have the privilege of again meeting with you at this, the nineteenth annual session of this Grand Lodge, and of placing before you my third annual report as your Grand Secretary. In doing so I will try and give you a statement of the work of the Association in this jurisdiction, as far as it is possible for me to do so.\n\nIn looking over the year just closed we see much that is encouraging, although not unmingled with disappointments. Brethren it is my pleasing duty to inform you of the organization and resuscitation of a larger number of lodges, than for a number of years previous.\n\nWARRANTS.\n\nNine new warrants have been issued as follows, viz.:\n1588 to Bro. W. L. Hames, Alameda, Assiniboia County.\n1590 to Bro. Jas. Willoughby, Creeford, Minnedosa County.\n962 to Bro. J. Sexsmith, Ash Creek, Rock Lake County.\n1595 to John W. Elliot, Pasqua, Assiniboia County.\n1598 to Philip Beauchamy, Lake Dauphin, Minnedosa County.\n1599 to W. E. Fisher, Caron, Assiniboia County.\n1600 to William Clarke, Pense, Assiniboia County.\n1601 to John H. Switzer, Silver Creek, Shoal Lake County.\n1602 to David Philips, Morris, Franklin County.\n\nThe latter being incorporated under the Dominion Act and the following have been resuscitated, viz.:\n1456, Bro. Geo. Johnstone, W. M., Emerson, Franklin County.\n1510, Byo. William Orr, W. M., Wellwood, Brandon County.\n1511, Bro. J. Maguire, W. M., Carberry, Brandon County.\n\nOnly one lodge is reported dormant, viz., 1523, Rapid City, which according to Bro. James Hardaker's letter, which is on file, could easily be reorganized.\n\nBy resolution of this Grand Lodge, at its last session, I was instructed to call in Warrant No. 962, issued to Bro. Jos. Barker, of Glenboro, in 1888, and never opened, which I did, and I transferred it to Rock Lake County, where it is working and in a flourishing condition.\n\nOne Royal Scarlet Dispensation has been issued to Isolated, Primary Lodge No 1549, Medicine Hat.\n\nAn application has been received for a Primary lodge at Lethbridge, N. W. T., with Bro. G. W. Steele as W. M., which was duly forwarded the M. W. G. Secretary, and the warrant, no doubt, will be issued shortly. I would here call the attention of the brethren to the fact that the application fee for a Primary Warrant, is now $10.00, which covers cost of incorporation.\n\nRETURNS.\n\nBlank forms for annual returns were mailed, together with the usual circular of instructions to the W. M. of all the Primary Lodges, on Nov. 20th, District Masters on Dec. 25th, and County Masters on January 7th, 1891.\n\n64 of the Primary lodges have sent in duplicate returns. 10 have not done so, they are 1528, Moosomin; 1542, Moose Jaw; 1544, Davidsburg; 1548, Oakburn; 1559, Hill Farm; 1561, Workman; 1573, Cartwright; 1598, Lake Dauphin; 1600, Pense; 1601, Silver Creek.\n\nMy report of the numerical strength of the Association must be imperfect, owing to those lodges not sending in returns and to the very careless manner in which many of the officers make out their returns. Only 8 of the counties have complied with rule 51, page 19, of the constitution. Such gross neglect should be stopped, and at once.\n\nThe 64 lodges report a membership of ...................... 1593\n\nAnd placing the membership of those 10 lodges the same as last year, which is ........................................... 112\n\nWould make a total membership of .................. 1705\n\nThere have been Initiated .................................. 212\nJoined by Certificate ........................................ 207\nReinstated ........................................... 5\n\nTotal .............................................. 424\n\nAgainst that there have been\nWithdrawn by Certificate .................................. 111\nSuspended ............................................. 48\nExpelled ............................................... 8\nDied .................................................... 8\n\nTotal .............................................. 175\n\nTotal Gain 249.\n\nThe largest increase reported is that of 1507, McGregor, 18 Initiated and 8 joined by Certificate.\n\nThe following Counties have not made returns: Turtle Mountain, Portage la Prairie, Assiniboia and Shoal Lake, the latter not for two years.\n\nThe correspondence has more than doubled that of any previous year. All letters received are on file and my replies to those of most importance, are copied in the Grand Lodge letter book. All of which will be laid before the proper committee.\n\nIn accordance with a resolution passed at last session of this Grand Lodge, I mailed copies of resolution re Separate Schools and Dual Language, to Mr. McCarthy and all English speaking Dominion Parliament representatives, who hold seats from Manitoba and North-West. I also mailed copies of all resolutions and recommendations, re Constitutional Amendments to the M. W. G. Secretary, immediately after the close of last session of this Grand Lodge.\n\nNotice of an appeal against the decision of this R. W. G. Lodge, given at its last session, re the election of officers in Franklin County, was received from Bro. David Philips, and all documents relating thereto, were duly forwarded the M. W. Grand Secretary.\n\nThe usual Railway arrangements were made for conveying delegates to and from this meeting for one and one third fare, and certificates mailed to all entitled to them.\n\nYour Grand Secretary would here acknowledge receipts of printed reports from the the Grand Lodges of Scotland, Ireland, New Zealand, Ladies L. O. Association of U. S. and Canada, M. W. G. Lodge B. A., Middle Island, New Zealand; Ontario West and East, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, P. E. Island, O. Y. Britons and True Blues.\nThe perusal of them must impress the reader with the greatness and rapid progress of the Order throughout the world. I am pleased to note the marvellous growth of the True Blue Association, their G. Secretary reporting the formation of nineteen new lodges, and of having doubled their membership, during the past year. I believe it to be the duty of this G. Lodge to assist our junior orders, in establishing lodges in this province. They have always proved a grand recruiting field for the Orange Association. The ladies of this Order have undertaken, and I am confident, will carry through to a successful issue a grand and noble work, viz., the establishment of a True Blue orphanage, in Toronto, for the purpose of caring for and rescuing Protestant orphans from Romish institutions throughout the Dominion.\n\nTHE SENTINEL.\n\nBrethren, I will again call your attention to the importance of increasing the circulation of this valuable paper, which should be supported by every Protestant, and I trust that ere this session closes, every member, who is not now a subscriber, will add his name to the list.\n\nI have pleasure also in referring to another thorough Protestant journal, published in New Glasgow, N. S., called the \"Vindicator,\" edited by Bro. W. D. Taunton, Junior D. G. Master of that province.\n\nI have also received sample copies of the Protestant Standard of Philadelphia, the Protestant Herald of Pittsburg, and the Patriotic American of Detroit. All of these are ever watchful of and true to the interest of civil and religious liberty.\n\nAccompanying this report, will be found a detailed statement of my account for the year, showing the receipts to be $165.87, and disbursements $166.20\n\nAnd now in conclusion, I beg to tender my fellow Grand Lodge officers and all the representatives of the various lodges, my deep felt appreciation of the kindly forbearing manner in which I have always been treated, which has made my duties a pleasure, during the three years I have held the office of Grand Secretary. It has always been my humble aim to do all in my power to advance the interests of our noble Order, and I trust that in this respect I have not come short of your expectations. And now brethren I fervently pray that God, Who ruleth everywhere, may so guide and govern the heart and actions of each of us, that the work of this session, may be done in harmony, that we may fully realize how good and pleasant it is for\nBrethren to dwell together in unity.\n\nI am Dear Brethren,\nFaithfully and Fraternally Yours,\nW. J. Kernaghan,\nGrand Secretary.\n\nSECRETARY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENT.\n\nW. J. Kernaghan, G. S., in account with the R. W. G. Lodge of\n1890 Manitoba and N. W.

Wigmore, seconded by Bro. Jos. Quinn.\n\nResolved\u2014That the report of the Grand Secretary be received and landed to the committee on correspondence and Finance committee.\n\nThe Grand Treasurer then presented his annual report, as follows:\n\nGRAND TREASURER'S REPORT.\n\nTo the R. W. Grand Master, Officers and Members of the R. W. Grand Orange Lodge of Manitoba and N. W. T.\n\nR. W Sir and Brethren,\u2014I have much pleasure in submitting for your consideration the Annual Financial Statement for the year ending March 18, 1891, being the fifth as your Grand Treasurer, I have the honor to present to you. At the last annual meeting of the Grand Lodge there was a cash balance of $186.48, and I have received during the past year the sum of $432.20. These amounts added together make a total of $618.68.\nThis amount is derived from the following sources:\n\nBalance on Hand, 5th March, 1890, .................. $186 48\nGrand Lodge Dues to date .................................. 165 00\nTax per Capita to date ........................................ 265 20\nPresentation Fund .............................................. 2 00\n\nTotal ......................................................... $618 68\n\nI have disbursed from the General Fund, during the year the sum of ........................................... $518 77\n\nLeaving a balance on hand to General Fund of ........ $99 91\n\nThere is also the sum of $1150.47 to the credit of this Grand Lodge, in the Commercial Bank of Manitoba, which is the proceeds of the celebration which was held in the city of Winnipeg on the 12th July last. Taking these amounts added together, places to the credit of this Grand Lodge, the very handsome sum of $1250.33.\n\nI regret to say that from some cause, not more than one half of the Primary lodges in the jurisdiction, have made the necessary returns to the Grand Treasurer, so that I am unable to make as full a financial report as I otherwise would, and I would urge upon the County Officers to use the utmost vigilance, immediately after county meetings, to have their reports prepared and forwarded to the proper Grand Officers, who will then be enabled to submit to this Grand Lodge such reports as will enable all parties interested to see at a glance, the status and financial standing of our Order. During the past year I used every means in my power to collect the outstanding accounts and have succeeded in collecting all except about half a dozen lodges. The same state of affairs presents itself, at the present time and I trust that in the future this difficulty will become less apparent from year to year.\n\nWith best wishes to my brethren and trusting that the present meeting of the Grand Lodge, will prove both pleasant and profitable.\n\nI am Yours Fraternally,\n\nFRANK D. STEWART.\nGrand Treasurer.\n\nGENERAL FUND.\n\n| Date     | Name            | L.O.L. No. | G. L.

That early in the year, your Committee met and made preliminary arrangements with the C. P. R., M. and N. W. and Northern Pacific Railroad Companies for passenger rates to Winnipeg. Nine special trains were engaged, requiring a special guarantee deposit of $2,300 by the Committee.\n\nYour committee held some twenty special meetings for the occasion, entailing a great amount of labor and responsibility. The prices were made as low as possible. We are glad to be able to report that the thousands who took advantage of the rates to participate in the demonstration, taxed all the railroads to their utmost capacity.\n\nThe day and demonstration were in every way a success, the conduct of the brethren being everything that could be desired.\n\nThe sum total realised from the sale of tickets, etc., amounted to $1516.02. Total amount of payments under the head of expense, in connection with the day, amounted to $365.55. Leaving a respectable balance of $1150.47 to the credit of this Grand Lodge.\n\nThe committee desire to thank the C. P. R., the Manitoba & North-Western, and the Northern Pacific railroads for their liberality in rates, also for their increasing efforts; under unexpected difficulties, in trying to make the excursionists as comfortable as possible.\n\nThe committee desire to express their thanks through you to the thousands, who participated in the day's celebration, for their excellent conduct throughout the day. It was the general remark that no more quiet or orderly gathering ever was seen in the city of Winnipeg.\n\nSTEWART MULVEY, Chairman,\nW. J. Kernaghan, Secretary.\nMoved by Bro. Jas.

That the Grand Master's address be published in full in the proceedings of this most Worshipful Grand Lodge and that the suggestion to increase the salary of the Grand Secretary be acted upon by the finance committee. In regard to the recommendation of the appointment of a Grand Lodge solicitor, we do not think it is necessary that such officer should be appointed at the present time.\n\n2. Referring to the letter addressed to the Grand Secretary by Bro. A. G. Hamilton, of Moosomin, stating that the Orangemen of the Territories had decided to form themselves into a Grand Lodge and also to a clause in the Grand Master's address, referring to the same matter, your committee are of the opinion that it is not advisable to institute a Grand Lodge in the Territories at the present time for the following reasons: 1st, the country intended to be embraced by that grand lodge, is entirely too sparsely settled to warrant the establishment of such Grand Lodge. 2nd, Your committee have reasons to believe that some of the most important lodges of the Territories are opposed to the movement. Your committee would therefore recommend that a petition be forwarded to the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge, praying that body not to grant the separation of the Territories from the jurisdiction of this Grand Lodge.\n\n3. Your committee beg to compliment your Grand Secretary upon the satisfactory report he has given of the work of his office and would recommend that it be printed in full in the Grand Lodge minutes.\n\n4. In regard to a letter from Bro. Niblock, asking that the Rev. Bro.
