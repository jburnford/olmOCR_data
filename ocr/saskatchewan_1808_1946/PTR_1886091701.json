And wild flowers bloomed in glorious gay. He knew not where he was going, but his heart was filled with thoughts of love. To see the flowers there and there and polish a sword.\n\nAnd so he came to an old child who did. Having no fear, he came near to see. The beautiful flowers sent each year. When, perchance, he came face to face with a little girl of a sweet grace. And as bright as the morning rose. And as soft as the evening dew. Unmoved by solemn alarms\u2014 Their eyes telling, as no tongue could, their hearts' secrets, and their souls' charms. Thus fate made him little sweetheart. And have from that day each been known. Through life's many years they have kept A pledge of faith unmarred by doubt.\n\nH. T. McPhillips\n\nTHE FLAG OF CANADA.\n\nOh! how the flag was born at our side. Over the deep to earth's furthest bound. It takes a nation's life then begins With its first breath, as the eagle soars Upward to flight, as the flight unfolds Unto its native breeze. Let it flutter and curl On every wind, and let it wave And overshadow us with its majesty Till the last star fades from the blue. When earthly glory shall pass away.\n\nH. T. McPhillips\n\nSTEEL'S SCOUTS.\n\nPRESENTATION OF MEDAL\u2014SPEECH BY GEN STRANGE\u2014ADDRESS, PERSONATION AND REPLY.\n\n(Portage la Cloche, Ont.)\n\nOn Saturday evening, September 4th, Steele's Scouts were presented with the medal awarded for service during the last war. General Strange was present; his appearance was greeted with hearty cheers. He made a few remarks congratulating the men on the occasion, and asked Mr. Beaton to make the presentations. One by one the men were called up, and each signed the roll. General Strange gave them hearty shake of the hand, and expressed a wish that the recruits might long live to see the knowledge which he had so well earned. The ceremony was manifestly most impressive, and when the General, at the conclusion, asked them to dress them he received unanimous applause.\n\nHe said: \"My comrades\u2014on account of age you may not be able to serve as soldiers during the next few years, and I have never commanded a corps that I admired more than this. I am glad to see that the enthusiasm which has been shown by Steele's Scouts is bravery and the chivalry of Alberta (applause). It is impossible that any man who has seen you may pass you in the streets and perhaps be unable to recognize your individual features, nor will you forget that gallant troop of men, nor will you ever have been enabled to render the country you love more illustrious, but you may (Cheers). I may say that I am glad all here to night. Some of you have come a long distance, and you are satisfied and others are not. But wherever you may be, I trust and believe there will ever be a bond of sympathy and affection between you and those who have served in the same. Without your assistance in the foreground would have been more impossible to move such large forces of infantry, cavalry, artillery with train and wagons, through that country and you know that a country was infested by Indians. You have been the gallant 65th\u2014(cheers)\u2014but with little military experience. But in moving in the rear of the column, you have been well served by your thin line of scouts under the gallant Steele. (Cheers) The Indians were very savage when engaged, and in my report I stated that you were the eyes, ears and feelings of the force. You have had little experience, but you have been a source of comfort. (Cheers) I assure you had I found fault with any of the men of your corps or greatly questioned your conduct, that would be the end of the campaign, and I will always feel proud to have commanded you. (Applause) I have nothing to say about anything in the papers about part of the reports not having been published. Gen. Middleton is not here to night and I do not intend to say anything of the matter in dispute, only this that Major Steele's report regarding the Indians, me, was entirely forwarded to Gen. Middleton and it has not been published. But it is necessary for me to know that we did our duty and did our best. (Applause) Some of you are American citizens, but this campaign shows that Canada is thicker than water. (Cheers) Yet fell into line to help the citizens of Canada in their own borders. It was a feeling, worthy of note. I hope I will not live too late to see the fruits of our labours, and the occasion remembered, for it is worthy of being remembered. (Cheers) I know that you may be wanting to see me again, but I am sure that the campaign, for these purposes, are still fresh, and will long remain fresh in your memories. (Applause) You have been, after that long march to Pitt, with all its attendant hardships and dangers, but while making the perilous passage you did not need to be reminded of the incidents. But while making it Steele's Scouts were always ready to respond to the call. When I looked forward I could always see the country dotted over in a scene such with Indians like that of the last campaign. If the Indians did not want to get inside that ring fence (Laughter and applause.) After the speech was ended, General Strange turned toward me and said: \"I am glad to see that you have made that decision, and that they will now wear their uniforms like the real thing.\" (Applause.) Continuing General Strange had served with the cavalry corps of different provinces, Sikhs, Plains and Mounted, but he thought that Alberta had a better corps than that of Alberta. He believed that Alberta would yet be a great province. He said: \"I am very sorrowful that Major Steele, Capt. Owen, and Lunt, Corryell were not present, but I could not carry a vote in my favour to have them here, but the public media, I felt that I could not wear medal that was not given to all the men who served in the campaign. Sir John Macdonald has made that decision, and that they will now wear their uniforms like the real thing.\" (Applause.) Continuing General Strange had served with the cavalry corps of different provinces, Sikhs, Plains and Mounted, but he thought that Alberta had a better corps than that of Alberta.
