Onion Lake, Sask.\n\nAugust 10th... 1923.\n\nF. H. Paget, Esq.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Paget,\n\nThe cheques recently sent me for Mr. and Mrs. C. Hebert, school teachers at Cold Lake reserve, were made out for a much larger amount than formerly. They had heard nothing of any increase having been granted them, nor had I. Please let me know if the cheques are O.K. as Mr. and Mrs. Hebert are afraid to spend them although assured by me that everything was right. However, I promised them that I would make sure, and let them know on my next visit.\n\nWith kind regards and wishes for your good health.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, August 20, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to the amount of salary for the June quarter sent to Mr. and Mrs. Hebert, teachers at the Cold Lake Indian day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Hebert was appointed teacher at salary of $650.00 per annum and Mrs. Hebert assistant teacher at salary of $350.00 per annum. They began duties September 5, 1922, and when the return for the quarter ending September 30, 1922, was received, it showed that they had taught 19 days and, as there are 200 teaching days in the school year, Mr. Hebert was paid for that quarter 19/200 of $650.00, or $61.75 and Mrs. Hebert 19/200 of $350.00, or $33.25.\n\nFor December quarter each teacher was paid one-fourth of the yearly salary and a like amount was allowed for the March quarter.\n\nWhen the June quarter return was received, all returns previously received during the last school year, were checked and it was found that from September 5, 1922, to June 30, 1923, they had taught the required number of days, namely, 200, and the balance due to complete their yearly salary was, therefore, paid. The cheques forwarded were correct.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, SASK.\n\nRussell T.

However, as you have signed the return it is presumed that you agree with the teacher and payment is being allowed to him for the three months of July, August and September and two months holidays should be taken during the winter, as the Department can only allow salary for ten teaching months in the present school year, which ends June 30th, next.\n\nPlease advise during what month the holidays will be taken at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Hebert, teacher of the Cold Lake Indian Day School, writes the Department stating that he and his wife have not received their salary cheques for the quarter ending June 30th, last. The reason for this is that the June quarter return from that school has not yet reached the Department. Please arrange with the teacher to forward these to the Department at once.\n\nIn order that the teacher may not be inconvenienced any further, the cheques for the amount due to both him and his wife are being enclosed.\n\nPrevious to March 31st, last, Mr. Hebert was allowed salary at the rate of $750.00 for the ten teaching months and Mrs. Hebert $350.00, plus bonus of $150.00 in each case. Payment of the bonus to teachers in Indian day schools was discontinued from March 31st, last, but the Department decided to increase the salaries of teachers by $150.00. From April 1st, last, Mr. Hebert's salary is $900.00 for the ten teaching months and Mrs. Hebert's $500.00.\n\nI would refer you to official letter of April 22nd, last, in which you were requested to secure from Mr. and Mrs. Hebert a refund of $15.00 each for overpayment of bonus for the month of January, last. As this amount has not been refunded, it has been decided to deduct the same from the June quarter salary. The following statement shows the balance due both Mr. and Mrs. Hebert, cheques for which amounts are enclosed.\n\nC. Hebert, salary April, May & June, 3/10 of $900 ..$270.00\nLess overpayment of bonus for January ..................$15.00\n\nBalance due ........................................$255.00\n\nMrs. C. Hebert, salary April, May & June, 3/10 of $500 ..$150.00\nLess overpayment of bonus for January ..................$15.00\n\nBalance due ........................................$135.00\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake,\nSASK.\n\nRussell Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, November 2, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI am returning herewith the September quarter return of the Cold Lake Indian Day School. The holidays at this school were taken during the months of December, 1924, and January, 1925, and the Department therefore thought that this school would be open during July, August and September of this year. The return, however, states that the school was open only 42 days during the September quarter. Please state what months it was open and furnish any other information that you have available.\n\nI would also refer you to official letter of September 10th, last, in which you were informed that the Department had not received the June quarter return of this school. Please arrange with the teacher to prepare this and you should forward it when sending back the September quarter return.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSir,\u2014 \n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, No. 115-3-3, and in reply to state that I have seen Mr. C. Hebert, the teacher at the Indian Day School at Cold Lake, and he informs me that owing to sickness in his family he was forced to close the school and to go to British Columbia during the month of July.\n\nAs I was at that time away from the Agency, on sick leave, Mr. Hebert stated that he telegraphed to the Indian Commissioner's Office for permission to close the school during the month of July, and received permission on June 26th, last.\n\nWith respect to the June returns for this School, it appears from the Office files that this return was mailed - together with that for the Long Lake Indian Day School - on July 30th, last. However, as it appears to have gone astray I am now enclosing a copy, together with the September quarter return.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n**SASKATCHEWAN**\n\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\n**TEACHERS' SALARIES**\n\n**FOR QUARTER ENDED September 30 1925**\n\n| NAME OF TEACHER | NAME OF SCHOOL | ANNUAL GRANT OR SALARY | AMOUNT DUE | ADDRESS TO WHICH CHEQUE IS TO BE SENT |\n|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Chas.

This additional room is now used by the Sisters as a living room. The allowance made to this school is for teacher $400, Assistant and Field Matron $300 and rent of building $240.

Crombie, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nLe Joffre 25 March 1918\n\nTo Mr. Libby & Co.\n\nUnion Lake\n\nApril 8th.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn answer to your letter of the 4th instant I beg to say that your perfectly willing to have all the first floor of the house arranged for a very close room, but we are much incumbered in doing so.\n\nIt is true that the number of pupils enrolled since the opening of the school is a pretty good one, being something about 65 or 70, but the average attendance has very seldom been over 30, while out of these only 20 only come very regularly the whole year round, the other coming just once or twice. The more regular pupils should be kept together so not to mix too many standards and it seems more convenient for the welfare of those more advanced pupils to have different rooms so that one teacher can attend to the backward children while the teacher gives all her attention to the others. Even if the room was large it's just inconvenient to have two teachers in the\nBesides teaching proper we are teaching the girls sewing, knitting, weaving etc etc. Whereas the boys are learning to take off their coats for the purpose of the sake of good discipline during this time. We have the boys and girls in the same room for manual work. It would be the utmost disorder without any real benefit could be derived from such teaching as they have not the least idea about these things. So our Sister takes the girls and the Teacher Boys the boys in the school room for cotton, rope and plastering work.\n\nWe have to use our own kitchens to prepare the midday meal for the children. If the department should think the rent for three rooms is too high, I can build a school house large enough to have 3 rooms, 2 Class rooms and one kitchen, and supply them with every thing needed which has not been done until now, for we are still using the benches of the Church as seats for the school, and the only two tables have been supplied by the mission.\n\nI hope you will be satisfied with my explanation. Our understanding that we can hardly do any more for two sisters are willing to take care of the child so they can get a greater advantage of their coming to school, it is without a proper education for them.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSir,\n\nReference File No. I32985-1, April 16th 1918.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of the above communication regarding Cold Lake Day School. I have read Father Dophin's letter and beg to return same herewith. Notwithstanding what Rev. Father Dophin says regarding class arrangements I am still of the opinion that the rooms must be overcrowded at times, although the ventilation is well looked after by the Sisters.\n\nI do not suppose that it is the intention of the Department to erect any permanent building for school purposes at Cold Lake Reserve, nor would I consider it wise to do so until such time as the Day School proves to be a permanent success. At a comparatively small expense a lean-to addition could be made to the present mission building which would provide the necessary class room accommodation and overcome the possibility of inconveniencing the sisters in their limited quarters.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, May 2, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo in regard to the Cold Lake Day School and returning Father Dauphin's letter, which was sent you by the Department.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is not the intention of the Department at the present time to erect any school building at Cold Lake.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. B. Crombie, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa, May 2, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your letter of the 1st ultimo with which you enclosed a letter from the Rev. Father Dauphin in regard to the Cold Lake Day School and stated that you hoped to visit this school the next week, I beg to say that if you made this visit the Department would like to receive a full report from you in regard to this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. Gibbald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 2nd inst., and to enclose herewith my report for the month of April for the Cold Lake Bay school.\n\nAfter inspecting the school I called upon the Rev. Father Dufresne. He is still very adverse to the change in the class-room which is contemplated. He points out what is very true that the change will inconvenience the Rev. Sisters considerably and also a fact that does not seem to have been taken into consideration before, the pupils are not all the time in the same room as one of the other sisters takes the older girls to a small room leading off the regular class-room for instruction in sewing, knitting and other such work. Should however the Department insist on the change being made he will have it done. Another objection the Rev. Father raised was the disadvantage to having two teachers at work in the same room because if the sitting-room be thrown into the class-room the use of the one used as a sewing-room would have to be discontinued.\n\nYours Sir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 25, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to previous correspondence in regard to the Cold Lake Day School I beg to say that I am sending you herewith a copy of a letter from Mr. Agent Gibbald in reference to this school.\n\nKindly state whether, in view of the explanations contained in this letter, you are still of the opinion that the room in this school now used as a sitting room should be included in the classroom.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. B. Crombie, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa, May 25, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant enclosing your report for the month of April on the Cold Lake Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a copy of your letter is being sent to Mr. Inspector Crombie and he is being asked to state whether, in view of the explanations contained in this letter, he is still of the opinion that the room in this school now used as a sitting room should be included in the classroom.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. Gibbald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nRef. your letter No. 132985-1 of the 25th May, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of the above communication regarding correspondence in connection with Cold Lake Day School.\n\nWhen making my report upon this school I took into consideration the fact that the pupils were not all the time in the same room, but there is no doubt that part of the time they are and this being the case the room must certainly be overcrowded. There is no doubt that if the class room was enlarged by taking in the adjoining room it would inconvenience the Reverend Sisters considerably and the suggestion made in my letter of April 24th was that a leanto addition be made to the present mission building, which would provide the necessary class room accommodation and overcome the possibility of inconveniencing the sisters in their quarters. If there are no funds available for the erection of a leanto, there, of course, would be nothing else to do but to continue under present conditions, which in my opinion is not altogether satisfactory.

Sir,\n\nIn reference to previous correspondence in regard to increasing the class-room accommodation at the Cold Lake Day School, I beg to say that Mr. Inspector Crombie suggests that a leanto addition be made to the present mission building, which would provide the necessary class-room accommodation and overcome the possibility of inconveniencing the sisters in their quarters. The Inspector also suggests that an arrangement might be made whereby the Department could advance the Mission $250.00 for the purpose of purchasing lumber and erecting an addition to the present building to provide extra class-room accommodation, repayment of the same to be made by the mission from rent which they are charging the Department at the present time.\n\nKindly let the Department know whether you would be willing to carry out the Inspector's suggestion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Dauphin,\nLegoff, Alta.\nOttawa, June 18, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant in further reference to increasing the class-room accommodation at the Cold Lake Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Rev. Father Dauphin is being advised of your suggestion that an arrangement might be made whereby the Department could advance the mission $250.00 for the purpose of purchasing lumber and erecting an addition to the present building to provide extra class-room accommodation; repayment of same to be made by the mission from rent which they are charging the Department at the present time.

I first saw the Rev. Sister Eugenie, who is the teacher. She informed me that after treaty payments the attendance was so bad that she closed the school for Summer holidays on 19th July. Treaty payments took place on 13 & 15th. It is customary at this school to give a months holidays in winter and take it off the summer holidays. A reference to the register showed the wisdom of closing of the school because it showed the average attendance to be 23.50 and for July to the 19th 11.50 showing a considerable reduction.\n\nThe room used as a classroom up to the closing of the school, as you are already aware, was much too small for the number of pupils attending, being only 18 x 20. Now an addition is being made which will enlarge the school room to a measurement of 20 x 34 and when completed will be a most satisfactory improvement. The expense of this building is evidently being defrayed by the Roman Catholic authorities respecting which there seems to have been some correspondence between the Department and the Authorities, according to information given me by the Priest at the Mission, the Rev Father Dauphin.\n\nThis school so far has been a success and is worthy of being properly furnished. The present furniture consists of only three roughly made desks several forms. The teacher asks me to requisition for 4 No. 3, 8 No. 4 & 8 No. 5 double desks, a teacher's desk No. 11 & 2 chairs No. 7. These\nare taken from Catalogue No. 15 of The Western School Supply Compy., Regina. If The Department would be willing to supply these articles it would meet with my recommendation. It is not likely that the building will be fit for use until the end of September.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOnt.\nOctober 20th\n\nWestern School Supply\nRegina, Saskatchewan\n\nThe Globe Furniture Co.\nWaterloo, Pennsylvania\n\nE.R.

The building would appear to be rather poor for winter use. There is no foundation. The interior is rather dingy. A toilet is needed. The water supply is not good. The general surroundings are good.\n\nC. Crispo, Insp.\nOttawa, October 22nd, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his inspection of the Cold Lake Indian Day School, has drawn attention to the condition of the mission building which is used for school purposes. This building is rented from the church authorities, and it is considered that they should be responsible for the undertaking of any repairs to make the building comfortable during the coming winter. The Inspector states that there is no foundation under the building, and that the interior is dingy. He also states that a toilet is needed, and that the water supply is not good.\n\nYou will be good enough to draw this matter to the attention of Rev. Father Balter, to whom payment of the rent is made, and request him to see that the building is made as comfortable as possible for the coming winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of the 22nd ultimo, No.115-3-5, and, in reply, to inform you that when at Cold Lake reserve on the 19th instant, I spoke to the Reverend Father Balter with respect to the condition of the building which is used for school purposes; and he told me that he was contemplating the erection, next spring, of a new building for a schoolhouse; and that in the meantime everything possible would be done to make the building at present in use comfortable for the winter.\n\nThe school is held in a building formerly used as a residence by the priests at the Mission. It is a two storied log building, 21 feet square, with a single storied leanto 21' by 14'. Mr. Hebert, the school teacher, with his family, used the upper part of the main building and the leanto as a residence; the lower part of the main building was used as the schoolroom. However, on my visit to the school a few days ago, I found that the teacher had moved his family into the schoolroom, and had removed the desks and school equipment into the leanto, and was holding school there. This room is large enough for a schoolroom but is not nearly so comfortable as the one vacated. I told Mr. Hebert that the Department could not approve of the change he had made, but on his promise to cover the leanto with building paper to keep out all drafts, I would ask that the change be countenanced as a temporary measure, to last, certainly, not later than April 1st next. By this time Father Balter's plans for a new building may be completed, and arrangements made between him and Mr. Hebert whereby the latter will be able to use the whole of the present schoolhouse as a residence.\n\nWith respect to the need for a toilet. There is one situated about 75 yards from the school and, with Father Balter's permission I will have Mr. Martineau, the Farm Instructor, haul it closer to the schoolhouse.\n\nWith respect to the water supply. Several wells have been dug in the vicinity of the Mission and the water, although at first good, has in each case turned alkaline later. A good open creek runs close to the schoolhouse, but there is always the danger of this water containing impurities, and I would recommend that a stone filter be supplied the school. I believe that one holding ten gallons could be purchased for between $25.00 and $30.00.\n\nI trust the Department will approve of the action taken with respect to the schoolroom.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Dec. 3rd, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, regarding the condition of the mission building which is used for school purposes on the Cold Lake Indian Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is hoped that this building will be made comfortable and will serve the purpose until next spring, at which time it is noted that the Church authorities contemplate the erection of a new building for a school house.\n\nIt is noted that you have arranged to have the farm instructor haul the present toilet to a site nearer to the school.\n\nRegarding the water supply, I beg to say that you may purchase a stone filter to hold approximately 10 gallons, and have it delivered to the school. It will be necessary to obtain competitive prices from a number of dealers, and the purchase should be made from the firm quoting you the lowest price. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the cost. It is thought that when this filter is installed it will solve the problem insofar as the supply of drinking water is concerned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

The teacher, Mr. Chas. Hebert, holds a Second Class Alberta Certificate. The school is held in a building, the property of the Roman Catholic Church. A portion of the building is used as a residence and one of the rooms in size 20 x 22 is a class room. This room is lighted by five small windows which are placed on three sides of the room. I may say that this building is not kept in good condition and in my opinion is not a suitable building for the purpose. When it was taken over I was under the impression that it was only for temporary use. If a day school is to be continued on this reserve I would suggest that a new school and teacher's residence be provided and a site for same selected away from the Church Buildings. At the present site they have to depend on the creek for water which I do not think is safe. An effort has been made to obtain water at this point but it has turned out to be alkali. The Farm Instructor, half a mile away, has excellent water in his well.\n\nThere are 20 pupils on the roll at this school, 8 boys and 10 girls. The average attendance for the year is 16. This pupilage is only a proportion of the children of school age belonging to the Cold Lake Band. The Indians have been clamouring for a Boarding School for years. Each trip I make to the reserve that appears to be the question of the greatest importance with them.\nRegina, Sask., Sept. 22nd, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the schools in the Onion Lake Agency, which was made by Mr. Inspector Murison.\n\nThe Cold Lake school is taught by Chas. Hebert. You will notice that the building here is a poor affair, but I would not advise the Department to spend any money on it, as no doubt the time is coming when a large residential school will be built to take care of the Catholic children of the Saddle Lake and Onion Lake Agencies.\n\nW.

REGINA, SASK., April 4th, 1928.\n\nINSPECTION REPORT ON SCHOOLS ONION LAKE AGENCY.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the three Day Schools and the two Residential Schools, which are situated on reserves included in the Onion Lake Agency.\n\nCOLD LAKE DAY SCHOOL.\n\nI visited this Day School on the 5th of March and found 24 pupils present, 12 boys and 12 girls, out of an enrollment of 36. The average attendance for the previous month was about 20. The average attendance for the December quarter, 1927, was 12.86 and for the June quarter, 1927, was 11.59. The increased attendance is attributed to the fact that a hot bowl of soup has been given to the children at mid-day, in addition to the regular issue of biscuits. The Priest, in charge of the Mission, purchased beef, beans, lard and tea at a cost of $5.70 and this provided a bowl of soup for each child for three weeks at a cost of less than one cent per meal. The attendance has nearly doubled since they commenced giving the soup. The teacher was very anxious to provide the soup during the cold weather, and, as I was impressed with the good results which had already been obtained, I purchased $5.00 worth of meat at my own expense to enable them to carry on during the month of March.\n\nThe Indians of the Cold Lake Band have bee\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nhave been hunters and still follow that vocation. It takes them away from their reserve a great deal, and, as they in many instances take their families with them, the regular attendance at the school is naturally affected to a considerable extent by this. It is a fact, that here, as well as on other reserves where we have Day schools, many of the children go to school in the morning with practically empty stomachs and are listless. In consequence, it is noted that after getting their bowl of wholesome soup they are much brighter in the afternoon. I do not think it necessary to provide an expensive meal, and realize that at some schools where the privilege has been granted there has been the tendency to abuse it, but I firmly believe that the provision of a bowl of nourishing soup has a very beneficial effect on the health and comfort of the children attending our Day Schools.\n\nThis school is held in a building, which was formerly the Priests' Residence and which is rented for school purposes from them. I do not consider it a suitable for the purpose, but rather as a make-shift, pending the provision of a more suitable building. I found the building clean and the children appeared warmly clad. It was noted that they have a water cooler, only one wash basin and no tooth brushes. I have spoken to the Agent regarding providing them with towelling, which he has in stock at the Agency store house, to enable them to have individual towels.\n\nMr. Charles Hebert, the teacher, holds a Second Class Alberta certificate. He appears very painstaking and interested in his work. I consider that he is doing as well as can be expected under the circumstances. It is very discouraging for a teacher where the attendance is so intermittent. The school room was clean and tidy. The pupils are taught knitting by Mrs. Hebert. A garden has been put in during the past three years, but has not proved a success, as the ground in the vicinity of the school appears unsuitable.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith Inspector Murison's report on the various schools in the Onion Lake Agency. The report is very complete and the Inspector has gone into matters very thoroughly.\n\nWith reference to the Cold Lake Day School, I notice that the Priest in charge of the Mission purchased beef, beans, lard and tea at a cost of $5.70 and provided a bowl of soup for each child at a cost of less than one cent per meal. I do not think the Department want to call on the Priest to provide this food for the Indian school children and I am of the opinion that they would be willing to make a small grant for this purpose, say five or six dollars a month. I should be glad if action on these lines could be taken, as I do not think it is the intention of the Department that children should go to Day school on empty stomachs as is pointed out by the Inspector.\n\nW. M. Graham.\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, April 20th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your No. 309-11 of the 10th instant, enclosing Inspector Morrison's report on his inspection of the Cold Lake Indian Day School, I beg to say, with reference to the supplies required for the midday meal, that the Department would be prepared to allow an amount of approximately $5 per month during the winter months, in order to purchase the beef, beans, tea, etc., required in giving the pupils a hot lunch at midday, and I shall be pleased if you will arrange with the local Indian Agent to furnish the supplies, the cost of which should not exceed approximately the amount mentioned each month. Accounts should be forwarded from time to time covering the expenditure.\n\nIt is noted that the teacher is interested in his work and that he is doing as well as can be expected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nLe Goff, Alberta,\nApril 24, 1928.\n\nI am compelled to address myself to you on the following questions.\n\nI have been teaching here for five years. Have asked for more fuel to heat the school. I receive only $30. a year. The last five years have cost me an average of $70. not including $30. allowance. This I had to pay from my own pocket. I understand that many day schools receive as far as $170. for fuel. Is there any reason why I should be limited to a little $30. a year.\n\nNothing is furnished on the line of midday meal except biscuits. When bacon, rice, rolled oats etc. could be given, attendance was very much better. Is there no way of giving those poor little Indian children a better meal at noon?\n\nChas. P. Hebert,\nTeacher, Le Goff, Alberta.\nOttawa, May 5, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Hebert,\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General has directed me to reply to your letter of the 24th ultimo which has reference to your activity at the Cold Lake Indian Day School. In connection with the fuel allowance, I wish to point out that the Department made an agreement with the local missionary to the effect that the rental of $20 per teaching month should include the necessary heating and caretaking. Accordingly, your request for an increased fuel allowance should be made to Rev. Father Lacombe. With reference to the midday lunch, I have to inform you that on the 20th ultimo, following receipt of Mr. Inspector Hurison's report, the Department authorized an expenditure of $5 per month during the winter months so that some beef, beans, tea, etc., could be provided.\n\nWhen you were appointed in 1922, you were allowed salary at the rate of $300 for the ten teaching months, and, in addition, Mrs. Hebert was allowed $500 per annum for her services as field matron. It is true that you have given satisfaction, and in 1924 an increase of $100 was allowed in your case.\n\nIn your letter to Mr. Stewart, you leave the impression that your salary has never been increased since your appointment and that at present it is only $350 for the ten teaching months. May I point out that you are in receipt of $300, and when the salary of Mrs. Hebert is added thereto, it makes a total of $400, which I feel compares quite favourable with remuneration paid to workers in rural day schools in the province.\n\nI am pleased to inform you that, in harmony with the Department's practice to recognize satisfactory services, I have directed that an increase of $50 be granted in your case as from the 1st of September, next.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nChas. P.

Lacombe, O.M.I.,\nLegoff,\nAlta.\nOttawa, May 30th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nA communication has been received from Rev. E. Lacombe, O.M.I., making enquiry as to the payment of rent for the quarter ended March 31st, last, of the building used for school purposes on the Cold Lake Reserve. The last voucher received from you for the payment of this rent was for the quarter ended December 31st, 1927. I have to request that you will prepare and forward a voucher for the amount of the rent for the quarter ended March 31st, last, and also at the end of the present quarter, viz. June 30th, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake,\nSask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of April 26th, 1927, No. 115-3-5, in which authority was given to dig a shallow well on the edge of a creek at Cold Lake reserve, to supply the Cold Lake Indian Day School with water. This reserve is about 75 miles from the Agency, so, as I could not give personal supervision to the digging of the well I placed the matter in the hands of the school teacher to hire men and have the well made. However, for one reason and another he was unable to do this last fall, and on my visit to the school yesterday the Rev. Father Lacombe, who is in charge of the Roman Catholic Mission at Cold Lake, suggested to me that he would have a well bored for the joint use of the mission and Day School, and that the Department would bear half of the cost, to which proposal I gave my consent, subject to the approval of the Department. I estimate that the total cost of the well will not exceed $100.00; the Department's share should, therefore, not exceed $50.00. Water for this Indian Day School is a vital necessity; I trust, therefore, that my action will be approved by the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 1st, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, relative to the boring of a well for the use of the Cold Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that arrangements can be made with the missionary at Cold Lake to have a well bored for the joint use of the mission and day school, and that the estimated cost will not exceed $100, each party to be responsible for half the cost. The Department will approve of the arrangement which you have made with the missionary for the boring of the well, and will, upon receipt of a voucher, in duplicate, certified by you, pay half the cost of boring this well.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

There are 15 Indian pupils enrolled for this month, 7 boys and 8 girls. There are, in addition, 3 girls belonging to the farming instructor, 2 boys belonging to the teacher and 1 halfbreed girl in attendance. The enrolment at this school has been reduced owing to a large number of children having been transferred to the Onion Lake R.C. Residential School. The attendance, in proportion to the enrolment, has shown an improvement this year.\n\nSince my last visit provision has been made for a supply of skim milk for this school during the summer months and bowl of soup for the winter. The furnishing of a warm meal would commence on November 1st. The furnishing of these additions to the biscuits for the mid day lunch has been greatly appreciated, and the teacher informs me it has had a beneficial effect on the attendance.\n\nI have already reported on the school building at this point. It is not a suitable building.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nGOLD LAKE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nAs I have already stated, for school purposes and I think was only intended for a makeshift when the school was re-opened.\n\nI found both the schoolroom and the children clean and tidy.\n\nThere are no facilities for recreation at this school and I would recommend that teeters and swings be provided as has been done at Long Lake and Frog Lake. These do not cost much and are splendid recreation for the children.\n\nMr. Charles Hebert remains in charge as teacher at this point and his wife, Mrs. Hebert, takes an interest in teaching knitting to the children, as well as preparing the lunch at mid day.\n\nFROG LAKE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nI visited the Frog Lake Day School on the afternoon of the 18th of October. There are 17 enrolled at this school, 10 boys and 7 girls; of these, 7 boys and 6 girls were present. The attendance at this school has been better since my last visit, but there is still a great deal of room for improvement.\n\nSince my last visit the teacher has been supplied with Drinilk during the summer months. He states that the children are not very partial to it, but they like it when boiled with rice and they have been giving it to them in this manner. This will be substituted on November 1st and during the winter months with a warm bowl of soup and tea. There is no doubt that the providing of this inexpensive meal is a great boon to the children.\n\nThe children\nFROG LAKE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nThe children are required to clean themselves up when they come to the school and they had adequate clothing for the season.\n\nI reported on the condition of the school building last year. The conditions are practically the same only the school does not present so good an appearance as in the winter time as the rains had washed the mud off in streaks. Both the teacher's residence and the school are log buildings and are plastered with mud. It is hard to keep the buildings in repair and I would suggest that these buildings be plastered with lime and sand. I would also suggest that a small addition to the house be allowed for a summer kitchen and storage. The total cost of these repairs should not exceed $150.00.\n\nThe teacher has a small garden which was fairly good this year.\n\nMr. A. B. Peterson is still holding the position of teacher. He appears to be a man of good common sense and has practical experience, apart from his teaching ability, in western farming. His presence on the reserve has a good influence, but his authority over the Indians is, of course, very limited.\n\nKEDHEWING INDIAN DAY SCHOOL. (Longfellow)\n\nI visited this school on October 31st and found 4 boys and 2 girls present out of an enrolment of 10. The teacher's 3 girls were also present. They are attending the school, but are not shown on the register.\n\nMr. Francis Dion, the teacher, continues to be quite faithful to his duties, and I considered his work quite commendable, considering the disadvantages that he\nthat he has to work with, particularly insofar as the irregularity of the attendance is concerned.\n\nThe children were quite clean and tidy and healthy looking.\n\nThe school building was also clean and presented a good appearance. Since my last visit this building has been plastered with lime and sand and whitewashed. Only the school was re-plastered with lime and sand. When I suggested the re-plastering of these buildings in my last report, I included the teacher's residence, but the Agent apparently was under the impression that only the school building was to be done. I think that the teacher's residence should be re-plastered with lime and sand. It is a difficult matter, where they live in houses the year around, to keep them looking decent. These buildings would look better if the roof and the gable ends were painted. The outside closets should also be painted. The teacher has asked for doorsteps in front of the school. These might be supplied, and also 1 large and 1 small iron gate for the fence. A new well is also required at this school. The present well does not furnish an adequate supply for the use of the school and teacher's residence.\n\nThe teacher also asks if he might be provided with pictures of the King and Queen and some other prominent men as well. We have pictures of the King and Queen in practically all of our schools and I would recommend that the Department supply these.\nONION LAKE CHURCH OF ENGLAND RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nI visited this school on October 24th, and made a careful inspection of the school and outbuildings. I found the school buildings in a well kept condition.\n\nThere are 80 pupils enrolled at this school; 77 were present on the day of my visit, 44 boys and 33 girls. The pupils were clean and tidy and had a healthy appearance. I am informed that there has been very little illness at this school during the past year.\n\nI was present at the children's noon-day meal and noted that they had an ample supply of wholesome food. The children receive all the milk that they care to drink. They were milking 8 cows at the time of my visit, which gives them an ample supply for the children.\n\nThe Rev. H. Ellis, Principal, has as a staff 7 women, 1 of whom is a trained nurse and 2 are properly qualified teachers. The kitchen matron was absent on the day of my visit on account of sickness. Mr. D. Spooner, the Farming Instructor, appears to be a competent man. Mr. W. Gravil, the Engineer, impresses me as being a first class man for the position. He appears to thoroughly understand the operation of the plant and is quite capable of doing the necessary repair work. I found everything in the boiler and engine room in first class condition.\n\nMr. Gravil brought to my attention that the water system was not available for fire protection in the engine and boiler rooms and stated that if he was supplied with a 1\u00bd\" hose connection and 50 ft. of fire hose, he could do the work himself and provide protection for that wing of the building. They have one large size extinguisher in the boiler room. He also pointed out that a ventilating fan installed in the chimney.\nchimney would carry off the battery and gas fumes from the engine room. He tells me that at times these are quite strong.\n\nI examined the fire fighting equipment and found it to be in good working order. The plant appears to be operating satisfactorily. They are still using the farm engine to pump water from the lake.\n\nOUTBUILDINGS.\n\nSince my last visit, the stanchions in the cow barn have been raised and re-set in cement. The hay carrier track has also been repaired. I noted an improvement in the condition of the outbuildings and in the tidiness of the premises. A separate sewage disposal system has been installed in connection with the Principal's residence and is very much appreciated. It is working very satisfactorily.\n\nFARM.\n\nThe school crop this year consisted of 50 acres of wheat, 75 acres of oats and 13 acres of barley. The sample of the grain has been considerably spoiled as a result of frost. Only 1019 bushels of wheat were threshed; this will possibly grade 5 or 6 Northern. 656 bushels of oats were threshed from 25 acres and 50 acres of oats were not considered worth threshing and were kept for feed. 13 acres of barley yielded 199 bushels. It is too bad that this grain was frozen as they had the promise of an excellent crop of wheat. The frost also effected the yield of their garden produce.\n\nThe stock now consist of 29 cattle, 12 of which are milch cows. They have 4 good work horses, 2 old horses and 2 drivers. They require another team. They have 25 poultry and 17 hogs.\nONION LAKE C. OF R. RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nI may say that I was better pleased with conditions at this school than I have been on any previous visit.\n\nONION LAKE R.C. RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nI visited this school on three occasions during my stay at Onion Lake. All the details in connection with the construction of this school had not been completed. The electric lighting plant was installed at the time of my visit and the water system was also completed. It appears that there has been a great deal of difficulty experienced in getting the contractors to complete their work. I examined the plumbing system and the heating and lighting plant, and the work in connection with these appears to have been well done. There appears to have been no provision made for a chimney for the laundry and bake oven. They require a stove in the laundry for the purpose of heating irons. The laundry floor has not sufficient fall to carry off the surplus water. As a matter of fact, the fall appears to be away from the drain instead of to it. This is a detail that was pointed out by the Sisters and is not being mentioned here with a view to fault finding.\n\nThe fire fighting equipment consists of 2 sets of hose on each floor attached to the water supply system. This equipment, being new, is in first class condition. I noted that there were no fire extinguishers and would point out that at all our residential schools, in addition to the hose, we have 2 fire extinguishers on each floor. Access to the fire escapes is obtained through rooms occupied by members of the staff.\n\nThe school has been very nicely equipped with new furniture. The Rev.\nONION LAKE R.C. RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nThe Rev. Father Balter, O.M.I., is in charge as Principal. Mr. Balduc is the Farming Instructor and Mr. Rose is Engineer. There are 6 Sisters of Charity, 3 of whom are teachers. The Sister Superior is the business manager of the institution and appears to exercise supervision over the outside operations as the present Principal is not a practical man being more of a student.\n\nFARM:\n\nThis year they had their first crop. 30 acres of wheat produced 573 bushels; 45 acres of oats yielded 2300 bushels. Their garden produced 400 bushels of potatoes, not sufficient for their requirements. The wheat was a good quality of Garnet and will make excellent seed. They will realize a good price for this.\n\nTheir stock consists of 13 cattle, including 8 milking cows, 7 horses, 16 pigs and 75 hens. Mr. Balduc appears to be a good farmer and a careful man with stock.\n\nI was very unfavourably impressed with Rose, the Engineer. He had a great deal of fault to find with the plant which he is expected to operate and has succeeded in getting the Principal and the Sister Superior very much dissatisfied. He found fault with the plumbing, the boilers, the electric lighting plant and the water supply system. Even the engine wasn't properly constructed. Everything was wrong. I was presented by the Principal with a typewritten list of all the imperfections in connection with this plant and came to the conclusion, after examining the plant, that Mr. Rose was making a big noise to hide his own incompetence. This man is a trouble maker pure and simple, in my opinion, and I think the wrong class of man to have associated in any way with an institution of this kind.\n\nThe outside\nThe outside dwelling for the Farming Instructor, as well as the poultry house and implement shed, were nearing completion at the time of my visit.\n\nThere are 92 pupils enrolled, 50 boys and 42 girls. The children looked well nourished. There were a few cases of whooping cough and 3 children were sent to the hospital while I was there being typhoid suspects.\n\nThis being the first summer that this school has been occupied and as work has been under construction during the whole period, very little has been done towards beautifying the grounds, but as soon as the construction work and buildings are completed, the premises can be put in shape.\n\nThe foregoing report is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Morrison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., Nov. 29th, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the schools in the Onion Lake Agency, which were visited by Mr. Inspector Murison.\n\nSwings and teeters for the Cold Lake Indian Day School have been asked for in the Estimates. I have been trying to supply Drimilk wherever they will make good use of it. I note it is being used at this school.\n\nThe teacher's residence at Frog Lake might be improved but it seems to me that nothing much can be done to make it more habitable.\n\nWith reference to the Inspector's remarks regarding the teacher's residence at the Keeheewin Day School, probably the reason that the building was not re-plastered was because it was the intention of the Agent to line it with siding. This has been asked for in the Estimates that were forwarded, also an amount for painting the interior. I think if this were done it would make a better building.\n\nYou will note what Mr. Gravil, the Engineer at the Onion Lake C. of E. School asks for in the way of hose for fire protection. This might be authorized.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nYou will also note what the Inspector says regarding the completion of the contract at the new R.C. Indian Residential School. He states that no provision was made for chimneys in the laundry and bake-oven. This may or may not have been an oversight, as they may have had some other scheme in view when the plans were drawn. He also complains about the manner in which the laundry floor has been built. I do not know whether this was in accordance with the details of the plans or not. Mr. Hamilton has gone to this school to make a final report and the Department will then be in a position to know just how the matter stands. One matter, however, I think should not escape the attention of the Department, and that is that the Inspector says he was not impressed with the Engineer. I do not know whether this man has the proper qualifications or not, but if he has not he should have been replaced. It is absolutely wrong to have an incompetent man handling a plant of this kind, as he can do more damage in a few months than we should expect to occur in ten years. I would ask the Department to look carefully into this man's qualifications. The Inspector remarks that he has a great deal to say. I found this to be the case when I was at this school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, December 6, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your No. 309-11 of the 29th ultimo, enclosing the report of Mr. Inspector Murison on his inspection of the various schools in the Onion Lake Agency. The various matters referred to by the Inspector as requiring attention at the schools will receive consideration. We are pleased to note that the conditions generally at these schools are fairly satisfactory. Certain of the matters referred to by the Inspector will form the subject of separate communications to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, December 6, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Murison, in a report on his recent inspection of the Cold Lake Indian Day School, recommends that teetors and swings be provided as playground equipment for the use of the pupils, the same as has been done at the Long Lake and Frog Lake Day Schools.

Father Jos. Portier to the post of Principal of the Union Lake Indian Residential School. I hope you will have no objection to approve of the same.\n\nI enclose herewith a cheque to the amount of $60.00 made in favour of Rev. Father E. Lacombe for the rent of a building at Cold Lake. As Father Lacombe has been removed to Delmas, Sask., and replaced by Father L. Balter the Bank refused to pay the cheque on account of not bearing the proper endorsement. Would you be kind enough to have another cheque issued in favour of the actual Principal.\n\nDear Mr Scott, I thank you very much for the cordial reception with which you and all the other officers of your Department have recently favored me.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.

There is also\nin a very miserable situation viz., a certain\nIndian woman has been living with a white\nman for 6 or 7 years but never lawfully married\nwith him. The white man is now dead and the\nIndian woman is now living on the Reserve with 3 children.\nThe poor squaw has lost her ration for herself and the\n3 children. She would like to have them in a Boarding School,\nbut the pupils not being in the treaty would receive no grant\nof education from the Indian Department. The case of these\nchildren is then worse than if they were pure Indians.\n\nI take the liberty to draw your attention on these\npoor children, and I would suggest a grant of\neducation to be authorized to them, that they may\nbe admitted in a Boarding School. As for their\nsupporting on the Reserve I would suggest a certain rule\nequal for every one of these children half breed.\n\nWith regard to the age for admitting pupils in the Boarding\nSchool, I am aware of the rule of the Department, but when the\nIndians are willing to give up their children at 5 years old will the Depart-\nment give them the grant of education. I hope, considering the difficulties in recrui-\nting pupils, the Department will have no objection for their admission,\nand in the past the same has been done for other schools.\n\nHaving a satisfactory answer, I have the honour to be\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOTTAWA, 15th September, 1899\n\nRev.

Father Riou, O.M.I., of the Blood Reserve, and to say that I have thoroughly considered the matter of admitting non-treaty children into our schools and have come to the conclusion that it should not take place. There are thousands of these outcasts in the country and the admission of some, even of the most needful, means that of all, which the Department has refused to countenance, on principle. Several exceptions have been made in the past which have led to worrying correspondence and strife between clergymen of different denominations.\n\nI have therefore made an absolute rule, of which all parties concerned have been duly notified, and must say that, but for the pity of having children ill-cared for in our midst, the rule is working satisfactorily. I may also add that the local Government of the N.W.Territories has not closed its eyes to the educational wants of these people and is quite willing to provide teachers salaries to competent persons teaching in our schools, qualified according to the N.W.T.School Ordinance, and subject to the government's inspection.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\ninspection. Two schools have already been granted this privilege which can be had for the mere matter of the asking. This enables the school authorities to have competent teachers at no cost practically, whilst otherwise they in many cases have to pay salaries to incompetent ones.\n\nIt of course stands to reason that this can be carried out only where there is room for admission of half-breeds and providing that no detriment is experienced as regards Indians.\n\nFrom a late report from Mr. Inspector Chisholm, recently forwarded to the department, it will be seen that the halfbreed inmates in the Church of England Onion Lake Boarding School, are much more numerous than the Indians; here the local government upon request immediately agreed to pay the salary of one duly qualified teacher.\n\nIn regard to the age of admission of Indian children into Boarding Schools I think that these should not be considered as nurseries and that six years is as low an age as should entitle a child to the privilege.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, 18th October, 1899.\n\nMemorandum Mr. Smart,\n\nThe Indian Commissioner is to be informed, in reply to his letter of the 19th ultimo, that I have given the subject referred to therein careful consideration, and that I cannot approve of the absolute rule which he has laid down that none but treaty children are to be admitted into Indian schools. A well defined line can be drawn between Halfbreeds, properly speaking, and Indians. While I do not consider that the children of the Halfbreeds proper of Manitoba and the Territories should be admitted into Indian schools and paid for by the Department, I am decidedly of the opinion that all children of mixed blood, whether legitimate or not, who live upon an Indian Reserve and whose parents live as Indians upon a Reserve, even if they are not ammitants, should be eligible for admission to the schools. It must be remembered that\nthat boarding and Industrial schools were not established for the purpose of carrying out the terms of the treaty or complying with any provision of the law, but were instituted in the public interest, so that there should not grow up upon reserves an uneducated and barbarous class. The North West Government cannot provide for the education of non-annuitants upon reserves; and if we exclude them from our schools, they will practically be debarred from all means of education.\nOttawa, 24th October, 1890.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Minister has had under careful consideration your letter of the 10th ultimo, Ref.180145, addressed to the Secretary of the Department, and he has come to the conclusion that he cannot approve of the absolute rule which you have laid down that none but treaty children are to be admitted into Indian schools. A well defined line can be drawn between Half-breeds, properly speaking, and Indians, and while the Minister does not consider that the children of the Half-breeds proper, of Manitoba and the Territories, should be admitted into Indian Schools and paid for by the Department, still he is decidedly of the opinion that all children, even those of mixed blood, whether legitimate or not, who live upon an Indian Reserve and whose parents on either side live as Indians upon a Reserve, even if they are not annuitants, should be eligible for admission to the schools. It should be remembered in this connection that boarding and industrial schools were not established for the purpose of carrying out the terms of the treaty, or complying with any provision of the law, but that they were instituted in the public interest, so that there should not grow up upon reserves an uneducated and barbarous class. The North West Government cannot provide for the education of non-annuitants upon reserves, and if we should exclude them from our schools, they would practically be debarred from all means of education.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, and to say that the Minister's conclusion will be accorded its proper weight.\n\nI would, however, remark that I did not consider that on the question referred to I was making any new rule - on the contrary the object I was endeavoring to accomplish was to carry out what I regarded to be the meaning of the 138th Section of the Indian Act and the Orders in Council based thereon. The Industrial and Boarding Schools are there mentioned as \"for Indians\". Sub-section 2 of said section 138 does refer to \"children of Indian blood\"; but regulation 9 of the Order in Council of Nov. 10, 1894 restricts its application to \"any Indian child\". The children of White men are not Indians, and I thought that ruling as I did in the case brought before the Minister by Rev. Father Riou, O.M.I., I was carrying out the law.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nJas. A.

Boarding School, Blood Reserve,\n\nMacleod, Alta.\nOttawa 15th July, 1801.\n\nRevd Sir,\n\nWith reference to the enquiry in your letter of the 26th ultimo, as to whether any provision has been made in the Estimates of 1801-2 for the Roman Catholic Boarding School on the Blood Reserve, I beg to inform you that you should communicate with the Hon. D. Laird, Indian Commissioner, Winnipeg, who is in a position to furnish you with full information in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRevd LeDouceur, O.M.I.\nPrincipal of the Roman Catholic Boarding School\nBlood Reserve,\nMacLeod, N.W.T.\nHonourable Sir,\n\nI beg to say that the number of the pupils of the Roman Catholic Boarding School, Blood Reserve amounts now to 28 children and I have sent you lately through the Indian Agent Mr. Wilson four applications for children's admission.\n\nI am glad to say that the Indians begin to understand the value of education and they are stirring up now to send their children to the school.\n\nThe R.C. Boarding School is in the fifth year of its existence; for a long time very few children were admitted and the Honourable Mr. Laird and the Indian Agent Mr. Wilson were at a time discouraged to see so few children in such a large house as our school, and the same gentlemen were coaxing the missionaries here to recruit more children.\n\nThe Indian Department has been kind enough to give a grant for twenty-five children from the beginning in November 1898; but today, with 28 children, there are three over the number allowed, and more are coming, and I may say through the great help of the head-chief Cropped ear wolf; this shows the change in the ideas of the Indians about education. So, I feel confident that till the end of this fiscal year you will kindly allow us to admit all the children presented and give the grant for them, and for next year you will allow us the grant for forty (40) children and I feel sure that before the end of next year we will reach that number.\n\nIt would be hard for us to support many children over the number granted, and it cannot be thought of\nrefusing the children presented; this would ruin our future recruiting.\n\nHoping to receive a satisfactory answer, I remain\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nyour devoted servant,\n\nJ.J. Le Vern, ome principal.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose a letter from the Principal of the R.C. Boarding School, Blood Reserve (in connection with the grant of the school) which speaks for itself. It is of course quite the wrong time of the year to deal with a matter of this kind. However, there is some force in the Rev. gentleman's reasoning and perhaps the Department will find it convenient to consider the request favourably.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, 16th March, 1903.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nWith reference to the application hereunder from the Principal of the Roman Catholic Boarding-school on the Blood Reserve for an increased grant for this School, I beg to say that provision is now made for 25 pupils at $72.00, and up to the present time the returns received from this School do not show that they have ever had more than 20 on the roll. The Principal states that they have now 28 children and wishes to be paid for this number. If this is correct they have been taken in since the 1st of January. He is aware that 25 is all that he is allowed for and unless an increased provision is made he should limit himself to that number.\n\nThe Commissioner when forwarding the report says that perhaps the Department will find it convenient to consider the request favourably.\n\n[Signature]\nSir:-\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th inst., enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Roman Catholic Boarding-school, Blood Reserve, in which he asks to have the number of grant earners for this School increased, and in reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that it cannot grant further assistance to this School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.D.

Boarding School,\nBlood Reserve,\nStandoff, Alta.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd ultimo, No.180,146/1, I beg to say that as the school building has no less than four stairways located in different parts of the edifice the matter of fire escape was fully provided for when it was built and no further expenditure in that direction is called for. The building does not require re-painting yet, and I am of the opinion that the present outhouses will serve the purposes of the school upon which altogether too much money has been spent in late years. With regard to the request for more money for fencing I would say that this school is already supplied with an extravagant amount of picket fencing with sawn square timber for posts.\n\nSome of these people found their requisitions not on what they actually require but upon the supposition that whatever they ask for will be granted as a matter of course.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nExtract\n\nSt. Albert, Alberta, March 22nd, 1907.\n\n\"I have received lately a lengthy communication from the Reverend Father Principal of the Boarding School on the Blood Reserve showing that the Agent has acted in a very prejudicial manner to take away a catholic child from our school and transfer him to the Protestant school and to prevent others from being admitted into our institutions.

The records of the Department do not show that any such transfer has taken place, but, if Mr. Wilson, as stated, authorized the same, he has exceeded his authority, as the regulations relating to the education of Indian children provide that no Protestant child shall be placed in a Roman Catholic school or in a school conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholics and no Roman Catholic child shall be placed in a Protestant school or in a school conducted under Protestant auspices.

McLean\n\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 9th instant stating that it has been reported to the Department that Mr. Agent Wilson authorized the transfer of a pupil from the Roman Catholic to the Protestant Boarding School on the Blood Reserve. Mr. Agent Wilson is not to blame in the matter as he acted under my instructions.\n\nThis is one of those troublesome cases, where friction has arisen between two schools of different creeds, and I have to decide as impartially as my judgment enables me.\n\nThe child, a boy of the name of Joseph Wells, or Heavy Head, was never admitted by me as a pupil of the R. C. School on the Blood reserve, consequently a transfer in the proper sense of the word was not made. He was only taken from that school where he had been staying a few weeks to the St. Paul's School to which his admission had been formally granted.\n\nThe father of the boy, James Wells, deserted the boy's mother and the child when he was a baby and took no further interest in them. He was then taken in charge of by his grandfather, Heavy Head. On September 18, 1905, Heavy Head signed an application for the boy's admission to the St. Paul's School, but the application was not then forwarded to me as the child was too young. Being offended at the Principal of the St. Paul's School over some\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nsome matter, Heavy Head on January 5, 1907, signed another application to have the boy admitted to the R. C. Boarding School. I received this application on the 18th February, but did not immediately act upon it, having been informed of the prior application. On the 23rd February I wrote to Mr. Agent Wilson a letter relating to this boy and another, copy of which is placed herewith. On the 6th March I received a reply from the Agent, a copy of which is also enclosed. On the 19th March, having this new application in hand, I admitted the boy to St. Paul's School, as per copy of letter enclosed. If I have done wrong the Department can easily overrule my decision.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir,\n\nI have received an application from the R. C. Boarding School on your reserve to admit Robert Platted Hair to said School. The admission is granted; notify the Principal.\n\nThere is also an application from the same School for the admission of Joseph Wells, said in the application to be 5 years of age. I have a prior application from the C. E. School for the same boy, giving his age as only 4. Taking the latter to be probably correct, he is too young for admission to either school.\n\nFurther, as the father has deserted his child and the child's mother, and the latter, as also the child's guardian, Heavy Head, belong to the Church of England, the boy, when of age, should go to the C. E. Boarding School, unless the mother and guardian make a proper declaration before you that they wish otherwise.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) D.

David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nTo the Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nI received the official cheque of the Department, $76 No. 2067.\n\nI would beg to state that, to my estimation, this amount is far from being the correct one, as I expect to get the grant per capita for fifty pupils.\n\nLast year, on April 30th '07, I received from the Honourable Mr. Laird, Winnipeg, a letter No. 122/73, stating that the grant per capita for the maintenance of the pupils was found in the estimates, viz; 50 boarders at $72 and that the increased provision was available from the first of April. In fact, the grant for all the pupils entered in the books was duly received ever since. I was somewhat surprised last week when I received the official cheque No. 2067.\n\nI looked over again to the quarterly returns, and I am convinced that this amount $76 is not correct. I hope that you can see to this and that you are as kind as to forward to us the grant as you did before, that is, according to the letter No. 122/73, dated Winnipeg April 30th '07.\nAs to the balance, you are in a better position than myself to know how much would amount this balance, but I trust that you settle up the matter in a satisfactory way.\n\nI remain, Honourable Sir,\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nJ.M. Galaun\n\nPriest.\nOttawa, September 11, 1905.\n\nRev. Sirs,\n\nIn reply to that portion of your letter of the 3rd ult., which deals with the amount of grant received by you in payment of the earnings of the Blood (R.C.) Boarding School for the June quarter, last, I beg to say that provision is made for only forty pupils at this school and payment was made on that basis.\n\nThe question of increasing the pupilage to sixty will be dealt with when next year's estimates are under consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J.M. Salmon,\nPrincipal,\nBlood (R.C.) Boarding Schools,\nStand-Off P.O., Alta.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the R. C. Boarding School on the Blood Reserve complaining about the payment of the grant for the June quarter last. The Department cannot be called to account as the grant was apparently paid on the basis of 40 boarders which is the number provided. However, the Principal was wrongly informed as early as April 1907 that the grant was provided for 50. I cannot account for this grave error, except that the information was gathered from an unrevised copy of the estimates; for in my estimate as submitted to the Department for both this and last fiscal year I asked provision for 50 boarders.\n\nThe matter is further complicated by the fact that the Department before the last quarter actually paid for more than 40 pupils, which encouraged the Principal in gathering more children than were provided for.\n\nUnder the circumstances I feel justified in recommending that the Principal be paid for all the pupils he has under 50 for both the June quarter and the following quarter just ended. I would also press that the authorized attendance be increased to fifty. I am anxious to have a favorable answer at an early day.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nthat there are two bills for repairs and improvements unpaid, one of $65.00 and the other for $6.80 rendered in January 08, for work done in October 07. The Rev. Father is very urgent in having the larger of these two bills paid, and seems entirely at a loss as to why it has not been settled. I would strongly urge that the account be squared, and that we have a better understanding for the future as to what our liabilities are for expenditure incurred by authority of the schools.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFrank Podley\n\nFrank Podley Esq.\nPatents Branch\nOttawa\nDear Sir:\n\nRev. Father Salmon, principal of the Roman Catholic school on the Blood reserve, represents that for the year 1907 the school was allowed to draw aid on a pupilage up to fifty. For the past year it was only allowed to draw aid on a pupilage of forty, while he asserts that he had forty-eight pupils in attendance.\n\nThere seems to be no good reasons why the decrease should be made, and if there is some reason which I do not know of, I suggest that the step be taken to place the school in the position in which it was in 1907 as to pupilage, and notify the principal accordingly.\n\nThe Rev. Father at the same time, pointed out that the school was on the bank of the Belly River, and was liable to be flooded out. He suggested removal to higher ground. I told him that was a matter of consideration, and when it was decided what to do, we would decide where we would give assistance, and to what extent.\n\nThe Rev. Father also brings to my attention\nOttawa, October 7, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nThe Principal of the Blood Roman Catholic school claims that he is entitled to more money than he has received on account of the earnings of this school. Forty pupils are already provided for and the Department has paid for this number. The Commissioner writing under date of the last inst. stated that through an error the Principal was informed more than a year ago that the grant had been provided for fifty pupils. He admits that a mistake was made and he would like the Department to help him out of the difficulty.\n\nThis can only be done by paying for the number shown to be in attendance under fifty and, if funds can be spared, I would suggest that the Department pay the amount claimed as earned by the school, about $250.00 up to the end of June, last, and continue payment for fifty pupils in future.\n\nIt would hardly do to let the impression go abroad that the Commissioner had not kept faith with the school authorities. Few, if any, of these mistakes have been made in the Commissioner's office.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nOttawa, October 8, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,-\n\nIn regard to Father Salaun's statements to the Minister I beg to say that the Commissioner admits that through an error he advised him that fifty pupils had been provided for from April 1, 1907, while forty were all for whom the grant was provided.\n\nThe Department has never paid for more than forty, although the returns received since that date show the attendance to have been in excess of that number. No decrease was made in the grant but the increase of ten pupils asked for was not allowed and until it is authorized the Department will have to pay at the rate specified in the estimates.\n\nThe school is responsible for the location of the buildings and if the site is unsuitable it is the Church authorities that are to blame.\n\nAs to the unpaid bills for repairs and improvements, Father Salaun was officially informed on July 27, last, that it would be hardly possible to pay for the unauthorized expenditure on repairs, as the Department is required to deal strictly with such matters, the requirements of each school being specially estimated and\nand provided for and those persons having direct supervision of repairs or additions to buildings are expected to limit themselves to the amounts specially authorized for such purpose. It is the rule of the Department that unauthorized expenditure is not recognized and the schools are well aware of this rule, which if not enforced would soon lead to reckless extravagance which no Government would be willing to meet.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nOttawa, October 13, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the last inst., with reference to the payment of a grant for fifty pupils instead of forty at the Blood (R.C.) Boarding School since April 1, 1907, and in reply I beg to say that, in view of your explanation as to the misunderstanding regarding the number of pupils provided for, the Department will pay for the number in attendance up to fifty since the date above mentioned and a cheque will be sent to the principal for the arrears as shown by the returns.\n\nReferring to the second paragraph of your letter there is a misconception as to the previous number of pupils paid for by the Department. The payment has always been limited to forty, the number provided for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. Stewart\n\nAsst. Secretary\n\nThe Hon.

If this is correct I think that you are making a mistake and that if you have the records looked up you will find that the R.C. people have never expended anything on this building either in its original construction or subsequent repairs.

In order to advance the process of civilization amongst the Indians of the Black River and especially the pupils of the Boarding school of which I am principal, I most gladly to buy for them at my own expense a small band of twenty-five instruments. Knowing not of any factory of this kind in Canada, I ordered them from Belgium. But the custom duty is very high on these instruments. I had to pay \u00a36.10s. for the importation. I should be very grateful to you if you were kind enough to listen for an abatement or a total remittance of this custom as I bought them for the Indians in whose welfare the Government is taking a great interest.\nHoping that you will give to my request a favorable answer.\n\nI am\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nStada Off P.O.

I objected to this and proved that the Boarding school was absolutely in the same condition as the other Boarding School under Rom. Cath. control. The Department has provided a bonus for building, we supplied the rest and the Department acknowledged our ownership, but I believe here is the cause of the mistake because if we claim the ownership of the Boarding School, it is not so for the Hospital.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nSgn. Emile J.

SCHOOL.\n\nDATE OF INSPECTION - November 2nd, 1914.\n\n16. Precedents are rarely forgotten, if ever, for I was reminded that the Department gave the Peigan P.C. Boarding school, a lot, about 50, of blankets, a few years ago. This school would be glad to be likewise treated. I informed the matron that as I understand the agreement it was the duty of the school authorities to provide the necessary blankets etc. After I returned to the Blood Agency I noticed on the file that this request had gone forward Sept. 25, last, and replied to on the 7th of October.

Additional accommodation is being prepared, which will make room for ten more and he asks that the grant be increased to 60 pupils.

Boarding School to have the grant increased from 50 to 60 pupils I beg to say that Mr. Agent Dilworth, who was asked to report as to what additional accommodation has been provided at this school, states that the new dormitory space available will accommodate twenty more pupils. Fifty pupils are now provided and you will see that they can accommodate more than the sixty asked for.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPT. OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nJAN 21 1915\nARCHITECT.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMrs. Scott\u2014\n\nThe Indian Boarding School on the Blood reserve, has recently made application for an additional 10 pupils supplementing the 50 pupils which the school is now entitled to, and for which they have provided ample dormitory accommodation.\n\nThe building is the property of the school authorities, and consists of a central building three stories high, with a two story wing at each end, and, was erected about 17 years ago. The construction is of balloon frame, erected on stone foundation, and while maintained in fair condition, is showing evident signs of deterioration, and will necessarily have to be replaced within a few years by a modern building.\n\nThe school is of C class, and without modern sanitary equipment or conveniences.\nThe additional dormitory accommodation is provided by utilizing two rooms in the third flat of main building formerly used for the staff, having a combined area of 11,284 cubic feet, or accommodation for 22 pupils, being more than double the required air space.\n\nThere is only one staircase leading to this upper flat, and it will, therefore, be necessary to provide a fire-escape from each of the upper dormitory rooms, for safe egress in case of fire.\n\nThe correspondence in reference to this matter shows that the number there could be recruited to 80 without difficulty, providing there was accommodation, and as this school is doing thoroughly, the work for which it was established, I would recommend that they be granted the additional 10 pupils which they request, on condition that satisfactory fire-escapes be erected.\n\nArchitect.\nOttawa, February 20th, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to that portion of your report on the Blood (R.C.) Boarding School in which you state that the accommodation at this school has been increased and that the authorities asks for permission to take sixty pupils instead of the fifty now provided for I beg to say that the Department will consent to this number being enrolled as grant earners, but no additional pupils must be put in the school until the fire escapes are erected in accordance with the plans which have been sent you. You will be good enough to see that these instructions are strictly carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. J.

BOARDING SCHOOL.\n\nI was disappointed in the class of instruction given and being given in the subjects, reading, arithmetic spelling. The children's work was merely memory work and did not appear to be developing any deductive power, altogether too parrot-like and lacking in expression. The English spoken is not clear.\n\nGenerally speaking the show side of actual school work is being emphasized too much to the detriment of the common branches of reading, writing, arithmetic and spelling and as a result the work does not give evidence of developing and deductive power or independence of thought. The English spoken is not good English.\n\nRv E. Rumsey,\nPrincipal\nOttawa, June 21, 1915.\n\nRev.

The children's work was merely memory work and did not appear to be developing any deductive power, altogether too parrot like and lacking in expression.

Marke in our school for last May. In answer I have to say that I am not at all surprised by such a report, and that for the present, I do not attach the least importance to it.\n\nIf Mr. Marke made the impression of our school too weak age and a thousand other reasons, he may be forgiven and his future influence about Indian teaching shown. Would you be kind enough to send me a copy of his report, especially for that part concerning the working of the fugitive, so that I be able to establish a comparison between the two effects.\n\nIf they succeed I will willingly assist further working is not what it should be and how the plan is to change. We have to have teachers for more than ten.\nyears and it is the first time that such a remark has been passed on their work.\n\nIf they do not succeed I will also be able to find out why for which reasons Agent Mr. Smith has been making such a effort and the result of inspection will result at the time.\n\nExpressing the favour of a prompt reply I am\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, July 13, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant in which you take exception to the report of Mr. Agent Dilworth on the class instruction given in your school and state that you are not at all surprised at such a report and that you do not attach the least importance to it.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that Mr. Dilworth is simply carrying out his instructions to report matters as he found them at the time of his inspection. You were informed of his criticism of the teaching at your school in order that you might take steps to correct the method complained of. As you have mentioned Mr. Inspector Markle's name in connection with this matter I beg to quote you an extract from his last inspection report on your school.\u2014 \"The pupils in both the Jr. and Sr. class rooms speak more audibly than those in the C. of E. school, still there is room for improvement even here in this respect. The junior teacher allows her pupils to recite together as a class and then individually. This manner of procedure tends, I think, to offset the pupils' natural timidity and to encourage them to speak in higher tones. They are, however, liable to acquire a tendency to 'sang' tones when reading by this method. Some progress.\"\n\nRev. N. Rumix,\nPrincipal,\nBlood R.C. Boarding School,\nStandoff, Alta.\nseems to have been made since I last visited there.\"\n\nFrom this extract you will see that Mr. Markle's opinion coincides with Mr. Agent Dilworth's as expressed in his report above referred to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It seems that Colin MacLeod has been retained by the Indians themselves and as he stated in court this morning he had been paid to look after the Defence. I explained to the Judge that I was looking after their interests on behalf of the Indian Department. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nYours truly,\n\nS'gd. J.L. Fawcett.\n\n(Memo.

MARPLE ON THE BLOOD R.C. EDG. SCHOOL.\n\n13. Black Rabbit and Rabbit Tail, school graduates, gained admittance to the girls dormitory about the 1st of August last and at about 2 O.C. in the night. The sister in charge of the dormitory attempted to cut off their retreat but these lads made their escape through the window by which they entered and where they had placed a ladder. There was a complaint made to the N.W.M. Police and the boys were arrested and on trial pleaded guilty.\n\nI understand, to the charge. I was told that an item appeared in the local newspaper to the effect that Mr. Fawcett of Fawcett and Cameron, claimed at the trial that he was looking after the defense of the culprits in behalf of the Department. Rather Ruaux seemed to be passed over this report. He entertained the view that \"the Department employed counsel it would look better in print if it did so to prosecute instead of to defend for such a case - an offence.\"\n\nI afterwards looked over the office file for information on this point and found a letter to the Agent a copy of which I shall attach. Mr. Dilworth informed me that as far as he knew the Department had given no instructions to Mr. Fawcett. I found, however, that $60.52 had been paid, $55.00 fees and $5.52 costs, through the office and charged to a relation of one of the boys. Mr. Macleod accepted a horse worth about $75.00 for his claim.\n\nDate of Inspection - November 5th, 1915\nOttawa, November 26, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to that portion of your report on the Blood (R.C.) Boarding School which refers to the trial of Black Rabbit and Rabbit Tail I beg to say that the Department is unable to find that any authority was given to Mr. J. L. Fawcett, Barrister, Macleod, to defend these boys and I should be obliged if you will inform the Principal accordingly and tell him that it is not the policy of the Department to furnish counsel for offenders of this class.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. A. Markle, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRed Deer, Alta.\nOttawa, November 26, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report from Mr. Inspector Markle on the Blood (R.C.) Boarding School in which he states that Black Rabbit and Rabbit Tail, school graduates, gained admittance to the girls' dormitory about the 1st of August, last, at about 2 o'clock in the night and that boys were arrested and on trial pleaded guilty to the charge. Mr. Markle states he was told that an item appeared in the local newspaper to the effect that Mr. Fawcett or Fawcett and Cameron claimed at the trial that he was looking after the defense of the culprits on behalf of the Department.\n\nThe Department would like to know what authority Mr. Fawcett had for stating to the Judge that he was looking after the interests of these boys on behalf of the Indian Department.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform the Principal of this school that it is not the policy of the Department to furnish counsel for offenders of this class, and did not do so in this case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. J. Dilworth, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMacLeod, Alta.\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 26th ultimo\n\nNo. 180148\u2014I re supposed engagement of an attorney on behalf of the Indian Department to defend Peter Black Rabbitt and Peter Rabbit Tail; I beg to inform you that Mr Fawcett had no authority to say that he was engaged by the Indian Department;\u2014He was engaged by Bruised Head the father of Peter Rabbitt Tail with my consent, and I do not believe Mr Fawcett that ever thought he was in any way employed by the Indian Department, what he said being wrongly interpreted by a reporter.\n\nAn attorney was engaged on behalf of Peter \u201cAbb\u201d Tail for the reason that he was not the real culprit and he was charged with a crime that would bring a sentence out of all proportion to the offence. The real culprit was Black Rabbitt and a large measure of blame for the offence rests with the School authorities themselves in allowing this boy to hang around the mission. He has been a pet of the R C and St Joseph\u2019s Industrial school and is the boy whom the school St Joseph\u2019s Industrial allowed out on leave of absence at 17 years of age until he should receive his discharge; attention to this fact was drawn to the Department by my letter of February 6th last, so that I felt justified in seeing that Peter Rabbitt Tail should not receive where punishment another boy was the real culprit.\n\nThe principal of the Blood R C school knows\nknows that the Indian Department did not engage a lawyer to look after the defence of the boys in question. He knows that Peter Rabbitt Tail paid for his own lawyer out of wages earned by himself.\n\nIn cases like these I endeavor to see that our Indians get justice in the Courts, and that the sentences imposed are commensurate with the crime and the conditions governing them. I am ready to accept responsibility for the boy Peter Rabbitt Tail as for the other boy he should have received a heavier sentence than he did receive. It will probably have a beneficial effect on the school authorities too, as it will have a tendency to put a stop to favoritism.\n\nI have the Honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nTo the Assistant Deputy and Sec'y\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 12, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th ultimo in reference to the engagement of an attorney on behalf of the Department to defend Peter Black Rabbit and Peter Rabbit Tail, who gained admission to the girls' dormitory at the Blood (R.C.)

SCHOOL.\n\nREPORT DATED,- FEBRUARY 6th, 1917.\n\nI HAVE SOMETIMES THOUGHT THAT THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN were too much engrossed in the society doings on the reserve to give the attention to their studies that is necessary to make rapid advancement. The pupils at both of the schools here are in too close touch with reserve events, I think.\nOttawa, February 20th, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nIn your recent report on the Blood R.C. boarding school, it is noted that you state that you consider that the children are too much engrossed in what is being done on the reserve and as a result they do not give sufficient attention to their studies.\n\nCan you suggest any means by which this difficulty could be overcome?\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ.A. Markle, Esq.\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRed Deer, Alberta.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo and to say that about the same conditions prevail where schools are located on reserves and where Indians have inherited the dance craze. The Superior of the Crowfoot School made a like complaint to me last Monday. She stated that the big boys apparently though of little else and were constantly running away from the school to attend these dances, of which there has been two and three weekly on this reserve\u2014Blackfoot, since the payments of cash for grain about December 15th last, anyway.\n\nI am unable to reply to your question to my own satisfaction.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInsp.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nR.C.

Middleton, principal of St. Paul's Mission, Church of England on the Blood Indian Reserve, told me, a few weeks ago the result of a conversation he had with you, at Ottawa last summer, about an increase of grant for the Indian Schools, and which you could not afford to give. But instead you suggested to him to solicit the Indians of the Reserve called in a special meeting to consent and to vote a certain sum, that would be paid by the Indian Department, out of the Reserve funds, to the two Schools of the Blood Reserve viz: the Church of England and the Roman Catholic, in order to help them to meet the high cost of living, and pass through the present hard times.\n\nMr. Middleton requested my assistance to prepare the Indians for the meeting by explaining the proposition to them before hand. I have no doubt that the Indians would willingly come to the help of the schools.\n\nThe aim, Honourable Sir, of the present letter, is to ascertain myself if you are still in favour of the plan suggested to Mr. Middleton last summer, I would like to receive the assurance of it directly from your hand, before taking any further step in that line.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nFebruary 7, 1919.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 23rd of January. I think that the present would not be an opportune time to submit any question to the Blood Indians with reference to expenditure on education, and, whenever it is thought advisable to do so, the proposition should be made by a representative of the Department.\n\nI recollect discussing the matter with Mr. Middleton and expressing the view that the Blood Indians might expend some of their own money on the education of their children.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

C?\n\nBOARDING SCHOOL, October 5, 1923.\n\nSister Gertrude, Elementary certificate, Illinois State Normal School.\n\nSister Mary, No certificate.\n\nIn the senior room there are 24 pupils enrolled, 11 in grade II, and 13 in grade IV. All are retarded, as may easily be inferred from the fact that IV is the highest grade in the school. In Grades I and II there are 36 pupils enrolled. They are also very backward.\n\nSister Gertrude succeeds in getting her class through the reading lesson by half pronouncing the word the pupil following up and appending the tails. In this manner each pupil reads once and then the class is dismissed. Spelling is taken orally, each pupil getting one word to spell. In arithmetic in Grade III the method is to call the class. All face the front of the room, then the teacher goes to the side board and sets down this question:\n\nOne pupil is sent to the board to work the problem. He multiplies aloud setting down the figures as he does so. His position is such that the rest of the class cannot observe what he is doing without turning around. And this they do not do, and hence take no more part than do the inhabitants of Mars. The Grade IV arithmetic problem was to divide 281973 by 3. As the pupil who was sent to the board to solve this problem did not know the table of three times he was given a card having all of the multiplication tables conveniently printed upon it and with this he managed with considerable help from the teacher to at last complete the problem.\n\nSister Mary's instruction is defective in every respect. Class management, supervision, assignments and methods of presenting the work are almost without exception lamentably poor.\n\nJ. H. Hutchison, Insp.\nOttawa, Apr. 9, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Provincial Public School Inspector has reported so unfavourably concerning the instruction and teaching ability of Sister Gertrude and Sister Mary, of the Senior and Junior Rooms at the Blood R.C. Indian Boarding School, that it is my duty to ask you to arrange for better qualified successors in the near future. This Department's aim is to have efficient classroom instruction in the schools that are supported by parliamentary appropriation, and I should be pleased to have your cooperation. Please let me know what action you take in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAset. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. E. Ruaux, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlood R.C. Bdg.

There are eleven Sisters in this Institution and between sixty and seventy children. As usual, I found the children in excellent shape - clean, well dressed and tidy. This was not a dress parade. The children are well fed and good work is being done here. This work, however, is being carried on under great disadvantages. The present school building is certainly unfit to carry on work in. However, the time is not far distant I hope, when they will enjoy a new building; and when it is built and operated, it will be a credit to the Indian Department. The work they are now doing under great disadvantages would be discouraging to most people. As it is, I found everything in the old building immaculate. They want to do a little brightening up of the interior of the classroom and livingroom, and asked to be allowed to have a little paint to do this work. I gave the Agent the necessary authority to purchase a small quantity of paint. The vouchers for this will pass through this office.\n\n(Sgd.) W.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nD.C.

More than ever, we realize the great interest you take in the education of Indian children, by helping to get for them better qualified teachers.

Indian Residential School. I am aware that this teacher took a special course in Edmonton this summer; but it will take considerable time for her to overcome her handicap in English. It is of vital importance that the teachers of Indian children have a good command of the language of instruction and I shall be pleased if you will arrange in the immediate future for a better qualified instructor.

Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Education\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Mr Ferrier:\n\nI just returned this morning from a visit to both the Peigan and Blood Schools. On our way south we had stopped at Hobbema and visited Erminaskins' school. Rev. Fr Blanchin and myself enjoyed our trip and for my part I feel very pleased to give you the very best news about the construction of the new Blood School which is progressing rapidly and under ideal circumstances.\n\nIn connection with this reconstruction of the Blood School I wish to have instructions regarding the management of the new school. Commissioner Graham has stated to Rev. Fr Ruaux Principal that he was to be in full charge instead of the Sisters who until now were responsible to the Department though correspondence was exchanged with Rev. Fr Ruaux only. The latter together with Rev. Fr Blanchin are in favor of the change and the Sisters seem also to prefer it though the higher administration has not as yet sanctioned the change. Would you kindly give me your idea in this matter even by wire if possible.\n\nA matter arising from the change of possession is that of stock and farm implements. Mr Graham stated to Rev. Fr Ruaux that the Department would supply farm implements but not stock to the new school. Rev. Fr Ruaux is conversant with the fact that the Department has supplied stock to different schools in similar circumstances and does not know what to make out of the Commissioner's statement. So he has requested me to ask from you about the Department's policy.\n\nAnother matter is that of the accounts. Rev. Fr Ruaux wishes to know if his school is on the same basis and of the same character as that of Duck Lake and if therefore accounts are to be kept in the same manner.\n\nAs I will be at the above address until the 11th I would be grateful to you for sending me a wire covering all the above matters.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, August 8, 1925.\n\nREV.

You have treated us with great generosity, in giving us a splendid construction equipped with all modern conveniences. In my own name and that of the Blood Indians of our Creed, I thank you with all my heart. I have no doubt that this School will prove a great factor in advancing the work we are doing among the Indians.\n\nAs we shall have the official opening of this new Institution on July 21st, I should feel highly favored if you could be present for the occasion, which would give the Indians an opportunity of expressing their appreciation of your interest.\n\nMost respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nJuly 9, 1926.\n\nReverend and dear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, informing me that the new school building will be opened on the 21st July. I should consider myself fortunate if it were possible for me to be present at the opening and to inspect the new building, and to see yourself and the staff in your new quarters, but I regret that under the present circumstances that would be impossible. However, I should like to send a message of congratulation on the continuance of your activities in surroundings so greatly improved, and to bespeak for you continued success. On my early visits to the Blood Reserve I resolved that the school buildings should be modernized as soon as possible, and in this resolve I was supported by the Honourable the Superintendent General, and Parliament generously granted us the necessary funds for the purpose. I feel that the new institution is in excellent hands, and that you will make as full as possible use of the equipment to promote the interest and progress of the Indians of the Blood Reserve.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. E. Ruaux, O.M.I.\nSt. Mary's Roman Catholic Residential School,\nCardston, Alberta.\nSt. Mary's R.C. Residential School Blood Reserve\nCardston Alta. July 2nd, 1926\n\nMr. Duncan Scott,\nDepute Minister,\nOttawa\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nIn making the returns for the quarter ending June 30th, 1926, I have calculated the per capita grant on the basis of one hundred and sixty-five Dollars (165) per annum; I have done this in order that our school may be given the same assistance as institutions of equal standard. Schools of the same standard were automatically accorded the increased grant upon removal to their new buildings, and there seem no reason why this school should not be treated in the same manner. Since the first of April I have taken over the administration of the school from the sisters, and am in pressing need of funds owing to extraordinary expenses consequent upon the opening of the new school.\n\nI am Honorable Sir,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, July 14, 1926.\n\nDear Father Ruaux:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to the per capita grant to be allowed this fiscal year in the case of the Blood Indian Residential School.\n\nI regret that the funds at our disposal this year are extremely limited and it will not be possible to provide any increases at present. I intend to bring the varied needs of the educational institutions to the attention of the Honourable the Superintendent General at the earliest opportunity; but it will be impossible to immediately augment the per capita grant.\n\nBest wishes for a successful official opening on the 21st of the month.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. E. Ruaux, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlood Indian Residential School,\nCardston, Alta.\nBlood N.C. Residential School,\nCardston, Alta.\n\nMay 28th 1927.\n\nHonorable Mr. Scott,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nBy a letter dated May 3rd, Mr. Ferrier informed me that the grant of our School had been increased to $155.00 per capita. Lately the Rev. Fr. Beys, our Provincial Superior, wrote to me saying that Mr. Ferrier had informed him that our grant was raised to $160.00, but that he had made application to you to obtain for our school the same grant as the one allowed to the Duck Lake school, viz., $170.00.\n\nMoreover I am informed that the grant at the St Paul's school, Blood Reserve, is $160.00 since this new school was opened two years ago. There would seem to be a discrimination against our new school, which nevertheless is located on the same Reserve but further away from the Cardston Railway Station than St Paul's.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the increase granted, still I hope that our school will not be treated inferiorly than others under similar conditions.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nE. Ruaux, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nJune 7, 1927.\n\nDear Father Ruaux:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the grant allowed in the case of the Blood Indian Residential School. It is true that there are some temporary inequalities in the amount of grant allowed to Indian residential schools in the Prairie Provinces. These are being removed as fast as possible. An adjustment commenced the beginning of this fiscal year. Some time ago the St. Paul's Institution applied for and received a larger grant than paid formerly. At that time the present adjustment was not contemplated, as it was uncertain whether or not funds for the purpose would be provided by Parliament. This year the Blood School received an increase of $15 and the St. Paul's School, no increase. I am hopeful that in the near future it will be possible to have both schools at the rate contemplated for institutions of this type and in this geographical situation, viz.: $170. I regret that funds are not available at the present time to pay more than $155 per capita in the case of your school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D.

Pauw, chief\nprincipal\nRoman Catholic Residential School,\nCardston, Alta., January 23, 1928.\n\nHonorable D.C. Scott, Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nStatement requested by Mr. Pugh, Indian Agent, Blood Reserve, Alta.\nRe: Smith and Albert Many Fingers.\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nMy occupation at the R.C. School, Blood Reserve, is the one of Gardiner in summer time. During the winter months, sharing the work with the Disciplinarian and assisting in the Boiler room. Albert Many Fingers, is a Pupil 17 years of age.\n\nTrouble between myself and this boy commenced about two months ago. Specific orders had been given by the Reverend Principal E. Ruaux, that the boys should not pass through the corridors, leading along side the kitchen to the Boiler room. Albert Many Fingers took no heed of the order and continued without any good reason, to appear into these passages. I repeatedly cautioned him, at the beginning, in as a friendly a way as was possible to do, what he had been told; I had to the present time a good opinion of the boy and wanted by all means to prevent trouble, but he took no notice whatever; on the contrary, began to show outward signs of antagonism towards me. It gradually seemed to me that an attempt was being made by my authority. Every time he would meet me, he would show signs of contempt and defiance sneering at my face occasionally using such insults as no white man would take from another; not speaking of an Indian, until he gave me clearly to understand, that I was afraid of him and that he was going to fight and lick me, as in fact, he had told another senior boy, Willie Mills by name, whom he wanted to lead in the same trouble and whose statement you will find here enclosed.\n\nIt would take too much space to relate in detail the different times and happenings in which this boy brought himself into trouble, in these passages. The sole reason for doing so was to have a chance to flirt with the girls working in the kitchen, laundry, creamery, bakery, etc. He was caught many times at this game and actually once, acting indecently, in company of the afore named Willie Mills, with one of the big girls. The whole staff was taking notice of this situation and the sisters in charge of the girls complained to me, that through the actions of these two boys, the entire girls were becoming uncontrollable. In the dining room, their pastime was to talk and make signs to one another, which obliged me to change these two boys' places, where they could be better seen. It brought the matter to its climax and I went again to the Rev. Principal, who was already aware of everything and who had given strong warning to Albert Many Fingers, that he was getting himself in bad trouble. Rev. Father Ruaux answered me that it would not settle the question, if he would strap the boy, but would rather increase his contempt for me, for having him punished and would incite him to come back on me at first opportunity. I must have my own authority and use it when necessary, as the Rev. Principal absents himself occasionally.\n\nI had stood all I could from that boy. He wanted to fight me and I had to meet him on his own grounds. The boy is 17 years old and considers himself a man; so on the following Monday morning, when the pupils were going to breakfast, I kept him back in the play room. I pointed\nout to him his conduct towards me, his disobedience, his insults and finally told that since he thought himself a better man than I, the time has arrived to show it. He was given the same chance that I had myself. I hit him a few times and the result was a bleeding nose. When I saw that he was making no attempt at striking back, I quit, mentioned again the friendliness I had shown towards him in the past, pointed out to him what was right for his own good and took him to breakfast.\n\nThe matter would have had stopped right there, if the boy had not run away from the School, taking away another boy, and told the Indians he met all kinds of lies about what had taken place, such as stating that the School teacher Mr. Coady was holding his hands behind his back while I was pounding his face and creating an uproar on the whole Reserve. The fact is that Mr. Coady coming down for breakfast, knowing that all the Pupils were already in the dining room and hearing talking in the play room, opened the door, walked in, stood there and remained at least ten or twelve feet from the boy at all times and left before the thing was over.\n\nA few days later, the Agent Mr. Pugh, I understand, came to the School to make an investigation. I was not home at the time. He took the boy's evidence and more or less past judgement on me without even giving me a hearing, to which I take exception, giving those present to understand that if I do this again, I would be turned out of the School. I am not appealing to you for support, for this position I am holding. I have since coming here been offered better and more remunerative positions. I am only staying here with the idea of service. Helping where help is needed, may explain it better. What I do want and expect, is justice and also respect and obedience from those in my charge, which, if I could not obtain by myself, I would not consider myself eligible for the position. I have worked at boys work for many years and was Scout Master of a troop in Lethbridge before coming here. In my opinion, all this trouble could have been avoided, had the Agent, the father of the boy, and the Principal of the School, got together and talked the matter over. It was nothing more than what happens daily in all Indian schools, I understand. In fact, I have been informed of much greater trouble at the other School on this Reserve, when the Disciplinarian was knocked down by a boy with a piece of scantling on the head, and the staff held at bay by the same boy with a drawn knife; things similar to this would have happened in this particular case, had it not been checked in time, the way it was. These extreme means, must meet these extreme situations, it is the only method. A man has to protect his rights, himself, his good name and the good name of his mother. A mountain has been made out of a mole hill, in this case.\n\nTrusting you and Mrs. Scott are in the best of health, believe me to be, Honorable Sir.\n\nRespectfully yours\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.J. Smith\nSir,\n\nI beg to confirm my night lettergram of Jan. 26th, and to acknowledge receipt of your wire of Jan. 21st, and in reference to this matter I wish to submit herewith my report.\n\nOn January 5th a fight took place at the R.C.School, Blood Reserve, this was reported to me on the 14th inst., in the meantime on the 10th, Father Ruaux had reported to me that two boys had truanted including Albert Many Fingers. The father of the boy came to see me on Saturday the 14th inst., and as Agent asked my assistance in the matter, at the same time declaring his intention of having the charge laid against Assistant Smith for assault. In order to avoid trouble but the mothers of the two boys came to my office Monday and I personally took them to the St. Mary's School to look into the matter. The Chief who was at the office, expressed his desire to be present and this was granted by myself. At the school it was found that Mr. Smith was absent on leave, and I asked for Father Ruaux and the boys to state their case, this was done so.\n\nThe stories vary somewhat, but in the main it is admitted that there was an invitation to fight and a fight did take place, and it is admitted that the boy's nose was bleeding. While dealing with the matter, I stated that the Department, as far as I knew, would not countenance the striking of a boy by fists, and stated that I thought the proper method should be by the use of a regulation strap and that, in the event of a further case arising, I would report to the Department and ask for the dismissal of any Teacher or Disciplinearian using his fists. I came away from the school and I was under the impression that the matter was finished there; however, the Chief and father came to see me later and were insistent in their desire to have this man prosecuted and they requested me to send my lettergram to you. At this time Mr. Inspector Christianson was present at this Agency and the father of the boy took this matter up with him, and Mr. Christianson and myself discussed the matter and decided to wire you for instructions.\n\nOn receipt of your wire I proceeded to the school Saturday evening to convey your information to Father Ruaux. Father Ruaux, Mr. Smith and Mr. Cody were present and, much to my astonishment, found Father Ruaux and Mr. Smith in an antagonistic frame of mind and, among many things, said was, that it was unfair to pass judgment and wire yourself without me getting a statement from Mr. Smith. I therefore was not insistent in prosecuting your telegram and asked Mr. Smith to let me have a written statement to forward to you.\n\nThis statement\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nThis statement is attached and speaks for itself.\n\nFather Ruaux, in his statement to me at the school, took exception to my being allowed to investigate this matter, and accuses me of the following things. First, that I took a lot of Indians to the school at the time when I first investigated this, but not before him that I was coming, but put the two Indians in question in my car and drove to the school. The Chief went by himself; at the school there was as a matter of fact, a number of Indians when I arrived. Secondly, he accuses me of being partisan for the reason that they are Catholics. He states that he will endeavour to have an Agent's duties confined to looking after the plant only; that they could not manage the children with the Agent and the Inspector listening to complaints from Indians and then proceeding to the school to investigate. He states further that this had to be done in the case of Nurses and that Mr. Inspector Christianson had been reported along the same lines. Father Ruaux states he would not accept an investigation by Inspector Christianson, but only from some one from the Ottawa office, and that he would have to have his Superior, and if necessary the Bishop, present at the investigation. I might say that at an Indian dance, to which this boy was away to, this matter was announced to the Indians assembled, this information I have obtained from the father and the boy. Lastly, I am accused of taking action on the lies of Indians as is the case always and making, as contained in Mr. Smith's letter, a mountain out of a mole hill.\n\nThe Chief came to see me again Monday the 23rd inst., and again repeated his interest in the matter and stated, that if the Department did not take some action against Mr. Smith that they would still ask the Police to do so. I might say that the father of the boy has already laid the information in this case, but they have been asked to withhold action.\n\nIn regard to Mr. Smith's statement, this speaks for itself. It includes the admission of inviting to fight and fighting, but is tempered with the defence that it is necessary. The argument is in this connection given by Father Ruaux and Mr. Smith, that with Indians of this type unless they are humiliated no good can be done with them.\n\nIn regard to my action in this case, or in any other school case, I have always governed myself by that form of instructions to Indian Agents under your signature found on pages eight and nine under Educational clauses 28 & 29, which speaks for themselves. Father Ruaux contends that an Agent has not the right to look into matters of this kind, and that I have no right whatever of stating that a strap could be used. It appears to me that if such a condition as having to fight, no matter what the provocation may be unless actual self defense, has not a place in conducting schools or Agencies in our Department. I do not think that you would tolerate for one minute myself or any of the staff lowering themselves to fisticuffs with the Indians no matter what the offence, unless actual self defense, and I know that we should be immediately dismissed.\n\nIn conclusion I wish to state, that in view of the conditions existing in matters of this kind, and particularly in this case, I wish to tentatively place my resignation in your hands on the basis of the accusations made against me, and the fact that this will make it practically impossible for cooperation with Father Ruaux, especially so will this be the case should an Agent be instructed not to visit the schools from a disciplinerian or other point of view.\n\nI have always\nI have always considered it my duty in a complaint of this kind to investigate and the one failure, that of courtesy in not phoning Father Ruaux previous to my leaving the office, is probably regrettable. I am rendering this report unbiased and would ask for a thorough investigation into this matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n4th February, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Pugh,\n\nI have your letter of January 25th with enclosure. The incident is giving me some concern. I would not receive your resignation even in any qualified sense. You must continue to administer the agency firmly, with a full knowledge that you have the confidence and support of the Department.\n\nIn view of Mr. Smith's unwarranted assault of this pupil as corroborated by his own statement and the refusal of the principal to dismiss him or to do anything else to recognize the injury done to this boy, I do not feel warranted in asking the father of the boy to further refrain from prosecuting the charge already laid against Mr. Smith. You will advise the father accordingly that he is at liberty to take whatever course to him may seem proper.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ.E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\nFebruary 7, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI am informed by the Indian Agent for the Blood Reserve, who has general supervision over the residential schools and all other activities on the reserve, that you have objected to his investigating the conduct of Mr. E. J. Smith, an employee of the school, and that you stated that you would endeavour to have his duties confined to looking after the mechanical and material part of the school; that this action had to be taken in the case of nurses, and that our inspectors have been reported for similar action; and that you stated that you would not accept an inspection by Inspector Christianson; and that you would have your Superior, and if necessary, the Bishop, present at an investigation.\n\nI have to ask you for an immediate explanation of this statement. I have every confidence in Agent Pugh, and I take a serious view of the statements that he has made.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. H. Ruaux, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlood Indian Residential School,\nCardston, Alberta.\nFebruary 7, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Pugh,\n\nI am inclosing a letter addressed to the Reverend Principal Rusaux. When you have read it kindly send it on to him. I hope you will keep me fully and promptly informed if any action is being taken in this case.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ. E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alberta.\nCrime Report\n\nRe: Edwin Smith - Cardston Alta.- Common Assault\n\nOn the 26th inst., Morris Many Fingers, an Indian of the Blood Reserve, came to this Detachment & complained that on the 5th inst., his son Albert, age 17 years, a pupil of the Roman Catholic School on this Reserve, had been assaulted by the above named, who is one of the staff at the above mentioned school.\n\nThe affair took place at the school, which is situated on the Blood Indian Reserve. The following is a brief outline of what happened:\n\nIt appears that for some time past Albert Many Fingers had been disobeying certain regulations made by the Rev. Father E. Roux, the Principal of the school, and when spoken to about it by Smith, who assists the Disciplinarian during out-of-school hours, it is alleged he became insolent & it is further alleged that he had expressed his intention of fighting Smith at the first opportunity.\n\nOn the 5th inst., Albert Many Fingers was deliberately disobedient, which resulted in Smith, whose age is about 30, inviting the Indian boy to fight. Smith then hit him several times & made his nose bleed, without any retaliation whatsoever on the part of the Indian boy.\n\nAn information was laid on the 26th inst. by Morris Many Fingers before J.W. Low, Police Magistrate, charging Smith with violation of section 291 of the Criminal Code of Canada. In the meanwhile the Dept. of Indian Affairs, at Ottawa was notified of what had happened by J.E. Pugh, Indian Agent, and word was received from the Dept. to the effect that Smith was to be immediately dismissed. If this order is complied with by the Principal, Morris Many Fingers desires to withdraw the information, no doubt the Police Magistrate will allow this to be done, because if Smith is dismissed, he has been sufficiently punished.\n\nFrom my investigation in this case, I understand that on the day in question Smith admits striking the Indian boy, and then makes a futile attempt to justify his actions, by saying that this was the only way to enforce obedience, which is obviously ridiculous. If Albert Many Fingers was disobedient & merited punishment, same should have been administered in the proper manner, i.e. the regulation strap. There are numerous legal rulings laid down, which support this contention.\n\nA. Howard\nSgt\n(A. Howard)\nReg. No. 4627\nI/c. Cardston Detachment\nThe Commissioner\n\nSir:\n\nForwarded.

Father Ruaux, Principal of the Blood Indian School, he communicated to me the letter You addressed to him on the 7th inst. The Rev. Father asked me to answer to same, as he did not feel inclined to write on his own behalf.\n\nI made a careful inquiry about the accusations brought against Father Ruaux, and, I think, I may safely state the following as the real facts:\n\n1. Rev. Father Ruaux never objected to inspections or investigations from Department Officials. We could hardly expect anything else from a man who has been 18 years Principal of one of our biggest Schools and probably the most difficult to manage.\n\n2. Rev. Father Ruaux objected to investigations or inspections as some have been conducted lately, both by Mr Christianson and Mr Pugh. If my informations are true, and I have every reason to believe they are, no one could blame the Principal for his objecting to same.\n\n3. The mention about nurses was never made according to the statement of the school staff who assisted to the interview between Mr Pugh and the Principal.\n\n4. It must be added that in the heat of the discussion, Rev. Father Principal may have said words that went beyond what he had really in mind. On the other hand his meaning may have been misunderstood. The sad fact remains that relations between the Agent and the Principal are strained. I am working to promote amongst them a better understanding and expect to be helped by the Department in this purpose, as no good can result without broad minded cooperation.\n\nI am, dear Mr. Scott always Yours sincerely.\n\nJ.

Evidence was given by Albert Many Fingers for the Prosecution, as outlined in C.R., re the above dated 26-1-28, which was corroborated by two other Indian boys named Jim Big Threat & Bob Big Soreel Horse.\n\nAt the close of the case for the Prosecution, Counsel for the Defense applied to His Worship for dismissal of the case against his client, pleading the provisions of section 65 of the Criminal Code in extenuation, but the Magistrate asked to hear the evidence for the Defense.\n\nThe accused in giving evidence on his own behalf, the sum & substance of which is that he admitted both inviting Albert Many Fingers to fight and striking him three or four times in the face with clenched fists, but claimed this was the only way to enforce discipline. Smith's evidence was corroborated by A.W. O'Conley, one of the teachers at the Indian School in question.\n\nThe Police Magistrate after considering the evidence both for the Prosecution & Defense, adjudicated as follows, using these words: \"(1) I think that blows with clenched fists on the face is unreasonable punishment under the circumstances of this case; it would be justified only to resist force with force. (2) I think that the accused stepped outside the bounds of his official position, when he invited Albert Many Fingers to fight.

Mr. Smith was represented by Mr. G.E.A. Rice of Lethbridge, and Mary Fingers was represented by Mr. O'Brien of Cardston. The various witnesses were examined after giving evidence for the prosecution, and after the prosecution evidence was all taken, Mr. Rice moved for dismissal, on the grounds that that the punishment was not excessive and that it was necessary in the particular case, and went on further to say that the matter had no right to be in Court, but was a means of settling a dispute between the Principal of the School and the Indian Agent, and certainly would not have come up, if the Indian Agent had not interfered with the operation of the School. (I was not present in the Court Room when this was stated, being called out at the time the statement was made.) At this point Mr. O'Brien asked for permission to place me on the stand, which was deemed not advisable. Mr. O'Brien then demanded that the statement be retracted, which I understand was done. The Magistrate then called for the Defence witnesses, who were duly examined, Mr. Smith himself going on to the stand, and was cross-examined. After all parties had rested their cases, the Magistrate summed up the judgement in the following way, as his record reads as follows:\n\n(1) I think that blows with clenched fists on the face unreasonable punishment under the circumstances of this case; it would be justified only to resist force with force.\n\n(2) I think that the accused stepped outside the bounds of his official position when he invited Albert Mary Fingers to fight. This in my opinion was not discipline, I adjudge the accused, Edin Smith, guilty of assault. Penalty $10.00 and costs.\n\nI do not know whether I am expected to make comment on the case, and will refrain from doing so unless the Department request such, I would, however, like to go on record as being absolutely aggrieved at the way I was injected into the matter by Smith's Counsel, especially in view of the fact, that Mr. Rice was taken to the School by Mr. Smith the evening previous to the case, and no doubt the Department will then see where such viscous opinion originated from, and I feel it my just right that an apology should come from that source through the Department for the statement made.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDuncan C.

Ottawa, April 10th, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nRe - Edwin Smith, Common Assault,\nBlood Reserve, Alta.\n\nI beg to enclose, herewith, for your further information in connection with the above matter, copy of a report, dated the 30th ultimo, submitted by the Officer Commanding Southern Alberta District.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCortlandt Starnes,\nCOMMISSIONER.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nWith further reference to previous C.Rs.re the above dated 26-1-28, 26-2-28, 29-2-28 & 30-3-28, on April 2nd, I patrolled in auto to Macleod to attend Court in the Appeal of the above mentioned case, which was tried at Macleod on the 3rd.inst, before His Honor Judge A.M.Macdonald.\n\nJ.D. Matheson, Agent for the Attorney General, at Macleod and J.W. O'Brien of Cardston for the Prosecution.\n\nG.E.A. Rose of Shepherd, Rice & Fairbairn & Lethbridge for the Defense.\n\nThere was very little difference between the evidence produced by the Crown at this trial and that which was produced at the trial at Cardston in the Police Magistrate's court on February 25th last, with the exception that the Rev. W.K. Haynes of the Pelican Indian Reserve gave evidence at this trial, with regard to the usual method employed in Indian schools when it was necessary in the interests of discipline to chastise a pupil for misconduct, and told the Court that in his experience of 50 years teaching Indian boys, the chastising was always done by the Principal and with a strap and on examination by Counsel for the Defense stated that when the occasion demanded it he would resist force with force, or words to that effect.\n\nTurning to the evidence produced by the Defense, this was practically the same as at the trial. An attempt was made by the Defense to introduce fresh evidence by calling an Indian boy by the name of Willie Mills to give evidence that he had heard Albert Many Fingers say he was going to fight him because he was too strict. But the memory of this witness when he got on the witness stand became confused and he forgot apparently what he was supposed to say.\n\nThe accused in giving evidence on his own behalf, in part stated that the only way to enforce discipline among Indian boys was to humiliate them by striking them in the face, and anywhere else did not have the desired effect, and went on further to say that it was useless to take them to the Principal for punishment, because by so doing he would lose authority over them. (If this is so, it would appear that there is something radically wrong in the management of the school in question as far as enforcing proper discipline is concerned.)\n\nDuring this trial, the Judge in course of his remarks intimated that he would have liked to hear another witness who had considerable experience in enforcing discipline in Indian schools. Here I must mention that the Crown intended to subpoena Mr. T.K. Middleton, Principal of the St. Paul Anglican Indian School on the Blood Indian Reserve, but after I had inquired him about it, he positively declined to appear as witness.\nunless he was compelled to, on account of the strained relationship between the Principal of the St. Mary's R.C. Indian school and himself, so under these circumstances it was deemed unadvisable to call him as witness.\n\nAs in previous cases His Honor showed his usual antipathy towards, and lack of patience with Indian witnesses for the Prosecution. He seems not to understand that it is very seldom Indians are conversant enough with the English language to give evidence without the aid of an interpreter. And furthermore I have no hesitation in saying that he showed a distinct leaning towards the Defense all through the trial of this Appeal.\n\nIn summing up the Judge said he was satisfied that Albert Many Fingers, in his opinion was a bad boy & deserved chastisement, but he was undecided whether or not Smith should have punished the boy the way he did. It was a very important case to decide, as it would a ruling for all other Indian schools in the district, and therefore he would reserve his decision until a later date.\n\n................A.

Low, a Police Magistrate, on the 25th day of February last for unlawfully committing an assault on Albert Many Fingers, a pupil at St. Mary's Roman Catholic Indian School situated on the Blood Reserve south of Macleod.\n\nSmith is employed on the staff of the School referred to and among his other duties is that of maintaining discipline among the pupils. During the absence of the principal he is in charge of the School.\n\nMany Fingers is a pupil attending the School. He is a strong healthy boy and about the same height and weight as the appellant, and will be seventeen years old on the 5th of this month. Prior to the alleged assault he had been the cause of considerable trouble in the school and was a leader amongst some of the older pupils who were evidently becoming discontented at being subjected to school discipline. He had intimated his intention of fighting Smith. The appellant spoke to him about his conduct and also warned him but with no effect, as he continued to be insolent and disobedient to both Smith and his teacher. The appellant then reported the matter to the principal who advised him that it was his duty to see that discipline was maintained. He then concluded that in order to carry out his instructions and maintain discipline in the school it was necessary that he punish Many Fingers. On the morning of January 9th when the pupils were marching in to breakfast he requested him to stand out of line. When the other pupils had marched into the dining-room he told Many Fingers that he had been corrected several times but was still disobedient and he was now going to punish him, or words to that effect. He also referred to Many Fingers threat to fight him. Other words then passed between them and Many Fingers, seeing that he was about to be punished, assumed a fighting attitude with closed fists. Upon his so doing Smith struck him three rapid blows about the face and head with his fists causing his nose to bleed. Many Fingers then stepped back. No further attempt was made by Smith to strike him.\nI find that the blows struck, although causing the pupil's nose to bleed, were not severe and caused no apparent bruise or discoloration of the flesh where struck.\n\nI further find that the appellant in administering the punishment was not guilty of malicious intent or was he actuated by any ill-will towards Many Fingers. The punishment was not inflicted in a fit of anger.\n\nFollowing the judgments of Rex vs Metcalfe (1927) 3 W.W.R. 194; Rex vs Zinck, 18 Canadian Criminal cases 456; Regina vs Robinson, 7 Canadian Criminal Cases 52, and the authorities therein cited, I think that the appellant had the right to punish the pupil in question, or any of the other pupils disobeying the rules of the School.\n\nAt the close of the hearing of this appeal considerable doubt existed in my mind as to whether or not the force used was reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nI have carefully considered the evidence submitted on this point especially that of Rev. William R. Hanes, called by the crown, and who has had considerable experience in the management of Indian Schools. When asked what he would do if an Indian attempted to fight him he said he would knock him down and then take him to the principal to be dealt with.\n\nI have further considered the fact that the pupil had boasted that he intended fighting the appellant and the further fact that in appearance at least, he was physically able to carry out his boast. These, with the further facts that he assumed a fighting attitude when approached by Smith, and that when Many Fingers stepped back after receiving the blows complained of, no further attempt was made by Smith to strike him, convinces me, after consulting a number of authorities on this point, that the force used was not under the circumstances unreasonable. In this regard I may refer to the words of Ouseley, D.C.J., in the case of Rex vs Hilton decided by him in March, 1919, (unreported) and quoted in Rex vs Metcalfe already referred to, which reads as follows: \"It seems to me therefore that under these authorities I am in this appeal bound to find that taking into consideration the doctrine laid down in the case of State vs Pendergrass as explained by the case of Rex v Gaul that the force used was reasonable under the circumstances. I have consulted many authorities and so far as my reading extends the only case in which the schoolmaster or mistress has been found guilty of an assault is where the act was done with a dangerous weapon, improper for correction, and likely (the age and strength of the pupil being duly considered) to kill or maim, such as an iron bar, etc., or where the pupil is kicked on\nthe ground or otherwise ill-treated, or where the chastisement is flagrantly excessive, or the master has been actuated with malice or ill-will towards the pupil, but I have found no case which goes nearly the length that the respondent on this appeal is asking me to do, namely to hold that because a punishment inflicted by the schoolmistress caused temporary pain and discolouration of the flesh for a few days that no pain or inconvenience was experienced so far as the evidence shows outside the first two days, I should hold that the punishment inflicted was excessive or was not reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nI think, after taking all the circumstances into consideration, that the language in this quotation applies in this case.\n\nFor the reasons submitted the appeal will be allowed with costs and the conviction quashed and set aside with costs.\n\n\"A.M.

Our files do not show any record of this statement, so you will understand why an adjustment has not been made.\n\nI have decided that a grant of $165 shall be allowed as from July first, last, and I have asked Mr. Ferrier to make the necessary adjustment.

I did not insist on the Department buying said stock; but as the Rev. Sisters may insist and in fact insist on taking away what really belongs to them, and we, not being really in a position to buy or replace same, we ask the Department to supply the said schools at least with the most necessary items so that the schools may proceed normally when the sisters take away what belongs to them. Otherwise it would be impossible for us to run those schools!\n\nMy dear Mr. Scott, Re the above item I believe that Father Beyes' contention is fair. In fact those schools up to lately were under the control of the sisters as far as financial side is concerned. The Oblates taking now the absolute control of the school are in the same position as those other schools which in the beginning are provided by the Department for the most necessary items to go on with the running of the school such as: Horses, cows, agricultural implements &c.\n\nIn a word, the sisters abandoning the running of the school take away with what belong to them and the Oblates taking charge of the\nThe school have nothing to start with and appeal to the Department to get what is given to the other schools being in the same financial circumstances.\n\nI am leaving for the west next Sunday, should you favor me with an answer, please be kind enough to send it to the R.C. Rectory, Lachine. On my behalf let me offer you my most sincere thanks for your kind reception and you may rest assured of my entire cooperation in anything that might be for the good of the Department and the benefit of the Indians.\n\nBelieve me Honorable and dear Sir,\n\nYour's truly,\n\nJ.A. Thivierge\n\nR.C. Rectory, Lachine\nJune 22nd, 1928.\n\nDear Father Beys,\n\nWith reference to our previous correspondence on the subject of educational affairs on the Blood reserve, I have to inform you that I have noted the result of the case which arose out of the disciplinary measures used by an employee of the Blood Roman Catholic School. Notwithstanding the acquittal of Mr. Smith I am constrained to say that I am strongly opposed to punishment carried out by this method and I should hope that it will be the last occasion on which such an incident would occur. If there is any recurrence I should insist immediately upon the discharge of the offending official. In the present instance I may even yet decide that that is the best course, but the matter will be held in abeyance. I should like you to convey to the principal my strong disapproval of Mr. Smith's conduct.\n\nWhen I was on the Blood reserve last summer I endeavoured to moderate the feeling which exists on the reserve with reference to recruiting pupils and I asked both principals to make an effort to accommodate themselves to the circumstances, and before pupils were drafted to the schools, to discuss the matter with the Indian agent in order that no difficulties should arise. I asked Mr. Pugh to use his best endeavours to satisfy the principals and it was understood that all matters should be freely\n\nVery Rev. J. B.

I know that you will join me in the wish that these difficulties should moderate and entirely disappear.\n\nWith very kindest regards, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise that under date of Oct. 9th, Mr. G.E.A. Rice of Lethbridge, who defended Edwin Smith in the complaint of Many Fingers versus Edwin Smith, has advised that His Honor Judge MacDonald has fixed the costs in this trial and appeal at $63.45, and has ordered Many Fingers to pay the same.\n\nThe afore-mentioned has written asking me to collect and remit this amount, and I find this will inflict somewhat of a hardship on Many Fingers, having already paid out $50.00 to the lawyer who took the case for him, and other costs amounting to some $30.00.\n\nI presume that I shall be held responsible for this payment if Many Fingers refuses to pay. The Department will no doubt understand this man's feelings in regard to this case, especially in view of the fact that the family are the most law-abiding people I have under my charge, and I personally feel very bad over the matter.\n\nI should be glad to have advice in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOctober 18, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Pugh:\n\nI have your 402-8 of the 12th instant, with reference to the expenses of the Indian Many Fingers in connection with recent court action.

J. E. PUGH, INDIAN AGENT, CARDSTON, ALTA., DATED DECEMBER 1, 1928., RELATIVE TO TRUANCY AT THE R. C. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ON THE BLOOD RESERVE.\n\nWhen Sorrel Horse came before me he made the statement that he had been to see Father Ruaux, and asked him not to whip the boy when he brought him back, but Father Ruaux stated he would unless the Agent told him not to. If the statement is correct, it hardly seems fair to be burdened with that kind of statement and savors very much of placing me in the position of a go between. I deal with the Indians strictly according to the Act without reference to personal feelings, and when one gets a statement such as Big Sorrel Horse makes, I am forced to the admission that some tact is not being shown. I may say that last week I had another Indian make a similar complaint, and I feel that it makes a situation which is hard to handle, much more difficult.\nJanuary 2nd, 1929.\n\nNOTE:\n\nIn connection with the relationship between the Indian Agent's Office, Blood Agency, and the Principals of the two residential schools in the Agency, particularly with regard to the question of returning truant pupils, see letter of December 19th, 1928, from Indian Commissioner Graham enclosing copy of a letter received from Mr. Agent Pugh. This correspondence is on File 15-103.\nOttawa, May 22, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is desirous of learning if the elder girls at the Blood Indian Residential School are being trained in milking cows. As most of the graduates of your school will return to reserves that are largely farming communities, it is very important that the girls be fully competent in this particular. The Department expects that the elder girls, under proper supervision, will be given a course of instruction in milking, and I shall be pleased to learn that suitable arrangements have been made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

May 20th 1929.\n\nMr. Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLast July, 1928, at the occasion of your visit to St Albert, where I had the honor of meeting you, we discussed the matter of the Live-Stock and Implements that had been transferred to the new Piegan and Blood Schools.\n\nAs part of this Stock and Implements is claimed to be the property of the Rev. Sisters, you and Mr. Graham told us that the Department would send us a full report showing that such Stock was really the property of the Department, as having been acquired at the time of the closing of the Dunbow Indian School.\n\nWe would like very much to have a definite statement from you on this matter. We shall then advise the Rev. Sisters of your decision and leave to them the question of pressing their claim if they think such course advisable and justified.\n\nI remain, Dear Mr. Scott,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nProvincial.\nJune 6, 1929.\n\nDear Father Boys:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th ultimo, with reference to the ownership of the live stock and agricultural implements at the Sacred Heart and Blood Indian Residential Schools. As you are aware, these institutions are conducted on a partnership basis - some of the equipment is supplied by the Church and some by the Department. The schools are financed by department grant, and, from time to time, replacements to stock and implements are made from the earnings. Therefore, I believe the equipment must be considered school property.\n\nThe Department can hardly give favourable consideration to reimbursing the Reverend Sisters, who supplied equipment some time ago for the Sacred Heart and Blood Schools. Whatever they gave was part of their contribution to the work in which they were engaged. It is true that the Department now supplies a new school with practically all the physical equipment that is required for the satisfactory conduct of the institution; but I cannot consider reimbursing an organization for their donations of many years ago. The founders of all the older Indian schools in Canada have made similar contributions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nVery Rev. J. B. Boys, O. M. I.,\nOblate Fathers' Provincial House,\n9916-110th St.,\nEDMONTON, ALTA.\nRoman Catholic Residential School,\nCardston, Alberta, June 4th, 1929.\n\nJ.D. Mclean, Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 22nd May last asking for information if the older girls of our school are trained for milking cows and I beg to answer in the affirmative. During the Summer holidays the older girls remain at the school and milk the cows morning and evening; in fact they milk better than the boys, but division of the work in the house during the year obliges me to use the boys for milking as the girls have much to do otherwise.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE. Ruaux, O.M.I., Principal\nSt. Mary's R.C. Residential School,\nCardston, Alberta, Nov. 25th, 1930.\n\nReverend Father U. Anglais, O.M.I.,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nReverend Father:\n\nReferring to the conversation we had at the time of your visit, there are a few things that should be brought to the attention of The Department of Indian Affairs. The first one is the matter of our Per capita grant which is lower than the one paid to all other Schools of the same class as ours: Duck Lake, Onion Lake, Delmas, Hobema, and here on our own Reserve and for the same Indians St. Paul's Church of England. All these Schools receive $170.00 when we are kept at $165.00. I have brought this difference to the Dept. of Indian Affairs, but without success.\n\nThe second one is the question of Play ground Equipment for our children, these have been supplied to different Schools, St. Paul's in particular, I have applied for the same, but without result; our School is built on the open Prairie and our children have nothing to play with during recreation.\n\nThe third one is the matter of recruiting children for the School. I am informed that education is compulsory for Indian children seven years of age, all over Canada, but here nothing is done to bring them to School, although there is at least twenty children of School age on the Blood Reserve, that should be in our School.\n\nHoping you will succeed to bring the Department to consider these matters, I remain.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\n| School       | Grant |\n|--------------|-------|\n| Duck Lake    | $170  |\n| Onion Lake   | $170  |\n| Thunderdell  | $170  |\n| Ermineskin   | $170  |\n| St. Paul's   | $165  |\n| Blood        | $165  |\n\n+ all 7 in & atta\nMissionnaires Oblats de Marie Immacul\u00e9e\nMaison St-Joseph\n9916 - 110\u00e8me Rue\nEdmonton - Alberta.\n\nHon.B.C.Scott\nSurintendent G\u00e9n\u00e9ral\nD\u00e9partement des Affaires Indiennes,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nCher M.Scott,\n\nJe suis \u00e0 visiter les diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9coles indiennes qui sont sous ma juridiction, et j'ai pri\u00e9 les Principaux de me mettre par \u00e9crit leurs dol\u00e9ances ou sujets de plaintes.

Dans l'initia-\nTranslation\n\n103-2-1\n\nEdmonton, Dec 15th 1930\n\nHon. W.C. Scott\nSuperintendent General\nDept. Education Affairs\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI am now visiting the different Indian schools under my jurisdiction and have requested the Principals to send me in writing their grievances and complaints. I shall every one of them how you were interested in the success of our schools and how we were assured to respond to the wishes of the Department to cooperate efficiently with it by informing you of our desires.\n\nThis why I take the liberty of enclosing and recommending to your kind attention the letter of the Rev. F. Ruaux, Principal of our school of Ste-Marie de Cardston.\n\nI remember that Father Ruaux had spoken to me at the time of my visit of the disparity of treatment mentioned in his first paragraph, also of the state of inferiority in which this was placing the school under his direction. There may have been in the past serious reasons to legitimate that difference in the allowance. I do not know these. I am not aware if they are still existing but I would be greatly pleased to know why at the present moment our school of Ste-Marie de Cardston does not receive the same treatment as the other schools of the same rank. On the other hand if the Rev. F. Ruaux was mistaken in complaining of a situation which does not exist, the Department would render me a great service by advising me accordingly.\n\nThe lack of outdoor play for the children invisible to all visitors of this school. I made the remark myself to Rev. F. Ruaux. She reports are not only a good means of physical culture, but also a good school of moral formation. In this situation...\nOf Indian children to our civilized life, playing is one of the most important matters, and I have insisted with all our Principals that they see as soon as possible, with the help of the Department, to the organization of the Indian young people in appropriate sporting groups.\n\nNearly all the Principals have let me understand that the regulations issued under your care for registration into Indian schools, at least those under our care, were not strictly observed. This carelessness or weakness on the part of the Agents is not of a nature to favour the work of the schools both at such great cost by the Department, nor to break the Indians to the vigorous discipline which alone make polished nation and strong people. It furthermore does not seem to me to be the prerogative of the Principals to round up children of school age; they are all ready to cooperate with the authorities in this matter but the initiative must not rest with them. When the Indians will feel that there is the hand of the Government behind every school, they will not hesitate to send their children where the Department will direct them.\n\nI hope, dear Mr. Scott, that you will take these few suggestions in good part as they are made with the aim to help the work to which you have devoted many years of your life with success. Believe in my sincere wish to work in accordance with your Department and in my most distinguished sentiments towards yourself.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nJanuary 8, 1931.\n\nDear Father Langlois:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th ultimo, enclosing a communication from the Reverend Father Rusaux, Principal of the Blood Indian Residential School. At the outset, he states that his per capita grant is lower than that paid to all other schools of the same class, including the Church of England School on the same reserve. The fact is that all seven Indian Residential Schools in southern Alberta - four Protestant and three Catholic - receive $165. The other Catholic Schools which he mentions receive $170, for good and sufficient reasons. Some are church-owned and one is remote from the railway. As far as the Duck Lake Indian Residential School is concerned, it was formerly in the \"Industrial School\" class. Ten years ago, it received $25 per child more than the Blood School; today, the difference is but $5.\n\nWith reference to playground equipment, much is supplied or built by the school management. The Department provides footballs, volley ball equipment and playground ball outfits, but we expect the schools to prepare\n\nVery Rev. U. Langlois, O.M.I.,\nOblate Fathers' Provincial House,\n9916 - 110th St.,\nEdmonton Alta.\n\n- the playing\nthe playing fields and to erect swings, teeters, etc.\n\nConcerning the statement that there are twenty children of school age on the Blood Reserve, who should be in Father Rusaux's School, and that nothing is done in the matter, I may say that, early in November, Mr. Indian Agent Pugh asked if he could use the services of the police, if necessary, to place children in their proper schools. He was given authority, and, since that time, I find that the Department has approved of the admission of nine children to the Blood R. C. Institution. In addition, there are two or three disputed cases at the present time. If there are any children whose eligibility to the school is certain, I am satisfied that, if Father Rusaux will get in touch with Mr. Pugh, the necessary action will be taken.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

June 14th, 1933.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to report that on a recent visit to the Blood Reserve in company with Doctor Stone, I visited the St. Mary's Residential School. We visited the classrooms and looked over things generally at the school and found everything in splendid shape.\n\nThe children looked well and happy and evidently are receiving the best of care.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nMr. John Pugh,\nCardston, Alta.\n\nDear Mr. Pugh: Re- Willie Big Head.\n\nI examined this boy at the Blood Hospital on the above date and found as follows: Contusion of the right eye; i.e. \"black Eye\". contusion of the nose. There did not seem to be any fracture of the nose. There was some limitation of motion of the right shoulder. This pointed to a bruised condition of the muscles. There were no signs of bruising in the region of the left shoulder.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.K. Mulloy.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to state that at a meeting of the Chief and Council of the Blood Band of Indians, held Friday, the 16th instant, at my office, a rather serious matter was presented to me.\n\nIt took the form of a complaint against the Principal of the St. Mary's (Blood) R.C. School, as the result of a pupil receiving a rather nasty blow or two on the nose and eye, resulting in a black eye and damaged nose.\n\nIn this connection I may say that the matter came to my attention on the 8th instant, when I picked up Willie Big Head, pupil No. 129, the boy in question, at the home of Hungry Crow, while I was travelling on the reserve. The boy explained his condition to me, and I took him to hospital, where I had Dr. Mulloy examine him and attached is his report on his condition. I then took the boy back to school and interviewed the Principal. The history of the matter is briefly as follows: \"The boy, Willie Big Head, had been sent the previous Monday to get a bull for the school, while bringing it home, his horse fell and he hurt his shoulder. He, however, continued on to school after resting at Hungry Crow's place, and attended chapel that night in school. On the way out he was spoken to by the Principal for having his hands in his pockets, and it was then taken hold of by the Principal and in an apparent scuffle, the Principal struck the boy and the facial damage according to the boy was done by the Principal\". This was the statement made to me by the boy. I questioned him as to whether he had been insolent or did anything to annoy the Principal. He stated he did not, other than the fact that as his arm was hurt, he was slow in taking it out of his pocket.\"\n\nAt the interview with the Principal, the following verbal statement was made. \"Expressing regret at the matter, the Principal stated that the chapel incident was correct, that the boys on the way out had given trouble, and he spoke to Big Head, asking him to take his hands out of his pockets, and the boy answered back several times, and the Principal then took hold of his arms to take them out of his pockets, forgetting in the heat of the moment, that he had a sore arm, and in the resulting scuffle, and feeling that the boy was resistant, he took hold of his hair and the boy put his arms folded over his face and the Principal struck him, as he thought about the arms, and then found he was bleeding at the nose.\" The Principal further states \"That the boy has been of an insolent\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nnature, and in some cases has offered to fight some of\nthe employees at the school, and the Principal felt at\nthe time that the boy was going to set up an argument\nin front of the rest of the school boys, and thought that\nhe had better take him in hand\".\n\nIt was my intention of reporting this\nin the monthly report, but as the Chief and Council re-\nquested the matter be brought to your attention, I have\nwritten this report.\n\nI may say that I interviewed the father,\nHenry Big Head, and offered to take him up to see the Prin-\ncipal, but he preferred not, stating that might lose his\ntemper and hit the Principal. He stated that he would send\nno more children to that school.\n\nI trust that you will appreciate my\nposition in the matter, and would state that the last time\na case of this sort arose, the father of the boy who was\nstruck by an employee named Smith was granted permission by\nyour predecessor to lay a charge of assault. The history of\nthis case can be determined from the Department files, as the\nwhole matter was recorded at that time, and as a summary of the\nmatter \"Smith\" was fined by the local Magistrate, but at an\nappeal later, the case went in favour of Smith, and I may say\nthat your agent was at that time, if I may use the phrase,\n\"Dragged through the Courts\", my action at that time being\ninterpreted by defending counsel as entirely a personal grudge\ntowards the school. Usually in these cases, there is an in-\nclination to lose sight of this fact, that when a father\npresents a school pupil to their Agent, with bruised faces,\nthey will receive some protection. I am entirely activated by\nthat physiological desire of the Indians.\n\nIn conclusion I may say that the Chief\nand Council as a whole are very indignant, and make this request\nwhich took the form of asking for the removal of the Principal.\n\nI, therefore, place this matter before you\nfor your consideration, as being a direct appeal by the Chief\nand Council of the Blood Band of Indians to the head of their\nDepartment. The father of the boy did desire to prosecute the\nPrincipal. I have held this in abeyance pending your perusal\nof the matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nI have the honour to state that at a meeting of the Chief and Council of the Blood Band of Indians, held Friday, the 16th instant, at my office, a rather serious matter was presented to me.\n\nIt took the form of a complaint against the Principal of the St. Mary's (Blood) R.C. School, as the result of a pupil receiving a rather nasty blow or two on the nose and eye, resulting in a black eye and damaged nose.\n\nIn this connection I may say that the matter came to my attention on the 5th instant, when I picked up Willie Big Head, pupil No. 129, the boy in question, at the home of Hungry Crow, while I was travelling on the reserve. The boy explained his condition to me, and I took him to hospital, where I had Dr. Mulloy examine him and attached his report on his condition. I then took the boy back to school and interviewed the Principal. The history of the matter is briefly as follows. \"The boy, Willie Big Head, had been sent the previous Monday to get a bull for the school, while bringing it home his horse fell and he hurt his shoulder. He, however, continued on to school after resting at Hungry Crow's place, and attended chapel that night in school. On the way out he was spoken to by the Principal for having his hands in his pockets, and he was then taken hold of by the Principal and in an apparent scuffle, the Principal struck the boy and the facial damage according to the boy was done by the Principal.\" This was the statement made to me by the boy. I questioned him as to whether he had been insolent, or did anything to annoy the Principal. He stated he did not, other than the fact that as his arm was hurt, he was slow in taking it out of his pocket.\n\nAt the interview with the Principal, the following verbal statement was made. \"Expressing regret at the matter, the Principal stated that the chapel incident was correct, that the boys on the way out had given trouble, and he spoke to Big Head, asking him to take his hands out of his pockets, and the boy answered back several times, and the Principal then took hold of his arms to take them out of his pockets, forgetting in the heat of the moment, that he had a sore arm, and in the resulting scuffle, and feeling that the boy was resistant, he took hold of his hair and the boy put his arms folded over his face and the Principal struck him, as he thought about the arms, and then found he was bleeding at the nose.\" The Principal further states \"That the boy has been of an insolent\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nnature, and in some cases has offered to fight some of\nthe employees at the school, and the Principal felt at\nthe time that the boy was going to set up an argument\nin front of the rest of the school boys, and thought that\nhe had better take him in hand\".\n\nIt was my intention of reporting this\nin the monthly report, but as the Chief and Council re-\nquested the matter be brought to your attention, I have\nwritten this report.\n\nI may say that I interviewed the father,\nHenry Big Head, and offered to take him up to see the Prin-\ncipal, but he preferred not, stating that might lose his\ntemper and hit the Principal. He stated that he would send\nno more children to that school.\n\nI trust that you will appreciate my\nposition in the matter, and would state that the last time\na case of this sort arose, the father of the boy who was\nstruck by an employee named Smith was granted permission by\nyour predecessor to lay a charge of assault. The history of\nthis case can be determined from the Department files, as the\nwhole matter was recorded at that time, and as a summary of the\nmatter \"Smith\" was fined by the local Magistrate, but at an\nappeal later, the case went in favour of Smith, and I may say\nthat your agent was at that time, if I may use the phrase,\n\"Dragged through the Courts\", my action at that time being\ninterpreted by defending counsel as entirely a personal grudge\ntowards the school. Usually in these cases, there is an in-\nclination to lose sight of this fact, that when a father\npresents a school pupil to their Agent, with bruised faces,\nthey will receive some protection. I am entirely activated by\nthat physiological desire of the Indians.\n\nIn conclusion I may say that the Chief\nand Council as a whole are very indignant, and make this request\nwhich took the form of asking for the removal of the Principal.\n\nI, therefore, place this matter before you\nfor your consideration, as being a direct appeal by the Chief\nand Council of the Blood Band of Indians to the head of their\nDepartment. The father of the boy did desire to prosecute the\nPrincipal. I have held this in abeyance pending your perusal\nof the matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nMay 10th, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Pugh:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo, in further reference to Willie Big Head, a pupil of the Blood Indian Residential School.\n\nYou may inform the Chief and Councillors that this matter has been taken up with the Church authorities, and I feel assured that a similar difficulty will not again occur at the Blood School.\n\nAs intimated in my letter of March 26th, last, I feel that it would be in the best interests of all parties concerned to allow the matter to drop.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ. E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\nMarch 26th, 1934.\n\nSir:-\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to Willie Big Head, a pupil of the Blood Indian Residential School. The contents of your letter have been carefully considered and the Department regrets very much the unfortunate occurrence. The matter is being taken up with the church authorities with a view to preventing any recurrence of such treatment of pupils.\n\nI feel that you should dissuade the father from taking any court action. Such procedure would be of no practical benefit either to the boy or himself and would only cause additional bad feeling.\n\nI recognize the difficult position in which you are placed in cases such as this, but it is your duty to submit the facts to the Department, as you have done in the present instance.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ. E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to state, with reference to your letter dated March 26th, re the matter of an assault of Willie Big Head, by the Principal of the Blood R.C. Residential School, that the Chief and Council wish to be advised as to the attitude of the church authorities in respect of the matter.\n\nI may say that the matter was brought to the attention of Mr. Inspector Christianson very strongly on his recent visit and inspection by the Council at a meeting Friday, the 20th instant.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nRoman Catholic Residential School Cardston Alta.\n\nOctober 9th 1935.\n\nTo Mr. Sheean\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAt the time of your visit to our school last June, I made to you a request to have my grant increased to a greater number of pupils. These last four years, I have been paid for only $40, when I had nearly all the time $60. My school was built for $75, I have accommodation for them, all dormitory and other space required, as you saw by yourself. No doubt you have not forgotten my demand, but as I have received no word, I am taking the liberty of refreshing your memory, as this is the time of the year that the estimates are prepared.\n\nThe material for renewing the floor of the recreation room on the boys side has arrived, but so far the work has not been done. We have again been visited by an epidemic of measles, and had as many as 37 children in bed at the same time, they are all getting better and so far no casualties.\n\nHoping that my request will be met favorably,\n\nI remain, sincerely yours.\n\n[Signature]\n\nE. Prayx, Principal\nOttawa, October 18th, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to increasing the pupilage of the Blood Indian Residential School. When the estimates are being prepared for the fiscal year 1936-37, your request will receive further consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. E. Ruaux, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlood R. C. Indian Res. School,\nCardston, Alta.\n\nPP/O'M.\n| CENTRAL REGISTRY | REFERRED TO | DATE REC'D | INITIALS | CENTRAL REGISTRY | REFERRED TO | DATE REC'D | INITIALS |\n|------------------|-------------|------------|----------|------------------|-------------|------------|----------|\n|                  |             |            |          |                  |             |            |          |\n|                  |             |            |          |                  |             |            |          |\n|                  |             |            |          |                  |             |            |          |\n|                  |             |            |          |                  |             |            |          |\n|                  |             |            |          |                  |             |            |          |\n|                  |             |            |          |                  |             |            |          |\n|                  |             |            |          |                  |             |            |          |\n|                  |             |            |          |                  |             |            |          |\n|                  |             |            |          |                  |             |            |          |\n|                  |             |            |          |                  |             |            |          |\n\nFILE No. 10624 VOL.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days residing of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................

THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..................................................School for the Quarter ended...........................................19......\n\nPrincipal..................................................................\n\nDated.................................................................19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at..................................................................\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada**\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' attendance of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................

THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................School for the Quarter ended .................................................. 19...\n\nPrincipal .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\nReqn.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper place.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

the foot of columns.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the-quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended.\n\nPrincipal.\n\nDated.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. J.

to be correctly made and entered at the foot of columns.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2; and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Mary's R.C. School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1943.\n\nPrincipal: P.A.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the........................................................School for the Quarter ended..................................................19......\n\nPrincipal..................................................................\n\nDated.................................................................19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent...........................................................\n\nDated at...............................................................this..................................................19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a

RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Roman Catholic R.C. School for the Quarter ended December 1943.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. P.A. Charron\n\nDated: January 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nAnthony M. McCallum\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Board Agency this 31st December 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 603\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by filling the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a

column.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of pupils in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blood Indian R.C. School for the Quarter ended January 1944.\n\nPrincipal: Mr. P.A.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paginating No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days attended by all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended.\n\nPrincipal.\n\nDated.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Mary's P.R. School for the Quarter ended December 1944.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. P.A. Charon\n\nDated Jan. 1, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nJAN 8 1945\n\nCARSTON, ALTA.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In case, however, the grant is not to be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ....................................................

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Mary's R.C. School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. P.A.B.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The average number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereon.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

column.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of pupils entered for the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended.\n\nPrincipal.\n\nDated.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDated at.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT OF the St-Mary's R.C.

entered at the foot of column.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings therein.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Mary's R.C. School for the Quarter ended September 1945.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. L.A. Charbonneau\n\nDated: October 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: OCT 15, 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils shown in the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI declare that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blood Indian R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pegging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence which are entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT of the Blood Indian R.C., School at Cardston**\n\n**Blood Reserve for Quarter ended December 1945**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAME OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|------------|\n|                 |                         |     |     |      |                |                   |                          |                            |            |\n| 344             | Maurice Holy W.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nIN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended:\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return, the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blood Indians R. B.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings therein.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils shown on this Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT OF the Roman Catholic School at Gardston on Blood Reserve for Quarter ended December 1946**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY/GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n|                 |                |     |          |                |                   |                         |                           |            |\n| 325             | Michael Devine | 10  | 1        |                |                   | Farm work               | Sept.1st,46               | 92/55       |\n| 326             | Charlie Singer | 11  | 1        |                |                   |                         | do                        | 92/55       |\n| 327             | Winold Crofton | 8   | 1        |                |                   |                         | do                        | 92/55       |\n| 328             | Jordan Heavy Shield | 10 | 1    |                |                   |                         | do                        | 92/55       |\n| 329             | Gilbert Crow Chief | 10 | 1    |                |                   |                         | Dec.31,46                | 92/55       |\n| 330             | William Red Crow | 10 | 1    |                |                   |                         | do                        | 92/55       |\n| 331             | Thomas Eagle Child | 8  | 1    |                |                   |                         | do                        | 92/55       |\n| 332             | James Wells     | 8   | 1        |                |                   |                         | Jan.12,45                | 92/55       |\n| 333             | Gilbert Little Bear | 8  | 1    |                |                   |                         | do                        | 92/55       |\n| 334             | Joe Beebe       | 9   | 1        |                |                   |                         | do                        | 92/55       |\n| 335             | Peter Heavy Runner | 10 | 1    |                |                   |                         | Sept.3rd,46              | 92/55       |\n| 336             | Jonas Fox       | 8   | 1        |                |                   |                         | do                        | 92/55       |\n| 337             | Francis Russell | 14  | 1        |                |                   |                         | Oct.25,45                | 92/55       |\n| 338             | Guy Russell     | 11  | 1        |                |                   |                         | do                        | 92/55       |\n| 339             | Gilbert Mills   | 9   | 1        |                |                   |                         | do                        | 92/55       |\n| 340             | Gordon Plain Woman | 10 | 1    |                |                   |                         | do                        | 92/55       |\n| 341             | Albert Many Fingers | 11 | 1    |                |                   |                         | do                        | 92/55       |\n| 342             | Herbert Many Fingers | 9  | 1    |                |                   |                         | do                        | 92/55       |\n| 343             | Gilbert Black Water | 8  | 1    |                |                   |                         | do                        | 92/55       |\n| 344             | Maurice Holy Man | 9  | 1    |                |                   |                         | do                        | 92/55       |\n| 345             | P.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present in case of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 468\nReg.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2; and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence (all pupils) entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper place.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of quarterly per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays or holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ...............................................................School for the Quarter ended..................................................19.........\n\nPrincipal .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pegging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate fixed by the Department. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence recorded against each pupil in the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, should payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n##

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of the capital grant per quarter is determined by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' attendance of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndians Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFont No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils per quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return, the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blood Indian B.C.

When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, posting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. All Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupil in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of $1.00 per capita. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance, in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars, in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SS. PAUL'S ANGLICAN School for the Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated SEPTEMBER 30, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date, 1945.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT OF the ST.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will any claim be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINFORMATION RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition of the St. Paul's Anglican School for the Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 30, 1919.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated SEPTEMBER 30, 1919.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date 1919.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days attended by all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils are actually in attendance on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is determined by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of pupils in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Now, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagine it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, piping it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ......................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, should any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Paul's Anglican School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30, 1919.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30, 1919.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nR. 3608\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT of the ST.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate of (dollars) per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the... S.S. PAUL'S ANGLICAN School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30 1949.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA. 403\n\nR. 3608\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Blood Agency**\n\n**Report of the St. Paul's Anglican School at Cardston**\n\n**Reserve for Quarter ended June 30, 1945**\n\n| Register Number | Names of Pupils | Age | Boy | Girl | Band or Reserve | Class or Study | Standing in Class | Trade or Other Industry | Date of Entrance School | Attendance |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|------------|\n| 266             | Henry R.T.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, any payment is made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The column of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case shall any payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI, [Name], declare that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndians Agent\n\nDated at: [Place]\n\nthis [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nR. 3038\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Report of the Roman Catholic School at Cardston**\n\n**Reserve for Quarter ended September 1949**\n\n| Register Number | Names of Pupils          | Age | Boy | Girl | Band or Reserve | Class or Study | Standing in Class | Trade or Other Industry | Date of Entrance to School | Attendance |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|-----|-----|------|-----------------|---------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n|                 |                          |     |     |      |                 |               |                    |                         |                             |            |\n| 0312            | Verna L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per pupil in residence during quarter is determined by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the grant per pupil per quarter. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blood B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The average per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................School for the Quarter ended .................................................. 19......\n\nPrincipal..................................................................\n\nDated................................................................. 19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent...........................................................\n\nDated at............................................................... this.................................................. 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance, in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant; no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall the grant be payable for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................

\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the total placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI declare that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blood R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days that the aggregate of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of pupil grant due for quarter is ascertainable by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate per quarter fixed for each grant.

The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall any credit be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pasting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pegging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of quarterly grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate of grant per pupil. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in reaching of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT OF THE ST.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of boys pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon return to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils are present, excluding the Return and the quarters by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively, according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated:\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT of the ST.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included, on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively, according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Paul Anglican School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated October 12, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBLOOD INDIAN AGENCY SUPERINTENDENT'S\n\nDated OCT 18, 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA-403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT of the ST.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return, ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant; in no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blood P.C. Indian School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: M.J. [Signature]\n\nDated: October 15, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBlood Indian Agency Superintendent\n\nDated: OCT-18-1950\n\nCARSTON, ALTA.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of quarterly grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in which pupils are enrolled on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate of grant per pupil.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils in residence on the Return and is mentioned by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate fixed for the quarter per capita. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2; and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, posting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of quarterly grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, should any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ......................................................School for the Quarter ended ........................................... 10 ..........\n\nPrincipal ................................................................. .\n\nDated ................................................................. 19 ....\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent ...........................................................\n\nDated ................................................................. this ........................................... 10 ....\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................School for the Quarter ended..................................................19.........\n\nPrincipal..................................................................\n\nDated.................................................................19.........\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent..................................................................\n\nDated at.................................................................this..................................................10.........\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nR. 3444\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Report of the Roman Catholic School at Carlisle**\n\n| Register Number | Names of Pupils          | Age | Boy | Girl | Band or Reserve | Class or Study | Standing in Class | Trade or Other Industry | Date of Entrance to School | Total Number of Days in Residence During Quarter | Average Attendance of Pupils During Quarter | Amount of Per Capita Grant Due for Quarter |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|-----|-----|------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| 0355            | Clare Mary Fingers       | 10  |     |      |                 |               |                   |                        | Nov.2,49                     | 90                                          | 52                                           | $17355                                      |\n| 0356            | Beatrice Carlo Rider     | 11  |     |      |                 |               |                   |                        | Nov.15,49                    | 90                                          | 52                                           | $17355                                      |\n| 0357            | Delphine L.F.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the equated per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paginating No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate attendance of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paginating No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in which pupils are present and entered in the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days present\" for each pupil.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per pupil grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per pupil grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, piling it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence which are entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate of grant per capita.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When entering the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return; use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................School for the Quarter ended .................................................. 19......\n\nPrincipal ..............................................................\n\nDated .............................................................. 19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent ..............................................................\n\nDated at ..............................................................\n\nthis .............................................................. 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Blood** Agency  \nREPORT of the Roman Catholic School at Cardston on Blood Reserve for Quarter ended June 1951\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAME OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n|                 | Brought forward         | 124 | 78  |      |                |                    |                          |                             |            |\n| 0329            | Louise Little Man       | 14  | 1   | 1    |                |                    |                          | Sept. 1, 46                  | 91/63      |\n| 0330            | Josephine Wolf Plume    | 7   | 1   | 1    |                |                    |                          |                             |            |\n| 0331            | Vera Panther Bone       | 10  | 1   | 1    |                |                    |                          | Sept. 4, 46                  | 91/63      |\n| 0332            | M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is determined by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI declare Coveney that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the..............................................................School for the Quarter ended..................................................19......\n\nPrincipal..................................................................\n\nDated..................................................19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent...........................................................\n\nDated at...........................................................\n\nthis..................................................19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA. 408\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                 |                          |     |     |      |                |                    |                        |                           |            |                                                                                             |\n| 417             | Gilbert Good Rider       | 10  | 1   |      |                |                    |                        | Sept.1,50                 | 91         |                                                                                             |\n| 418             | Clyde Heavy Runner       | 7   | 1   |      |                |                    |                        | do                        | 91         |                                                                                             |\n| 419             | Herman Vielle            | 6   | 1   |      |                |                    |                        | do                        | 91         |                                                                                             |\n| 420             | Dominic Mountain         | 10  | 1   |      |                |                    |                        | do                        | 91         |                                                                                             |\n| 421             | Ray Black Water          | 6   | 1   |      |                |                    |                        | do                        | 91         |                                                                                             |\n| 422             | Larian Rabbit            | 6   | 1   |      |                |                    |                        | do                        | 91         |                                                                                             |\n| 423             | Winston Many Bears       | 7   | 1   |      |                |                    |                        | do                        | 91         |                                                                                             |\n| 424             | George N.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of new pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' attendance of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil on entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of new pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of quarterly grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the........................................................School for the Quarter ended..................................................19......\n\nPrincipal..................................................................\n\nDated..................................................19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent...........................................................\n\nDated at............................................................this..................................................19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Blood** Agency  \n**REPORT of the Roman Catholic School at Gardston on Blood Reserve for Quarter ended December 1961**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRY TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|-----|-----|------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|------------|\n|                 |                          |     |     |      |                 |               |                   |                         |                        |            |\n| **Brought forward** |                          | 124 |     |      |                 |               |                   |                         |                        |            |\n| 0256            | Annie Plain Woman        | 16  | 1   |      | 227             | 30           | 171826 1612 3     |                         | May 10, 40              | 98         |\n| 0274            | Celina Brewer            | 16  | 1   |      | 231             | 1             |                   |                         | Dec. 1, 43              | 92         |\n| 0276            | Adeline Mills            | 14  | 1   |      | 584             | 1             |                   |                         | do                     | 92         |\n| 0278            | Loretta Red Crow         | 14  | 1   |      | 245             | 1             |                   |                         | Sept. 20, 40            | 92         |\n| 0286            | Rosabel Greighton        | 15  | 1   |      | 71              | 1             |                   |                         | Sept. 24, 43            | 92         |\n| 0287            | Pauline Bigthroat        | 16  | 1   |      | 9               | 1             |                   |                         | do                     | 92         |\n| 0288            | Isabelle Ville           | 15  | 1   |      | 363             | 1             |                   |                         | Nov. 15, 43             | 92         |\n| 0290            | Mary Heavy Head          | 15  | 1   |      | 163             | 1             |                   |                         | do                     | 92         |\n| 0291            | Beatrix Twig             | 15  | 1   |      | 307             | 1             |                   |                         | Jan. 17, 44             | 92         |\n| 0292            | Elizabeth X Mountain     | 14  | 1   |      | 4               | 1             |                   |                         | do                     | 92         |\n| 0294            | Loretta Mills            | 15  | 1   |      | 364             | 1             |                   |                         | do                     | 92         |\n| 0295            | Isabel StabDown          | 16  | 1   |      | 274             | 1             |                   |                         | do                     | 92         |\n| 0296            | Jessy Day Rider          | 14  | 1   |      | 456             | 1             |                   |                         | Jan. 27, 44             | 92         |\n| 0297            | Rachel Plume             | 15  | 1   |      | 231             | 1             |                   |                         | Feb. 22, 44             | 92         |\n| 0298            | M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in which all pupils enter into the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, should any be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the cases of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will any credit be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return use another sheet, paging is No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper place on the second sheet.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall any credit be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................School for the Quarter ended ..................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the grant per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal: ____________________________\n\nDated: ____________________________\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: ____________________________\n\nDated: ____________________________\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Blood**\n\n**Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Roman Catholic School at Cardston on Blood Reserve for Quarter ended September 1951**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n|                 |                          |     |     |      |                |                   |                         |                             |            |\n| 0410            | Elizabeth Low Horn       | 9   | 1   | 26   |                |                   |                         | June 1, 50                  | 227/82     |\n| 0411            | Eleanor Bull Shield      | 9   | 1   | 26   |                |                   |                         | do                           | 67/28      |\n| 0412            | Julia Morning Owl        | 10  | 1   | 581  |                |                   |                         | do                           | 36/28      |\n| 0413            | Ruby A.

The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE-\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days residences of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging (6 No. 2), and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blood Reserve Indian School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 15, 1951.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nSUPERINTENDENT'S\n\nDated at OCT 15, 1951\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAME OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STARTING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 290             | Claude Eagle Plume      | 16  | 1   |      |                |                   |                          | Jan.15,40                   | 92/28       |\n| 297             | Wallace Scout           | 15  | 1   |      |                |                   |                          | Mar.21,41                   | 92/28       |\n| 302             | Joseph Young Pine       | 14  | 1   |      |                |                   |                          | Jan.5,42                    | 92/28       |\n| 306             | Frank W.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, can payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, may payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will any credit be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, any payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of capitis grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the..............................................................School for the Quarter ended.........................................................19......\n\nPrincipal................................................................\n\nDated.........................................................19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated.........................................................19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Blood**  \n**Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Roman Catholic School at Carlston on Blood Reserve for Quarter ended June 1957**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAME OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN COURSES | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE | DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|                 | Brought forward         | 120 | 53  |      |                |                     |                        |                           |            |                                                  |                                          |\n| 0342            | Helen Steele            | 13  | 1   |      | 466            | 1                   |                        | Sept.1,47                 | 91/54      |                                                  |                                          |\n| 0344            | Adeline Eagle T.

THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, posting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, shall any adjustment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will grants be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant during quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, piling it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, any payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................School for the Quarter ended .................................................. 19 .......\n\nPrincipal ..............................................................\n\nDated .................................................. 19 ....\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent ..............................................................\n\nDated at .................................................. 19 ....\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|-----|---------------|------------|------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0256            | Annie Plain Woman | 16  | 1   |     |               |            |                        |            |                                                                                          |\n| 0276            | Adeline Mills    | 16  | 1   |     |               |            |                        |            |                                                                                          |\n| 0278            | Loretta Red Crow | 16  | 1   |     |               |            |                        |            |                                                                                          |\n| 0286            | Rosalind Creighton | 16 | 1   |     |               |            |                        |            |                                                                                          |\n| 0287            | Pauline Big Throat | 16 | 1   |     |               |            |                        |            |                                                                                          |\n| 0290            | Mary Heavy Head  | 16  | 1   |     |               |            |                        |            |                                                                                          |\n| 0291            | Beatrix Trigg    | 16  | 1   |     |               |            |                        |            |                                                                                          |\n| 0294            | Loretta Mills    | 16  | 1   |     |               |            |                        |            |                                                                                          |\n| 0296            | Jenny Day Rider  | 15  | 1   |     |               |            |                        |            |                                                                                          |\n| 0297            | Abigail Plume    | 16  | 1   |     |               |            |                        |            |                                                                                          |\n| 0298            | M.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall any deduction be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant during quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the BLOOD R. C INDIAN SCHOOL and tuition at the CARDINAL ABERNATHY School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1952.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 1st 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case shall any grant be payable for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the..............................................................School for the Quarter ended.........................................................10...........\n\nPrincipal..............................................................\n\nDated..............................................................10...........\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at..............................................................\n\nthis..............................................................10...........\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS                  | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|----------------|----------------------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|------------|\n|                | Drought forward                  |     |     |      |                |                         |                            |            |\n| 0295           | M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................

There is an item in the Estimates of $1200.00 to provide for the addition, for School purposes, to the Hospital on this Reserve. I observe from the note on these Vouchers that the expenditure was authorized by the Indian Commissioner, on the 17th November 1897. The expenditure has not received the sanction of the Department, and certain arrangements made by the Commissioner with reference to the school in Treaty 7 have been disapproved by the Department (see File 118153/5 A), although the expenditure on the Blood Reserve was not specially included in this disapproval, and it does not appear from the Commissioner's correspondence to have fallen within the arrangement he made with the Bishop. The Union Bank, which cashed these Vouchers naturally expects payment, but I do not see how we can pay without further explanations.\n\n8th January, 1898.\n\nAccountant.\nOttawa, 19th January, 1888.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of the favourable letter from you, dated January 15th, in which you state that you have been obliged to make an advance to the Indians until now. The expenditure in question was incurred without Departmental authority, and the amount is not, I am sorry to say, any appropriation to which the outlay could be properly charged, and I am therefore obliged to return the advance to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Manager,\nThe Union Bank,\nOttawa.\nBishop's house,\nSt. Albert,\nJan 6/94.\n\nA.A.

T.E. Reed\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY.\n\nI can add very little on the subject of the expenditure on the Roman Catholic Boarding School on the Blood Reserve to what is said in my memorandum of January 8th. In considering payment of these vouchers the points to be emphasized are the absence of authority for the expenditure and the wording of the amount in the detailed estimates. If the former point can be overlooked and the latter explained by the Commissioner, (as it is not evident to the Department what connection the Hospital has with the school,) the vouchers might be paid. For my part I do not think the minister's decision with reference to the school on the Peigan Reserve affects this case very materially.\n\nThe reason that the vouchers were returned to the Bank was that the Branch of the Union Bank here urged us to either pay them or to return them to the Bank. According to their request we did the latter. This Bank not being accustomed to do business with the department seems to consider these vouchers as ordinary matter for collection.\n\nAccountant.\n\nFeb'y 4th, '98.\nOttawa, 8th February, 1896.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the vouchers for expenditure in connection with the Roman Catholic School on the Blood Reserve are returned to the Department; they will be paid up to $1200.00 the amount voted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Laird Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nLast August I requested the Commissioner to utilize the unexpended grant towards purchasing furniture, as stoves, bedsteads etc for the Boarding School and in answer, August 29/98, No.122/73 I have been informed that this request was to be made some time in January or February.\n\nI take the liberty to call your attention on that point. The Boarding School being the property of the Indian Department it seems to me that the furniture and dependences must be in the same case. Many things are needed for starting such an institution, and our resources are very small yet.\n\nIf you agree to expend the whole or part of the unexpended sum, on notification I will supply your Department with a list of the articles required.\n\nExpecting a satisfactory answer,\n\nYours &c., &c.,\nJ. Riou, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit the enclosed application from the Rev. Principal of the Blood Roman Catholic Boarding School for the favourable consideration of the Department. The unexpended portion of the grant is probably over $800.00. In support of the application I beg to say that in its letter of the 7th of March 1898, No. II7201/5, the department has been pleased to grant this privilege to the authorities of the Ermineskin Boarding School, Hobbs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIn account with Peter McLean,\n\nCEDAR SHINGLES, SASHES, DOORS, Etc.\n\nLumber of all descriptions.\n\n| Description                  | Quantity | Rate | Total |\n|------------------------------|----------|------|-------|\n| Broke Sort                   |          |      |       |\n| Nov. 5 240 ft B.C.

There is a sum of about $1300.00 due to Peter McLaren's Lumber Mill, in Macleod, outside of the $500.00 advanced by the Mission and which we expect shall be refunded afterwards.\n\nI would respectfully ask that appropriation be made in the supplementary estimates, to pay off, as soon as possible, the amount due to Mr. McLaren. Application has been made by Rev. Father Riou, Principal of the School, on this subject, and I strongly recommend it to your consideration.\n\nThis can be done the more easily that at this school, and many other Boarding Schools as well, the number of children authorized is far from being completed and cannot be completed before the expiration of the fiscal year.\n\nHoping that you will kindly look into the matter and authorize the payment of said amount.\n\nI have the honour &c.\n\nEmile J.

Will you kindly pay on it the balance of the $200 dollars voted for the actual fiscal year. That will leave a debt of $100 dollars about, plus $500 dollars paid by the R.R.Sisters of Charity last summer to Mr. McLaren, or a total of $600 dollars.\n\nWould you kindly put that sum in your supplementary estimates in favour of the Roman Catholic Boarding School Blood Reserve, or if there is no possibility for it, divide the said sum between the supplementary estimate of this year and the estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nHoping that you will do this with the best of your experience,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJ.

Boarding School should have installed two drinking fountains.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of 30th, ultimo I beg to supply further particulars with regard to the work I proposed to have done at the R.C School.\n\nThere will require to be laid about a thousand feet of new flooring, which will cost for flat grain flooring, $5.00 per ft. It will cost about the same amount to lay this flooring as the old floor will have to be torn up & there is quite a lot of patching to do, which takes more time than the laying of an absolutely new floor.\n\nThere are eight floors which require to be painted with two coats of paint & the estimated requirements for this is eighteen gallons. The estimated requirements for painting ceiling is four gallons & for the walls of one room & stairway another two gallons.\n\nThis makes a total of twenty-two gallons, which at say $5.00 per gallon will amount to $120.00 & in addition to this $10.00 will be required for brushes.\n\nThe above figures total $240.00 & I allowed $10.00 more for contingencies which makes $250.00 the amount of my requisition.\n\nI trust the above figures will enable you to arrive at a decision in the matter.\n\nI am,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nP.S.

Mr. Naishon,\n\nThe Estimates for the current fiscal year provide for the erection of a new Roman Catholic boarding school on the Peigan Indian reserve. In this connection I beg to draw your attention to an interchange of letters between Commissioner Graham and myself, particularly with reference to the boarding schools on the Blood and Peigan reserves. You will observe that Commissioner Graham agrees with the policy which I wished to establish in this matter, and I would ask your concurrence. I am so convinced of the reasonableness of this proposition that I think the Roman Catholic and Anglican Churches will have to meet our wishes, or else we should not incur any further capital expenditure for school buildings on these reserves.\n\nDuncan C. Scott,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, August 19, 1919.\n\nDear Canon Gould -\n\nAs you may be aware it is the policy of the Department to rebuild our industrial and boarding schools when necessary on more improved plans. Previous to 1914 we had an extensive plan outlined looking forward several years under which we were to replace in order of necessity, as far as possible, buildings considered no longer fit for the purpose which they were serving. The war, however, intervened and we were obliged from economical reasons to curtail very largely our building schemes.\n\nOn the list for rebuilding were the Victoria Home and the Roman Catholic school building on the Pelican Reserve, and I had planned later to renew both the Roman Catholic and Church of England buildings on the Blood Reserve. However, owing to the necessity of strict retrenchment these matters have been reconsidered and it has been decided that four schools on these two reserves are not necessary; the construction and maintenance thereof being an uncolled burden both on the Government and the church authorities.

C. Boarding School for the month of January, 1920. Original on 180148-7\n\nWe are greatly in need of a more modern school building where the children could be kept under better sanitary conditions; and the thing most noticeable to me is how the Sisters can keep the school looking as well as they do under present conditions.\n\n(Sgd.) J. E. Ostrander,\nAgent.\nR.C. Boarding School, Stand-Off, March 1st, 1920.\n\nTo Mr. W.J. Ostrander, Agent,\nBlood Reserve.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe have decided to buy the second hand baking-oven as you advised us to do, although we knew that such an expense would be above our means in the present circumstances, but it was a matter of urgent necessity, so we ask you to be kind enough to use your influence with the Indian Department to come to our assistance in the purchase and installation of this oven which will amount to, at least, $200.00 two hundred dollars.\n\nWe have no doubt that if our reasons for buying this oven were made known to the Indian Department, they would willingly come to our assistance. As you know the personnel of the School is about seventy-five, who consume an average of about eight sacks of flour per week, we had to bake that amount of bread on a common kitchen range, besides the rest of the cooking, so that we had to bake from four o'clock in the morning until nine o'clock in the evening, to meet the requirements of the school, besides the inconvenience of the excessive heat in the kitchen during the summer season which is enough to impair the health of any person.\n\nTrusting that you will take this in consideration and that you will interest the Indian Department in our favour,\n\nI remain,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter I have received from the Reverend Father Runaux, Principal of the R.C. School on the Reserve.\n\nThe Father has been trying for some time to get a bake oven for the school & some few weeks ago we got in touch with a man who had one for sale & it was decided to buy it, as it had only been in use a very short time & was splendid value at the price $100.00.\n\nOn my periodical visits to the school I have frequently remarked the excessive heat in & in the neighbourhood of the kitchen in the school, as also the tired look of the Sisters & older girls who seemed to be continually baking & wondered how they stood it & the Father advised me that they kept changing them around from day to day, as it was the only way they could stand it.\n\nFather Runaux asks for $200.00 to pay for the oven & the installation of the same & I think if the Department can see their way to grant his request, I think the money will be well spent as I am satisfied that baking under the present conditions is far from being beneficial to the health, especially of the young girls employed.\n\nThe installation would consist of the building of a lean-to, against the present kitchen, the bedding of the oven in cement &c & generally fitting up the oven for use.\n\nTrusting that this application may receive your favorable consideration,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 12, 1920\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, requesting that a grant be provided to reimburse the Principal of the Blood Roman Catholic Boarding School to the extent of $100.00 in the purchase of a bake oven and also $100.00 to pay for the installation of the same, and enclosing a communication from the principal regarding the matter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in view of the reasons given by the principal for the need of this oven, the Department will provide a grant not to exceed a total of $200.00 to cover the cost of the oven and the installation of the same. You will be good enough to inform the principal accordingly, and you may arrange to have the work of building a lean-to and the bedding of the oven in cement and any other work required to complete the installation.\n\nIn the purchase of any material required for the installation of the oven you will be guided by the requirements of the War Purchasing Commission, as set forth in circular letter of the 25th of February last.\n\nYou should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred to the extent of the amount allowed as stated above.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

I have been absent from my desk every day lately on account of the spring work, but my thanks are nevertheless the more hearty.\n\nThis oven is a very convenient acquisition for our school, in fact, it was of an absolute necessity, as stated to you before, and the staff of the school is in measure to appreciate it at its real value for commodity, economy of time and fuel.\n\nIn my own name, and in the name of the staff of the R.C. Boarding School Blood Reserve, I pray you, Honourable Sir, to accept the expression of our deep gratitude.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nprincipal\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs, Canada.\n\nOttawa, July 25th, 1921.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. J. D. McLean -\n\nI beg to refer you to your memorandum of the 19th instant regarding certain recommendations made in a communication addressed to Bishop McNally by Rev. Father Riou, Principal of the Crowfoot Boarding School on the Blackfoot reserve.\n\nThe Minister has read your memorandum and with reference to paragraph No. 4 he instructs that some sort of cheap implement shed should be built for the use of the Boarding School.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your memorandum the Minister instructs that arrangements be made at once to install one bath in the Roman Catholic School on the Blood Reserve.\n\nKindly see that the Minister's instructions in the above connection are carried out as soon as possible.\n\nSgd. J. C. Caldwell,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, July 29, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nA request has been received from the Blood R. C. Boarding School, asking that a bath-tub be installed at that Institution. Please consult with the Rev. Principal and make arrangements to have a five-foot cast-iron enamelled bath installed; competitive prices to be obtained in the usual manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nfor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. E. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMacLeod,\nAlberta.\nMemorandum,-\n\nHon. Sir James Lougheed.\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your memorandum of the 15th instant, inclosing a communication addressed to you by Reverend Father Riou, Principal of the Crowfoot boarding school, located on the Blackfoot reserve. I shall reply to the different matters in the order in which they are presented by the Reverend Father:\n\nRegarding the installation of baths and sanitary arrangements at the Roman Catholic School on the Blood reserve, concerning which His Lordship Bishop McNally spoke to the Minister, this is a very old building, almost beyond all usefulness for the purpose of a boarding school. Just at the present time, we are concluding the purchase of a lot near Clareholm, on which it is proposed to erect a school, to be used jointly for the Catholic children of the Blood and Peigan reserves. It is probable that, if funds are available, we will go ahead with this work next year, and, in view of this, it is not considered advisable to spend very much on the old school building, either by way of repairs or equipment. We will, however, make inquiries, and see if some bath tubs could be installed, which might be used when equipping the new school. We have not the data before us to enable us to decide that here.\n\nJ. D. McLean.\nActing Deputy Supt. General.\nSir:\n\nI wish to inform you that it was brought to my attention that the furnaces in the Roman Catholic school on the Blood Reserve, are in very poor shape, and as the grates were burned out they were unable to put on fires. I therefore instructed the Agent to purchase grates and a few minor repairs, and he intends to have the Engineers, who are running the threshing outfit on the Reserve, do the repairs. This will do away with the necessity of bringing in a man from outside to do the work.\n\nI trust my action in this matter will meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, Sept. 26th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, in which you inform the Department that you have authorized the Agent to purchase grates and to have a few minor repairs made to the furnace in the Blood (R.C.) Indian Boarding School.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that your action in this matter is approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

It is a fact that sewage purifies itself by filtration, and if the reservoir is sufficiently far away from the river, the gradual seeping and catching of the hole by filtration will turn the effluent into the river, purified, so that no harm will result.\n\nThis is a matter which should be taken up at once and in the meantime, I would discourage as far as possible the usage of the present system, and take the precaution to have a plentiful supply of Chloride of Lime on hand, for use there, and see that it is freely used.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCpl.

Alan H. N. Kennedy.\nSir,\n\nJ. T. Point Peay,\nIndian Agent, Blood Reserve,\nMacLeod Alberta\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWhile out at the Hospital at Stand Off on Sunday I had occasion to go over to the School, and while there, took the opportunity to inspect the Sanitary arrangements. I do not know whether you are aware of the conditions there or not, but I was absolutely amazed to find them as they were, and under the existing conditions, it is the biggest surprise to me that there has not been a very large outbreak of either Typhoid Fever or Diptheria, coming from the School.\n\nI saw Baths and sinks in the building and naturally asked where the outlet of them was, and it was taken for granted that the dirty water is allowed to run from the building to a depression in the ground over a small hill, not twenty-five yards from the back door of the Institution. Here this dirty water lies, until washed away by what is the most beautiful location for the breeding of all kinds of germs, practically outside the Kitchen door, where flies abound. These flies which are the proven carriers of Typhoid germs alternate between the stinking pool of dirty water and the refuse, and the fact that is being prepared for the Indian children, and the attendants.\n\nAs far as I could see there was no attempt made to keep this pool covered, or even disinfected such as Chloride of Lime thrown about. It is really one of the most glaring cases of insanitation that I have come across, and I am disgrace not only to the school, but to the Indian Department as well. On making enquiries I found that this condition has been going on for some considerable time, and I can quite believe that in the summer-time the smell from it is pretty near unbearable.\n\nNot only is this pool unsanitary for the reason that I have mentioned, but the point also has to be taken that this place is not very far from the river, the source of their water supply, and the water is taken in below this cesspool. I don't quite know the slope of the land there, but it is not very hard to imagine the escape from this pool seeping into the water supply, with the added dangers from this source. How they have escaped a serious epidemic of Typhoid there, under the existing conditions, is more than I can understand.\n\nSomething will have to be done about this at once or the Indian Department will be very negligent in its\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith, copy of a letter I have received from Dr Kennedy, Acting Medical Officer for this Reserve, in regard to the sanitary conditions at the Roman Catholic Mission.\n\nWhat the doctor says in regard to conditions is just about right & if it would be the intention of the Department to alleviate these conditions in view of the fact that under the Department's authority a bath tub is being installed at the school, for which drainage will be necessary, the simplest way would be to connect the drain from the sink with the one from the bath & carry this drain to a cesspit over towards the river. About two hundred feet of 6\" tile would be necessary for this undertaking, or say 4\" pipe, which costs about thirty cents per foot in Calgary.\n\nI shall be glad if the Department will authorise me to have this very necessary work attended to, or may I take it that the authority given to install a bath-tub would cover the cost of necessary drainage. If it is a matter of cost, there is a good bath-tub in my house which I cannot make use of, on account of there being no water supply & no heating arrangements sufficient to keep an upstairs cistern from freezing. This tub could be taken out & transported to the school, in which case the cost of a new tub would be saved & I can get along better without a hot plunge than the Indian children can with typhoid.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Indian Agent.\n\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, December 13th, 1931.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 21st ult., with reference to the drainage required for the baths at the Roman Catholic School, I beg to advise you that you may have a 4\" tile drain installed and connected with the drain from the sink and carried to a cess-pool approximately 200' from the building.\n\nIn purchasing the 4\" tile drain, competitive prices should be obtained and tile purchased from the firm quoting the lowest price.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J. D. McLean)\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. T. Faunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMacleod, Alta.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter No.103-2-5a under date Dec 5th I may say that the voucher is correct.\n\nThere were two grates purchased as there are two furnaces in the R.C. school at Stand Off. The items appear separately because the grates were purchased at two different times, as one was procured in Winnipeg and the other had to be ordered from Hamilton. Attached please find copy of Voucher.\n\nI am,\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa.\n| DATE     | PCS | DESCRIPTION          | NO.

Father Guy, I have to inform you that the Rev. Father Grandin, and others, have drawn our attention from time to time to the incomplete condition of the Crowfoot Boarding School building. When we were preparing the supplementary Estimates for this year there was brought to our attention the extreme desirability of interior decorating and plastering. The Rev. Fathers Grandin and Guy now strongly urge the brick veneering of the building, before the interior alterations are carried out.\n\nThe main building was erected in 1914, and was so constructed that brick veneering could be done later. At the time of my visit in August of last year, it was drawn to my attention that the proposed veneering should be done as soon as possible.\n\nIn the supplementary Estimates for 1922-23, $6,000.00 is voted for repairs to the Crowfoot Boarding School.\n\nAssociated with this question is the poor condition of the institutions under the R.C. Church on the Blood and Peigan reserves. The Crowfoot and Blood buildings belong to this Department and the Peigan, to the church. Because of the uncertain plans concerning R.C. Indian educational work in Southern Alberta (Clarke's Int?) I hesitate to make a recommendation regarding the old buildings on the Blood and Peigan.\n\nThe Crowfoot Boarding school on the Blackfoot is modern and has been admirably cared for, and I would recommend that the brick veneering be done this year. Because of the large capital and interest moneys of the Blackfoot band, I respectfully ask your opinion regarding the possibility of securing, from this source, the necessary funds over and above the $6,000.00 budget-to-be.\n\nSept. of Indian Education.\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nMy dear Mr. Scott:\n\nAs already mentioned to you Rev. Fr Grandin is asking me to apply to the Department for very urgent repairs at the Blood Indian School.\n\nLast year, he personally asked from you that these repairs be done and I have included a similar request in view of the estimates. It seems that as the future of the school is uncertain that the Department hesitates to do very necessary repairs. I must say in the name of Rev. Fr Grandin that it is impossible for the staff and children to spend another winter under such trying circumstances. I would therefore ask your kind and prompt attention to this matter.\n\nBelieve me\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs - School Files (AG 10, Volume 6743, File 720-5, part 2)\nOttawa, May 31, 1922.\n\nDear Father Guy:\n\nI wish to assure you that I have given considerable thought to the questions arising out of your three communications of the 23rd instant, referring to the needs of the Crowfoot, Blood and Peigan Roman Catholic Boarding Schools. The plans for future education of Roman Catholic Indian children in the southern part of Alberta are somewhat undermined at present; but I have come to the conclusion that there should be no cessation in our efforts to properly house the children at present admitted to residential schools.\n\nThe Crowfoot Boarding School on the Blackfoot Reserve is relatively a new building and has been admirably cared for. I will instruct Mr. Commissioner Graham, of Regina, to make overtures as soon as possible to the Indian band with a view to having them vote the funds necessary for the brick veneering of the exterior. I am hopeful that our efforts in this connection will be successful.\n\nI have learned, with regret, that the Rev. Father Grandin states it is impossible for the staffs and children to spend another winter in the Blood and Peigan Roman Catholic Residential Schools. Mr. Ferrier reports that the buildings are in poor condition, and I am prepared to ask the Minister for the necessary authority to spend $1500.00 each on the Peigan and Blood schools. If the Minister O.K.'s the expenditure, I will ask you to instruct the Rev. Father Grandin and the principals to communicate, concerning the necessary repairs, direct with Mr. Commissioner Graham, under whose direction the work will be carried out.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Jos. Guy, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOttawa, Ont.\nR. C. Boarding School, Stand Off, May 4th 1922.\n\nMr J. T. Gaunt. Agent.\n\nBlood Reserve.\n\nDear sir,\n\nRepairs have been done on our school during the past winter for which I must say we are most grateful. One thing however has been overlooked; our kitchen range is in the poorest of condition, as old as the building itself; the firepot and top part of the stove have been renewed several times, and at the present time the whole range is in such a bad condition and worn out that it would be useless to spend money for repairs on it, besides it would be impossible to affix to it attachments for hot water system, bath tubs have been installed in the school but having no water system every Saturday we are obliged to heat water at the wash house and carry it with pails to the dormitories for the children's baths, which is very inconvenient.\n\nOf course you know the range having seen it several times, consequently, I would ask you to use your influence with the Indian department, to obtain a new one for us, as our financial standing will not allow us to meet the expense of buying one ourselves.\n\nI remain Sir, Dear Sir,\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nSgd. F. Ruaux.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of a letter received by me from Father Ruaux, Principal of the R. C. School, in which he asks that I use my influence with you with a view to a new range being installed at the school.\n\nAs he says, the range is in a very delapidated condition & altogether unfit for the duties which it is supposed to perform & if at all possible I would suggest that something be done by way of replacing the range.\n\nI had thought that a great many of the hotels in this part of the country having closed up since prohibition went into effect, a good second hand range might very readily be picked up \u00ab I shall be glad to have your authority to make enquiries with a view to the purchase of such a range.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOTTAWA, June 9th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, enclosing copy of a communication from the Principal of the Blood R.C. Boarding School in which he requests that a new kitchen range be supplied for the use of the school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the purchase of a range of the size and capacity required for the use of this school. You may make enquiry with a view to the purchase of a good second-hand range, but if you are unable to obtain such, it will then be necessary to obtain competitive prices from a number of dealers in making the purchase of a new range. No undue expenditure should be incurred and the range, while serviceable and of a satisfactory type, should be purchased as cheaply as possible.\n\nYou will be good enough to forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred, and, if it is not possible for you to obtain a second-hand range, it will be necessary, in submitting vouchers for the purchase of a new range, to attach a memorandum showing the names of the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Faunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMacleod, Alta.\nOttawa, May 31, 1922.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nHonorable Charles Stewart:\n\nFor some months I have consistently refused to expend funds on the Blood and Peigan Roman Catholic Residential Schools in Southern Alberta, because of the somewhat indefinite plans for the future of the Indian educational work under the auspices of that church in the district mentioned.\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that it will be impossible for the teachers and pupils to remain another winter, unless certain repairs are carried out at these two schools. The one on the Blood Reserve is government-owned and on the Peigan, church-owned.\n\nThe future for Roman Catholic Indian educational work in Southern Alberta is still unsettled, and this Department should see to the proper housing of our wards who are admitted to residence for the coming winter. I respectfully recommend that I be given authority to make repairs at the Blood and Peigan R. C. Boarding Schools to the amount of $1500 each.\n\nDuncan C.

Boarding School, I have to advise you that \u00a31500 has been voted in this year's estimates to cover this work, and I would ask you to let me know the nature of the repairs which the Reverend principal wishes to have carried out.\n\nIn sending in your report kindly give as much detail as possible, and under no circumstances must the amount available be exceeded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.D.

As near as I can make out about six thousand shingles will be required, probably a few more. He also makes a request to be supplied with two hundred feet of two inch iron pipe to carry water from the pump to the garden.\n\nI would point out the urgency of granting this authority at once in order that the work can be carried on at the school during the vacation period, and I would see that all purchases are made in accordance with the Departments' regulations, that is as regards competition. The work should be done by day labour and I think can be safely handed over to the Indian Agent to carry out the instructions which are given to him.\n\nThere was an old shed situated on the site of the former residence of Doctor Steele which I handed over to the school to be used as a chicken house. They were glad to receive this and I was glad to know that it could be made good use of.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. GRAHAM.\nIndian Commissioner.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have just returned from Alberta and while there I visited the Roman Catholic Boarding School on the Blood Reserve. As you know, this building is in very bad shape at the present time, and it seems to me that it is about impossible to carry on the work unless some extensive improvements are made. The Principal and the Nuns are very anxious that something be done at once, as the school is about to close for the summer vacation and in the interval the necessary work could be done.\n\nI would recommend the following repairs be authorized: New floors for two play rooms. The size of these rooms 18x33. The floors are practically gone. New floor in kitchen, size 24x24. Thirty gallons of floor paint, five gallons of raw oil and one gallon of turpentine to be used in re-painting the floors and a supply of calcimine to renovate the walls, in the various rooms and dormitories. I find the kitchen range is in very bad shape and will have to be renewed. What is required is a kitchen range known as hotel size. I have hopes of obtaining this range from one of the Military Hospitals which was in existence at Regina last year. This range was handed over to the School Board who owned the building in which the Hospital was established. If I am successful in obtaining this range, it will not be necessary for the Department to supply one, but if not, I would be glad to have your authority to purchase a suitable range.\n\nIn addition to the above, the Father in charge of the School has erected a large stable with\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the attached letter from Mr. Graham, regarding the most urgent repairs required to the Blood Roman Catholic School, I beg to say that on June 15th, a letter was addressed to the Indian Agent, advising him that $1,500 had been voted in this year's estimates to cover the most urgent repairs needed at this school. He was asked to consult with the principal and advise the Department, giving as much details as possible of the necessary repairs, it being understood of course, that whatever work was done, the cost must not exceed $1,500.00.\n\nArchitect.\nJune 21st, 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, No. 403-14, reporting on the present condition of the Blood R.C. Boarding School, and recommending that the repairs enumerated by you be carried out.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that the Minister has approved of an expenditure not to exceed $1500 in having the most urgent repairs required at this school carried out. Previous to the receipt of your letter, we communicated with Mr. Agent Faunt and requested him to let the Department know the nature of the repairs which the Reverend Principal desired to have done this summer. A copy of this letter is enclosed herewith for your information. You may communicate with the Agent and inform him of the action you desire taken regarding these repairs.\n\nThe repairs enumerated by you in your letter, and which you recommended be undertaken, should be considered in connection with the other items of the work which the Principal desires to have carried out, and the whole cost incurred in these repairs should not exceed the above authorized amount.\n\nThe work should be completed during the vacation period, and all purchases should be made in accordance with the requirements of the Purchasing Commission.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nREGINA, SASK.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI wrote you yesterday regarding repairs and requirements for the Roman Catholic Boarding School on the Blood Reserve. In my letter I stated that I was in hopes of obtaining a suitable range for the institution through the Regina School Board, but I regret to say that I received word today to the effect that they did not feel disposed to hand the stove over, nor will they sell it.\n\nI measured the stove in the School. It is six feet long with a fire box in the centre and two extensions on either side, without the hot water attachments. What we need is the same size stove with hot water attachments. If this can be bought from the Purchasing Commission direct, I would ask that it be done; however, if it is your desire that I purchase here through wholesale firms I can do so, perhaps it would be better to make the purchase from this office as the Companies have representatives here in the City.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIn view of the fact that this particular kind of range is required, is it necessary to call for competitive prices.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOTTAWA, June 26th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, No. 402-13, regarding the purchase of a range for the use of the Blood R.C. Indian Boarding School.\n\nIn this connection I beg to state that a communication was received from Mr. Agent Faunt, dated May 28th last, in which he directed the attention of the Department to the need of having a new range installed in this school. He stated that a good second-hand range might be obtained from one of the hotels which had been closed. He was informed that he could arrange for the purchase of a good second-hand range, but that, if he was unable to obtain such, he might, after obtaining competitive prices, purchase a new range.\n\nIt might be well for you to communicate with Mr. Faunt and ascertain what action has been taken by him to obtain a range, and, if he has not done anything in this matter, you may arrange for the purchase of a new range. Competitive prices should be obtained and the range should be purchased and installed at the lowest possible cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M.
