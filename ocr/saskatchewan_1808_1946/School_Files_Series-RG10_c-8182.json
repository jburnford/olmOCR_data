BOILY ON THE GIFT BLUE BAY SCHOOL.\n\nOn June 21, last, I had the honour to visit the Indians' school at Pointe Bleue and make a fairly thorough examination of the 90 pupils present.\n\nPermit me to remark that this splendid attendance was due to the fact that most of the Indians had returned from the woods and for some days had been sending their children to school.\n\nIt is this way every year, that is to say, that a large number of little Indians go to school only ten or fifteen days a year. Why would the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa not establish classes during the holidays for these young Indians? I humbly submit this idea to you and I trust that the Department at Ottawa will take it into consideration.\n\nReport dated, July 5th, 1915.\nOttawa, August 5, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Boily in his recent report on the Pointe Bleue School states that every year a large number of little Indians go to school only ten or fifteen days a year and suggests that the Department establish classes during the holidays for these young Indians.\n\nThe Indian Day School Regulations provide that \"where in the interest of the school work such action may be desirable, the holidays allowed during the summer (two months) may, upon the recommendation of the local Agent, be taken at some other time of the year; but no change is to be made without the express approval of the Department.\"\n\nIt is too late in the season now to make a change in the holidays for this school this year, but next year, if it is considered advisable, the school may be kept open during the summer and the holidays taken at some other time. You should bring the matter to the attention of the Department early next summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. STEWART\n\nA. Tessier, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPointe Bleue, Que.\n\nAsst.

Pour le mois de septembre il lui a fallu \u00eatre aid\u00e9 par l'une de ses compatriotes de la m\u00eame Communaut\u00e9, donc Mme Vincent de Paul, qui continue \u00e0 la remplacer ici si le D\u00e9partement n'y voit aucune objection.\n\nCette institutrice poss\u00e8de un dipl\u00f4me avec en outre une exp\u00e9rience de quelques ann\u00e9es dans l'enseignement.

For the month of September she had to be assisted by one of her sister nuns of the same community, Sister St. Vincent de Paul, who will continue to take her place here if the Department has no objection.\n\nThis teacher has diplomas and also an experience of fourteen years in teaching. Mr. Boily, Inspector of Schools, to whom I telephoned on the subject, tells me that she is one of the best teachers of his district. She was teaching last year and for some years past at Normandin, Lake St. John, and her school was one of those in which the progress of the pupils has been most marked.\n\nOn the other hand, I have the pleasure of telling you that three of the former Indian pupils of the Pointe Bleue school, holding diplomas as teachers obtained from the Provincial Board of Examiners, have been engaged by some school municipalities among the white people to teach school during the course of the present year. Misses Anna Robertson and Kate Simpson are each in charge of a school in the parish of St. Prime, and Miss Alice Cleary is in charge of the model school of St. Felicien. All three are receiving excellent salaries. This fact ought to be of a nature to satisfy your Department as to the results obtained up to the present time by our Indian school.\n\nThanks to the constant efforts of your Department in regard to Indian education, our humble Indian school supplies today to the white population of the county of Lake St. John some capable and devoted teachers.\n\nIndian Affairs.

At Restigouche there was an enrolment of 87 pupils.\nof about 50; at Lorette the enrolment is 68 pupils and the average attendance 60; at Pointe Bleue the enrolment is 85 with an average attendance of 62 and at Bersimis the enrolment during six months of year is about 96 and for the September quarter, last, the average attendance was 92. During the winter the Indians are away hunting and the enrolment at the Bersimis School is about 25, with an average of 21.\n\nIf my recommendation is approved, the salary of the principal of Lorette should be increased by $200.00 and the assistant by $100.00; at Pointe Bleue the salary of the principal should be increased by $150.00 and the assistant by $100.00 and at Bersimis the salary of the principal should be increased by $175.00 and the assistant by $75.00. By allowing these increases the salaries at these three schools will be the same as paid the teachers at Restigouche. There is practically the same amount of work to be done at all these schools and the teachers have the same qualifications. If these increases are approved by you they should date from the first of October, last, the beginning of the present quarter.\nOttawa, November 24, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that it has been decided to increase the salaries of the teachers at the Pointe Bleue Indian Day School from the first of October, last. At present the principal is paid $300.00 per annum and the assistant $250.00. From the above date these salaries will be increased as follows:- the principal will be paid at the rate of $450.00 per annum and the assistant at the rate of $350.00 per annum. This is an increase of $150.00 in the salary of the principal and of $100.00 in the salary of the assistant. This increase is made to equalise the salaries paid the teaching sisters in the Indian day schools in the Province of Quebec.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to inform the teachers of the above increase allowed them from the first of October, last. You should see that their quarterly returns are forwarded promptly at the end of each quarter, in order that payment of salary can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst.

C'est pourquoi, Monsieur le Secr\u00e9taire, je n'h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 solliciter de votre influente bienveillance l'obtention de cette faveur pour nos deux S\u0153urs institutrices, me souvenant que le D\u00e9partement a accord\u00e9 m\u00eame une ann\u00e9e presqu'enti\u00e8r\u00e9e \u00e0 nos S\u0153urs lors de la reconstruction du Couvent de Bersimis, et cela nonobstant les deux mois de vacances ordinaires.\n\nJ'ose donc esp\u00e9rer une r\u00e9ponse favorable, d'autant plus que Monsieur Tessier est tout \u00e0 fait bien dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet et juge comme nous que ces deux mois seraient \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s nuls pour les classes.\n\nDaignez agr\u00e9er, Monsieur le Secr\u00e9taire l'hommage de mes respectueux sentiments et me croire en N.-S.\n\nVotre tr\u00e8s humble\n\n[Signature]\n\nVotre tr\u00e8s humble\nTranslation.\n\nConvent of N.D. du Bon-Conseil,\nChicoutimi, April 22, 1927.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nSir,\n\nIt is with confidence that I am addressing you this request; that is to grant our Sister teachers of the Point Bleue reserve their usual two months' holidays.\n\nHere are the reasons for this request; you have not forgotten that during January last the school house was uninhabitable. Mr. Tessier, Indian Agent, was authorized to close the school during the two coldest months; this was once understood.\n\nThe classes were re-opened in the beginning of March and as in the past our Sisters do not spare their fatigue, nor their work for the good of these poor children and even for the welfare of the Indian families as well as the half-breeds.\n\nHowever, taking account of their kindness, the summer holidays are absolutely necessary at the Mother House. That is why, sir, I do not hesitate to ask you to kindly use your influence to obtain this favour for our teaching Sisters. As I remember that you Department was kind enough to grant nearly a full year to our Sisters when the Convent at Bersimis was re-built besides the two annual months of holidays.\n\nI there hope that you will send us a favourable reply as Mr. Tessier is quite agreeable and believes that these two months would be absolutely useless as far as the school work is concerned.\n\nYours etc.,\n\nSister St. Elzear.\n\nSuperior General.\nOttawa, April 30th, 1927.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, in which you request that permission be granted to the Rev.

January and February, last, the Department will approve of the school being closed for the regular summer holidays for the months above mentioned, viz. July and August. Salaries will be allowed in full for the time the school was closed during January and February, and cheques in payment to the teachers for the quarter ended March 31st, last, are being sent.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Agent Tessier of the permission granted to close the school for the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

As you are aware, permission was granted to have this school closed during January and February, last, and we are allowing full salary for these months.

All our teachers are in activity and it is impossible to ask them such a thing after ten long months of teaching.\n\nHowever, I hope that our Sister St. Raphael whose health is improving considerably may be able to fill that position but I cannot assure you of anything.\n\nIt is certain that we will do our very best to fulfill your request. Believe me Sir.\n\nVery Humbly in Jesus Christ.\n\nSister St. Helen, Superior.\nSir:\n\nAt a meeting of the council of the Montagnaise Tribe of Pointe Bleue held on the 13th January.\n\nIt was proposed by Mr. Georges Jourdain, seconded by Mr. Meride Robertson that a request be made to the Superintendent General to establish a special course at the school of Pointe Bleue during the months of July and August to permit the children of the Indian hunters to acquire an education. Considering that these hunters return from the bush at the time of the holiday and return in September, their children, numbering about 50 are deprived of all education.\n\nConcerning the 3rd request made to the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, permit me to say that it would be quite useful for the said children that a Sister be able to teach them school during those two months. Having written to the Rev. Sister Superior of the Nuns of Notre Dame of Bon Conseil to know if I could depend on the services of one of her Sisters, I enclose her reply. If we cannot have any Sister it will be easy to have a lay-teacher.\n\nA. De La Boissiere.\nOttawa, February 11, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to resolution of the Pointe Bleue Band of the 13th ultimo requesting that a summer school be conducted at Pointe Bleue during the months of July and August, next, for the benefit of the children of the Indian hunters who return from the bush at that time, I have to say that the Department will approve of a summer school being conducted during the above named months, and would allow the teacher salary at the rate of $60 per month. It is to be understood, however, that this school is to be for the benefit of only those children who do not attend the regular day school.\n\nIt is hoped that you will be able to arrange with the Reverend Sister Superior of the Nuns' of Notre Dame of Bon Conseil to supply a qualified teacher to conduct the school during the two months' period. If it is impossible for the Sister Superior to supply a teacher, you should arrange to obtain the services of a lay teacher for this summer school. The classes could be conducted in the Pointe Bleue Indian Day School, using the equipment at present in the school. Please advise the Department of the arrangements you can make for teaching services for this summer school. It should commence operations on or about July 4th, next, and continue until the end of August, following.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Elles ont chang\u00e9 de local pour la classe deux fois; la premi\u00e8re maison d'\u00e9cole n'\u00e9tait plus qu'une vieille maison en ruine, l'autre construite il y a une dizaine d'ann\u00e9es, pour deux classes, plus moderne et plus solide mais cependant pas assez chaude en hiver malgr\u00e9 tout le bois qu'on apporte \u00e0 chauffer, bar- rin au fait-disant de ce c\u00f4t\u00e9 l\u00e0. Fumais \u00e0 air chaud qui ne chauffe habituellement qu'une classe; dans l'autre les \u00e9l\u00e8ves plus petits et plus nombreux y souffrent beaucoup du froid oblig\u00e9s qu'ils sont parfois de garder tous leurs habits. Un petit po\u00eale dans cette classe y ferait un grand bien.\n\nAutre chose, sans avoir eu remarqu\u00e9 sur le rapport de septembre que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves sont trop nombreux pour deux classes, 344 591 surtout en cette derni\u00e8re, il est in...\npour que de suffire \u00e0 la t\u00e2che et encore plus difficile d'y faire progresser les \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Tous ces \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont sept ans et r\u00e9volus. Il y a 15 ans, on pouvait les refuser et une quarantaine reste encore qui n'attendent que le moment o\u00f9 ils auront sept ans \u00e0 l'un ou l'autre des orphelinats pour entrer en classe. Que ferons-nous?\n\nVoici donc votre Marie du Carmel, directrice de la classe et institutrice des Indiens \u00e0 B\u00e9thanie et \u00e0 la Pointe-Blanche depuis vingt ans. J'ai pens\u00e9 que le D\u00e9partement des affaires indiennes h\u00e9siterait \u00e0 accueillir \u00e0 toutes nos demandes; probablement parce que nous ne serions pas fr\u00e9quent\u00e9s ou refuseraient pas d'accorder une petite attention au P\u00e8re Cur\u00e9 (100 $ environ) qui pourrait \u00eatre utile et aurait sous son contr\u00f4le une petite \u00e9cole \u00e0 quelque distance de la n\u00f4tre, ce qui favoriserait les enfants trop \u00e9loign\u00e9s ceux qui ont la peine de lire et plus et d\u00e9cha\u00eenerait nos classes d'autant.\n\nMonsieur Faubin, traducteur du D\u00e9p. des affaires indiennes qui accompagnait M. l'inspecteur anglais K avait bien promis de s'occuper de nous, mais la mort de l'a\u00een\u00e9 trop vite. J'esp\u00e8re que ceux qui le remplacent ne seront pas moins gentils et un petit mandat comme celui que je viendrais me rencontrerais pas d'objection.\n\nJe compte sur votre bienveillance et j'inscris davantage mes remerciements.\n\nVotre tr\u00e8s\n\nMarie du Carmel\nDirectrice\nPointe-Blanche\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nFor 26 years the school at Pointe Bleue has been under the care of the Sisters of Notre-Dame du Bon Conseil.\n\nDuring all this time two sisters have taught the Indian children of both sexes. The location of their school has changed on two occasions: the first school house was an old building in ruins; the next one, built about 10 years ago and containing two classrooms, is more modern and in better condition. However, it is not warm enough in winter, in spite of all the care given to its heating. The hot air furnace gives the necessary heat to one room only; in the other, the pupils, who are younger and more numerous, suffer a great deal from the cold and are often obliged to retain their over-clothing. A small stove in this classroom would be a decided improvement.\n\nYou have probably noticed, by the September report, that the pupils are very numerous, too numerous, in fact, for the two classrooms, in one of which there are 34 and in the other 59. It is almost impossible, especially in the latter classroom, to give the proper instruction. The ages of the pupils vary from 7 to 15. We cannot refuse any of them and there are still about 15 awaiting their seventh birthday in the course of the year to begin attending school. What shall we do?\n\nThe undersigned, Sr. Marie du Carmel, has been for 20 years directing and teaching in the Indian school at Betsiamits and Pointe Bleue. I think the Department of Indian Affairs, which has always so graciously granted our requests, probably because they have not been frequent, will not refuse to grant to the Reverend Father, the priest, a small sum of about $100.00 which would provide a small school house to be opened by him at a short distance from ours, and which would remain under his control. This would prove a boon to the children who live a couple of miles away from our school and would remedy the over-crowding to a certain extent.\n\nMr. Fabien, translator of the Department of Indian Affairs, who accompanied the English-speaking inspector, promised to look after our request, but death removed him too soon. I hope that those who replace him will not be less kind and that the small amount that we ask for will not meet any objection.\n\nI rely on your kindness and thank you in advance.\n\n(Signed) Sr. Marie du Carmel, Pointe Bleue.\nOttawa, October 13, 1936.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI have your letter regarding the crowded condition of the classrooms in the Pointe Bleue Indian Day School, and requesting that a grant of about $100 be allowed the local Priest, in order that he can provide a small school-house, to be opened as an extra classroom, under his control.\n\nIn this regard, I regret to say, as funds are extremely limited, the Department will be unable to provide the expense for the purpose of opening the extra classroom and payment of teacher's salary.\n\nRegarding the heating of the classrooms in the school building, it is noted that the hot air furnace supplies only the heat necessary for one room and that in the other room, in which the younger pupils are taught, they suffer from cold. The Department is communicating with Mr. Agent de la Boissiere, requesting him to arrange for the purchase and installation of a small stove in this classroom. It is hoped, when the stove is installed, that sufficient heat will be provided to keep the room comfortable in cold weather.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Sister Marie du Carmel,\nPointe Bleue,\nQue.\nOttawa, October 13, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from the Reverend Sister in charge of the Pointe Bleue Indian Day School, in which she draws attention to the difficulty in heating one of the classrooms and requests that a small stove be supplied and installed.\n\nThe Department desires to make the classrooms comfortable for the children in cold weather, and I would request that, after consulting the Rev. Sister, you will arrange for the purchase of a small stove, of a type that would be suitable to heat the room and, also, for the purchase of any stove pipe that may be required. You should have the stove set up in the classroom.\n\nYou should obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost of the stove and any stove pipe supplied, attach the account to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. Please give this matter your early attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. de la Boissiere, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPointe Bleue,\nQue.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nMonsieur,\n\nJe comprends parfaitement bien que le D\u00e9partement a d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 bien des demandes; mais ce que je vous demande moi est un peu de chose. C'est-\u00e0-dire, $100.00; ce n'est pas ainsi dire que comme une goutte d'eau au sein de l'Oc\u00e9an; en comparaison des fonds du D\u00e9partement. Je ne peux m'arr\u00eater \u00e0 supposer que vous me refusez vraiment; et c'est pourquoi je vous \u00e9cris aujourd'hui, pour redire le grand besoin que nous avons de vous aider. Depuis ce temps, la population est beaucoup augment\u00e9e et nous avons encore que deux classes. Nos classes actuelles sont belle et grande, mais quand m\u00eame, on ne peut pas entamer les \u00e9l\u00e8ves comme des sacs de farine, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves sont beaucoup trop nombreux et les professeurs sont impuissants; ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 cela, la grande distance que ces enfants ont \u00e0 parcourir. L'\u00e9cole est au centre, il reste deux milles \u00e0 deux milles et demi de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9, de jurer si la chose est possible chaque matin et nuit.\n\nMonsieur de la Bussi\u00e8re, \u00e0 qui j'ai confi\u00e9 ma requ\u00eate, trouve que cette demande aurait fait des ann\u00e9es longtemps et qu'elle est bien trop absolument n\u00e9cessaire de maintenir.\nOui, si vous pensez que tout le bien que cela ferait, votre cause serait vite gagn\u00e9e. Les enfants sont intelligents et studieux, assidus \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole quand le temps le permet; mais \u00e0 une aussi grande distance, les autres sont souvent emp\u00each\u00e9s \u00e0 cause du froid et des temp\u00eates en hiver.\n\nMme, je pense en avoir assez dit pour gagner ma cause aupr\u00e8s de la bienveillance. J'esp\u00e8re que la semaine prochaine je recevrai une r\u00e9ponse favorable et que d\u00e8s le premier jour de novembre nos enfants jouiront d'un bonheur plus parfait dans une classe que sera plus \u00e0 leur fortune et plus proche de leur domicile.\n\nJ'inscris avec ma lettre une autre de Mme Poir\u00e9 qui nous fait bien ce qu'il en pense lui aussi.\n\nAvec le rapport de septembre j'avais demand\u00e9 des cahiers de Division B, je ne les ai pas encore re\u00e7u.

Vous lui avez r\u00e9pondu qu'il n'y avait pas de subsides vot\u00e9s.\n\nIl y a plus de 10 ans que nous demandons au D\u00e9partement la construction d'une \u00e9cole dans le rang C, distant de 2 milles de l'\u00e9cole du village.\n\nEn 1930, la veille des \u00e9lections f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, on nous l'avait promis m\u00eame des inspecteurs sont venus choisir le terrain. Le gouvernement King est tomb\u00e9 et l'\u00e9cole aussi.\n\n\u00c0 diverses reprises, j'ai demand\u00e9 moi-m\u00eame et on m'a toujours r\u00e9pondu qu'il n'y avait pas de subsides vot\u00e9s \u00e0 cette fin.\n\nQuand M.

D\u00e9carie, O.M.I.\nPointe Bleue, Oct. 23, 1936.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI fully appreciate that the Department has to reply to a very large number of requests, but it seems to me that $100.00 is merely a drop in a bucket of water. I cannot think that you really intend refusing my request and this explains that once again I should come to you. Twenty years ago, we had two classes. Since then, the population has considerably increased and we still have only two classes. Our present classrooms are spacious, but, nevertheless, we cannot pile in the pupils who are much too numerous for accommodation. Besides, another point to be considered is the great distance those children have to travel to come to school. They have to walk between two and two and a half miles in either direction. Mr. de la Boissi\u00e8re, with whom I discussed my present request, is of the opinion that it should have been made long ago and that it is highly opportune and even absolutely necessary. Our pupils are intelligent and studious, the attendance is good, but owing to the great distance, several girls cannot come on account of the cold weather in winter. I do hope, gentlemen, that I shall receive a favorable answer from you some time next week, and that by November our children shall have new classrooms closer to their homes. I am enclosing a letter from the parish priest. In submitting my report for September I asked for 12 dozen of Dominion B copybooks which I have not yet received.\n\nThanks for the small stove.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) Sr. Marie du Carmel,\nDirector,\nPointe Bleue, Lake St.\nJohn Co., Que.\nPointe Bleue, October 22, 1936\n\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAbout 10 days ago, Sister Marie du Carmel, Dean of Studies of our Pointe Bleue school, wrote to you in connection with a large number of pupils, particularly in her classroom.\n\nShe was requesting a grant of $100, in order to decentralize some pupils and to send them to maternal schools under my control. You replied to her that no monies had been voted for that purpose.\n\nFor more than 10 years we have asked the Department to build a school in Range C, two miles from the village school. In 1930, on the eve of the federal election, the construction of a school had been promised and inspectors had come to select the land. The King Government was defeated and the school was not built.\n\nOn several occasions I have requested the construction of such a school, but each time I was informed that there was no money available. When Mr. Robertson, inspector of Reserves, visited us this year I renewed my request. He told me at the time that he would take the matter up with the Department since he believed such a school to be urgently needed.\n\nMr. De la Boissi\u00e8re, Indian Agent, and the Indian Council have made the same request and received the same answer. Is the purpose of this oft repeated excuse to make us cease asking for the construction of a school? Let it be known now that we will not capitulate. Since it is too late this year to begin such construction I make the following requests:\n\n1. That a grant of 30 cents be made for each pupil whether he is belonging to the tribe or not, between the age of 7 to 15, living outside the village, and this during the period of November 1 to June 24.\n2. The appoint by myself of teachers not holding the diploma, but former teachers here, for that purpose.\n\n3. Replies in French to all our letters.\n\nI trust, Sir, that our request will not only be taken into consideration but that immediate action will be taken.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) J.

The need is urgent, as we have about 30 pupils who shall have to abandon school some time during the Winter on account of their age and their physical resistance which do not enable them to travel such a long distance with poor clothes. Those who have persisted in years gone by have often been sick during the day. All the pupils who live far from school take their meal at the school, which is a further cause of inconvenience to the teachers. I do not lose faith and I trust that for January, 1937, it will have been possible for you to find $50.00 which may be used for the welfare of those children during the balance of the school year. Would not your sons and daughters be very unhappy if they had to share the lot of those poor Indians. Please listen to our prayers and accede to our request.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) Sister M. du Carmel,\nDirectress.\nEX'D.\nOttawa, November 26, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nRecently, the Department received a letter from Reverend Sister Marie du Carmel, requesting a grant of $100 for the establishment of a new classroom closer to the homes of some of the pupils. She was informed that, owing to lack of funds, the Department was not in a position to approve opening additional classrooms at any Indian day school at the present time.\n\nThe Reverend Sister has again written, requesting an amount of $50.00 to be used for the welfare of the children residing at a distance from the school. The Department does not understand exactly what she meant in her letter. Does she wish the Department to make an allowance for serving a midday meal?\n\nPlease let me have a full report from you in connection with the Reverend Sister's request. You should inform her that our reason for not allowing the expenditure requested by her is not due to our lack of interest in the education of the children at Pointe Bleue, but simply due to the fact that our appropriation for the current fiscal year has been assigned and, therefore, expenditures for which funds were not specially provided cannot be considered.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

J'ai seulement expos\u00e9 tous les termes de nos \u00e9clats qui ont l'ambition et l'\u00e9loign\u00e9e. Mais puisque la chose est impossible pour le moment, nous resignons respectueusement.\n\nLe $50.00 piastre demand\u00e9 par la mise de janvier, avait la m\u00eame fin que le $100.00 piastre.\ndemand\u00e9 au d\u00e9but de notre correspondance; c'est \u00e0 dire pour le salaire d'une autre ma\u00eetresse en dehors de l'\u00e9cole actuelle. N'ayant plus apr\u00e8s cette date, janvier, que sept mois de classe, je demandais pour cette ann\u00e9e ce montant suffisant; mais seulement pour une classe. Les deux institutrices sont raisonnablement r\u00e9tribu\u00e9es.\n\nJ'esp\u00e8re cependant que cette demande n'est pas refus\u00e9e pour toujours et que le D\u00e9partement saura en temps opportun se souvenir de nos besoins qui sont bien l\u00e9gitimes et r\u00e9els.\n\nEn attendant la confirmation de la continuit\u00e9 avec laquelle nous avons toujours accueilli vos demandes jusqu'\u00e0 ce jour et demain,\n\nVotre humble\n\nSoeur Marie du Carmel\n\n\u00c9cole St-D. du Bonheur\nPointe-Blanche\nLac St-Jean\n3 d\u00e9c. 1936\nPointe-Blanche, 23 janvier 1937.\n\nMonsieur,\n\nVoici ci-joint une lettre de la Rev.

P\u00e8re je trouve qu'il y a toujours trop d'\u00e9l\u00e8ves dans la petite classe, m\u00eame quand les enfants des chasseurs sont dans les bois et c'est ce que je constate depuis 8 ans.\n\nJe me permets de demander au D\u00e9partement s'il serait possible de songer \u00e0 l'am\u00e9nagement de l'\u00e9cole pour une troisi\u00e8me classe. Je ne suis pas en faveur d'une seconde \u00e9cole sur la r\u00e9serve; je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re que les enfants viennent \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole du village pour qu'il n'y ait que les religieuses qui fassent l'enseignement. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves les plus \u00e2g\u00e9s demeurent \u00e0 environ 2 milles de l'\u00e9cole, ils sont des enfants de cultivateurs qui aiment facilement pouvoir venir y conduire leurs enfants.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre, Monsieur, votre humble serviteur,\n\nA. de la Boissi\u00e8re,\nAgent des Sauvages.\n\nLe Secr\u00e9taire,\nD\u00e9partement des Affaires Indiennes,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I only tried to state the needs of our school children who are numerous and live far away from the school. But since, as you say, it is impossible for the moment, we respectfully accept your decision. The $50.00 we requested for the month of January was to be used as the $100.00 we requested at the beginning of our correspondence, namely, for the salary of an additional school teacher. Since after Jan., there will be only six more months of school, I found this amount sufficient for the present year. That was the only purpose of my request. The two school teachers are receiving a reasonable salary.\n\nI hope, nevertheless, that our request will not be shelved forever and that the Department shall, whenever it is convenient, remember our needs which are very legitimate and real.\n\nMeanwhile, I thank you for the courtesy with which you have always received our requests and I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) Sr. Marie du Carmel,\nEcole N.D. du Bon Conseil,\nBlue Point, P\u00e9Q.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn a letter dated January 28, 1937, Mr. A. de la Boissi\u00e8re, Indian Agent of the Blue Point Reserve, encloses a letter from the Revd. Sister Marie du Carmel, in answer to your letter No. 21-1-1, dated November 26, 1936, which he claims is self-explanatory.\n\nHe substantiates the Reverend Sister's claim. There are always too many children in the small classroom, even when the children of the hunters are out in the woods. He further adds that he has been claiming this for the last eight years. He requests that the Department make provisions, if possible, for the enlargement of the school, in order to include a third classroom. He states that he is not in favour of having a second school on the Reserve and that he prefers that the children should all come to the village school in order that the nuns may be the only ones to teach. He claims that no child lives farther away than two miles from the school and that the few farmers' children who do, can be easily brought there each day by their parents.\n\n(Signed) A. de la Boissi\u00e8re,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 10, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, urging the enlargement of the Pointe Bleue Indian Day School in order to provide a third classroom. I may add that recently the Department received a letter enclosing a petition from the Indians residing on Ranges B and C requesting the erection of a day school at that point.\n\nNo funds are available in the current year's Appropriation to carry out either project, nor has it been possible to make provision in the Estimates for the next fiscal year for this work.\n\nThe Department would appreciate your discussing the whole matter with the Indians concerned and ascertaining if they are prepared to assist in the erection of a third classroom. Could they provide the necessary lumber and do the work without charge to the Department? In this event, it might be possible for us to favourably consider supplying the doors, windows, shingles, etc. On receipt of your reply the provision of extra classroom accommodation at Pointe Bleue will receive further consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

Mr. Hoey,\n2. Mr. Christianson\n\nRe: Pointe Bleue Agency\n\nWhile on my general inspection at the above Agency, the matter of education was brought to my attention, and after listening to certain suggestions, I thought best to submit the same to you on a special memorandum.\n\nWe find on this Reserve a certain number of children who have never been to, and will not have any opportunity to attend school, as their families spend most of their time in the woods, and are only on the Reserve for about three months during the summer.\n\nFar from me is the idea of high education among the Indians in general, but no education at all, wherever it is possible to give it, is no better. We find in some places the regular ten month September - June year; in other bands - three month summer schools, for the benefit of young Indians who follow their families in the woods; but at Pointe Bleue, the children coming from the woods are never given an opportunity to attend school during their stay at the lake.\n\nThe following arrangement was discussed with the Missionary, Father Decarie, Agent de la Boisserie and the Sisters, and appears to meet local conditions:\n\n1. School year for Grades 3 - 4 - 5 & 6, October 1st - April 30th (7 months).\n2. Juniors - June, July and August (3 months) including children from families in the woods, Juniors and others.\n3. May and September - teachers' holidays.\n4. During May, children could help at Spring's work. During September, children could help at crops; thus providing them with farming and gardening.\n\nThe above arrangement would provide for ten months schooling, and the proposed division of the ten months would benefit all of the children, instead of the present conditions which do not allow any of the families in the woods to give their children the least schooling. The attendance to school is also a good training for discipline and good manners.\n\nThere are but few left of the experienced canoe makers of old - snowshoe making will also be a thing of the past, unless steps are taken to train the young men, showing\nsome ability, to make canoes and snowshoes.\n\nThere is already a fair start in agriculture, and I only hope that the same will be given close attention and due consideration. Lack of trapping in past few years has been instrumental in the increased interest in farming; let us keep it up, and encourage any move towards more and better farming, so that more will be kept off the relief list and become self-supporting.\n\nIt is hoped that you will understand that the above suggestions are made only in view of the improvement in the conditions of these Indians. The proposal changes in school year are, in my opinion, to benefit all the Indian children of school age, whether they remain on the Reserve the year around, or whether they only come to spend three summer months in the year.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nQuebec Inspectorate.\nOttawa,\nApril 27, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn the recommendation of Inspector Thibault it has been decided that the annual summer holidays at the Pointe Bleue School will be taken during the months of May and September, 1940. This means that the school will close for one month's holidays at the end of this month and will be re-opened on June 1 and continue in operation for the months of June, July and August and will then close for the month of September.\n\nInspector Thibault states that by arranging the holidays in the manner mentioned above the school will be able to give some training not only to the pupils who live in the vicinity but to those pupils who come to the Reserve during the summer months of June, July and August.\n\nThe Reverend Sisters and yourself should keep careful check on the attendance and a full report should be submitted to the Department early in October stating if this method of conducting the school has proved successful. If so, the practice will be continued in future years.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

L'exp\u00e9rience faite nous prouve d\u00e9j\u00e0 que ce mode n'est gu\u00e8re satisfaisant et donne un r\u00e9sultat inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 ce qu'on obtenait auparavant. Le niveau de l'enseignement a certainement baiss\u00e9 et cela se comprend, puisque les \u00e9l\u00e8ves n'ont fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 l'\u00e9cole que sept mois au lieu de dix, et pour cause d'\u00e9pid\u00e9mie, n'en ont eu que six cette ann\u00e9e.\n\nLe second groupe n'aura que trois mois de classe et cela dans le temps le plus chaud de l'ann\u00e9e.\n\nVraiment, il vaut mieux revenir \u00e0 l'ancienne organisation, c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 celle qui est en usage dans toutes les \u00e9coles de la province.\n\nEn cons\u00e9quence, je prie votre D\u00e9partement de bien vouloir r\u00e9tablir l'ann\u00e9e scolaire telle qu'elle \u00e9tait: du premier septembre au premier juillet avec les vacances pendant les mois de juillet et ao\u00fbt.\n\nComme l'inscription est de 111 \u00e9l\u00e8ves - ce qui est beaucoup trop pour deux classes - je demande, en outre, \u00e0 votre D\u00e9partement d'ouvrir une troisi\u00e8me classe afin de pouvoir recevoir en m\u00eame temps tous les enfants de la R\u00e9serve. Ainsi, tous b\u00e9n\u00e9ficieront des dix mois de classe et les progr\u00e8s seront plus appr\u00e9ciables.\n\n\u00c0 cet effet, un local pourra facilement \u00eatre lou\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur pour y installer les commer\u00e7ants sans d\u00e9ranger les deux classes actuelles de l'\u00e9cole.\n\nDe cette mani\u00e8re tous feront leur ann\u00e9e compl\u00e8te.\nle classement sera plus facile et les progr\u00e8s plus marquants.\n\nEn septembre prochain, nous aurons dans toute la province, la fr\u00e9quentation scolaire obligatoire. Il ne faudrait pas que cette \u00e9cole, administr\u00e9e par le Gouvernement F\u00e9d\u00e9ral, fasse exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle. Elle doit \u00eatre organis\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 recevoir tous les enfants qui s'y pr\u00e9senteront.\n\nVotre maison d'\u00e9cole a besoin de r\u00e9parations. Le syst\u00e8me de chauffage fait d\u00e9faut; le plafond, les murs sont tout noircis par la fum\u00e9e. La peinture ne y para\u00eet plus; elle doit \u00eatre repeinte, et \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur et \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur.\n\nLa fournaise ne donne plus aucune satisfaction; elle devrait \u00eatre remplac\u00e9e par une autre \u00e0 l'air conditionn\u00e9 avec thermostat en haut dans le passage.\n\nJe ne doute pas que le D\u00e9partement des affaires Indiennes verra \u00e0 ce que ces am\u00e9liorations se fassent au cours des vacances de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que son \u00e9cole soit, pour le moins, aussi bien tenue que celles des autres municipalit\u00e9s scolaires, m\u00eame les plus pauvres.\n\nVotre humble serviteur,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSt-F\u00e9licien, ce 12 juillet, 1948\nThe Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nI have visited today both classes of your Indian School at Pointe Bleue.\n\nAfter visiting the regular course, I wanted to ascertain the work done by the pupils during the summer course.\n\n59 pupils followed the former, that is the 7-month course and 52 are following the second which lasts three months.\n\nI found out that progress was not as satisfactory as in the past. Experience has shown that this system is not very satisfactory and that it gives results inferior to those which were formerly obtained. The educational level has certainly been lowered; and this is easily understood inasmuch as the pupils attended school only 7 months instead of 10 and this year, due to an epidemic, they only had six months schooling.\n\nThe second group will only have three months schooling and this in the warmest period of the year.\n\nI believe that it would be preferable to revert to the former system, which is in use in all other schools in the Province.\n\nAccordingly, I would ask the Department to re-establish the former school year: from Sept. 1 to July 1, with holidays during July and August.\n\nFurther, as 111 pupils have been registered -- which is too large a number for two classes -- I would ask your Department to open a third class in order to accommodate all the children of the reserve at the same time. Thus, all will benefit from 10 months schooling and progress will be measurably increased.\n\nFor this purpose, premises could be easily leased outside the school to accommodate beginners without disturbing the two present classes in the school.\n\nIn this manner, all will attend school the whole year, it will be easier to classify them and progress will be more noticeable.\n\nNext September, compulsory school attendance will be inaugurated in the province. This school, which is administered by the Dominion Government, should not be an exception to the rule, and it should be set up in such a manner as to receive all the children which will apply.\n\nThe schoolhouse needs repairs. The heating system is defective; the ceilings and the walls have been blackened by smoke. All traces of paint have disappeared and it should be repainted inside and outside.\n\nThe furnace is very defective; it should be replaced by an air-conditioning furnace with a thermostat upstairs in the hall.\n\nI have no doubt that the Department of Indian Affairs will see to it that these improvements are carried out during the holidays in order that the school be at least as well kept as those of other municipalities, even the poorest.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\n(Sgd) C.E. Boily,\nSchool Inspector.\nOttawa,\nJuly 21, 1943.\n\nMr. A. de la Boissiere, Indian Agent, Pointe Bleue, Que.\n\nI am in receipt of a report from Mr. C.E. Boily, in connection with his recent inspection of the Pointe Bleue Indian Day School. The Inspector considers that a third classroom should be opened in order to accommodate the number of children on the reserve and he advises that premises could be rented suitable for one classroom. Possibly he has discussed this matter with you and I should appreciate your advising me what building he refers, its approximate distance from the present school and the rent that would be required. Is there a stove or furnace in the building and, if not, what would it cost to install heating facilities? On receipt of this information the matter will receive our careful consideration.\n\nThe Inspector states also that he does not agree with the broken periods during which we have had the school in operation for the past three years. He feels that the school should operate from September 1 to the following June 30 each academic year. It would be appreciated if you would discuss this suggestion with the Reverend Sisters. I may add that the Inspector appears to have a strong argument in favour of his recommendation, in view of the fact that the attendance during the summer months is apparently small.\n\nI have written to you under separate cover regarding the furnace and will await your reply before making a decision.\nThe Inspector also refers to the ceilings and walls which he states are blackened by smoke. You might let me know what it would cost to paint the interior of the two classrooms at the Pointe Bleue School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE TREASURY\n\nL.

And I have examined the pupils of different divisions. They read intelligently and they have a good pronunciation and tone. The replies which they gave me in regard to other subjects have convinced me that they are properly classified and that a good year may be expected.\n\nThe class-rooms are clean and well equipped. Likewise the pupils are clean and have a good posture.\n\nThe classes are therefore on a sound footing and very good results may be expected.\n\n(Signed) Charles-Edouard Boily.\nMay, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have visited your two classes on April 17. I examined the pupils and I found that the work and the results of the year were quite satisfactory.\n\nSince last year, the school year covers a seven-month period only in the case of the most advanced pupils while the young pupils follow a three-month course during the summer months. I believe that this system will prove entirely satisfactory.\n\nYour pupils deserve praise for their good posture, cleanliness and discipline.\n\nYou may rest assured that your school is efficient and compares favourably with others.\n\n(Signed) I.E.\nDecember 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have made my first annual visit to the two classes of your school. The number of pupils registered in both classes is 38 and 40 respectively.\n\nI made them read in turn and by a summary examination I found that they were doing satisfactory work. Ratings are properly done, all the pupils have a good posture and, under the circumstances, they are remarkably clean. The devoted teachers deserve nothing but praise.\n\nI can not say as much of the class-rooms which are blackened by smoke and have a very dismal appearance. They would need a good white-washing. I would ask you, therefore, to have the classes redecorated during the forthcoming holidays.\n\nThe exterior also needs decorating but I suppose this could be left until next summer.\n\nI trust that you will get in touch with your department in this connection.\n\n(Signed) Charles-Edouard Boily\n\nI.E.\nMr. Achille de la Boissi\u00e8re,\nIndians Agent,\nPointe-Bleue.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe pupils of your school underwent the second annual examination recently.\n\nAs in the past, the results were very good. All the pupils of both classes read well, and they replied intelligently to the questions asked. The only fault is their timidity and the fact that they do not speak loud enough. However, this is a fault which is hard to overcome. Therefore, the progress accomplished during the year is quite satisfactory and your classes compare favorably with those of the other municipalities in my district.\n\nYour schoolhouse is in good condition. It would be advisable, however, to repair the interior which has been blackened. Further, the plaster is broken in certain places and should be repaired.\n\nI would ask you to kindly have such repairs carried out during the summer holidays.\n\n(Signed) Charles-Edouard Boily\n\nI.E.\nPointe Bleue, August 13, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nWith reference to your letter No 21-1-1 dated 21 July, may I inform you that I did not have any interview with Inspector Boily at the time of his visit to the school last July; he simply sent me a copy of the report which he forwarded to you.\n\nI had an interview with Sister Henri-Suzo, who has been a teacher at the Pointe Bleue school for twelve years. For the 1943-44 school year the Sister expects to have 73 children; in the first class there are 35 desks and she expects 30 children; in the second class there are 52 desks whereas 43 pupils are expected. In addition to these 73 pupils there are about 10 white children of school age, from families of C.M.R. section-men and from the family of Willie Larouche who are tolerated on the reserve. Therefore, there would be no need for a third class if we only had to provide for the Indians; it is the last mentioned 10 who would cause overcrowding. Since June 1st, 52 pupils attended the classes; as several of them are hunters' children, if it were not for these summer courses, they could not be educated as they always return from the woods around the summer holidays.\n\nAs you may note by Mr. Boily's reports (which I would ask you to return to me) the classes held in 1941 and 1942 were a success. The falling off in attendance this year was obviously caused by epidemics of whooping cough and scarlet fever, but after the quarantine was lifted at the end of November, a few parents kept their children at home until January as they did not think it worth while to send them to school in December. Therefore, for some reason there was a falling off in the educational level.\n\nFor this year at least, I am still in favour of holding classes from October 1st to April 30th and from June 1st to August 31st.\n\nIndians Agent.\nOttawa,\nAugust 19, 1943.\n\nMr. A. de la Boissiere, Indian Agent, Pointe Bleue, Que.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 13th instant, in which you submit additional information with respect to the operation of the Pointe Bleue Indian Day School.\n\nIn view of the information submitted in your communication and the information contained in the Inspector's report sent forward therewith, it will be satisfactory to the Department if the school, this year, is operated as you suggest from October 1 to April 30 and from June 1 to August 31. The officials here were disturbed to learn that there are about 10 white children in attendance at this school. This Department is under no obligation whatever to provide instruction for white children. You should interview the parents of these children, therefore, at an early date and inform them that, in view of the number of Indian children on the reserve for whom we must provide accommodation, it will not be possible for us to provide instruction for their children in the future. The instruction of these children is a matter that should be taken up with the Provincial Department of Education.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would discuss with the Inspector at the time of his next visit to the school the desirability of operating this school from September 1 to June 30. The attendance of white children at our school and the provision that should be made for the education of these children by the Provincial authorities is also a matter that should be discussed with the Provincial Inspector. You might forward a report on your discussions with the Public School Inspector to the Department in due course.\n\nR.A.

As they have been tolerated for a long time on the reserve I should like to know whether these children are entitled to attend the Pointe Bleue school.\n\nIn recent years, 35 families left the reserve without being compelled to do so chiefly because their children could not be accommodated at the school.

McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\nOttawa, September 4, 1943\n\nDr. H.W. McGill\n\nRE: Visit to Pointe Bleue Agency\n\nI beg to submit a report of an inspection made at the above agency on July 15, 16 & 17th last.\n\nSCHOOL\n\nMy visit happened to be during the summer school term; the sister in charge gave me the list of the forty-seven inscriptions for said term consisting of fifty-four school days. According to records, attendance was as follows:\n\n- 8 pupils attended from 50 to 54 days\n- 9 \" \" \" 40 to 50 \"\n- 10 \" \" \" 30 to 40 \"\n- 12 \" \" \" 20 to 30 \"\n- 6 \" \" \" 10 to 20 \"\n- 2 \" \" \" less than 10 days\n\nThe total of 47 inscriptions is made up of:\n- Children living on the reserve all the year... 26\n- Children living on the reserve during the summer months only (9 speaking \"Indian only\")... 31 - 47\n\nDuring the term the 26 children who were able to make up a class by themselves did not easily follow a mixed class.\n\nSchool Inspector C.E. Boily, rushed when he came to make his examination at the Agency office, and simply mailed his report to the Agent. I have read said report and agree with him on some points.\n\nHe does not apparently approve of our system at our school, he said that the uneven number of success was due to an epidemic, there was no attendance; if he only had talked to our school, he would have written a more accurate report, as the majority of the children were ill in October and a part of November. In December many were still ill, and in January many were still ill. One month of January due to an epidemic, one expects to compare results of a school when it really was no more than three months.\n\nWhen the system was established two years ago into two sections, it was for the children of families (hunters) who...\nsummer months only and never had a chance to learn to read; the change now existing gave those children a better showing than they ever had before.\n\nMr. Boily suggests the return to the old school year as carried on in other parts of Quebec, as the new Quebec legislation on compulsory attendance to school will be in effect from September 1943. He does not seem aware that the Indian Act had that matter decided upon a long time before Quebec ever thought about it; I must admit however, that it is hard to enforce the Act where we have no constable.\n\nI do not agree with the Inspector's suggestion to open a third class, claiming that there are ill inscriptions; he forgets that many children can only speak Indians and are unable to follow the regular course for the whole year; he also forgets that many children are following their families to their hunting grounds and therefore unable to attend a ten months school year; this will leave sufficient room in the two classes for the children remaining on the reserve, who are able to follow our longer school term. I fail to see the necessity for another class being opened.\n\nThe sisters again complained that the water still tastes of gasoline. I also noticed this taste. They claim to be very careful when filling the engine with gasoline, but it seems to run into the well. I would recommend that we secure an estimate of the cost of moving the small engine in the cellar away from the well. This should not cost very much and I have asked our Agent to secure this information and submit same to the Department for consideration. Our water supply is good and plentiful and the taint of gasoline does not affect it for washing purpose but it is hardly fit for drinking and the Indians cannot be blamed for objecting to drinking it.\n\nThe painting and varnishing of the two classrooms will be executed while the children are not attending school.\n\nAnnexed hereto is a list of rations as I found them on my visit. In my opinion, every case is justified either by old age or sickness. I am satisfied that no able bodied Indians are on the relief list. Total rations of $366.92 compare favorably with the total of $386.76 of same month in 1942.\n\nThere is employment available for Indians who are not in the trapping group; the blueberry season is also bringing quite a number to the fifty or more families who have gone to pick berries some sixty miles away, partly to La Dor\u00e9e, partly to Lac \u00e0 la P\u00eache by truck with their camping outfit; the berries are plentiful this year and four hundred cases have been sold in the market. The cost of transportation by truck is $20. per trip each way, several two or three families sharing the same transport and dividing the cost. The price paid averages $2.50 per quart of nine quarts, the Indians paying twenty five cents for the trip and the trucks are collecting the berries three times per week paying cash on delivery on the road. The picking of blueberries is easy and simple, children can all help and a family of six to five pickers will easily earn from ten to fifteen dollar...\nper day and during the season of six to seven weeks, an average family should make easily from five to six hundred dollars. It was reported that last year a family of six (whites) good pickers sold eleven hundred dollars worth of blueberries. That is probably the reason more Indians have gone away to pick blueberries this year.\n\nFARMING\n\nThere is not much change in farming and no great improvement can ever be expected until those farmers stick to their farms altogether; too many leave their farms to guide during the fishing and hunting seasons, and I feel that it is very hard to keep them on the farms; then, some do return with cash but too many with little or none; it is not surprising to hear them often say that the farm is not paying, only due most of the time to the many absences.

The list includes two of the BOIVIN families, with whom we previously had trouble and who were refused hunting permits by Supervisor Conn and the Quebec Government. Mr. Conn will be able to complete said list.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nPointe Bleue Indian Agency\n\nRevised ration list as for August 1943\n\n| Supplied by HUDSON'S BAY Co. | ration No. | Amount |\n|-------------------------------|------------|--------|\n| VOLANT, widow Pierre           | 3          | 7.26   |\n| ETIENNE, widow Pierre          | 2          | 5.71   |\n| DOMINIQUE, Joseph              | 5          | 9.98   |\n| DOMINIQUE, widow Mitchell      | 1          | 4.26   |\n| JOURDAIN, Georges              | 2          | 5.71   |\n| LAUNIERE, Chrysostome          | 4          | 8.65   |\n| MANIGOUGER, Bernard            | 5          | 9.98   |\n| MANIGOUGER, On\u00e9sime (Joseph)   | 3          | 8.77   |\n| PAUL, N., Sr.                  | 4          | 8.65   |\n| PAUL, L\u00e9opold                  | 4          | 8.65   |\n| PAUL, Roland                   | 5          | 7.26   |\n| PAUL, Rosario                  | 3          | 7.26   |\n| PEKETULEGAN, widow George      | 2          | 5.37   |\n| SIMEON, Malek                  | 4          | 8.65   |\n| APICHOOS, miss Madeleine       | 2          | 5.37   |\n| RAPHAEL, Christine, wid.

According to records, attendance was as follows:\n\n| Pupils | Attended |\n|--------|----------|\n| 8      | from 50 to 54 days |\n| 9      | \" 40 to 50 \"       |\n| 10     | \" 30 to 40 \"       |\n| 12     | \" 20 to 30 \"       |\n| 6      | \" 10 to 20 \"       |\n| 2      | less than 10 days  |\n\nThe total of 47 inscriptions is made of:\nChildren living on the reserve all the year ... 26\nwith 11 of them speaking \"Indian only\"\n\nChildren living on the reserve during the summer months only (9 speaking \"Indian only\") ... 21 - 47\n\nDuring the term the 20 children speaking \"Indian only\" were able to make up a class by themselves, while they could not easily follow a mixed class.\n\nSchool Inspector C. L. Boily, must have been in a great hurry when he came to make his examination, as he did not call at the Agency office, and simply mailed a copy of his report to the Agent. I have read said report and beg to differ of opinion with him on some points.\n\nHe does not apparently approve of the two course given at our school, he said that the seven months course was not a success, due to an epidemic, there was only a six months attendance; if he only had talked to our agent and got first hand information, he would have written a different and more accurate report, as the majority of the children had scarlet fever in October and a part of November, then, some being convalescent even in December, many were away from school in the month of January due to an epidemic of grippe; how can any one expect to compare results of a supposed seven month term when it really was no more than three months attendance.\n\nWhen the system was established to divide our school year into two sections, it was with a view to benefit the children of families (hunters) who were on the reserve during the summer months only and never had a chance to learn to read; the change now existing gave those children a better showing than they ever had before.\n\nMr. Boily suggests the return to the old school year as carried on in other parts of Quebec, as the new Quebec legislation for compulsory attendance to school will be in effect from September 1943. He does not seem aware that the Indian Act had that matter decided upon a long time before Quebec ever thought about it; I must admit however, that it is hard to enforce the Act where we have no constable.\nI do not agree with the Inspector's suggestion to open a third class, claiming that there are ill inscriptions; he forgets that many children can only speak Indian and are unable to follow the regular course for the whole year; he also forgets that many children are following their families to their hunting grounds and therefore unable to attend a ten months school year; this will leave sufficient room in the two classes for the children remaining on the reserve, who are able to follow our longer school term. I fail to see the necessity for another class being opened.\n\nThe sisters again complained that the water still tastes of gasoline. I also noticed this taste. They claim to be very careful when filling the engine with gasoline, but it seems to run into the well. I would recommend that we secure an estimate of the cost of lining the well with lead or similar, away from the well. This should not cost very much and I have asked our Agent to secure this information and submit same to the Department for consideration. Our water supply is good and plentiful and the taint of gasoline does not affect it for washing purpose but it is hardly fit for drinking and the Indians cannot be blamed for objecting to drinking it.\n\nThe painting and varnishing of the two classrooms will be executed while the children are not attending school.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 14, 1943.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen you inspect the Pointe Bleue School in future it would be appreciated if you would arrange to interview the Indian Agent and discuss with him the results of your examination. For the current academic year it has been decided to operate this school from October 1, 1943 to April 30, 1944, and from June 1 to August 31, 1944.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The classes have been closed these last two years because the Indians bring their children with them to pick up blueberries.\nOttawa,\nMarch 20, 1944.\n\nMr. A. de la Boissiere, Indian Agent, Pointe Bleue, Que.\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, regarding the months during which the Principal of the Pointe Bleue School has asked that the school be operated.\n\nIn official letter of August 19, 1943, it was decided to operate the Pointe Bleue School from October 1, 1943, to April 30, 1944, and from June 1, 1944, to August 31, 1944.\n\nThe Department feels that these dates should be given a fair trial. A very careful record should be kept of the attendance during the period October 1 to April 30 and also during the period June 1 to August 31.

The ideal method would be ten consecutive months of school, with an additional month for Indians, which would be sufficient for the latter because they are not on the Reserve any longer. Those arriving previous to July can attend the half-breed class where they will be admitted.\n\nThis year more than ever, I have studied the matter and am giving briefly what I have noted.\n\nFirstly, during the first days of June I had no pupils, and only three or four some days later; seven pupils by the end of the month.\n\nIn July, there were twenty admissions -- they have generally taken fairly good advantage of it.\n\nIn August, no pupils.\n\nI therefore sincerely feel that it would be better to have ten consecutive months of school. I can assure you that we cannot give to these pupils in seven months the tuition which we would normally be required to give in ten months; it is quite impossible.\n\nMoreover, during the five months' holiday our pupils forget, and when they return to school some have to repeat. They become discouraged and this delays them considerably for the Solemn Communion which requires them to be in the sixth year.\n\nThere are many other disadvantages which space here does not permit me to bring to your attention.\n\nKindly accept my grateful thanks for all you have done for us until this day, and forgive me for the worries which I may have caused you. I hope you will continue to promote this case to a good end in order that we may attain the proposed aim, because it is totally for the good of all.\n\n(Sgd) Soeur Henri-Suzo, B.C.\nPointe Bleue, August 1, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nEnclosed please find a report from Soeur Henri-Suzo, teacher at Pointe Bleue Indian school, suggesting that school opening be from the beginning of September until June 30th, 1945, and that an additional month (that of July) be added for hunters' children.\n\nI support this recommendation considering that it is impossible to continue school during August because all the children are away with their parents picking blueberries.\n\n(Sgd.)

As the rectory is small, it is impossible to increase the personnel without receiving beforehand the assurance that they will be accommodated.\n\nIn the hope that your views will meet ours in this connection, we beg you to have pressure to bear with the Department in order that this improvement may be granted to us, which will enable us to organize the courses under normal conditions.\n\nThe attention you have given our recent request for an increase of salary renders us confident in regard to the above-mentioned, and we thank you sincerely in anticipation.\n\nSoeur Saint-Alz\u00e9ar,\nSup\u00e9rieure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nPointe Bleue, 5 d\u00e9cembre 1946.\n\nBranche des Affaires Indiennes,\nD\u00e9partement des Mines et Ressources,\nOttawa.\n\nVeuillez s.v.p. voir ci-inclus une lettre de la R\u00e9v\u00e9rende Soeur St-Elz\u00e9ar, Sup\u00e9rieure G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des S.S.

If our information is correct however, the only white children in the locality are those of Mr. Tremblay who, being section-hand, can hardly reside elsewhere.

In addition, the Pointe Bleue authorities, the Reverend the Parish Priest, Mr. De La Boissi\u00e8re and the Chief of the tribe are willing to accept these children at the Convent.\n\nIn the interest of the education of these children, would it not be possible for your Department to give to the person concerned the authority to accept these children in the classes of the Convent.\n\nIt is with confidence that we are submitting this request and we are convinced that it will receive your best attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

There are 33 pupils in grades III and IV, and 49 in grades I and II. Grades III and IV are combined and are taught in the parish hall which is quite unsatisfactory as a classroom. It is being used as an emergency.\n\nIt is recommended to build a classroom, plan 865. A male teacher would take charge of the senior boys. According to the present enrolment there would be approximately 20 pupils. Grades VIII and IX should attend provincial High Schools. There will be 6 in this category next year. The principal has been instructed to notify the Department as soon as the final standing of these pupils is known.\n\nThere seems to be some misunderstanding between Roberval and the reserve. There is not here the cooperation that is noticed at Lorette, Pierreville, and other localities which now show a great deal of goodwill towards the Indian. This misunderstanding seems to be caused principally by ignorance of Government policy on the part of the authorities in Roberval. In order that activities on the reserve be successful I believe that this misunderstanding should be cleared as soon as possible.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nA. J.

As the amount of the bonus is $15.00 a month, the total due for the four months mentioned is $60.00 for each teacher. Official letter of the 9th instant should have read $60.00 instead of $45.00.

A. Guay, de Montr\u00e9al, vous trouverez ci-attach\u00e9 un coupon de mandat-poste repr\u00e9sentant le paiement du compte de cette maison.\n\nEn effet, en 1917, avec l'autorisation du D\u00e9partement, les Institutrices de Pointe-Bleue envoyaient une commande \u00e0 la maison Guay pour des prix qui furent distribu\u00e9s aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves de l'\u00e9cole, et elles m'en firent adresser le compte. \u00c0 la fin de l'ann\u00e9e scolaire, un Cercle Dramatique compos\u00e9 des anciennes \u00e9l\u00e8ves fut form\u00e9, et avec le concours d'autres personnes, ce Cercle donna \u00e0 la R\u00e9serve en juillet de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e une soir\u00e9e dramatique et un euchre au profit de bonnes \u0153uvres.\n\nParmi ces \u0153uvres, vu qu'on \u00e9tait en temps de guerre, je sugg\u00e9rai aux jeunes filles de payer les prix de l'\u00e9cole avec les recettes des soir\u00e9es. Ce qui fut agr\u00e9\u00e9. Les recettes la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e s'\u00e9lev\u00e8rent \u00e0 $ 47.00. Je transmis \u00e0 Melle Alice L. Cleary, qui en \u00e9tait la secr\u00e9taire, le compte de la maison Guay pour qu'elle pay\u00e2t. Six ou sept mois plus tard, je re\u00e7us un \u00e9tat de compte de la m\u00eame maison qui m'en demandait la remise. Je l'adressai de nouveau \u00e0 Melle Cleary, qui faisait alors la classe \u00e0 Roberval et qui me fit savoir qu'elle allait le solder. Au mois de juin dernier, je re\u00e7us encore un \u00e9tat de compte, me disant que s'il n'\u00e9tait pas pay\u00e9 sans d\u00e9lai, on allait l'adresser au D\u00e9partement pour paiement. J'avertis Melle Cleary qui me laissa sous l'impression qu'elle avait envoy\u00e9 le montant du compte et qu'elle m'en ferait tenir le re\u00e7u.\n\nPar votre lettre, j'apprends que le compte n'avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 et je me suis adress\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Cercle pour savoir s'il y avait encore des fonds disponibles. Il restait encore...\nencore $32.00. J'ai t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 Melle Cleary qui \u00e9tait en promenade \u00e0 Roberval, qui m'a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle me faisait parvenir le coupon du mandat qu'elle avait adress\u00e9 ce matin m\u00eame \u00e0 la maison Guay, et que je viens de recevoir ce soir.\n\nJe dois ajouter que c'est gr\u00e2ce aussi \u00e0 la lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 de ce Cercle qu'on a pu distribuer quelques prix aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves de l'\u00e9cole \u00e0 la fin des ann\u00e9es scolaires 1918-19, sans recourir au D\u00e9partement.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre,\n\nMonsieur,\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nAgent des Sauvages.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your esteemed letter of Aug. 20, 1918, No. 15264-5, in connection with the account of the J.A. Guay firm, of Montreal, you will find attached hereto a receipt for a post office order representing the payment of the account of this firm.\n\nAs a matter of fact, in 1917, at the authorization of the Department the teachers of Pointe Bleue sent an order to the Guay firm for prizes which were distributed to the pupils of the school and they sent the account to me. At the end of the scholastic year a dramatic society composed of ex-pupils was formed with many other people and this society gave at the reserve in July of the same year a dramatic entertainment and a euchre for the benefit of good works. Among these works, in view of the fact that it was in time of war, I suggested to the young girls to pay for the school prizes with the receipts of the entertainment. This was agreed to. The receipts the first year amounted to $47.00. I forwarded to Miss Alice L. Cleary who was the secretary, the account from the Guay firm to be paid. Six or seven months later I received a statement of the account from the same firm asking for settlement. I forwarded it again to Miss Cleary, who was then teaching at Roberval, and who informed me that she was going to settle it. In the month of June last I received another statement of the account telling me that it was not paid without delay it would be sent to the Department. I notified Miss Cleary, who left me under the impression that she had sent the amount of the account and that she would let me have the receipt. By your letter I learned that the account had not yet been paid and I wrote to the president of the society to know if there were still any funds available. There still remained $32.00. I phoned to Miss Cleary who was at Roberval, who replied to me that she was sending me the receipt of the order that she had sent that same morning to the Guay firm and I received it this evening.\nI may add that it is thanks also to the liberality of the association that it was possible to distribute some prizes to the children of the school at the end of the scholastic year 1918-19 without recourse to the Department.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nA. Tessier,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 6, 1919.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 18th ultimo, addressed to Mr. Benson of this Department, enclosing an account for goods supplied the Pointe Blanche School in 1917, I beg to say that, upon inquiry having been made, the Department is informed that a post office order covering the amount of this account was sent you a few days ago.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFOR Asst.

Guay,\n5 Notre-Dame St., East,\nMontreal, Que.\nWaterloo, Ontario,\nApril 8th, 1920\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nThank you for your letter of April 6th, giving us an order for one #120 Teacher's Desk to be shipped to Mr. William E. Jones, Teacher, Gibson Indian Day School, Bala, Ontario.\n\nThis shipment will go forward in a day or two, which we trust will be satisfactory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE GLOBE FURNITURE CO. LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Manager\nPointe-Blere, 15 octobre 1921.\n\nMonsieur,\n\nIl nous faudrait absolument un nouveau po\u00eale pour le chauffage de l'\u00e9cole des sauvages. Le po\u00eale actuel est corrompu, presque tout en morceaux et c'est un danger constant pour le feu. Il est m\u00eame pour le tuyau qui n'a plus d'apaisement que d'une fum\u00e9e de propre de soie; il est m\u00eame perc\u00e9 en maintes endroits.\n\nJe vous demande donc l'autorisation n\u00e9cessaire pour acheter un nouveau po\u00eale et un tuyau.\n\nLe tout est \u00e0 remplacer au plus t\u00f4t si nous voulons \u00e9viter une explosion.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur et l'honneur,\n\nMonsieur,\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nA. Tessier\n\nGrand des Sauvages.\nPoints Bleus, October 1st, 1921\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa - Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nWe absolutely need a new stove to heat the Indian school. The present one is broken all to pieces and it is a constant danger for fire. The pipe is in the same state; it has only the thickness of a sheet of tissue paper, and also full of holes.\n\nI wish you would kindly authorize me to buy a new stove and the necessary pipe. It must be replaced at once so as to remove any danger of fire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd) A. Tessier,\nIndian Agent.\nOTTAWA, October 12th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the last instant, informing the Department that a new stove is required for the use of the Pointe Bleue Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of a stove suitable for the requirements of this school, and also for the stove pipe required. Before making the purchase, however, you should obtain prices from a number of firms and purchase the stove from the one quoting the lowest price. After the stove has been delivered you should forward properly receipted vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred, to which you should attach a memorandum showing the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted by them. While a stove to meet the requirements should be obtained, it is desired that no undue expenditure be incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA.

Dec. 12, 1931.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed herewith you will find account for the repairs made to the Indian school house at Pointe Bleue. This work, of urgent need, was authorized by Mr. J. D. Sutherland, during my last visit to the Department in April last.\n\nI could not have this work done sooner as during the course of the summer, tradesmen were asking too high prices; twice as high as the prices obtained this fall. The work was getting scarce everywhere.\n\nI have asked tenders for this work and am enclosing those which I have received. The work has been done by F. X. Eugene Roy, the lowest tenderer, and is satisfactory in every way. It took more than five days to carry out the work, besides the cost of materials.\n\nThe pupils of the school have not been disturbed by this work as all the interior work was done during holidays and after school hours.\n\nYours........etc.,\n\n(SGD) Armand Tessier,\nIndian Agent,\n\nEnclosure.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa - Ont.\nOTTAWA, March 9th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nThe enclosed account, in triplicate, has been forwarded to the Department covering the cost of Catechisms supplied for the use of the Pointe Bleue Indian day school.\n\nIt is presumed that this account covers the cost of Catechisms ordered on Requisition 848, of October 27th, last, and should be paid by the Stationery Office and this Department charged therefor in your usual monthly account for school stationery.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nRussell T.

Nous avons actuellement 75 \u00e0 80 enfants qui assistent r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement \u00e0 la classe et qui m\u00e9ritent certainement d'\u00eatre r\u00e9compens\u00e9s pour leur assiduit\u00e9 et leur application. Il faudrait que le D\u00e9partement octroie au moins \u00a320.65 afin de pouvoir r\u00e9compenser un peu chaque \u00e9l\u00e8ve m\u00e9ritant. La perspective d'un prix \u00e0 la fin de l'ann\u00e9e scolaire est un puissant encouragement \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude chez les enfants.\n\nEsp\u00e9rant que vous voudrez bien appuyer ma requ\u00eate.\n\nJe demeure votre tr\u00e8s humble\nSr St-Vincent-de-Paul Dist.\nPointe Bleue, le 23 mai 1923,\n\nMonsieur le Secr\u00e9taire,\nD\u00e9pt des Aff. des Sauvages,\nOttawa,\n\nMonsieur,\n\nJe vous transmets ci-joint un billet que les institutrices de l'\u00e9cole des sauvages veulent de me faire parvenir au sujet d'une distribution de prix aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves de l'\u00e9cole \u00e0 la fin de l'ann\u00e9e scolaire. Je suis heureux d'appuyer la demande des institutrices et je crois, en le nombre d'\u00e9l\u00e8ves, que le montant de $20.00 demand\u00e9 n'est pas juste et raisonnable. La perspective d'un prix stimule r\u00e9ellement leur ambition et ainsi leur assiduit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole. J'esp\u00e8re donc que le D\u00e9partement acc\u00e9dera \u00e0 la demande qui lui est faite et d'ores et d\u00e9j\u00e0 des enfants de l'\u00e9cole, je lui offre un cordial merci.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre,\n\nMonsieur,\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nA. Tessier\nAgent des Sauvages\nSir:\n\nWe hope the Department of Indian Affairs will vote a certain amount so as to purchase books for pupils on the reserve. We have at least forty-five (45) to sixty (60) children following the school regularly, and they certainly need help to correspond for their facility to their studies. It would be necessary for this amount to be at least twenty-five (25.0) dollars so as to purchase a little bit every year having purposed the children.\n\nHoping that you will consider my request I remain\n\nYour very humble sister,\n\nSister St. Vincent de Paul.\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a note which has been received from the teacher of the Indian school regarding the distribution of prizes to the pupils of the school at the end of the school term.\n\nI wish to recommend the request of the teacher and I believe that among the number of pupils, the amount of twenty ($20.00) each is requested is only just and reasonable. The presence of a prize stimulates their ambition greatly and also their assiduity to their school.\n\nI, therefore, hope that the Department will kindly grant the request, and I wish to thank you in advance in the name of the children of the Indian school.\n\nYours, etc.\n\n(S.A.) A. To Lee,\nIndian Agent,\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 31st, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, enclosing a communication from the Reverend Sister in charge of the Pointe Bleue Indian Day School, applying for a grant of $20 to purchase prizes or other suitable gifts to be given to the pupils before the school closes for the coming summer holidays.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this is an increase of $10 in the amount previously allowed for the purpose. We have a great number of requests of this nature, etc., as our funds are limited, it will only be possible to allow the sum of $15 for the purchase of these prizes for the Pointe Bleue School at this time. You may inform the Reverend Sister accordingly.\n\nItemized accounts, in duplicate, should be obtained from the merchant from whom the prizes are purchased, which you will be good enough to attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department in order that payment can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I believe that the Department would do well to pay attention to this report. This School has been built for a long time, when there was only an attendance of 20 to 25 pupils, whereas, at the present time, even in winter, there is an attendance of 68. There are too many pupils in the two classes, but, until this school is built, it is impossible to place others.\n\n| ENROLMENT | AVERAGE ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------|---------------------|\n| June Quarter 1923 | 95 | 64 |\n| September Quarter 1923 | 64 | 60 |\n| December Quarter 1923 | 65 | 34 |\n| March Quarter 1924 | 62 | 43 |\n| June Quarter 1924 | 80 | 63 |\n| September Quarter 1924 | 71 | 66 |\n\nThere are two teachers at this school, namely Sister St. Augustin and Sr. St. Anne de Jesus.

The chimney and some lights of glass to replace. This work is very necessary and would cost from $15.00 to $17.00.\n\nI hope you will give me the necessary authority to have these repairs done at once.\n\nWishing you all the compliments of the season,\n\nYours, etc.,\nA. Tessier,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 29th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, forwarding an account for the firewood purchased by you for the use of the Pointe Bleue Indian Day School and requesting authority to make some necessary repairs to the building.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange to have the windows and doors repaired. You should purchase any glass required and have it put in. Any repairs required to the chimneys should also be carried out. It is noted that you estimate the cost of these repairs to be approximately $17. These repairs should receive your early attention and, when completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

When the sixty (60) slates arrived at the school there were four (4) of them broken on account of the very bad packing. I immediately sent a claim to the firm Cote, Boivin and Company to have these four (4) slates replaced.\n\nThis firm did not pay any attention at first to my claim and it was only after several requests were made that they finally sent me at the end of December the four (4) slates missing.\n\nYours, etc.,\n\nA.

Cette taille laisse qui doit avoir depuis plus d'un demi si\u00e8cle, apr\u00e8s ce qui s'est pass\u00e9, avant de faire pour une classe seulement. Pour obtenir deux classes, il a fallu, il y a quelques ann\u00e9es, la diviser au moyen d'une cloison en bois. L'on entend que se dit \u00e0 une classe \u00e0 l'\u00e9cart et c'est un troupeau insupportable. La maison est tr\u00e8s froide. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 construite sur un terrain mauvais. Monsieur l'agent nous a dit un dernier que le moment n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la construction d'une nouvelle maison d'\u00e9cole serait celui de la prochaine session du Parlement. Pour ma part, je dois vous laisser savoir qu'il\nNous serons impossible de continuer l'acte prochain \u00e0 donner l'assignation dans laquelle nous nous sommes engag\u00e9s \u00e0 y contracter de si\u00e9chues maladies et \u00e0 perdre compl\u00e8tement notre sant\u00e9.

This old house which must date back over half a century, according to what I was told, was built for one classroom only. To have two classrooms it was necessary a few years ago to divide it with a wooden partition. We can hear from one side what is going on on the other, and it is a continual racket. The building is very old, it is being gradually destroyed by frost, it is insanitary in every way having been built on swampy land. Mr. Agent Tessier told us last year that the necessary amount for the construction of the new school house would be voted at that Session of Parliament. For my part I wish to inform you that it will be impossible to continue to teach here in this building, as we cannot run the risk of contracting serious illness and completely lose our health.

D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister Ste. Anne,\nPointe Bleue,\nQue.\nOttawa, April 3rd, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is hopeful of being able to erect, during the coming summer, a new school building to provide suitable classroom accommodation for the Indian children at Pointe Bleue. I have to request that you will inform the Department at an early date regarding the site on which you would recommend that the building be erected. Is there sufficient ground in connection with the present school on which to erect a new building and provide playground accommodation? The site for a new building should be dry and provide for proper drainage. You will please give as full information as possible regarding the site and area of same.\n\nPlease state how you would recommend that the work in erecting this building be carried out. Could you arrange for the purchase of all material required, after obtaining competitive prices, and have the work carried out as far as possible by Indian labour under the charge of a competent foreman, or would you recommend that tenders be called and the building erected by contract, the contractor to supply all material and labour?\n\nI shall be pleased if you will furnish the information asked for regarding a site and the erection of the building at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. Tessier, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPointe Bleue, Que.\nPointe Bleue, le 30 avril 1926,\n\nM. le Secr\u00e9taire,\nD\u00e9pt des Aff. des Sauvages,\nOttawa -\n\nMonseigneur,\n\nJ'ai r\u00e9cemment re\u00e7u votre lettre du 3 du courant, No. 21-15, m'appr\u00e9ciant l'intention du D\u00e9partement de construire une nouvelle maison d'\u00e9cole \u00e0 Pointe Bleue au cours de l'\u00e9t\u00e9 prochain.\n\nLe site de l'\u00e9cole actuelle est absolument inappropri\u00e9 pour la nouvelle \u00e9cole pr\u00e9vue, parce que l'abri de l'emplacement n'est pas suffisamment grand, le terrain est mauvais et situ\u00e9 trop pr\u00e8s de la ligne du chemin de fer, tellement pr\u00e8s que lorsque la cl\u00f4ture du chemin de fer a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite les ing\u00e9nieurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9s d'y faire un angle afin de ne pas toucher \u00e0 la maison d'\u00e9cole. Elle est aussi entour\u00e9e de petits arbres qui sont un danger en cas o\u00f9 une incendie se d\u00e9clencherait dans l'une d'elles.\n\nApr\u00e8s avoir visit\u00e9 plusieurs endroits, j'ai pris note \u00e0 la conclusion, avec le Chef et tous les membres de la tribu, qui sont de la m\u00eame opinion, que le meilleur site pour l'\u00e9rection de la nouvelle maison d'\u00e9cole \u00e0 Pointe Bleue serait sur une partie du lot 13, voisin de l'\u00e9glise et en ligne avec l'\u00e9glise et le monument des Oublets. C'est un endroit magnifique, situ\u00e9 sur une \u00e9l\u00e9vation d'environ quarante pieds et dominant tout le village inclin\u00e9. Le terrain est sec, absolument plat. Il y a environ deux pieds d'\u00e9paisseur en bonne terre \u00e0 cultiver repr\u00e9sentant une rive, et un plan entre de la rivi\u00e8re. Ce morceau de terre avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9 pour la construction de l'\u00e9glise,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6099, file 325-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nmais elle fut b\u00e2tie sur le terrain occup\u00e9 par les Oblats, soit sur le lot no. 12 ou lot no. 13 m\u00eame terrain de 15 pieds de largeur. Avec deux arbres en profondeur, soit un morceau de terre de 360 x 215 pieds, nous avons suffisamment grand pour une cour de r\u00e9cr\u00e9ation et l'\u00e9tablissement d'un petit jardin scolaire. Les am\u00e9liorations sur ce terrain ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites par les Oblats. J'ai vu le P\u00e8re Buge, le sup\u00e9rieur des Oblats ici \u00e0 ce sujet et il serait pr\u00eat \u00e0 accepter la somme de cent piastres en compensation des am\u00e9liorations, ce qui ne serait certainement pas cher, soit moins de cinquante piastres d'argent pour de la tr\u00e8s bonne terre en culture. Il me dit qu'il devra \u00eatre \u00e9rig\u00e9 beaucoup plus que le prix demand\u00e9 pour faire ces am\u00e9liorations, mais en quoi le but est d'y placer l'\u00e9cole, il n'exigera pas plus. S'il nous fallait placer l'\u00e9cole n'impute o\u00f9 ailleurs et nous devrions payer les am\u00e9liorations d\u00e9j\u00e0 faites et je suis s\u00fbr que l'on exigerait un prix beaucoup plus \u00e9lev\u00e9. Si c'est ainsi que nous ferons de l'argent \u00e0 faire pour attirer l'\u00e9cole, le chemin conduisant \u00e0 l'\u00e9glise sera suffisant. En somme, je crois devoir recommander cet endroit qui est de plus convenable et de plus central que nous puissions trouver. Tout de m\u00eame, il s'accorde \u00e0 dire que c'est un site id\u00e9al pour la construction d'une maison d'\u00e9cole. J'ai recherch\u00e9 un petit croquis que nous trouvons si utile, celui-ci qui vous donne, je l'esp\u00e8re, une id\u00e9e du site propos\u00e9.\n\nJe recommande que cette maison d'\u00e9cole soit construite \u00e0 la jonction de la direction et une rue contigu\u00eb (foreman) et voici pour quelle raison : d'abord, un entrepreneur la construirait avec l'intention de\nde retirer le plus d'argent possible de son entre-\nprise, il ne viserait qu'aux b\u00e9n\u00e9fices \u00e0 un retour\net cela aux d\u00e9pens de la qualit\u00e9 du travail et des\nmat\u00e9riaux \u00e0 employer. Faut-il le plus cons\u00e9quent\ndes entrepreneurs, il fera du \"butching\", m\u00eame malgr\u00e9\nla plus petite attention du surveillant, et s'il anticip\u00e9\nque ses b\u00e9n\u00e9fices ne seront pas aussi forts qu'il s'y\nattendait, il se \"butchira\".\n\nEn supposant m\u00eame que le co\u00fbt de la b\u00e2tie\nserait ainsi \u00e9lev\u00e9 que le prix demand\u00e9 par un entre-\npreneur, le montant du pourcentage de b\u00e9n\u00e9fices serait\nn\u00e9 allant \u00e0 l'entrepreneur, il n'est donc pas une b\u00e2tie\nmais par un travail parfait et une meilleure qualit\u00e9 de\nmat\u00e9riaux. En un mot, l'ouvrage sera mieux fait\nsans tous les rapports, le entrepreneur n'ayant aucun\nprofit \u00e0 retirer sur les mat\u00e9riaux et le main-d'\u0153uvre.\nIl serait facile d'avoir comme entrepreneur un\nbon ouvrier qui tout en travaillant lui-m\u00eame\npourrait conduire l'ouvrage. Tous les mat\u00e9riaux\npourraient \u00eatre achet\u00e9s \u00e0 prix comp\u00e9titif et abro-\ngation des frais et am\u00e9liorer la qualit\u00e9 demand\u00e9e dans\nles instructions, etc., et plus. Cela donnerait\naussi la chance \u00e0 nos indiens de s'assurer un\ngain dans les ouvrages qu'ils auront apr\u00e8s \u00e0 faire,\nsi je ne pense qu'on aurait de l'argent que\ncela va m'apporter, je vous sugg\u00e9rerais de demander\ndes commissions.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre,\n\nMonsieur,\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nA. Perrin\n\nAgent des Sauvages.\nI have only received your letter of May 7th, informing me of the receipt of the Departmental Circular No. 1000 as a new school house at Pointe-\u00e0-la-Croix during the summer.\n\nThe site of the present school is altogether unsuitable for the purpose now desired, because the land is not sufficiently large, the ground is steep and too near the railway line, so near that when the passengers leave the train they have to make an angle so that they would not touch the school house.\n\nThe building itself is surrounded by small houses or shacks which are a constant danger of fire.\n\nAfter having visited several places I came to the conclusion, with the Chief and all the committee of the Tribe, who are of the same opinion, that the best place for the erection of the new school house at Pointe-\u00e0-la-Croix would be just off the road to the Church and in straight line with the Church and the majority of the Ojibwa families. It is a beautiful spot situated on a hill about forty feet high and dominating the whole Indian Village. The ground is dry, sheltered by trees, there is about two feet thick soil and loam with a rock bottom, and this spot is right in the middle of the Reserve. It has been previously chosen for the building of the church, but it was finally built on the grave of the Ojibwa Father, on lot 123. The lot has 13 acres, about 215 feet in width, with a depth of two acres, being a parcel of land 360 x 215. This would be quite sufficient for a play ground and a well laid garden. The improvements on this ground were made by the Ojibwa Father before his death, but the water and a mound occupied the time I was here and therefore I cannot give any information regarding the improvements. They would be rather cheap, being less than $50 per acre for good arable land. He told me that he had seen them much more than the price asked for to make the improvements, but seeing that it was for the erection of the school, he will not ask for more. If we had to place the school anywhere else we would have to pay for the improvements of the land, a much higher price. Then would be no road to build to go to that school, as the church road would be insufficient.\n\nTherefore I believe I must recommend this spot as the most suitable and most central if we can get. Every one here agrees to say that it is an ideal spot for the erection of a school house. I have sketched a small plan which you will find attached herewith and which will give you a better idea of the proposed site.\n\nI would recommend that the school house be built by day labour under the supervision of a good foreman.\nand here are the reasons why, to begin with a contractor would build it to make money, that is to draw as much profit out of his contract as possible, he would look into the benefits he can make to the difference in the quality of the work and materials used. Even if he was the most conscientious contractor, he will be looking in spite of attention to the expenditure and if he sees that he is not making enough money he will hold the whole thing.\n\nSupposing the cost of the building would be just as high then that backed by a contractor, the percentage going to him as a profit, would be put on the building to obtain better work and a superior quality of materials. In our work the work would be better done in every way, the presence being no profits to appear over the materials nor the wages of the labourers. It would be easy to hire or form an a good mechanic who would direct the work while working himself. All the materials could be purchased by tender and specify as specified any of the quality mentioned in the specifications and plans.\n\nThis would also give a chance to our Indians to see something in the kind of work they could do.\n\nIf I was only thinking of the appearance this would give me I would surely recommend that the work be given by contract.\n\nYours etc,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Je devrais remplacer le po\u00eale \u00e0 bois par une fournaise toutes et chauffer en chambre. Cela n\u00e9cessiterait l'achat d'une fournaise, de l'envoyer cinq tonnes de charbon et faire quelques r\u00e9parations, ce qui pourrait co\u00fbter de $150 \u00e0 $75. C'est l\u00e0 le seul moyen efficace pour arriver \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat satisfaisant, car comme je le disais toutefois, donner des cours avant de vacances en janvier est fini.\n\nCette \u00e9cole a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s difficile \u00e0 r\u00e9chauffer.

Quand j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 emprunt\u00e9, j'ai fait faire une remise par un autre homme \u00e0 qui j'ai pay\u00e9 25 ou 35$.

Perron,\nAgent des \u00e9coles.\nTranslation\n\nPointe-Blanc, Dec 10th 1934\n\nSir,\n\nI am forced by circumstances to submit the following report concerning the school house on the reserve at Pointe-Blanc.\n\nThat building is more dilapidated than ever; it is extremely cold, air and wind penetrate from all sides, the stone foundations are cracked, and full of holes which make the floor very cold to the feet. It has moved so much through frost that the glasses were broken.\n\nThe teacher called me at the school a few days ago so that I might find by myself how cold that house is. In fact, by noon, when the stove was heating to its full capacity, all the children and the teacher were suffering from cold. The teacher has warned me they certainly would not continue to teach in that class room during the winter under these conditions. We will have to choose one of the following alternatives: either give a holiday during the months of February, the colder part of the season, and keep the school open during July and August except Summer; or, if you wish to continue the school this winter, to change the kind of heating and have urgent repairs made. The school is heated at present with wood; the stove is lighted at 6 in the morning. The ink in the inkstands is frozen every morning. It would be necessary to make the school habitable, that is to say heated day and night, the wood stove should be replaced by a furnace heater and heater with coal. For this it would be necessary to purchase a furnace for furnace heater and five tons of coal and make certain repairs which would amount to about $150. or $175.\n\nThis is the only way to attain a satisfactory result as I said before, or give two-months holiday during January and February.\nThis school has always been very difficult to heat. Until the 8th November last and for 15 years, I always attended personally to the lighting of the stove in the school and further work I was getting from the Dept. the sum of $25.00. When I was unable to do it I had someone to do it for me for $25 or $35. Last year I did the same thing while when I was unable to perform the work myself, I had somebody to replace me at my own expense. As for the preceding year, I had drawn my accounts for $25.00 in 1925 to the Dept. On the 7th June, under no. 14-21, I received a letter from the Dept., asking me if I had performed the work myself. I immediately replied what is written here above, and I regret to say that I have not yet been paid.\n\nIn spite of all, this fall I continued to light the stove of the school until the 7th November. I could not find anybody who would take the job for less than $20 to $25 for the Winter, which was out of proportion. On the 7th November, Mrs. Wilson, Mary Robertson offered me to light the stove of the school. She has two big boys who can help her. She was asking at first $15.00 per month and finally accepted $6.00 per month, on condition that she should be paid every month or at least every second month. I tried her for one month and found to be quite satisfactory, but it was not of her fault if the school is hard to heat on account of being so dilapidated. Here is the work she has to do; light the stove about 6 o'clock in the morning for the breakfast time and then heat the stove from 7 to 10 o'clock. I imagine herself the stove rooms on Sundays and holidays. I imagine her work is more than fair. I am paying her $6.00 per month for lighting the stove from the 8th November to the 8th December. Also the Account of Proper Supplies for 8\u00bd cords of wood supplied to the school. I will not purchase any other wood before you advise me if you wish to continue the contract next winter and be closer for January and February.\n\nYours etc., (Signed) Leonard Tucker\n\nAgent\nOttawa, December 27th, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, reporting on the condition of the school building at Pointe Bleue and stating that it will be impossible for the teachers to carry on the work without extensive repairs being undertaken.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department agrees with you that it would be advisable to close this school during the months of January and February next rather than incur any large expense in fitting up the building, in view of the fact that, if the necessary funds are provided, it is the intention to erect a new school building.\n\nYou may, therefore, inform the Reverend Sisters that the school is to remain closed during the two above-mentioned months. They should, however, arrange to re-open the school on or about the first of March next and keep it open during July and August following.\n\nWith reference to the caretaking, a cheque to the amount of $6.00 has been sent in favour of Mary Robertson for lighting the fire at this school for the period from November 8th to December 7th, and you may forward a voucher for any further amount due her to the end of the present month. If she will continue this service when the school re-opens, it is considered that the amount of $6.00 per month should be ample remuneration until such time as the new school building is ready for occupation. The Department would pay her monthly upon receipt of a voucher from you for the amount due.\n\nWith reference to the account which you submitted in your own favour for janitor's services covering the period from October 12th, 1925 to May 14th, 1926, I beg to say that, in view of your explanation that you performed this work yourself or, when you were unable to do so, you arranged for someone else to do the work, the Department will pay you for this service for the period mentioned and a cheque for $25.00 will be sent you in the course of the next few days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Dans le rapport de ma comp\u00e9tence en fait de construction, je dois vous dire que je suis un parfait green-hand. Cependant, puisque vous le voulez, je me soumets. J'agirai donc au mieux de mon jugement, de mes connaissances et de mes capacit\u00e9s pour conduire \u00e0 bien cette surveillance, mais l'on ne devra pas exiger de ma part des responsabilit\u00e9s au del\u00e0 de cela.\n\nLorsqu'il s'est agi de la surveillance des travaux de construction de la nouvelle r\u00e9sidence et du bureau de l'Agent des Sauvages ici, j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 mis fort pour exercer une surveillance vigilante de tout instant, la nouvelle b\u00e2tisse \u00e9tant construite \u00e0 cinq pieds de distance de l'ancien bureau.\n\nIl m'a fallu me chicaner \u00e0 plusieurs reprises avec l'entrepreneur pour le faire agir de bonne foi, chicanes qui ont fini d'\u00e9gayer plusieurs fois en combat de boxe. De loin, comme \u00e0 Ottawa, supposons, pareille surveillance para\u00eet simple et facile, mais de pr\u00e8s, ce n'est pas tant \u00e0 fait la m\u00eame chose.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre, humain,\n\nVotre ob. serviteur,\n\nP.

I must say I am a perfect greenhorn. However, since you want me to do it, I will submit it to your orders.\n\nI will therefore act in the best of my judgment, and knowledge as well as of my capacity to conduct this supervision to success but I hope you will not demand from me any responsibility beyond that.\n\nWhile the new residence was built it was harder for me to watch the construction as the old office was just next to it.\n\nI had almost to fight on several occasions with the contractor to make him do the work in a straight manner. We almost came to blows. From a long distance, say Ottawa, this supervision seems simple and easy, but at close range it is not at all the same thing.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Wishing to profit by the good weather he started to work immediately and began the work last Wednesday. With the exception through a solid bed of lime stones.\n\nThe contractor made me remark that there are no recess holes indicated for the lighting and ventilating of the cellar. He also states there is no stair nor any place to put one to go from the interior of the school into the cellar; the drainage system is neglected also. He would like to know as soon as possible if this work should be done before he starts building his forms for the concrete, which will be done during the course of next week. I believe that the building of a door in the foundation for the storing of wood, coal etc. would be useful.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYour truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I must tell you that the company persists in pretending they never received the cheque.\n\nYou will find enclosed herewith the declarations requested by your department for the issue of a duplicate cheque.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent\nPointe-Blanc, 19 octobre 1927\n\nMonsieur,\n\nEn r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 votre lettre du 10 octobre courant, no. 21-15, je dois vous dire que je n'aurais absolument aucune objection \u00e0 recommander \u00e0 ce que la vieille ancienne \u00e9cole, lorsque la nouvelle soit inaugur\u00e9e, \u00e0 ce qu'elle soit mise \u00e0 la disposition des sauvages de Pointe-Blanc pour en faire une salle de conseil, mais je pr\u00e9vois qu'il y aura \u00e0 faire des r\u00e9parations assez consid\u00e9rables pour la mettre dans un \u00e9tat convenable pour servir de salle de conseil. Le toitage en pierre est pratiquement \u00e0 refaire, le bas du carr\u00e9 est pourvu de m\u00eame que les pi\u00e8ces de bois des charpentes, le plancher est enti\u00e8rement fini, la toiture aurait besoin de bardage et la chemin\u00e9e devra aurait \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9e. C'est une vieille maison de bois datant de plus de cinquante ans qui exige une d\u00e9pense d'argent assez consid\u00e9rable pour la remettre en \u00e9tat de service.\n\nEn voyant construire une nouvelle maison d'\u00e9cole plusieurs sauvages m'ont demand\u00e9 si la vieille b\u00e2tisse serait \u00e0 vendre. Je leur ai r\u00e9pondu que oui que plusieurs d'entre eux...\naux voulant l'acheter pour la cl\u00f4ture et en tirer ce qu'il y aurait de bois utilisable, qu'elle serait probablement vendue \u00e0 l'anc\u00eatre pour donner \u00e0 tous la m\u00eame chance de l'acheter.\n\nLe Conseil des Sauvages se r\u00e9unit environ deux ou trois fois par ann\u00e9e, soit \u00e0 mon bureau, soit \u00e0 la maison d'\u00e9cole et je ne vois pas pourquoi ils ne pourraient continuer \u00e0 faire de m\u00eame.\n\nCependant, si nos sauvages veulent absolument garder la vieille maison d'\u00e9cole pour en faire une salle de conseil, je vous sugg\u00e9rerais d'exiger d'eux qu'ils se chargent de la r\u00e9parer, de la restaurer \u00e0 leurs frais, et qu'ils fassent facilement faire par inscription volontaire entre eux, et je suis presque certain qu'ils vont accepter. Autrement, le D\u00e9partement continuera avant longtemps que l'entretien de cette vieille maison sera trop dispendieux par les r\u00e9parations qu'il sera appel\u00e9 \u00e0 y faire \u00e0 tout moment.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre,\nMonsieur,\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\nR. Perrier\nAgent des Sauvages\nThe Secretary\nOffice of Indian Affairs\n\nSir\u2014 In reply to your letter of the 10th October, No. 21-15, I respectfully submit that I would have no objection to recommend that the old school building, after the new one be inaugurated, be left at the disposal of the Indians of Pointe-Blanc to use it as a Council Hall, but I foresee that a great deal of expense will be necessary to put it in good shape.\n\nThe stone foundation practically needs to be rebuilt; the lower part of the frame of the building is rotten as well as the walls. The porch is altogether gone. The roof wants new shingles and the chimney would also need to be repaired.\n\nThis old wooden building is more than 50 years old and would necessitate a considerable expenditure to be put in good shape.\n\nWhen they saw a new schoolhouse was being erected, several Indians asked me if the old building could be put up. I replied them that seeing that many of them wanted to buy the material that could be used again, it would be most likely sold by auction so as to give everybody the same chance to buy.\n\nThe Indian Council meets two or three times a year, either at my office or at the schoolhouse, and I do not see why they could not continue to do so.\n\nHowever, if the Indians do wish to keep the old house there it as a Council House, I would suggest that they take charge of all repairs and work of restoration at their expense, which could easily be done by subscription, I am positive.\nwould accept this proposition. Otherwise\nthe department would find before long that\nthe upkeep of their house and the repairs would\ncost a good deal of money.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) A. Lessin\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, October 29, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, relative to the request of the Indians that the old school building at Pointe Bleue be handed over to be used as a council hall.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in view of the present condition of this old building and the cost involved in repairing same, it is considered that it would be advisable for you to arrange for the sale of same. It is noted that there are a number of Indians who are anxious to obtain this building for the material which it contains, and you should arrange to auction same, and dispose of it to the highest bidder. The person who obtains this building should remove all material and level off the site to your satisfaction. The money received for the sale of the building should be forwarded by you to the Department for credit of the Receiver General. We note that the Indians can very well use either your or ice or the new school building for the holding of their council meetings on the two or three times each year which they meet. As soon as all material which may be useful is moved from the old school building to the new school, you should arrange for the sale of the old school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Emile Plombe. Il y a certainement pas pr\u00e8s de $3,000.00 d'ouvrage et de mat\u00e9riaux vendus sur les lieux de construction. L'excavation, les fondations en b\u00e9ton pour 60 pieds de longueur, 34 pieds de largeur et 8 pieds de hauteur sont toutes termin\u00e9es. La charpente en bois avance rapidement. Un char complet de bois de construction venant de Qu\u00e9bec est arriv\u00e9 la semaine derni\u00e8re pour l'entrepreneur. Le bois est rendu sur la place des travaux o\u00f9 il y a une assez grande quantit\u00e9 d'autres en provenance. Les portes et charpentes doivent arriver d'un fournisseur \u00e0 l'autre.\n\nVoudriez-vous bien me dire, si c'est possible, quel syst\u00e8me de chauffage vous avez l'intention d'installer dans cette b\u00e2tisse et nous indiquer o\u00f9 les tuyaux de tuyaux dans la chemin\u00e9e devront \u00eatre plac\u00e9s? Je crois que je ne\nescalier \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de cette b\u00e2tisse pour descendre \u00e0 la cave n'aurait pas sa raison d'\u00eatre.

There is surely for $300.00 worth done and of material on the premises. The excavation for the concrete foundations 60 ft. in width by 34 ft. depth and a height of 8 ft. is completed. The wood framing is rapidly growing up. A whole car of timber arrived last week from Quebec for this construction. This timber is now on the ground where a large quantity of material was previously delivered; the doors and windows will arrive shortly.\n\nWill you tell me, if possible, which system of heating you intend to install in this building and also indicate where the pipe holes in the chimney are to be located? Do you not believe it would be well to place a stair inside of the building to go down the cellar. The cellar is extremely large and could be used for several purposes.

C'est un M. Adelard Leclerc. \u00c0 la r\u00e9ception de votre lettre, je l'ai fait venir \u00e0 mon bureau pour qu'il me remette ses prix. Il m'a demand\u00e9 un plan de la maison d'\u00e9cole pour montrer \u00e0 sa compagnie. Je lui ai en effet un. Il est revenu au bureau hier une copie de deux croquis d'installation pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par les ing\u00e9nieurs de la compagnie.\n\nVoici les travaux ci-joint. Le prix qu'il demande pour une \"New Idea\", dernier mod\u00e8le, d'une capacit\u00e9 suffisante pour donner un chauffage de premi\u00e8re classe est de cinq cents piastres, tout compris, tuyaux, r\u00e9gulateur et compresseur install\u00e9 dans l'\u00e9cole, pr\u00eat \u00e0 chauffer. L'entreprise Plamondon ne tient pas \u00e0 faire l'installation de la fournieuse lui-m\u00eame, ne demande pas mieux que ce contrat soit accord\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre.

His name is Mr. Edward Leclerc. At the receipt of your letter I called him at my office so as to submit a tender. He asked me for a plan of the school house to send to his company. I made him a copy. He came back to my office yesterday with a plan prepared by the engineers of the company. You will find enclosed herewith the price he is asking for a \"New Idea\" latest model, of sufficient capacity to give first class heating, being $500.00, with all necessary supplies, pipes, registers and completely installed in the school, ready to heat.\n\nThe contractor Leclerc did not care to install the furnace himself, and is just as satisfied to see it done by somebody else. He told me yesterday that the price asked by Leclerc was very reasonable for the complete installation as mentioned of \"New Idea\" furnace. For that price he supplies everything; furnace, pipes, hot and cold air ducts of the sizes required, with installation made by competent mechanics.\n\nIt will only be necessary to light it to have heat.\n\nKindly return to me the attached sketches after you have examined them. I promised to return them to Mr. Leclerc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n[Signature]\nAgent\n\nIndian Affairs.

P.\nPoveshell, Dec 22, 1927\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your letter of the 23rd Nov. last, No. 21-1-5 concerning the installation of a hot air furnace in the new Indian school at Poveshell. I would say that after I met the agent who \"knew best\" and submitted a tender for $500.00, I had better take note of Mr. Gurney's local agent of the Supreme furnaces of Port Hope, Ontario. He was accompanied by Mr. Cote, general salesman of the same company. The \"Supreme\" furnace is certainly superior in every way to the \"New Idea\" for our district. It is best adapted to our climate. A large number of these furnaces have been installed at St. John in the last few years where they appear perfectly satisfactory. A large number of schools in this district as well as public buildings and private residences have \"Supreme\" furnaces.\n\nI telephoned to four or five different persons to know if their furnaces were giving satisfaction; they all told me they were perfectly satisfied. I went to see one myself at St. Anne and was amazed by its simplicity and the ease with which it can be handled. This furnace is economizing fuel. The \"Ideal\" furnace sells for $500.00 while the Supreme furnace of Port Hope of Ontario, costs $466.29.\n\nI therefore recommend the purchase of a \"Supreme\" furnace for the new Indian school at Poveshell.\n\nYours etc.,\n(Signed) A.

Pierre Duval pour le percage d'un puits art\u00e9sien pour la nouvelle \u00e9cole des sauvages de Pointe-Bleue. La premi\u00e8re eau a \u00e9t\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 153 pieds de profondeur. Le puits a \u00e9t\u00e9 creus\u00e9 \u00e0 cinq pieds de plus, soit 158 pieds, pour s'assurer un service d'eau suffisant. \u00c0 l'essai qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pendant quatre heures cons\u00e9cutives en pr\u00e9sence de quelques conseillers de la tribu qui \u00e9taient l\u00e0 aussi lorsque la profondeur en a \u00e9t\u00e9 mesur\u00e9e, le puits n'a pas donn\u00e9 moins de cent gallons \u00e0 l'heure. L'eau \u00e9tait propre et une heure plus tard elle \u00e9tait purifi\u00e9e de nouveau, et cela pendant quatre heures. Il y a plusieurs puits art\u00e9siens \u00e0 Pointe-Bleue et ce puits de l'\u00e9cole est l'un de ceux qui donnent le plus fort rendement d'eau \u00e0 l'heure.\n\nIl a \u00e9t\u00e9 perc\u00e9 \u00e0 environ 4/5 pieds des fondations de l'\u00e9cole. Pour mettre la pompe qui sera install\u00e9e, de quelque syst\u00e8me que ce soit, \u00e0 l'abri de la gel\u00e9e, il faudra n\u00e9cessairement une alc\u00f4ve communiquant avec la cave et o\u00f9 la chaleur donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la cave par la pompe ne pourra s'introduire, comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour le syst\u00e8me de pompage \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence de l'agent et qui donne la plus enti\u00e8re satisfaction sous tous les rapports. J'ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l'entrepreneur \u00c9mile Plouffe quel prix il exigeait pour faire cette alc\u00f4ve. Il m'a dit que oui que tout son entourage pour faire le b\u00e9ton \u00e9tait encore sur place il serait pr\u00eat \u00e0 faire cette alc\u00f4ve en b\u00e9ton pour la somme de $123,00.

Perrin\n\nAgent des Sauvages\nIn accordance with your letter of the 15th of October last, No. 21-1-5, I am forwarding the account of Mr. Pierre Davel for the boring of the artesian well for the new Indian School at Pointe-Blanc. The first time water was struck it was at a depth of 183 feet. The well was drilled 5 feet more, 188 feet to be sure of sufficient supply. At the trial which was made for some consecutive hours in presence of the Commissioners of the Tribe, who were there also when the depth was measured, the well gave 100 gallons per hour. The water was pumped and then again an hour later. This repeated for 4 hours. There are several wells at Pointe-Blanc and this one is among those giving the largest quantity of water per hour.\n\nIt was drilled at a distance of about 4\u00bd feet from the school walls. To have the pump which will be installed, no matter what system it is, clear from frost, it will be necessary to have an above adjoining the cellar where the basement of the cellar can circulate, as it was done at the Agent's residence, and which is giving entire satisfaction. I asked the contractor, Mr. Smith, how much he would charge to build the above. He told me that as all his work to make the concrete was still in the shop, he would be ready to build it for $125.00. This above would be 7' x 6' x 6' - the walls to be 12\" thick with a round top of reinforced concrete. There will be in the roof an opening to be closed by 3 steps so as to get the top of the pump out. I do not\nI know how the contractor calculated his price but I find it is really very low.\n\nI forgot to tell you the water in the well is reaching only about 50 ft. from the surface, like most of the wells around here. Several hand pumps were installed here and they are easily pumping the water from a depth of 15 and 80 feet without necessitating too much strength. A child could operate it with ease. I know that Mr. Adams installed one of these pumps at the Hudson's Bay Co. and another at Mr. Robinson and they are perfectly satisfied. It works very well.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We trust that this, combined with Mr.Ally's letters, will enable you to decide what course to follow in regard to the desks and other supplies that may be needed.\n\nYours very truly\n\nTHE GEO. M. HENDRY CO. Limited\n\nM/B  \nSecretary-Treasurer\nOttawa, February 6th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nIt will, no doubt, be necessary to supply school desks and teachers' desks and chairs for the new Indian day school building at Pointe Bleue, and I have, therefore, to request that you will take up this matter with the teachers and inform the Department as to the number and size of the desks required, in order that quotations can be received for the supplying of same. For your information, I may say that desks are manufactured in the following sizes:\n\n| No. | Size          |\n|-----|--------------|\n| 1   | Adults       |\n| 2   | Pupils 15 to 18 Yrs. |\n| 3   | 12 to 15     |\n| 4   | 9 to 14      |\n| 5   | 7 to 10      |\n| 6   | 5 to 8       |\n\nThe desks we supply are the single school desks. In stating the number of desks required, you should be careful to state only the number of each size absolutely necessary.\n\nIt is advisable, in the seating arrangements, that each row of desks be of the same size, with a front and rear seat, and in estimating the number of desks required this should be kept in mind. You should also state the number of teachers' desks and chairs required, and you should have the teachers prepare a requisition for any classroom material, such as text books, scribblers, exercise books, lead pencils, pens, etc., required.\n\nIn giving the information asked for regarding the desks, you should state when the new school will be ready for occupation, and when the desks should be delivered. You should also give full shipping directions. Your early reply will oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA.

In this connection I beg to say that it will be necessary to obtain prices from a number of dealers and, as we hope to call for prices in the near future, you will, at that time, be given an opportunity to quote.\n\nRelative to the classroom equipment as mentioned in your letter, I beg to say that our regulations require that this be ordered through the Government Stationery Office, here.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

If desired, we can supply the wood parts finished all cherry, or in a rich walnut color.\n\nOne inkwell is supplied in each pupil's desk. This is made with a nickel plated pressed steel housing and a removable glass ink container. A hinged top is fitted so as to keep the ink fresh and clean.\n\"Preston\" Ball-Bearing Automatic Single Desk\n\nThe \"B.B.A.,\" as it is popularly designated, contains no adjustable features and represents the type in general use. It will be noted that the substantial iron standards are smoothly finished, and scroll work has been entirely eliminated to prevent collection of dust.\n\nThe only moving part is the seat, which operates on ball bearings so arranged that noise is reduced to an absolute minimum, and, even after many years of use, the seat hinge is prevented from sloping forward when pushed down.\n\nMaterial: Maple.\n\nFinish: Cherry top; natural back and seat.\n\n| Size | Height of Seat inches | Height of Top of Desk from Floor inches | Width of Top inches | Length of Top inches | Floor Space inches | Approx.

Too much care in its selection cannot be exercised, because the expenditure so represented not only constitutes a large sum, but the purchase must be made from a viewpoint of true economy. This is seldom accomplished if price becomes the chief consideration, and the idea that should always be uppermost is to obtain seating which will give the maximum amount of service at ultimate minimum cost.\n\n\"PRESTON\" DESKS\n\nare constructed to last a lifetime of hard use, with small, if any, expense for maintenance. The wood parts are of clear, hard maple, locked firmly together by dovetailed (not merely tongued and grooved) joints, glued, and finished in high-grade manner. The iron standards are exceptionally heavy, providing that measure of strength and rigidity so necessary in a schoolroom.\n\nThousands of educational institutions throughout the Dominion are already equipped with \"Preston\" Desks and the thorough satisfaction they are giving is fully proved by the ever-increasing demand.\n\nIn the following pages will be found particulars of the different styles we can supply and each is accompanied by a table of sizes. In connection with the latter, it should be noted that ages of children accommodated are only approximate, based on general average. Some variations may, therefore, be necessary to take care of abnormal pupils. For guidance, we give a diagram showing how heights of seats and desks are measured, and this should be carefully followed to avoid errors.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, all desks are supplied \"knocked down,\" i.e., in pieces for assembly after delivery. To many customers, it is a great convenience to have their requirements shipped \"set up,\" ready to screw to floor of room. When so desired, this work of assembling will be done at the factory for a small additional sum.\n\nPrices do not include Forwarding Charges and are Subject to Change Without Notice.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\n**OFFICE OF THE PURCHASING AGENT**\n\nOttawa, Feb. 29, 1928.\n\nReq.

Chene,\nDepartmental Engineer\n\nWe herewith submit our specifications and estimate for a Gasoline Engine Driven, Deep Well Pump for the new School at Point Blue Lake, St. John, Que.\n\n1 #941 \"Duro\" Deep Well Pump, Capacity 165 Gallons per Hour.\n\n1 1-1/2 Horse Power Gasoline Engine.\n\n1 30\" x 6' (215 Gal.)

Regular Length 4 ft. and a charge of $.1.65 is made for each additional foot over the four feet.\nMarch 9, 1926.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS FOR PUMP\n\nLUBRICATION\nPerfect lubrication of the \"piston type\" cross-head is a Patented and exclusive Duro feature. Porous plugs in the cylindrical crosshead permit an even automatic oil flow. This feature is fool-proof and eliminates the possibility of excess lubrication.\n\nOILING\nEach of the bearings (including the connecting rod) has its own oil reservoir with wool waste circulating system. This is an exclusive Duro Feature eliminating troublesome grease cups with a loss of lubrication through grease squeezing out. It eliminates manual lubrication as there are no grease cups.\n\nCRANK SHAFT\nThe Duro one-piece, high-carbon, drop-forged ground steel crankshaft is of the center-throw type hung on two phosphor bronze bearings, insuring higher efficiency.\n\nDIFFERENTIAL\nThe Duro differential eliminates the necessity of the stuffing box. This principle results in an even motor load and an even flow of water, as it pumps on both up and down strokes. That's why Duro Deep Well Pumps are so quiet and efficient.\n\nLOWER CYLINDER\nIs of the open type allowing the lower Valve and Plunger to withdraw without destroying the Drop Pipe or Cylinder.\n\nCOMPACTNESS\nDuro Deep Well Pumps require very little room. They are easily gotten at from all sides. The motor is up high and away from all possible dampness. The square base permits setting pump head in any direction.\n\nCHAIN DRIVE\nThe Chain Drive is standard on Duro Deep Well Pumps. There are no worm gears to reduce efficiency.\n\nQUIET\nDuro construction eliminates noise. The plunger leathers are especially treated for long life and to minimize friction, thus preventing overload.\n\nSAFE\nThe pump mechanism is totally enclosed in one rigid casting, fully protected and guarded.\nMarch 9, 1928.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS FOR GASOLINE ENGINE\n\nSIZE 1-1/2 Horse Power\nIGNITION High tension magneto\nTYPE Horizontal Water cooled\nCYLINDER Hutto ground\nBEARINGS Die cast and removable.\nFUEL Gasoline (can be equipped for Kerosene at an extra cost of $5.00)\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES\n\nThe Pump and Engine are both mounted on a Cast Iron Container Base.\n\nThe Pump can, at any time, be converted into an Electric Motor Driven Unit.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nEMPIRE BRASS MFG.

(RG 10, Volume 6099, file 325-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe hearty welcome received last year about the school at Pointe-Blanc brings me back to you for the same cause.\n\nI believe it is my duty to inform the Department of Indian Affairs that I am convinced they ignore concerning this school, as the real state of affairs is pitiful. I know the legitimate ambition of the Department concerning the schools under its control and I dare rely on its devotion to have this warning taken into consideration.\n\nThe old school, which had to be closed during January and February 1927, is no more habitable than it was then.

We had agreed with Mr. Leclair who was supervising the work, to have the tank 9 feet square and 9 feet deep and the length of the sewer to have its outlet on the slope so as to give it the proper slanting would be about 125 feet. There must be a border to allow the water to run out as this is done in the rock and it can not be covered; this is quite necessary. I am very much disturbed in my work as you must have heard that Mr. Leclair died Saturday night. For several weeks past I was unable to do anything with him as he could not put his mind to it. He spoke to me of different things, the fence, some cupboards, the W.C., the boiler in the living quarters, also the coal bin. He also wanted me to install the pump and make a ladder to aid the ventilator and which might be used in case of fire. He made me wait for all the others, which were all to be paid at the same time.\n\nNow concerning your telegram it would be a matter of one thousand dollars ($1000.00) including the supply of all the wood, pipes and other necessary articles.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSt-Prime\nApril 23, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, advising me of the cost of the proposed sewage disposal system for the new school at Pointe Bleue.

This additional work will amount to approximately $300.00 including the plumbing work and fittings.\n\nAs to the cupboards and other furniture for the school, I would suggest that the Sister in charge of the school be requested to submit a list of same, and they can be purchased readymade from a local firm at Roberval.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nMay 6, 1928.\n\nMEMORANDUM: Mr. [signature]\n\nWhile at Pointe Bleue last week I made an inspection, in company with Mr. Plourde, the contractor, of the new school building lately completed on this reserve. The building appears to be well constructed, - the blackboards, however, have been installed above the wainscoting which is much too high for the younger pupils, and I consequently authorized the contractor to build raised platforms wherever required by the Sisters. As the school will be occupied within a few days the contractor was also requested to erect temporary outside closets.\n\nOwing to the constant presence of water in the basement of this building it will be necessary that the drainage and sewerage systems be immediately installed. The work will consist in the laying of 125 feet of 6\" vitrified drain pipe, and the construction of a concrete septic tank, with an outlet into the ditch along the railway track, all of which will cost in the neighborhood of $1,000.00. I would recommend if this work is authorized that it be entrusted to Mr. Plourde, the contractor for this building, who is willing to undertake it for the price mentioned. I may say that the excavation for this work will have to be done entirely in solid rock. Of course this matter can stand should the appointment of a permanent agent be made in the course of a short time.\n\nIt is also necessary to install in the basement of the school two or three water closets and one wash basin.\nQUEBEC DISTRICT.\n\nPointe Bleue, Que.,\nApril 29th, 1928.\n\nThe Officer Commanding,\nR.C.M.P., Police,\nMontreal, Que.,\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to copy of letter to Mr. A. Tessier, Indian Agent, Pointe Bleue, Que (since deceased) from the Department of Indian Affairs, dated March 27th, copy of which I attach hereto, I have the honour to report that I was approached by members of the council in connection with the disposal of the old school. I was told that Mr. Tessier had received instructions to have the building sold by auction and removed off the ground on which it is erected, this land being the property of one, Berd\u00e9e Robertson.\n\nThis old building is now empty, the school equipment having been removed to the new building, and the old building now has no caretaker. On my arrival I noticed that several windows were broken.\n\nMight I be advised, please, if anything is to be done in this matter.\n\nSome of the members of the reserve have complained that their children could not attend school.\n\nOn the afternoon of the 27th inst. I interviewed the principal, Soeur Aime de Jesus, who informed me that she and the other teacher were ready to start school, but the new school building was not completed, no lavatories for the boys and girls having yet been installed.\n\nMrs. Tessier, widow of deceased Indian Agent, corroborated this, and added that she did not know if any arrangement was made for the construction of same.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n(sgd) I.

Poirier\nSir,\n\nI feel words to give you some details on the construction of the coal bin, which may have appeared expensive. Yet there is no exaggeration; I did not charge for the 3 steps on each side of the hall, also a trap to climb on the roof, and the hot air registers which I had to replace in wood. As for the cistern tank which I did without authorization, I must say it was unavoidable as I had laid the sewer pipe and the water from the water closet was running back into the cellar. I knew the department was to have the work done so I took upon myself to do the work as you already had my price on hand. I am justified in having done this work which was urgent.\n\nThe ground should be levelled now as it looks very bad in its present state. If you wish to authorize me to do the work by day labour I am ready to undertake it.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSt. Pierre. June 24th 1828\nMEMORANDUM: School Branch\n\nWhile at Pointe Bleue last week I made another inspection of the new school building in company with the Acting Indian Agent, and beg to furnish you with the following information concerning the above mentioned building.\n\nThe raised platform supplied by the contractor as an extra to enable the younger pupils to use the blackboards in the classrooms, is entirely unsatisfactory and it is understood with the contractor that these shall be taken away from the building and that no payment will be claimed for this additional work.\n\nI would suggest that new steps be built by a competent carpenter during the coming holidays, in accordance with the sketch which the superior has agreed to furnish, if authorized to do so.\n\nThe double door at the rear entrance was broken down by the wind. This door should be re-adjusted and provided with a suitable cylinder lock at the expense of the Department. The registers for the intake of the cold air in connection with the hot air heating system, have been adjusted in the floor in a permanent manner. It will be necessary that these be taken out and re-adjusted with screws so that they may be removed for the cleaning of the galvanized iron box underneath them, where dust and waste paper have accumulated.\nI may add that I was surprised to find a number of labourers engaged in the levelling of the ground in the front of the school building and upon further inquiry to be advised that the contractor had completed the construction of the sewage disposal system in the manner outlined in his tender for this work, already on file. I subsequently endeavoured to locate Mr. Plourde, the contractor, who is working at Kenogami, and he explained to me that the sewage work was undertaken to prevent the renewal of the flooding of the basement of the building, where a hot-air heating system is installed. He was under the impression that this course would be sanctioned by the Department in view of the urgent need of the work being carried out.\n\nI beg to suggest that the Agent be requested to further investigate this matter and advise the Department whether it would be justified in giving its approval to the action taken by the contractor concerning the above mentioned work. In the affirmative, the Department should be furnished with the Voucher giving an accurate detailed statement of the amount and nature of the work performed, and the rate of payment should not exceed that mentioned in the offer already made by the contractor.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nJuly 4, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 14th of June, concerning certain repairs and additional work required at the Day School at Pointe Bleue, I beg to request that you arrange with a competent carpenter to have raised platforms or steps installed where required in the new classrooms, in accordance with sketches which the Rev. Sr. Superior has agreed to furnish. You should also arrange to have the double door at the rear entrance put in a state of repair, and a cylinder lock installed in the permanent door of this entrance.\n\nThe registers for the intake of cold air in connection with the hot air heating system, which have been installed and adjusted permanently in the floors of the classrooms should be taken out and readjusted with screws so that they may be removed whenever necessary for the cleaning of the galvanized iron boxes underneath, where it has been noticed that dust and waste paper has already accumulated. The work should be done as economically as possible under your supervision and you should furnish the Department with vouchers in duplicate stating in detail the amount and nature of the work performed.\n\nWith reference to the sewage disposal system which I am advised has just been completed by Mr. Flourde, the contractor for the building, without any authority from the Department, I have to request that you fully investigate this matter and advise whether the completion of the sewer and septic tank was absolutely necessary and if the Department would be justified in giving its approval to the action taken by the contractor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. de la Boissiere, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nPointe Bleue, Que.\nOttawa, July 5th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have also to acknowledge receipt of the enclosed accounts. The Department is not aware as to whom these supplies were for. It is thought that these goods were obtained for the use of the Sister Superior at Pointe Bleue and that the account should be paid by her. They are returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier.\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nA. de la Boissiere, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPointe Bleue, P. Q.\nFeinte Bleue, 9th July 1928\n\nSir:\n\nReference your letter 103-21 Dated July 5th.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that I have been authorised by your letter No. 21-1-5 to buy prizes for the pupils before the school closes for the summer holidays.\n\nAs the invoices which you have returned to me was the account for those prizes I am enclosing them again with this letter.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nActing Indian Agent\n| S\u00e9rie AA \u00e0 .95 | 2.85 |\n|---------------|------|\n| (Il ne restait plus un seul cartonn\u00e9) | |\n| Fabiola | 1.65 |\n| (S\u00e9rie AB \u00e9puis\u00e9e) | |\n| S\u00e9rie 31 \u00e0 .70 | 2.80 |\n| S\u00e9rie 6C | .75 |\n| (S\u00e9rie 2A \u00e9puis\u00e9e) | |\n| S\u00e9rie 22 \u00e0 .40 | 1.20 |\n| (Lourdes racont\u00e9...\u00e9puis\u00e9) | |\n| Les Ouvriers de la Moisson | .35 |\n| S\u00e9rie 42 \u00e0 .30 | 1.80 |\n| S\u00e9rie 44 \u00e0 .25 | 1.25 |\n| 8 volumes \u00e0 .35 | 2.80 |\n| (Collection Lilas \u00e9puis\u00e9e) | |\n| S\u00e9rie 63 \u00e0 .15 | .90 |\n| S\u00e9rie 6A \u00e0 .10 | .80 |\n| 20 S\u00e9rie 81 \u00e0 .06 | 1.20 |\n| (S\u00e9rie 7A \u00e9puis\u00e9e) | |\n| S\u00e9rie 82 \u00e0 .05 | 1.20 |\n| (S\u00e9rie 8A \u00e9puis\u00e9e) | |\n| Vie des Saints | .60 |\n| Remise | .15 |\n| 1 Volume (Les Arts) | $20.00 |\n\nFrais d'express $2.15\n\nExp\u00e9dition faite par express, la caisse sera descendue \u00e0 Pointe-Bleue.\n\nToute facture est payable le 10 du mois qui suit, au plus tard, par ch\u00e8que accept\u00e9 et au pair, apr\u00e8s quoi nous recouvrions par traite.\n\nIndian Affairs.

[signature]\n\nHas No. 63 been paid?\n\nIf not it should now be paid.\n\n[signature]\nAn Exclusive Emco Process\n\nAll the metal entering into the manufacture of Emco products is melted in electric furnaces. In all other methods of melting the fuel used requires the use of oxygen or air for combustion, and even though every precaution is taken, the air or oxygen is bound to come in contact with the heated metal and unite with it, forming oxides of zinc, tin or lead, which, when the metal is poured, tends to make a porous casting.\n\nIn the electric furnace the presence of air or oxygen is entirely unnecessary, and the charge is melted under air sealed conditions, so that no oxidization whatever occurs.\n\nSilence Where It Is Mostly Needed\n\nThe bathroom is generally conceded to be the last place in the house that should advertise its presence with unnecessary noise and the closet is usually the worst offender in this regard.\n\nThis is an effective remedy for this condition in the new Emco \"Hush\" Float Valve, the outstanding features of which are enumerated over leaf. This valve, in common with all other Emco products, is the result of scientific design, highest quality materials and precision workmanship\u2014a guarantee of lasting service and satisfaction.\nImprovements in the new Emco 'Hush' Float-Valve\n\n1. A removable axis pin held in place with a simple locking device. A slight turn of the bent projecting end and the pin is withdrawn, facilitating rapid removal of valve plunger. No inaccessible screws to be removed.\n\n2. The cam contact point is at a minimum distance from the axis of the fulcrum of the float arm. This increases the leverage of the arm and exerts the maximum force, keeping the plunger tightly down on the valve seat.\n\n3. A channel designed to collect and divert to the delivery pipe any water forced past the plunger head, obviating the necessity of any cup leathers which have a tendency to make the plunger stick.\n\n4. Outlet for refill tube so designed as to ensure delivery of the proper amount of water to the bowl during the time the valve is operating.\n\n5. The spiral groove\u2014the feature that contributed, the \"hush\" sound to the name of the valve and that effectively ensures silent operation. The action of the groove is based on the fact that the water, coming up to allow a circumferential path up the plunger, is subjected to a centrifugal action which has the positive effect of eliminating the singing noise of the old type valve.\n\n6. A cushioned rubber disc, secured by a threaded collar, which facilitates rapid removal and replacement and ensures positive seating.\n\n7. A reversible gate metal seat with the consequent advantage of a double life. Quickly reversed or replaced by unscrewing the union nut. This seat is supplied with two different-sized holes\u2014larger sized hole for medium and low pressures; smaller sized hole for high pressures.\n\nThe EMPIRE BRASS MFG. CO.

The account covering the cost of these desks was forwarded to Mr. Tessier, but was not certified in the usual manner and forwarded to the Department for payment.

He cannot show any letters of authorisation from the Department nor of any other employes. And in consequence I believe that he never was authorised to do this work. Mr. Plourde expect to go to Ottawa in a few days.\n\nAlso I like to mention that the work done is well made and that it was necessary.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nROBERVAL, P.

After giving this question due consideration I would suggest that the Department authorize the Indian agent to purchase in Roberval - one ordinary low down closet, also one enamel wall wash basin and arrange to have them installed at once where designated in the private toilet room for the use of the teachers. I would also ask to be authorized to order personally from the local agent of the Thomas Robertson Co. one battery of two enamelled iron range closets, with an ordinary flushing tank instead of that mentioned in the form of tender above referred to.\n\nThis equipment will be much more economical and easier to maintain in good working order. My reason for placing this order with the firm of Thomas Robertson Co. is that they quoted the lowest price on the articles described on the tender form.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nMontreal, Dec 18th\n\nNo.\n\nShip to\n\nAddress\n\nShip via\n\nTerms\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER\n\n[Handwritten text]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nAccounts paid to agent in cash for\n\n1.

Deputy & Secretary.\n\nAchille de la Boissiere, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPointe Bleue, Que.\nDecember 4, 1928.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThere has been considerable correspondence with reference to an account of Emile Plourde of St. Prime, Que., who was the contractor for the Pointe Bleue Indian Day School, erected last year. During the late Agent Tessier's illness, Mr. Plourde understood that he was to put in the drain and septic tank. The work was done on a cost plus 10% basis and amounts to $980.46. There was no written authority; but, as both Mr. Indian Agent Boissiere and myself are satisfied that it was necessary and that the work was well done, I have to recommend that the account be paid. I may add that I have inspected the work since its completion, and I find that the heavy labour cost is because the pipe and tank had to be laid in solid rock.\n\nMr. Plourde has a further account with the Department, which is in order, for repairing, setting up and aligning on strips the school desks and for supplying and installing the fixtures in the cloak rooms. This second account amounts to $285.95.\n\nDepartmental Engineer.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Je l'ai travaill\u00e9 avec un broche, celle-ci s'est pendue \u00e0 une vingtaine de pieds en dehors du mur, c'est \u00e0 cette place qu'il y a un obstacle.\n\nIl faudrait creuser une tranch\u00e9e \u00e0 cet endroit, ce qui peut co\u00fbter, avec les frais du plombier qui d\u00e9g\u00e8le ce tuyau, environ $50.00 piastres.\n\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'il y a encore 3 mois de classe avant la fin de l'ann\u00e9e scolaire, voulez-vous, s.v.p., me donner une autorisation pour faire faire ces travaux.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre, monsieur, votre humble serviteur,\n\n[signature]\n\nAgent des Sauvages.\n\nLe Secr\u00e9taire\nD\u00e9partement des Affaires Indiennes\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIt is my duty to warn you about the sewer pipe at the school at Pointe-Blanc is frozen. I tried to work it up with a wire, it went to about twenty feet from the wall, that is where there is an obstacle.\n\nIt would be necessary to dig a ditch at that place, and that would cost with the plumbers time about $50.00\n\nConsidering that there is still 3 months of school before the end of the year, they have asked me to authorize me to have this work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. de la Boissiere\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 17, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, informing the Department that the sewer pipe at the Pointe Bleue Indian Day School is frozen.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may arrange to have the ditch at the point where the pipe is frozen dug up and the section of pipe which is blocked taken up and the obstruction removed. It is considered that the labour in opening the ditch at the point where the pipe is frozen and the taking up of the section of pipe and replacing same by a new section, if required, should not cost the amount mentioned. It is thought that all this work could be carried out for an amount not exceeding approximately $25. However, you should arrange to have the drain pipe placed in good condition, keeping all expenses for the purpose as low as possible.

Il a fallu aussi remplacer un bout de tuyau qui \u00e9tait cass\u00e9.\n\nJe tout pour le moment donne un bon service.\n\nJe profite de la circonstance pour vous dire qu'il faudrait absolument durant l'hiver faire faire des travaux \u00e0 ce canal d'\u00e9go\u00fbt qui a une longueur de 150 pas, c'est le troisi\u00e8me hiver qu'il g\u00e8le \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e0 la m\u00eame date. J'ai fait l'automne dernier, barreter quelques voyures de terre esp\u00e9rant emp\u00eacher la gel\u00e9e, cela n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 un succ\u00e8s. Pour moi je crois que le tuyau est trop petit, avant de 4 pas sur cela commence par boucher avant de geler, il en faudrait un de 5 pas; puis le canal a des places n'a que 4 pas de profondeur et cela demanderait pour le mettre plus profond de 8 pas faire faire du sillage sur toute la longueur car c'est sur le roc, il faudrait aussi recouvrir ce canal avec une bonne \u00e9paisseur de brin de soie, etc. Cela peut co\u00fbter approximativement $500.00 pour ces travaux.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre, monsieur, votre humble serviteur,\n\nA de la Boissi\u00e8re\n\nAgent des Sauvages.\n\nLe Secr\u00e9taire,\nD\u00e9partement des Affaires Indiennes.\nOttawa.\nPointe-Blanc, Oct. 25th 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI have attached herewith four statements of accounts for the amount of $61.00 for materials and labour for the repairs during Feb. 1931 to the sewer of the Indian School at Pointe-Blanc.\n\nThis sewer was blocked and frozen, which was causing bad odors and having no outside pipe it was urgent to act immediately. It was also necessary to replace a piece of the pipe which was broken.\n\nI give for the present moment good service.\n\nI take this opportunity to tell you that it will be absolutely necessary during this Summer to have the work to this sewer done on a length of about 120 ft., it is the third time (or fourth) it freezes about the same date. I had done half done earth covered hoping this would prevent frost, this was not a success. Personally I think the pipe is too small being only 8 inches, as it flows fast and they hopes it should be 10 inches in size. Furthermore the pipe is layered only 6 ft. deep at certain places and it would be necessary to plant on the whole length as it is all through rock. It would also be necessary to have the whole duct covered with a fair thickness of saw dust. This work would cost approximately $200.00.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir, your humble servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent\nMarch 5, 1931.\n\nSCHOOL,\n\nWith reference to Indian Agent De la Boissiere's letter of the 25th ultimo hereunder, recommending payment of an account amounting to $61.10 for materials and labour furnished for the repairing of the sewer pipe last month from the Indian School at Pointe Bleue, I beg to say that this sewer pipe was laid in a trench excavated in solid rock with great difficulty. I believe that the reason why it freezes at different points is due to the fact that the ground over its course was lowered when the playground was levelled, after the completion of the sewerage system. In order to avoid further expenditure in connection with this sewer pipe I would recommend that the whole trench be excavated this spring and that the pipe be replaced by a vitrified clay pipe 6\" in diameter and that the ground be lowered as much as possible, so that the pipe would be at a depth of 6 feet. The trench should then be filled with earth to a minimum height of 4 feet on top and around the pipe. The cost of the work would be approximately $180.00.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nOttawa, March 7, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, enclosing accounts to the total amount of $61.10 for material and labour in carrying out repairs to the sewer at the Pointe Bleue Indian Day School. In reply I have to say that, as our funds for the balance of the present fiscal year are entirely exhausted, payment of these accounts cannot be made until after April 1st, next.\n\nIt is noted that the sewer is now giving good service, but that you recommend the trench in which the pipe is laid be reopened and deepened during the coming summer and a new pipe of larger dimensions laid. It is doubtful if funds for this purpose can be provided. It is considered that, if precautions are taken by the teachers to see that the pupils do not put extraneous matter in the toilets, there would be little danger of the sewer pipe becoming blocked. Next fall, before the frost sets in, a few loads of manure or straw could be placed along the trench in which the pipe is laid, which would prevent freezing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

The Agent estimates the cost of replacement at $200.00\n\n(sgd) Henri Fabien\nPointe-Blanche, 29 ao\u00fbt 1934.\n\nMonsieur,\n\nEn r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 votre lettre no 23034-1 dat\u00e9e du 27 ao\u00fbt courant permettez-moi de vous dire que l'\u00e9cole de la R\u00e9serve de la Pointe-Blanche poss\u00e8de une fournaise \u00e0 air chaud chauffant au bois en automne et au printemps et au charbon en hiver. Je dois ajouter que les soeurs ne r\u00e9sident pas \u00e0 la dite \u00e9cole mais au Monast\u00e8re qui est situ\u00e9 \u00e0 environ 500 pas de l'\u00e9cole, elles ne sont \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole que de 8 hrs. a.m. \u00e0 5 hrs. p.m., quant au syst\u00e8me de l'aqueduc, c'est par un puits art\u00e9sien lequel fonctionne avec un moteur \u00e0 gazoline qui accumule l'eau dans un r\u00e9servoir pouvant contenir 150 gallons, celui-ci alimente l'eau potable et celle pour les cabinets qui sont install\u00e9s dans la dite \u00e9cole.\n\nLe chauffage \u00e0 la maison et bureau de l'agence se fait aussi par une fournaise \u00e0 air chaud et c'est le sousign\u00e9 qui fait le chauffage des deux b\u00e2tisses (c.a.d. \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole et \u00e0 la maison), voit au syst\u00e8me \u00e0 l'eau, \u00e0 l'entretien de la cave, lavage des planchers et nettoyage des vitres, etc...\n\nEsp\u00e9rant que ces renseignements vous donneront satisfaction,\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre, Monsieur, votre humble serviteur,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent des Sauvages.\n\nLe Secr\u00e9taire,\nD\u00e9partement des affaires Indiennes.\nOttawa, Ont.\nTranslation\n\nSainte-Blanche, Aug 29, 1934\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter no. 23084 dated the 27th of Aug., permit me to tell you that the school of the reserve possesses a hot air furnace, heating with wood in the Fall and the Spring and with coal in Winter. I must add that the Sisters do not reside in the school but at the monastery which is situated about 600 ft. from the school. They are at school from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Due to the water works, the supply is from an artesian well which functions with a gasoline motor storing the water in a tank containing about 150 gallons that feeds the taps and w.c. installed in the said school.\n\nThe heating at the Agency residence and office is also obtained by an hot air furnace and it is the undersigned who looks after the heating of the two buildings (that is the school and residence) looks over the water system, the upkeep of the cells, floor washing, window cleaning, etc.\n\nHoping these informations will be satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir, your humble servant,\n\n(Sgd) R. de la V\u00e9di\u00e8re\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I thank you for the rapidity with which you have answered our demands. Service is perfect. There is still a request I wish to make and in presence of your kindness I feel my confidence increasing. Here is my request: I would like to have a small amount of money $10. to $15. to purchase recompense to our pupils before the holidays.\n\nFor three years these afflicted and studious children have received no other recompense than that of the Sacred Priest who is much interested in the progress of the pupils; the latter are very obedient, well stimulated by the religious and civil authorities, and certainly deserve a little encouragement to maintain their good application. All laborers deserve a salary and every good pupil a recompense.\n\nYou will understand this as I do. I do not want much and I will accept with gratitude whatever you may grant me for our dear little children of the woods who have not seen outside their reserve anything else than wild animals and the tall trees of the forest. Yet they are intelligent and lovable, and if you could see them at school thus cause would be won.\n\nI hope I am not soliciting in vain in their favour and again I thank you for your kindness.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) Sister Marie du Carmel\nDirector\nOttawa, May 27, 1935.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, requesting that a grant be provided to purchase gifts for the pupils of the Pointe Bleue Indian Day School, to be awarded them before the school closes for the coming summer holidays.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure, which must not exceed the sum of $10.00, in the purchase of suitable gifts. I would request that you obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, from the merchant from whom the purchase is made.

This is very commendable from the point of view of hygiene. It is also necessary to replace the grate in the furnace, and it is also urgent to replace out of the N.C. It will be necessary to remove the earth that covers the sewer over a length of about 200 ft., so as to find where the leak is located. I enclose therewith a list of the articles required, accessories, cost of material and labour.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir, your humble servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 4th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th ultimo, I beg to say that you may expend the following amounts in connection with the Pointe Bleue Indian Day School:\n\nFurnace grate - $15.00\nRepairs to toilet - $7.00\n\nThe Department is not prepared to authorize the installation of a drinking fountain at this school.\n\nThe estimate of the cost of repairing the sewer appears to be very high. Is this sewer used only by the Pointe Bleue School?

We dare say it is impossible, especially in winter-time, for the roads are full of snow.\n\n4--Almost thirty children are at the age of going to school.\n\n5--We have spoken to our representative in House Of Commune about that, but we have not got an answer.\n\n6--Really we cannot explain why there are some people, influential enough, who are against this thing to get a school, in this part of Pointe-Bleue.\n\n7--Consequently, we ask you to send someone, perfectly independent, in our parish with him may hold an inquiry about this situation, and, after that, if it is possible, to send us a report of this inquiry.\n\n8--In that way, we hope to get justice.\n\n9--And, in advance, we are sure you will grant us rights in order to have an elementary school for our children, situated in the rank \"C.B.\"\n\nWe thank you very much, Honourable Minister, for that service:\n\nN.B.

I may add that even if, some day, a school should be built on ranges B and C, a third classroom in the village school would nevertheless be necessary.\n\nI believe the cost of enlarging the school should not be more than $500.00, and if you have no objection, the school could be enlarged on the west side, which would not impair its architectural style. I am enclosing herewith a list containing the signatures of Indians who promise to pay for the timber and to furnish the labour. I could have had many more signatures, but many of the Indians have left the village to travel during the summer. I may say that I do not rely overmuch on these promises.\n\nIt would be greatly appreciated if this construction work could be completed this summer.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) A. de la Boissi\u00e8re,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDivision of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, July 26th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to a proposed addition to the Pointe Bleue Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted that certain Indians have expressed their willingness to provide timber and to furnish labour free of charge. Please let me know how soon this timber will be available for use.\n\nYou mention that the cost of enlarging the school should not be more than $500. Do you mean that this will be the total amount necessary other than the material and labour provided by the Indians? If so, you should state in what manner this amount would be expended.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

This began to show about three years after the building was finished and has been getting worse every year. For safety I requested Agent to employ a competent man to make repairs needed as soon as possible. The whole cost of this work should not exceed $50.00.\n\nThe water from the artesian well is good. It is pumped in tank by gas engine.\n\nTwo toilets are placed in cellar for boys and girls and from a moral standpoint this is quite wrong. It would have been very easy to install a toilet for the girls just next to the one used by the teachers upstairs. The expense would be very light and morality would certainly benefit by the change. During class hours, many times every day, children have to go to the toilets in the cellar where the teachers are in their class and there is nobody to supervise the going and coming of the children. Many of these pupils are from twelve to sixteen years of age and over. If my suggestion of having a toilet installed upstairs for the girls were followed up, the cellar toilets would be used by the boys only.\n\nJude Thibault,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nQuebec Inspectorate.\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit my inspection report of the Pointe Bleue agency made on October 1st, 2nd and 3rd.\n\nUpon my visit to the school, I was surprised to notice that all children are using the same cup and what is worse, dip it in a pail hung from the wall to get it filled - against all principles of hygiene.\n\nMay I strongly recommend that a small sink be set up in a corner of this entrance hall and a tap connected from the water tank to enable children coming to school with dirty hands to wash them. Also, I would recommend the installation of one automatic drinking fountain on one end of the sink as this would do away with the necessity of using the cup as mentioned above.

You have now a strong tuberculosis organization at Roberval and you should ask Doctor Pinsult to go with you to the head of the sanatorium and discuss what measures should be taken for the control of tuberculosis, not only among the school children, but among the adults of the Pointe Bleue Reserve also. The most usual method to accomplish this is to administer the tuberculin test to all the children and to further examine those found to have a positive reaction.\n\nYou would not need to consult the Department further up to this point, but it would be appreciated if you would ask the doctors to give you a report when this has been done, so that the Department may consider...\n\nA. de la Boissiere, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPointe Bleue, P.Q.\nwhat further measures can be carried out during the present year.\n\nMr. Thibault also recommends the issue of a half pint of milk per day to every child during the school year. In another part of his report he says that there are about 100 milking cows on the Reserve. You might discuss this matter also with the doctor and submit to the Department any recommendation you and he might agree upon. The Department would probably authorize the issue of the milk, but thinks that a population with a considerable number of cows ought to be able to supply the milk at fairly low cost, seeing that in many families children would be consuming milk which is already available at home.\n\nMr. Thibault recommends also that Cod Liver Oil be made available for the children at the school. For many years the Department has urged that this be done and you have only to ask the doctor to prepare requisitions for the oil at the rate of one quart for each pupil. The official standard dose is one teaspoonful twice daily, to be given by the school teachers.\n\nHe also recommends that you take charge of a quantity of home remedies such as cough medicines, liniments, and ointments. The Department distributes these medicines widely, but does not wish to set up what may become a sort of free drug store. It is quite willing to supply Cod Liver Oil and the only reason for asking you to make a requisition is to ensure that the teachers are willing to handle it. It would also be quite willing to send a supply of ointment if, for example, there were a widespread outbreak of scabies or impetigo.\n\nKindly talk all these things over with the doctor and advise the Department what you would like to have done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L.

It might be a good opportunity also to have our floors rebuilt, as they have never been repaired since the construction of the school. It seems to us that it is not asking too much to have these repairs done after ten years.\n\nWe trust that you will give the necessary authority to the Agent in order to have this work done.\n\nIn compliance with the wishes expressed by the Department, we instruct our pupils in domestic work, but as they are very poor, we thought of requesting a sum of $15.00 to purchase the required materials.\n\nFurther, if you had a used typewriter which you could spare, it would be very useful to us to prepare our examinations, etc.\n\nIn the hope that you will consider these requests favourably, we are,\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Sisters of Notre-Dame du Bon Conseil,\n\nby: Sister Sainte-Jeanne.\nExtract from report of School Inspector C.E. Boily on his inspection of the Pointe Bleue Indian day school on April 26, 1939:\n\nThe report showed that there were 91 children present on the day of the inspection. The Inspector remarked as follows on his report:\n\n\"As I have remarked in preceding reports it is necessary to open a third class room.\"\n\n\"107 pupils enrolled for two instructors is not tolerated in any other school in my inspectorate. It seems to me that the Department should make some effort to improve the situation. I suggest a third teacher.\"\n\n(Sgd.) C.E. Boiley,\nSchool Inspector.\nOttawa,\nMay 10, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Reverend Sisters in charge of the Pointe Bleue school in which they state that repairs are required to prevent the building from sinking. Please let me have an estimate of the expenditure that would be necessary in this regard. You should understand that our funds are very limited and you should, therefore, forward an estimate only on the work that is absolutely necessary.\n\nI wish also to direct your attention to my letter of March 20 to which no reply has yet been received. An immediate reply is expected.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of material at a cost not exceeding $15.00 to be used in the domestic science class.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

After this work was done the inside of the school was in a bad shape and it was necessary to have it repainted, which entailed extra expenditures. Further, the outside due to wear required much more paint than we had provided for.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant enclosing an account for $235.10 in connection with painting the interior and exterior of the Pointe Bleue school.\n\nIn official letter of August 10, 1939, you were authorized to expend an amount of $66.00 for materials for painting this building. On October 6 you forwarded an account for $7.26 covering the cost of nails and linseed oil to be used at the Pointe Bleue school and quoted as your authority official letter of August 10. This latter account was paid and left a balance authorized for painting materials of $58.74.\n\nThe Department cannot understand why, without obtaining authority, you exceeded the appropriation to such an extent as shown by the account just received. I think you will realize that if Indian Agents were allowed to exceed their authority in this manner it would be impossible for the Department to keep any control of expenditure. Under the circumstances I am inclined to feel that the only procedure that we can take is to pay $58.74 on the amount and allow you to pay the balance yourself.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. A. de la Boissiere,\nIndian Agent,\nPointe Bleue, Que.\n\nR.

It was well to have an ordinary faucet and small sink installed to prevent dipping drinking cup into water-tap, but the end is not achieved when over seventy pupils are using the \"one cup\". Individual cups, bowls, etc would be rather costly, but a special faucet - requiring no cup - would supply all required water to drink at any time - easy - clean and hygienic. If we are taking any steps to stop T.B. increasing on this reserve, we should, in my opinion, give the children the least chance for contamination.\n\nCod Liver Oil has been distributed regularly, and results can be seen in the healthy appearance of the children.\n\nThe suggestion to repair ceilings of the two classrooms was made in my inspection report of October 1938. I had estimated the cost of such repairs at about $50.00, judging from appearance at that time; however, nothing was done until July or August 1939, when the ceiling kept lowering all the time, and was then a terrible menace. I have interviewed one of the men who worked on the repairs, and he informed me that in one classroom the ceiling had come down eleven inches, while in the other room it was down nine inches. Whoever was supervising the construction surely slept on his job, to let a contractor get away with such fault of construction. Due to conditions being worse when repairs were made than when seen it in 1938, the cost of repairs was higher; the plaster had to be repaired; the whole ceiling had to be as well as all the walls, re-decorated in both classrooms, as scaffolding had somewhat touched the walls also. There appears to be a balance of $167.10 for materials due on this repair, and after seeing the work done I feel that no undue cost was added, and I recommend the payment of the said balance of $167.10.\n\nNo more paint was required for outside work, as the woodwork had become spongy, having received no paint since its construction in 1927-28. No house owner could expect to keep his property in good shape if painted every ten years, or if he does, he must expect to use a lot more paint, besides the depreciation of the lumber. A professional house builder and painter would probably not make such a difference in his estimates, but our Agent and even myself are not experts in the matter.\n\nJude Thibault,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nQuebec.\nCOT\u00c9, BOIVIN & CIE, INC.\nBureau chef \u00e0 CHICOUTIMI, Qu\u00e9.\nMARCHANDS EN GROS\nEPICERIE - PROVISIONS - FERRONNERIE\n\nROBERVAL, 14-10-1940\n\nVendu \u00e0 DEPT DES AFFAIRES INDIENNES\nPOINTE BLEUE\n\nConditions:\nNet 30 jours\nInt\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 8% apr\u00e8s \u00e9ch\u00e9ance.

It is agreed that the Family Allowance has something to do with the increased and more regular attendance.\n\nSince the location of the gas engine, used for pumping the water, was changed, the water can now be used from drinking, as the gasoline infiltration in the well is done away with, there is yet a very slight taste which will gradually disappear in time.\n\nThe school grounds are gradually sloping towards the railway fence, and I strongly recommend that a start be made towards leveling the same, this fall if at all possible, about one hundred dollars would help to start the improvement. As it is now, with larger attendance and older boys, there should be better playgrounds available for ball playing. Rather Lajeunesse is greatly interested in having all Indian boys take part in open air games. At this time, I have been told that a football would be most welcomed by the boys, if at all available and meets with your approval. Soft ball and bat could also be used, if sent now, if sent in care of our Indian Agent, Mr. A. de la Boissiere.\n\nJude Thibault,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nHudson's Bay Company.\nINCORPORATED 21st MAY 1670.\nPOINTE BLEUE, P.Q.\n\nINVOICE\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES & RESOURCES\n31st OCTOBER, 1945\n\nNo. 5 INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH, OTTAWA, ONT.\n\nINDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nOCT 25 5 gallons Gasoline 26 1.30\nProvincial Tax 08 40\nFederal Tax 02 15\n\n$ 1.85\n\nCertified correct.\n\nPost Manager\n\nPlease mail cheque or direct enquiries to:\nThe Manager\nEastern Line Section\nHudson's Bay Company\n100, McGill Street\nMONTREAL I, P.Q.\n\nI, [signature], certify that the work has been performed according to instructions, services rendered, goods, provisions, material supplied as shown above, and that:\n\n[signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Outside, the roofing shingles on the western side should be removed and replaced, and the whole roof should be given two coats of paint. The exterior walls also should be painted. Several boards should be replaced on the verandah, and all of it should be painted also.\n\nAs water seeps into the cellar in the spring, a coat of cement should be applied all over the cellar, which measures 40 x 60 feet.\n\nIn regard to the heating system, which Mr. Boily, School Inspector, wants to replace by a hot water system, I may say that during his visit Mr. Morris has suggested that a small furnace be installed in the higher grade classroom (as was done for several years in the lower grade classroom and which gave satisfaction), or else to add hot air pipes to the cellar furnace on the higher grade classroom side, which, I believe, would be satisfactory and would save a hot water installation.\n\nI am enclosing the tender prepared by Mr. Philippe Tremblay, painter of Roberval, for two coats of paint for the school interior and exterior, repairs to the roof, cement in the cellar, new pipes for the furnace in the cellar, and labour at .80 per hour.\n\n| Interior | Exterior |\n|----------|----------|\n| 125 pounds white water paint | $18.75 |\n| 4 gallons C.I.L. white enamel paint at $5.18 | 20.72 |\n| 7 gal. buff enamel | 5.18 |\n| 2 gal. turpentine | 36.26 |\n| 1 jar black paint for desks | 2.10 |\n| 2 bags of plaster | 4.20 |\n| 1 pound of fish glue | 2.80 |\n| 4 gal. floor varnish | 2.00 |\n| 20 gals. of white paint | .30 |\n| 35 \" green \" | 5.00 |\n| 10 \" linseed oil | 20.00 |\n| 12 cases of shingles | 3.50 |\n| Salary of painter at .80 per hour | 70.00 |\n| app. 550.00 |\n\n(over)\nOttawa, August 13, 1946.\n\nMr. A. de la Boissiere, Indian Agent,\nPointe Bleue, P.Q.\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, with reference to the Pointe Bleue Indian Day School.\n\nThe amount requested for labour appears very high and consequently we are not prepared to authorize painting the exterior of the building this year.

Roof will have to be shingled next year. Recommend asbestos shingles, with a heavy roofing paper right over the present wooden shingles.\n\nTop of chimney cracked. Agent instructed to have it repaired and submit a voucher for payment.\n\nInside of school should be redecorated. Plaster will have to be repaired. Note the finish coat of plaster is very thin and peels off quite easily.\n\nThe heating should be inspected by a competent furnace expert. The furnace appears to be large enough to heat the school rooms comfortably. Yet it has been necessary to install a stove in the classroom on the north side. It is my opinion that if the hot air registers were increased and placed differently the building could be heated without much difficulty.\n\nWater system. The sewer pipe froze close to the wall under the foundation last winter which meant that it would not drain the toilets. This caused considerable inconvenience. It may be that the septic tank, which has not been serviced since it was constructed, should be opened up and overhauled.\n\nDesks (school) are old and have been painted several times. New ones should be purchased. Suggest that the Agent be requested to submit a requisition stating the number and the size required.\nOttawa, September 6, 1946.\n\nMr. A. de la Roissiere, Indian Agent, Pointe Bleue, P.E.\n\nI have a report from Mr. Morris regarding the Pointe Bleue Day School.

Since the pipe is not sufficiently inclined, refuse has accumulated and frozen; as for the cesspool, it is in good shape.\n\nSince this drain is the cause of serious worries each winter, it should necessarily be dug further next summer and as the rock is not far down, blasting will even be necessary.\n\nAccording to the tests I made, I know through experience that it is useless to try and thaw it; it is too cold and it will freeze again.\n\nTherefore, I am asking for the permission to have water closets built outside the school, which will always be handy when something goes wrong in those inside.\n\nLabour and building material will cost approximately $90.00. As for the cost of digging the drain further down, I shall take this up with you again in the spring.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(SGD) A. de la Boissi\u00e8re,\nINDIAN AGENT.\nOttawa, February 8th, 1947.\n\nA. de la Boissiere, Indian Agent, Pointe Bleue.\n\nReference your 1771 - Jan. 31st.\n\nAuthority is granted for you to erect two temporary water closets at the Pointe Bleue Indian Day School as requested in your letter of January 31st, file 1771, at a cost not to exceed $90.00.\n\nIt is requested that you enclose receipts with your vouchers and also Labour Return forms.\n\nBernard F.

Il faudra aussi 50 sacs de ciment \u00e0 .90 le sac, pour en \u00e9tendre partout dans la cave parce que l'eau s'y infiltre.

Binet & Fr\u00e8re, of Roberval.\n\nI am sending you enclosed an estimate amounting to $360 from Messrs. Binet & Fr\u00e8re, plumbers, for furnishing and laying a cast-iron sewer pipe on a length of 125 feet to replace the present sewer system which is a wooden pipe that is pierced in many places. The said school was built 20 years ago.\n\nI am asking you also, in addition to the amount of the above estimate, the sum of $200 to pay the salary of the men who have uncovered the said sewer canal and who will recover it after having transported sand and sawdust to protect the pipe against frost. It is also necessary to replace the cesspool cover which has rotted. This will require 30 pieces of cedar wood 13 feet long which will cost $15. Fifty bags of cement at 90 cents per bag will also be needed. This cement will be spread in the cellar because the water comes up (infiltrates).

Having this in mind, I asked the same firm (Saguenay Isolation Enr.) to submit a tender for the School, as well as the residence, and send it to Ottawa for approval, as it would be cheaper to do the two jobs together, than having to go back again and do the School later on.\n\nTo date, I do not believe you have received this tender, but should you receive it, would you kindly give it serious consideration. If this School is insulated, it will save a substantial amount of money and it should pay for itself in three or four years. If you decide to concur in this, would you kindly communicate with Indian Agent A. de la Boissiere, Pointe Bleue, P.Q.\n\nJ. E. Gendron,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies for Province of Quebec.\nIt would be advantageous to have the school done. It must however be kept in mind that there is a building problem at Pointe Bleue.\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 Boivin & Cie\n\nMARCHANDS EN GROS\nEPICERIE - PROVISIONS - FERRONNERIE\n\nVendu \u00e0 Pointe-Blanche\nnet 15 suivent\n\nConditions: Int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 8% apr\u00e8s \u00e9ch\u00e9ance.

Je vous serais donc reconnaissant si vous donniez vous-m\u00eame les d\u00e9tails que vous jugerez n\u00e9cessaires sur les conditions actuelles de ce local; dimensions, apparence, \u00e9lectricit\u00e9, conditions qui motivent notre demande.\n\nAgreez, cher monsieur, mes meilleurs sentiments.\n\nVotre tout d\u00e9vou\u00e9,\n\nRev. Pere Aram Rthier, O.M.I., Sup.\nPointe Bleue, Dec. 9, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Agency,\nPointe Bleue,\nRoberval county,\nQuebec.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWould you kindly submit to your department our request for an increase of rent of the room used temporarily as a classroom on account of the lack of space for all the pupils of the reservation.\n\nOn his last visit, Mr. Gendron, Inspector of agencies, after inspecting this room which was renovated last summer, authorized this request being made to the Department through the agent's offices.\n\nOwing to the fact that I was away for a few weeks, I was unable to send this request before today.\n\nI think that $20 per month, from the month of September, would be satisfactory to us and to the Department. I should be grateful if you would personally give the details that you will judge necessary on the present conditions of this place: dimensions, appearance, electric power, conditions which motivate our request.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRvd. Father Aram Ethier, OMI,\nSuperior.\n\nTranslation\nDec. 14/48.\nPointe Bleue, Dec. 10, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nAttached please find copy of a letter received from Rev. Father Aram Ethier, Superior of Monastere des Oblats of Pointe Bleue.\n\nThis letter is self explanatory and for my part I would recommend a rent of $20.00 per month commencing in September.\n\nThe local secured by the Father for a class for the indian pupils is a public hall completely repaired last summer.\n\nThe building is 34\u00bd ft by 28\u00bd ft, giving a stand of 13 ft wide for the teacher's desk.\n\nThe hall has been completely painted inside this summer and moreover the father secures the electric lights from his delco plan. It is well lighted, clean, large enough for the number of pupils, well heated, and secures a very comfortable class for the Indians.\n\nConsidering the repairs and improvement made last summer on the hall, it is only just and fair that an amount of $20.00 at least be paid for the rent of that local.\n\nEdgar Arsenault, Supt.\nPointe Bleue Agency.\nDecember 20, 1948.\n\nMr. Edgar Arsenault,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nPointe Bleue, P.Q.\n\nIn view of your letter of the 10th instant, the Department will allow a rental of $20.00 a teaching month from September 1st, 1948 for the building used as a second classroom at the Point Bleue School.\n\nBernard F.

There are 33 pupils in grades III and IV, and 49 in grades I and II. Grades III and IV are combined and are taught in the parish hall which is quite unsatisfactory as a classroom. It is being used as an emergency.\n\nIt is recommended to build a classroom, plan 865. A male teacher would take charge of the senior boys. According to the present enrolment there would be approximately 20 pupils. Grades VIII and IX should attend provincial High Schools. There will be 6 in this category next year. The principal has been instructed to notify the Department as soon as the final standing of these pupils is known.\n\nThere seems to be some misunderstanding between Robervaal and the reserve. There is not here the cooperation that is noticed at Lorette, Pierreville, and other localities which now show a great deal of goodwill toward the Indians. This misunderstanding seems to be caused principally by ignorance of Government policy on the part of the authorities in Robervaal. In order that activities on the reserve be successful I believe that this misunderstanding should be cleared as soon as possible.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nA. J.

Electrique, Inc., Roberval, Que.\nper Raymond Chellet\nwiring and fixtures .............. $1,417.00\n\n(c) Romeo Trottier, Roberval, Que.\nwiring and fixtures .............. $1,399.83\n\n(d) Le Chauffage Moderne Enrg.,\nSt. Felicien, Que.\nper B. Savard, St. Felicien, Que. .......... $1,052.90\n\nMr. Doucet, of this Division, who visited Pointe Bleue last week, recommends the acceptance of the tender of\nRomeo Trottier, in an amount of $1,399.85 as he is reported to be a reliable man and Mr. Savard's tender appears incomplete. I attach a letter which we have received from the Indian Agent.\n\nII HEATING.\n\n(a) Le Chauffage Moderne Enrg. St. Felicien, Que.\nper Raymond Savard ........... $2,300.00\n\nThis quotation is for hot water while our plans and specifications call for forced hot air. Mr. Savard did not wish to quote on the latter.\n\n(b) Doucet & Frere Roberval, Que. .......... 2,225.00\n\nThese were the only two quotations that Mr. Doucet could obtain and we recommend the acceptance of the lower tender.\n\nIII PLUMBING.\n\n(a) Le Chauffage Moderne Enrg. St. Felicien,\nper Raymond Savard .......... 1,995.00\n\n(b) Brunet & Frere Roberval, Que. .......... 1,775.00\n\nMr. Doucet was only able to obtain the above two tenders and we recommend acceptance of the lower tender.\n\nThe construction of this building is proceeding and it is necessary to arrange for the electricity, heating and plumbing at the earliest possible date. It would be appreciated if the Minister would approve the recommendations made in this memorandum.\n\nAPPROVED\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Doucet.\n\nRe: Erection Indian Day School Pointe Bleue.\n\nFollowing our phone conversation regarding the work re erection of the Indian School, as already stated, the outside work and also the septic tank and outlet are completed.\n\nThe inside is also well advanced; all the partitions made and they have started today to place the gyprock; we did not receive yet all the gyprock required, but we expect it anytime.\n\nThe plumbing is completed except the fittings; for the electricity they have completed the wiring.\n\nMr. Laberge who has drilled two wells on the reserve here has examined the well in the old school, and he does not recommend to clean it, as according to him, it would be useless because it would not give any good result. He claims the same thing happened near Montreal few years ago, and they tried to clean the well, but the water had still the same smell and taste. He suggested the only solution would be to drill another well and plug the old one with cement.\n\nThe daylight is getting scarce in the morning and at night and of course we would need some light for the work of the carpenters inside; we had thought to use gas lanterns, or aladin lamps, but it is more or less commendable on account of the danger for fire and moreover, as the carpenters have to move from one room to the other and it is not possible to carry the lanterns each time.\nI have discussed the matter with Rev. Father Ethier, and I believe it would be possible to use their Delco light for a very reasonable cost per day; it is easy to have the connection from the hall it is near the new school.\n\nAs the furnace is not yet arrived, we have been obliged to organize a stove in the kitchen to heat the second floor where men are working; and it is necessary to have another system (stove or oil furnace) in the basement room; it is too cold and too damp without fire; Mr. Harvey has been requested to enquire about the cost of a small oil furnace; I believe it is the best system we could install in the basement, as we need heat during the night on account of the fresh paint. Mr. Binet does not expect the big furnace before the end of December.\n\nAt the end, I think an oil furnace would be more economic; with an ordinary wood stove, we would be obliged to buy the wood at $5.00 per cord, and pay a man during the night to keep the fire going.\n\nHope these few informations will help you to settle the question.\n\nYour visit will be appreciated.\n\nEdgar Arsenault,\nSupt.\nPointe Bleue Agency.\n**PURCHASE ORDER**\n\nTO: Gagnon et Frere de Roberval Limit\u00e9e, Roberval, Quebec.\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING MATERIALS AND CHARGE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES.\n\nMr. B.

Mr. Doucet states that he instructed you to return these to the company and receive a Credit Note. No doubt you have already done so, and the Department would appreciate it if you would forward the Credit Note immediately.\n\nAttached to the Credit Note from the company should be a statement showing the exact materials returned and the quantity of each. Please give this matter your immediate attention.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nPointe Bleue, December 6, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nAttention: Mr. J. A. Doucet, Supt., M.T. Division.\n\nAt your last visit we have discussed the question of heating system for the New Indian Day School.... We have organized the oil furnace in the basement, and according to the opinion of Mr. Binet and Harvey, the heat secured would be sufficient to prevent the frost of the water system and keep the building at a temperate warmth; but the heat is not sufficient if the Nurse occupies the kitchen and living room as dispensary.\n\nThere is no opening communicating directly from the basement and the kitchen, and of course it would be too cold for a person to remain there.\n\nIf those two rooms are given to the Nurse, an other oil furnace is required to heat the two rooms; the cost is about $50.00 for the purchase, plus the cost for the necessary oil.\n\nAs the second oil furnace is not necessary for us, you may make the necessary arrangements with the Department concerned for the payment of the furnace and oil if you so desire.\n\nI am waiting for a written authority before giving the two rooms at the disposal of Nurse Levesque. Report on the matter has already been forwarded to the Dept. concerned.\n\nI would be pleased to be advised of the decision taken regarding the furnace and the two rooms for Nurse Levesque.\n\nEdgar Arsenault, Supt.,\nPointe Bleue Agency.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Dec. 3 | To order No. 63100... | $5.90 |\n\nMaterial extra for erection of Indian School Reserve.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

We forwarded this Voucher to the Treasury Branch, and it has been returned to us with the following recommendations:\n\n\"There are a number of instances on these paylists where signatures are not the same as the person employed. We have no knowledge of any circumstance whereby this Agent can hand payments to anyone except the person who performed the work.\"\n\nI do not like to add to your many other duties at Pointe Bleue, but I hope you will find time to go over this voucher with Mr. Arsenault, and you should emphasize to him the necessity of preparing Credit Vouchers in the proper manner.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\n\nEnc.\nDecember 13th, 1949.\n\nMr. E. Arsenault,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nPointe Bleue, P.Q.\n\nRe: Pointe Bleue Indian Day School\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to again return your Credit Voucher No. 503 covering labour for the weeks ending August 25th, September 1st, September 8th, September 15th, September 22nd and September 29th, 1949.\n\nIf you review this Voucher you will note that in different places you have deducted income tax but you have not taken credit for it. In addition, you have not given any evidence either by cheque number or receipt, of the money having been remitted to the Income Tax Department.\n\nIn several cases on the Credit Voucher the payment has not been receipted by the person entitled to receive a payment. Presumably, money was given to someone else to give to such worker. Have you any definite evidence that the man entitled to the money received it?\n\nIf workers are not present when payment is being made, the amount due them should be omitted from the paylist containing the names of those who were present and signed the paylist for themselves.\n\nCheques should then be issued and mailed to those entitled to payment but who were not present when you were paying the others. A separate Credit\nVoucher should then be prepared and forwarded to us stating the number of the cheque. You should keep in mind that the Auditor General requires definite evidence that payment has been made to the person to whom any payment is due. The only manner in which this can be obtained is to have his signature on the paylist or his signature on a cheque for the amount owing to him.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\n\nPP/ST\nAttachs.\nDecember 15th, 1949.\n\nMr. E.

The Indian Health Services are prepared to pay the cost of purchasing this furnace as well as the oil that is required. It should be understood that the use of part of our school by the nurse is a temporary arrangement until June 30th, 1950.\n\nAny further correspondence with regard to the nurse occupying part of our school should be addressed to the Indian Health Services.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST\nChief, Education Division\n\ncc Dr. Leroux, Indian Health Services.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Oct. 5 | Pour le transport de bois et autres marchandises de Roberval \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole de la r\u00e9serve de Pointe-Blanc. 5 heures \u00e0 $3.00 de l'heure, avec camion. | $15.00 |\n\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Then, we may expect that in the spring the basement could be flooded if no proper equipment is installed to evacuate the water contained in the reservoir made for that purpose.\n\nI understand that the electricity is not yet organized in the reserve, but I wonder if it would not be advisable to have the sump pump installed immediately in order to have it when the electricity will be available. In the meantime, I believe it would be urgent to have instructions from you to install an ordinary pump on the reservoir, in order to prevent flooding in the basement.\n\nWe could arrange to have that pump connected with the outlet drain pipe. I have a spare pump that could be used for the purpose and we would need a certain length of hose for the connection.\n\nYour immediate instructions would be appreciated.\n\nEug\u00e8ne Arsenault, Supt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6009, file 325-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, Feb. 5, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Dupont\nIndian Education Division.\n\nRe: Electrification - Pointe Bleue Indian Reserve.\n\nMr. Arsenault was instructed in letter of June 13, 1949 as follows:\n\n1. If the Saguenay Power Company has expropriation powers they should:\n   (a) furnish a plan showing the proposed position of their line on the Indian Reserve.\n   (b) obtain the written consent of the Indians whose lands will be affected and pay them compensation.\n\n2. If the Company has not expropriation powers in addition to the plan and consent of the individual Indians a band resolution will have to be secured.\n\nNOTE: We informed Mr. Arsenault in the same letter that the Company could proceed to construct the line as soon as they secured the consent of the individual Indians, on the understanding that they would supply the plan as soon as possible afterwards.\n\nMr. Allan wrote on Oct. 26th to Mr. Arsenault giving him the same information as was contained in our letter of June 13th, and stated that when the company forwarded the information requested a permit would issue to them permitting them to run their line across the reserve.\n\nApparently Mr. Arsenault had several interviews with the company and was asked by them to supply the following:\n\n1. Secure from Indian Affairs authority for the company to set up and maintain its line.\nNote: This Mr. Arsenault could not do until the Company had secured and forwarded documents from the individual Indians, as asked for in 1 (a), and forwarded the plan asked for in 1 (b). However, as mentioned the permit could not issue until the plan was received, but once the consent of the Indians was secured and compensation paid the Company would not be hindered in the construction of the line. In theory the plan is required, but in actual practice I understand that the electric power companies are allowed to construct the line and furnish the plan later.\n\n2. Supply the company with a plan indicating the location of the proposed customers. (There does not appear to be any reason why Mr. Arsenault could not have attended to this).\n\n3. Supply the company with a list of the owners of lots and sites. (Mr. Arsenault could also have supplied this information)\n\nIt would appear from a letter addressed by the Company to Mr. Arsenault that Mr. Tellier and Mr. Freulix of the Saguenay Power Co. met you (they refer to a representative of the school construction, whom I presume to be you) and you offered to supply the information requested by the company, which information was to be supplied by December 1949.\n\nIn view of the fact that it is of interest to secure electricity for the school as well as for the reserve, it would be appreciated if you would follow the matter up. We do not know from the information on file what steps Mr. Arsenault has taken, nor whether the company has secured the consent of the Indians.\n\nI may add that Mr. Arsenault appears to have handled the whole matter in an incompetent way, and in his letter of Nov. 16th, which I would suggest that you read and which was addressed to the Provincial Electricity Board, Mr. Arsenault accuses the company of \"neglect or ill will\", and speaks of seeking for help from people in high quarters, namely the Board. His letter is not tasteful to say the least.\n\nMay we leave the matter in your hands?\n\nW.J.F.

He also wrote me that the present teacher wants to resign her position, but cannot move to say that she is not without a schoolhouse qualified and very capable. The time of my visit being so short, I could not possibly see her. She is well qualified for the position and is preparing herself to enter the Normal School for Superior Teachers' Certificate, but will delay a year if she can secure to have the position of Miss Keane.

I was willing to see Mr. Smith the School Inspector before I refer the case to the Department. Miss Isaac thinks it will be a good move in order to bring more progress in School and I think so too. Miss Isaac is a very intelligent young lady but she succeeds in a very different manner. Naturally she is a Micmac belonging to the tribe speaking her own language she is able to explain English arithmetical calculation better than another who cannot understand the language of her pupils. Last winter when the missionaries spoke &\nWe about the teacher I notified Miss Audet that likely she will not be engaged when her term will be over. I send you the credentials of Miss Isaac they are first class for elementary teaching. Mr. Lewis has requested me to very highly of her.

According to my view, Miss Evans is well able to teach these children for some time yet.\n\nWhen I have visited the school I found everything there well kept, the scholars answered well in French and English, and have also the advantage to be taught in their own language.\n\nSome complaints have been made to me such as the teacher is too fond and children have become very much out of order. At this juncture the teacher had done her duty.\n\nIt is also very unpopular for the new council to ask the dismissed teacher belonging to the opposite party. It will certainly cause ill feeling.\n\nI did explain all these things to the council who appear to understand for a moment and then a big talk ensued in silence which I did not understand and they finally decided she had to go on which I said no more and left it to your decision. My opinion is that it is better to keep her one year more, may be within that we may carry things to have better which would teach girls some keeping sewing etc., etc. I will explain my views in another letter when I get suspension granted.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Anne de Restigouche:\n\nSir:-\n\nAmongst much information received was a statement from the Chief's brother Thomas Isaac that some intoxicating liquor addressed to Chief Isaac Isaac had been seen in Campbellton freight sheds in June last. He was very evidently actuated by anything but kind motives in making this statement, and handed me at the same time a letter from a woman named Maggie Marocque who bears a bad reputation attacking Mary Isaac the reserve school teacher in what appeared to be a very scurrilous manner. Mrs. Larocque is the woman who was in gaol on July 19th last when the men confined with her broke out and was at that time convicted and fined some $27.00.\n\nThere was no doubt that these attacks upon the Chief and his daughter proceeded from the worst element upon the reserve, and were directed against the best. I spoke to the Chief about them and he stated that on the occasion of his daughter's marriage last summer he did get in, and use at the wedding a case of porter; that he never then, nor at any other time sold any sort of intoxicant, and that he was not aware that giving porter to his guests was an offence. He said also that the attack upon his daughter was absolutely unfounded and sprang entirely from the spite of a thoroughly bad woman who, he regretted to say, was his niece.\n\nI accepted these explanations believing them from what I knew, and heard, of the parties concerned to be quite true; and put the Chief right as to his belief in the propriety of giving guests porter. In any case where I was assuming the responsibility\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nresponsibility of not pursuing much more flagrant offenders than the Chief on grounds already mentioned, it was felt that it would be very bad policy indeed to single out for prosecution the best man, and strongest advocate of order and temperance simply because an attack that was evidently malevolent was made upon him. As to his daughter, after making inquiry, I could only conclude not to give any credence to Mrs. Larocque's charged. I have touched upon this incident because the Dept. has since been written to about the matter and the letter has been referred to me.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYr. obedt. servant,\nJ. A. Macrae,\nI. I. A. & R.\nTo the Hon'ble Superintendent of Indian Affairs\n\nSir,\n\nWe the undersigned members of the council and others of the band of Indians on the Reserve of St. Anne de Kiskigamche respectfully petition your Department to remove the present teacher on our reserve \"Miss Mary Dana\" for the following reasons:\n\n1. She is careless in her teaching and neglects her duties for the sake of her own pleasures.\n\n2. She is in the habit of associating with strangers (particularly white men) especially at night thereby neglecting her duties of teaching our children.\n\n3. A great many families have refused to send their children to the school on account of the bad behaviour of the said teacher whereby the children are losing their chance of schooling.\n\nIt is on account of the many complaints that your petitioners humbly request that this may be granted and another teacher engaged in the place of the said Miss Mary Dana.\n\nIndian reserve of St. Anne de Kiskigamche\nby Bonaventure.

He reports that he has complied with the Department's directions and that Mr Inspector Cote informs him that he will communicate with the Department on the subject.\n\nIn another letter on this subject the Agent states that as the new teacher will most probably be a white person, it will be necessary to make suitable provision for lodging, as there is no convenient boarding place on the reserve and the boarding houses off the reserve are too far distant.\n\nThere are over 75 children of school age on this reserve and last year they had a total enrollment of 44 with an average attendance of 34.\n\nThe Department has not made a practice of providing houses for teachers in the Province of Quebec and there are no funds specially available for this purpose. If, however, the Indians are to obtain the full benefit of a school, the teacher should\nreside with them. The Agent in his annual report says that the houses are clean and I do not see why a teacher should not be able to make himself comfortable with one of the progressive members of the band.\n\nIt would be well for the Agent to inform the prospective teacher of what he may expect to put up with if he receives the appointment. The salary attached to this school is only $200.00.\nThe Indian Agent informed me that the term of my teaching will end the 31st instant instead of 30th Sept next.

We do not want the sisters here to teach. In the first place if sisters come they will very likely be French. And when we think it's very important for all children to be taught English, and these sisters as a general thing know very little English.

Voici quelques-uns parmi les connaissances du d\u00e9partement des Sauvages, que je pense m\u00e9riteront probablement plus de Sauvages pour faire le classe sur la Rivi\u00e8re de Richelieu. La future mission serait de la difficult\u00e9 pour pouvoir loger o\u00f9 qu'il est pas convenable de demander \u00e0 une population de loger chez les Sauvages, et que les blancs sont bien trop \u00e9loign\u00e9s, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 urgent de b\u00e2tir un b\u00e2timent pour l'installation ou non a reproduire qu'il n'y avait pas de forces. Simplement on ne mette pas sur la recommandation de M. L'inspecteur de la Seigneurie du S. Roseau est charg\u00e9e par la future institution, c'est sans doute une tr\u00e8s bonne nomination (et je crois qu'une part du monde vous servira) car c'est certain que ces hommes devraient \u00eatre grandement partout en ils enseignent, si connus des Sauvages pas loin d'eux, o\u00f9 ils sont compl\u00e8tement charg\u00e9es la face des choses, et surtout des nos Sauvages, elles devraient rendre de tr\u00e8s grands services non seulement pour l'enseignement de leurs propres mais surtout pour l'\u00e9ducation. Elles finissent si l'espoir par leur mani\u00e8re plus de moralit\u00e9.\nMais la grande difficult\u00e9 c'est le logement o\u00f9 les mettre, les \u00e9coles, mais qui sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 en construction. Si l'\u00e9glise est une grande n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, il faut de m\u00eame qu'il y ait un b\u00e2timent sur lequel nous puissions faire une maison pour les gar\u00e7ons car ils ne veulent pas manquer d'avoir un bonnes \u00e9coles.\n\nJe prie donc que le gouvernement m'aide \u00e0 voir ces jeunes missionnaires qui sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 ici passer, b\u00e2tir une r\u00e9sidence pour l'institution des gar\u00e7ons, les prot\u00e9ger du gouvernement, voil\u00e0 pourquoi j'ai voulu en aviser le d\u00e9partement et j'esp\u00e8re qu'il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de le faire par votre intervention. Vous ferez ainsi un service de bien \u00e0 ceux-ci et je demande votre indulgence.\n\nBien sinc\u00e8rement \u00e0 vous,\n\nJ\u00e9r\u00f4me P\u00e8re\n\nAgent des gar\u00e7ons\nPointe \u00e0 la Garde, July 10, 1903.\n\nCharles Marcil, Esq., M.P.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acquaint you with the following facts. Some time ago I informed the Dept. of Indian Affairs that, as we should not probably have any more Indians as teachers on the Restigouche reserve, the future teacher would have difficulty in obtaining lodging, as it would be hardly proper to ask a teacher to lodge with the Indians, and, as white people were very far away, it was urgent to erect a dwelling for the teacher. I was told in reply that there were no funds. Recently I was advised that, on the recommendation of Inspector C\u00f4t\u00e9, Sister Marie du St. Rosaire has been chosen as the future teacher. This is no doubt a very good appointment, (and I believe a share of the merit is due to you), for it is acknowledged that these good Sisters obtain great success wherever they teach: I know parishes, not far from here, where they have completely changed the face of things, and, especially among our Indians, they would be able to render very great service, not only in teaching secular knowledge, but especially in education (religious); they will finish, I hope, by making them more moral. But the great difficulty is where to lodge them. The Rev. Fathers, who are already building a church (which\nis very much needed) have just told me that they are going to erect a dwelling on their own land, near the school-house, because they do not wish to be without these good sisters.\n\nI presume that the Government would not like very much to see these poor missionaries, who are already so poor, build a residence for the teacher of the Indians, the wards of the Government. That is why I wish to inform the Department of the matter, and I believe that it would be preferable that this should be done through your intermediation. Wherefore I give you these long details, for which I ask your indulgence.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\nJeremie Pitre,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa 18 July 1907\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMay I have the honour to submit a letter from Mr. David, agent for the Red River Indians, requesting aid for the construction of a lodging place for the teacher at the school reserve.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(2) It means that our children's education will be\nmostly French to which we are opposed because nearly all our business\nrelations are with the English, and what our people need is a good\npractical English Education. (3) It means the bringing into our reserve\nmore white people and the gradual obliteration of our tribe.\n\nWe therefore humbly request that you will be pleased to prevent\nthe introduction of the nuns into our Reserve and as in duty bound\nwill ever pray.\n\nDated July 20th, 1908.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Where accommodation has been provided, the funds have been furnished by the Indians, and the teacher's dwelling is the property of the Band. In this case the reverend Fathers are going to erect a dwelling on their own land near the school house, which will be in the nature of a convent and where the Sister appointed to take charge of the Indian school will reside, and it towards the erection of this building that the Agent wishes the Department to contribute.\n\nThe schoolhouse is the property of the\nGovernment and if the Department decides to furnish a teacher's dwelling it should be Government property, as it is not certain that the Sisters will always have charge of this school. A petition has reached the Department today protesting against the appointment of the Sisters as teachers, which bears the names of the Chief, two Councillors and sixty-nine members of the Band. The chief objection against the Sisters is the claim that the teaching would be wholly in French, while the Indians say that nearly all their business relations are with the English and that what their people need is a good practical English education.\n\nNo mention is made by Mr Pitre of the sum the Department is expected to contribute and we have no estimates to show what a separate teacher's dwelling would cost. The present schoolhouse is an old frame building put up about 45 years ago and it is a question whether it would be worth altering to provide lodging for a teacher.\nOTTAWA, 27th July, 1903\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant enclosing a communication from Mr. Agent Pitre of Restigouche suggesting that aid for the construction of a lodging place for the teacher, Rev.

Subject to that.\n\nOur priest announced in church last Sunday that it was the Indian...\nAgent Pete and school inspector who wants the nun to teach. I saw the agent last night. I asked him why he wants a convent in the reserve. He denied any such thing. He knows nothing about school. I believe it was just a trick to deceive us. We want an English teacher and our teacher will do. Since they cannot get their own way, they have to have them away from here.\n\nI hope the Indian Department will help me to prevent these nuns and stop the building they started at once. The Indians want and need to stop the carpenter from doing any work but the priest ordered them to go ahead. Unless you help us we cannot have peace.

The teacher engaged has been teaching satisfactory in an English speaking parish.\n\nAs for the number of signatures on that petition, it is only apparent for a good many of them are young boys and some of the men signed it in false representation, according to some declaration, to the effect made before me.\n\nThe Indians in general are not against the Sisters it is only the chief that causes trouble on that subject as on many other things.\n\nYour humble servant,\nJ.

Her present salary is only $200.00 per annum and she had an average attendance of 39 pupils for last year.\n\nI am at a loss to know why an increase was not provided for this school in this year's estimates as all the other schools conducted by this Department have had the salaries raised to $300.00 per annum, and I would suggest that if funds can be spared, the teacher of this school be paid at the same rate from the 1st July last.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am sure that if you could suggest the Hon. the Sup't. Gov. of all to do so, it would be good enough to grant some prize. This would give much pleasure to our little Miners and still more to their parents, who would certainly appreciate more their father's love, the King, and his efforts.\n\nI notice in a catalogue, 1905-06, of \"P. J. Kennedy & Sons, & Barclay St., N.Y.\", some good books at greatly reduced price, which, I think, would be very good.\n\n(1) First of all we might get six for the most deserving - this would be the first prize.\n\n(2) We might get six good Micmac books for second prize.\nFinally, it would be very desirable also to give a small book to those who would not get a prize; I would suggest the purchase of six other Micmac books and two dozen English history books from the same bookseller. You know that the Micmac books are hard.\n\nIt would be necessary to get prizes for reading English, reading Micmac, writing, history and geography, arithmetic, and perhaps others, which you might decide before or during the examination.\n\nI suppose it would be too much to ask from the Gov. General a prize for regular attendance and good conduct, the value and quality of which would be left to the choice and generosity of His Excellency on the suggestion of the Honorable Minister of his very generous Deputy Minister.\n\nThanking you yourself for your efforts, in my own name and on behalf of our missionary family of scholars\u2014\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

O. McCann, Assistant Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI respectfully beg to submit the following to your kind consideration.\n\nDuring the past nine years that I am in charge of the Indian School at Ratignola, I observe yearly that a certain number of children miss school, especially during winter months, in amount of their home being far from school, and they being obliged to bring a lunch for their dinner meal. Hence, it often happens that though rightly in want, the lunch is not prepared for them, and thus the children miss school in the afternoon, and greater part of time, the whole day.\n\nI think that if the lunch were supplied by the Department and given them at school, they would come regularly and the attendance rate would be more satisfactory.\nThere are about 8 or 10 children in the case I state,\nand it seems to me that tea and sugar befits for the\nworth of about fifteen dollars would be sufficient for a\nyear.\n\nI trust, kind sir, that you will keenly appreciate\nin favor of our little Indian children, will this once more\nnot fail to understand the opportunity of my request,\nwhich will meet, I hope, with your full compliance and\nfavorable reply.\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour most respectfully,\n\nSecretary of the Missionary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

She has been instructed to make a requisition to you for these supplies, which you will be good enough to purchase for her and send the accounts, in duplicate, to the Department.

Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nI respectfully beg to submit to your favourable consideration my following request, kindly seconded by a testimonial of Mr. G. E. Marquis, our school Inspector, concerning the results obtained in this school by the late instructor.\n\nRelieving me from his position I advise and recommend that I may be permitted to express to the honorable Department of Ind. Affairs that since nearly ten years, I have been charged with the management of this school with an annual appointment of $500. This salary is much less than that allotted to the majority of teachers in the Indian schools of the Province of Quebec, in which the number of scholars enrolled is far smaller, and thus figures less blame work and less fatigue.\n\nLastly\u2014Considering the special attention required for the intellectual and moral culture of these poor children, more so, the close watch that has to be kept out of school hours, and the work needed to preserve the school premises in good order, it seems to me that $500 is not a\nfit Compensation as an appointment. The time so\nwasting and other requisites being expensive here, and\nour school salary being our only income.\n\n3rdly. The success obtained in the school, as acknowledged\nby all authorized trustees, is a proof that all our energy\nand care have been given to our school work and\nwe firmly intend to do still more, if possible, for the\ncivilization of these poor Indian children.\n\nI hope, Sir, that the honorable Department will\nconsider that we have generously served said school\nduring ten years and that they will award a yearly\nappointment of \u00a3400. to the Principal of the school,\nand \u00a3300 to the Assistant from 1st January next.\n\nSaying that a favorable answer will be granted us.\n\nWe beg to remain,\n\nSir,\n\nI am, most respectfully,\n\nS. Henry of the Mission, Prop.\nS. M. de St. Joseph, A.M.\nTo\nSecretary Dept.of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:-\n\nHaving visited the Restigouche Indian School for eight years, it gives me pleasure to declare that the teaching of the Sisters of the Holy Rosary is rational and according to the programme of studies for Indians Schools.\n\nDomestic works to the girls and gardening to the boys are taught in a practical way and crowned with remarkable success.\n\nTherefore, considering the services rendered by these teachers, I should be glad that the Department of Indian Affairs should increase the salary of same, according to the request herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of schools.\nOttawa, December 9, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nThe Sisters in charge of the Restigouche Indian Day School have applied for an increase in their salary. They are at present paid at the rate of $300.00 and $250.00 each and have been receiving the same amount for the past nine years. The school has an enrolment as high as 73 and the average attendance is 47. Their work has always been most satisfactory and Mr. Marquis, Public School Inspector in the province of Quebec, recommends their application.\n\nI think the Department would be quite justified in meeting the wishes of the Sisters who are doing such good work, and I would suggest that they be paid from the first of January at the rate of $400.00 and $300.00 respectively. Funds are available for this purpose.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The buildings are beautifully situated and certainly look up to date in every way. The sanitary conditions are as good as could be expected under the circumstances. I found the Rev. Father very accommodating; he helped me in every way possible.\n\nH.A. Conroy.\nExtract from report of Inspector J. Henry Lane\non the Restigouche Indian Day School, dated February 3, 1920.\nOriginal on 151815/6.\n\nThe attendance should be much better. The chief reasons for lack of attendance are the long distance the pupils have to walk to come to school, the want of proper clothes sometimes and also the carelessness of the parents and the idleness of the children.\n\nI suggest that some reliable person be paid to bring the distant children to school in the morning and bring them back home after school hours during the winter months, that another reliable person be paid to hunt up the truants and have them go to school.\n\nCould not the Department assure certain rewards for the attendance of pupils, for the progress they make? I think it would be advisable and it would be a means of making these Indian schools a great success. I gave as a reward to the most deserving pupils of each grade the sum of $2.50 in all. They seemed to be overjoyed.\n\nI visited also the domestic science department. I was surprised to see how the pupils work. A few articles of general use have been made but I regret to say that the allowance of $6.00 a month to buy the necessary articles for this department is not at all sufficient. I would suggest that a sum of at least $15.00 a month be paid to the Sisters so that they may buy the goods they need to make a success of this art department. The clothes, stockings, mitts, underwear worked by the pupils would be distributed then to the poorest families. Thus out of this department, there would be two results, learn the pupils to work out their own clothes and provide poor Indian families with a few clothes.\n\nOn visiting the building, I remarked that there was a nice, spacy room intended for a kitchen, but I am sorry to say that there are no stove, nor utensils, nothing at all to have this department go. Would it not be advisable for the Department of Indian Affairs to put in the necessary funds and provide this room with all the necessary articles for cooking and also devote a sum of money to buy the provisions. Here also this kitchen work would teach the pupils and the different meals prepared might be sent to very poor families.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,-\n\nA request has been received for an increase in salary to the teachers at the Restigouche Indian Day School.\n\nThis school is conducted by the nuns and at present there are two sisters in charge. The teacher of the senior room is Sister Mary of St. Joseph, who has had eleven years' experience, and the assistant teacher is Sister St. Bridget, who, as is said, has professional qualifications. The Principal receives a salary of $400.00 per annum and the assistant $300.00. They also each receive the bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum. There is an enrolment of 87 pupils, with an average attendance of about 50. The Inspector states that these two teachers are very devoted and competent and are successful in their teaching. There is a good school building at this point, with two class-rooms.\n\nThere is no doubt that the salaries paid are small, but it is doubtful if, in the public schools in the surrounding districts, the teachers receive a much higher rate of pay.\n\nI would recommend that each of these teachers receive an increase of $50.00 in salary from the first of October, last, the beginning of the present quarter. I shall be pleased to have your decision regarding the matter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

They also each receive the bonus of $150.00, thus making the amount received by the principal $450.00 and the assistant $400.00.\n\nAt Bersimis the teachers are paid $275.00 each and they also receive the bonus of $150.00, a combined salary and bonus of $425.00.\n\nThe salaries of the two teachers at Restigouche have recently been increased and they receive, from the first of October, last, salaries as follows, the principal $450.00 and the assistant $350.00.\n\nI would recommend that the salaries of the teachers at the Lorette, Pointe Bleue and Bersimis Schools be increased to the same amount as at Restigouche, as the teachers at all these schools have a large attendance and perform the same duties and they are giving satisfaction in their work. At Restigouche there was an enrolment of 87 pupils with an average of\nof about 50; at Lorette the enrolment is 68 pupils and the average attendance 60; at Pointe Bleue the enrolment is 85 with an average attendance of 62 and at Bersimis the enrolment during six months of year is about 96 and for the September quarter last, the average attendance was 92. During the winter the Indians are away hunting and the enrolment at the Bersimis School is about 25, with an average of 21.\n\nIf my recommendation is approved, the salary of the principal of Lorette should be increased by $200.00 and the assistant by $100.00; at Pointe Bleue the salary of the principal should be increased by $150.00 and the assistant by $100.00 and at Bersimis the salary of the principal should be increased by $175.00 and the assistant by $75.00. By allowing these increases the salaries at these three schools will be the same as paid the teachers at Restigouche.

It is difficult indeed for me to express to you how very deeply I feel in the matter, the genuine rejoicing which the glad tidings will occasion, the vindication of the staunch and sincere friendships, so firmly rivetted by my revered father during his lifetime and the personal elation at finding myself so tangibly befriended, all combine in making my gratitude complete and permanent.\n\nOn behalf of those who will so materially benefit through your liberality and of myself, I wish to thank you in all sincerity.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Also that the school books supplied are very limited in number.\n\nGeorge M. McDade,\nBarrister.\nOttawa, January 25, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to that portion of your letter of the 20th instant dealing with the subject of education on the Restigouche Indian Reserve I beg to say that inquiry is being made regarding the complaint made by the Indians to you that English is not taught in the school. The curriculum of the Department calls for instruction in English and it has always been understood that the teachers use that language in the class-room.\n\nWith reference to the supplying of text books I beg to say that requisitions are received from the teachers at frequent intervals and it is considered that an adequate supply of text books, stationery and other material is furnished. I may say that all the text books furnished by the Department are in the English language. The readers in use in the school are the Dominion Catholic series, published by D. & J. Sadlier, Montreal. A large requisition was received from the principal and filled in November, last, and another requisition reached the Department on the 17th instant and is being filled by the Government Stationery Office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It is stated that, while the Indian children desire to be taught English and French, French only is being taught and no instruction is given in the English language.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will furnish a full report regarding the instruction being given and the language taught the children in the class-room. You should also state whether the teachers are English or French speaking and whether they can teach the English language.\n\nIt is also stated that the quantity of books supplied is very limited. I may say that the requisitions forwarded by the teacher are supplied through the Government Stationery Office here and the Department will be pleased to order a sufficient supply for the use of the pupils, upon receipt of requisitions from the teacher. A requisition was received from Sister Mary of St. Joseph in October, last, and another reached the Department on the 17th instant. You should state whether you consider there is a sufficient quantity of text books, stationery and other school supplies for the pupils' use.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst.

L'assistance n'est certainement pas ce qu'elle devrait \u00eatre, les parents n'ont jamais pay\u00e9, nous n'avons pas m\u00eame un officier charg\u00e9 d'y voir, comme il \u00e9tait autrefois le constable de cette r\u00e9serve lorsque nous en avions un.\n\n2o: Depuis deux ans, aucune instruction en fran\u00e7ais n'est donn\u00e9e dans cette \u00e9cole, et c'est l\u00e0 ce qui est regrettable, mais les sauvages n'en voulaient point, et elle ne leur a point \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e.\n\n3o: Toute l'instruction qui se donne dans votre \u00e9cole de Restigouche SE DONNE EN ANGLAIS en s'aidant de l'idiome indien lorsque cela est n\u00e9cessaire.\n\n4o: Le personnel des employ\u00e9es dans votre \u00e9cole parlent l'anglais et DONNENT L'INSTRUCTION EN ANGLAIS. Sr.M.de Ste.Brigide, dont le nom de famille est \"Rowney\", est une IRLANDAISE de famille et l'anglais est sa langue maternelle. Sr.M.de St.Joseph, quoique de famille canadienne-fran\u00e7aise, sait l'anglais, le parle et l'enseigne dans votre \u00e9cole \u00e0 l'exclusion de toute autre langue, selon le d\u00e9sir des sauvages et les prescriptions ou l'autorisation du D\u00e9partement.\n\nDonc, la plainte de votre correspondant est erron\u00e9e, fausse, idiote et malicieuse, et sans aucun fondement. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, \u00e9videmment, dans le but de cr\u00e9er du trouble, de jeter des doutes ou de soulever des pr\u00e9occupations. Votre correspondant devrait \u00eatre invit\u00e9 \u00e0 faire la preuve de ses avances afin de pr\u00e9venir \u00e0 l'avenir ces rapports aussi \u00e9videmment faux qu'il a fallu, pour les porter, l'absence de tout jugement.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nJos.T.X. Basse, M.D.,\nAgent des sauvages,\nD\u00e9partement des Affaires Indiennes,\nOttawa.\nRestigouche, 2nd February, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reference to your letter, No. 26-1-1, of the 25th January, 1921, I regret that I have to say that the correspondence which you have received concerning the instruction given at the school of this reserve is not only exaggerated but is also absolutely false.\n\nFirst: The children of the Indians of this reserve do not desire to educate themselves either in French or in English, and the parents do not seem to appreciate education, as they do not seem to care to send their children to school. The attendance is certainly not what it should be, the parents do not see to it and we have no officer in charge to look over it, as the constable of the reserve used to do when we had one.\n\nSecondly: For the last two years no instruction is given in French at this school, and that is what is regrettable, but the Indians did not want it and it was not imposed on them.\n\nThird: All the instruction which is given in your school of Restigouche is given in English with the help of the Indian idioms when necessary.\n\nFourth: The teachers employed in your school speak English and give the instruction in English. Sister Mary of St. Brigitte, whose family name is \"Romney,\" is Irish by her family and English is her mother tongue. Sister Mary of St. Joseph, although of a French Canadian family, knows English, speaks it and teaches it at your school at the exclusion of all other languages, according to the wish of the Indians and the prescriptions and authorization of the Department.\n\nTherefore the complaint of your correspondent is erroneous, false, idiotic and malicious, and without any foundation. It was made evidently with the object of creating trouble, to cast doubts and to raise prejudice. Your correspondent should be brought to proper charges so as to prevent such evidently false reports being made in the future, as they bear absence of all judgment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJos. F. A. Bosse, M.D.\nIndian Agent.\nFebruary 17th, 1921\n\nSecretary Department Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn re 26-1-1\n\nWith further reference to yours of the 25th ult., relative to the subject of education on the Restigouche Indian Reserve, I beg to make enquiry if investigation has been made into the complaint that the English language is not being properly taught in the Indian schools.\n\nChief Laroque has advised me that the Indians are especially desirous that the children shall be taught both English and French, and that steps be taken to afford them a course of study in both these great languages.\n\nI would thank you to kindly advise me.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGM/KB\nOttawa, February 21, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant with further reference to the complaint made to you regarding the subject of education on the Restigouche Indian Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a report on this matter has recently been received from our Indian Agent at Restigouche and he states as follows - for the last two years no instruction has been given in French at this school. The Indians did not want it and it was, therefore, not imposed on them. All instruction in the class-room is given in English, with the help of the Indian language, when necessary. The teachers employed speak English. The senior teacher speaks English only, while the assistant is a French Canadian and speaks both English and French. The text books provided are in the English language. The Indians themselves a few years ago protested against the teaching of French in this school and desired that their children be instructed in English only and this has been the language used and taught in the class-room during the past two years. The Department has no objection to the teaching of French, which was, along with English, formerly taught. The parents take very little interest in the education of their children and the attendance is very irregular.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGeorge M.

Bost\u00e9,\nNistigouche.\n\nMonsieur,\n\nLe nombre toujours croissant de nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves n\u00e9cessite nous permet de vous esp\u00e9rer qu'il serait urgent d'ouvrir une nouvelle classe afin de promouvoir leur avancement. L'inscription est de 115 actuellement et l'assistance est souvent au-dessus de 80; nos salles ne peuvent plus en recevoir et chaque enfant n'a pas le nombre de pieds carr\u00e9s d'air prescrit par les r\u00e9glements. La premi\u00e8re classe comprend quatre divisions et la deuxi\u00e8me, trois, a qui donne un surcro\u00eet de travail aux institutrices.\n\nDans l'assurance que vous prendrez notre demande en consid\u00e9ration et que vous aurez l'obligeance de faire les d\u00e9marches n\u00e9cessaires aupr\u00e8s du D\u00e9partement.\n\nJe me dis,\n\nVotre humble,\n\nSi Marie de St. Joseph,\nInstitutrice.\nSir,\n\nL'encouragement que les Reverends P\u00e9res Missionnaires de cette r\u00e9serve, les Reverends S\u0153urs Institutrices et moi-m\u00eame, nous effor\u00e7ons de donner aux enfants sauvages de cette r\u00e9serve, et le concours bienveillant du D\u00e9partement des Affaires des sauvages et surtout l'ouverture d'une classe de cinqui\u00e8me qui permet de donner un peu \u00e0 deux ou trois \u00e9l\u00e8ves pauvres et \u00e9loign\u00e9s a eu pour r\u00e9sultat d'augmenter consid\u00e9rablement l'assistance moyenne des enfants aux classes, et les quelques places d'habitu\u00e9s donn\u00e9es derni\u00e8rement et que nous pouvons faire encore dans l'avenir \u00e0 Jusqu'ici m\u00eame le total d'inscriptions de 112, et l'assistance moyenne de 80. Ce r\u00e9sultat est certainement de nature \u00e0 encourager les efforts commenc\u00e9s et montre que la voie dans laquelle nous nous sommes engag\u00e9s peut \u00eatre suivie avec avantage.\n\nIl y a donc lieu de constater ce progr\u00e8s et de pr\u00e9voir ce qui pourrait encore s'ajouter, au tout au moins le continuer. Dans l'ordre, et en premier lieu, serait l'organisation d'une \u00e9cole pensionnaire, chose sur laquelle j'aimerais pouvoir de revenir avant le printemps.\n\nApr\u00e8s que les Reverends P\u00e9res et les Reverends S\u0153urs Institutrices m'auront parl\u00e9 de ce qui devrait se faire imm\u00e9diatement, je les ai pri\u00e9s de bien vouloir me donner leurs vues par \u00e9crit et je vous envoie aujourd'hui leurs lettres demandant une troisi\u00e8me institutrice. Les raisons donn\u00e9es sont, je crois, tr\u00e8s suffisantes : deux institutrices pour 80 enfants sont certainement insuffisantes pour les raisons qu'ils vous donnent, et je ne puis que prier le D\u00e9partement de bien vouloir faire face \u00e0 la situation en ouvrant une troisi\u00e8me classe et en payant le salaire d'une troisi\u00e8me institutrice qui sera fournie encore par la Communaut\u00e9 des Reverends S\u0153urs du St. Roseire, et que cette communaut\u00e9 est pr\u00eate \u00e0 fournir.\n\nIl y a encore une deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l'\u00e9cole : une salle inoccup\u00e9e qui aurait servi \u00e0 cette troisi\u00e8me classe; il n'y aurait pour le d\u00e9partement qu'\u00e0 fournir en plus que 10 pupitres nouvelles (20 \u00e9l\u00e8ves), 1 tricorne pour la ma\u00eetresse et deux tableaux noirs.\n\nIl serait tr\u00e8s avantageux que cette classe put s'ouvrir apr\u00e8s la vacance de No\u00ebl, et j'ose esp\u00e9rer que le d\u00e9partement donnera sans tarder son approbation \u00e0 l'engagement d'une troisi\u00e8me ma\u00eetresse, et verra \u00e0 faire parvenir le mat\u00e9riel n\u00e9cessaire.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nAgent des sauvages.\n\nD\u00e9partement des Affaires Indiennes,\nOttawa.\nRistigouche, P.Q.,\nDecember 11th, 1883.\n\nJos. F. K. Ross, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nRistigouche, P.Q.\n\nSir:\n\nI have visited the classes of the Indians, and I found that the attendance was much better than the past year. The Indians seem to be very much attached to the classes, they read well, and have good writing, especially among those who are most assiduous. I also noted that the classes are crowded, and there are too many divisions in the advanced classes. Would it not be possible to furnish a new class, on the second floor, which is already to be used, and to employ a third teacher. In this way more attention could be devoted to children who have too much time to play when the teacher is explaining the lessons to the children of the other divisions in the class.\n\nThe Rev. Sisters could furnish another teacher at the beginning of next year.\n\nI am told that the number of children registered is 110, and that the average attendance is about 80. This is too many for the most advanced to get all the benefits they should receive in their classes when the teacher has to divide her time into four (4) parts.\n\nI dare hope that you will consider this question and that you will be able to take action in the near future.\n\nYours, etc.\n\nJ. Placide\nVicar of the Mission.\nSir:\n\nThe number of our Micmac pupils is constantly increasing, we take permission to express that it would be urgent to open a third class so as to help their advancement. The registration is at present one hundred and twelve (112), and the attendance is often above eighty (80). Our classes cannot receive more, and each child has not the required number of cubic feet of air prescribed by the regulations. The first class comprises four (4) divisions, and the second three (3) which gives a great deal of overwork to the teachers.\n\nHoping that you will kindly take our request into earnest consideration, and that you will kindly take the necessary steps with the Department, I remain\n\nYours very humbly,\n\nSister Mary of St. Joseph,\nTeacher\nSir:\n\nThe devotion of the Rev. Missionary Fathers of this Reserve, that of the Rev. Teaching Sisters and myself, who are directing all our efforts to give the Indian children of this Reserve, together with the splendid help of the Department of Indian Affairs, and especially the opening of a cooking class which permits to give some dinners to the local children attending who live at a distance; this has had as result to increase the average attendance considerably of children attending classes, and a few dollars which were spent recently to clothe a few of them and which we could furnish again in the future has, until now, brought the total of names registered to 113, and the average attendance to 80. This result is certainly of such nature to encourage the efforts which have been started and shows that the policy followed can be very profitable.\n\nIt is, therefore, interesting to know this progress and to increase it or at least keep it going. The first thing to do would be to organize a boarding school, a matter on which I will have the pleasure to write again before the Spring.\n\nAs the Rev. Fathers and the Rev. Sisters have spoken to me about what should be done immediately, I requested them to kindly give me their opinion in writing, and I am enclosing herewith their letters asking for a third teacher. The reasons given, I believe, are very satisfactory; two teachers for 80 children is certainly not sufficient for the reasons which they give, and I can only beg the Department to meet the situation by opening a third class and paying the salary of a third teacher who would be furnished again by the Rev. Sisters of the St. Rosary.\n\nThere is remaining on the second floor of the school an unoccupied room which could be used for this third class; the Department would only have to furnish ten (10) double desks (30 pupils) a desk for the teacher and two blackboards.\n\nIt would be advantageous if this class could be opened after the Christmas holidays, and I dare hope the Department will give its approval to the nomination of a third teacher, and send the necessary material without delay.\n\nYours, etc.,\n\nJos.

December 13th, 1922.\n\nTo the Superintendent of\nINDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nI beg to call your attention to the fact that there are now 105 pupils enrolled in the Restigouche Indian School. At the time of my visit, I suggested to the Department that before making any additions to the building, it would be preferable to consider the fact of establishing a boarding-school. Now I am informed that it would not be necessary to enlarge the building, but that a third class could be opened in the second story. The class furniture alone would be needed. I hope that you will consider this question attentively because the pupils are really too numerous for two class-rooms only. Should you want any other explanations, I would be at your disposal and I could visit the school at very little cost.\n\nHoping the new class will be opened this coming January or February,\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nI.E.\nOTTAWA, December 26th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, relative to the need for more accommodation in the Restigouche Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Department is making arrangements for the opening of an extra classroom and the appointment of a third teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The contract price was $3875. It is a two storey building, the lower storey having two classrooms and the upper was for use as a residence for the teaching Sisters. The building is heated by a furnace. Adequate drainage facilities were provided at the time the school was built, and the drainage was thoroughly overhauled and put in good repair during the summer of 1924. The school is built on property which belongs to the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIn December, 1922, it was necessary, owing to the increased attendance, to provide a third classroom, and one of the rooms in the teachers' residence portion was taken for this purpose. Since that time the Rev. Sisters have taken up the teaching of domestic science, and are now using the whole of this building for school purposes. The Rev. Sisters reside in the Convent near the school, and do not occupy any part of the school building for residence purposes.\n\nA request has been received from the Superior of the Capuchin Order, at Restigouche, who are the missionaries to the Indians at that point, for a grant of $300 to make certain alterations to a part of their convent to provide residential facilities for the 3 teachers of the Indian school.\nRestigouche, June 11.\n\nTo the Superintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nKind Sir,\n\nWith all your usual kindness and benevolence, I feel invited to solicit a favor in honor of the grand feast of the Confederation. In order to commemorate the said celebrations and give the pupils a grand idea of them, I very respectfully beg leave to close our school this year on the 23rd of June, with the understanding that the pupils will be invited to attend the annual picnic which will take place on the 4th of July. This picnic will crown the series of the patriotic holidays granted them which will surely influence them with\nregard to \"love of country.\"\n\nWith the assurance that you will kindly favor me with a prompt reply, and thanking you for your habitual courtesy and numerous benefits which we sincerely appreciate, I beg to remain,\n\nYour very grateful,\nSr. Mary of St. Joseph,\nteacher.\nOttawa, June 13, 1927.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, and in reply beg to inform you that the Department will approve of your closing the Restigouche Indian Day School on the 23rd instant. We have informed Mr. Agent Desy of the permission granted you to close the school. We note that the pupils will be invited to attend a picnic on the 1st of July to celebrate Confederation.\n\nYou will be good enough to prepare and forward, through the office of your local Indian Agent, the quarterly return of attendance, etc., for the current quarter, after the school closes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister Mary of St. Joseph,\nTeacher, Indian Day School,\nRestigouche, P.Q.\nOttawa, November 12, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of a communication from the Sister in charge of the Restigouche Indian Day School, which was forwarded by you, requesting that fuel be supplied for the use of their residence.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that, in order to assist the Rev. Sisters in providing the fuel required, the Department prefers to grant an increase in salary in lieu of payment for the cost of the fuel. At the present time, Sister Mary Stella Lucas and Sister Mary of St. Viateur are each in receipt of salary at the rate of $50 per teaching month. The Department will grant such an increase of $5 per teaching month in salary from the 1st of October, last. This will make their salaries from that date at the rate of $55 per teaching month, or a total increase to the Sisters of $100 per annum. In view of this increase, the Department should not be requested to pay any part of the cost of supplying fuel for the teachers' residences. Please inform the Rev. Sister accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. F. Deay, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nRestigouche, P.Q.\nSir\n\nAn English man named Kelley wants the permission to send his three children to the Indian school.\n\nHe wants to know how much you will charge him a month.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 13, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 10th instant, I beg to say that the Department considers, if all the children of school age on the Restigouche Reserve attend school regularly, there is no room for other pupils, and we are, therefore, not prepared to authorize the attendance of the children mentioned in your letter.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. Richard, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nRestigouche, P.Q.\nEXTRACT from Report of Inspector J. A. Leblanc, dated September 25th, 1931, regarding his inspection of the Restigouche Indian Day School.\n\nOriginal on File 26-1-6.\n\nI was surprised last year when I first visited the Indian schools that the school hours are longer in the Indian schools than in the other schools of the Province of Quebec. I find that the school hours are really too long. I think it would be well to take off half an hour, fifteen minutes in the morning and fifteen minutes in the afternoon. The length of the school hours would be the same as in the other schools, five hours and a half with a short recess of ten minutes in each session. I hope that the Department will take this request in consideration and make this change as soon as possible.\n| CENTRAL REGISTRY | REFERRED TO | DATE REC'D | INITIALS | CENTRAL REGISTRY | REFERRED TO | DATE REC'D | INITIALS |\n|-----------------|-------------|------------|----------|-----------------|-------------|------------|----------|\n\nIndian Affairs.

There is no correspondence on file regarding a change of teachers at this school, and I would appreciate your advising when the two last named Sisters began duties and their qualifications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Sister Mary of St. Joseph,\nTeacher, Indian Day School,\nRestigouche, P. Q.\nTo the Secretary\nDept. of Ind. Affairs\nOttawa\n\nKind Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 6th instant no. 26-1-1, I very humbly acknowledge that I am faulty for having neglected to notify the Department of the change of teacher which could not be avoided for sundry reasons. It did not come to my mind that there could be any inconvenience to the change owing to the fact that the de-\nparted teachers have been replaced by Sisters of the same community. Sister M. of St. Bridget began duties in September 1933, and Sister M. of the Guardian Angel, September 1933; both are professionals; the former having been teaching for twenty-seven years, and the latter, for thirty years.\n\nI trust you will kindly excuse the misadventure and believe in my good will to avoid it in the future.\n\nIn this hope and thanking for all past kindness, I respectfully remain,\n\nYour very grateful\nSister M. of St. Joseph\nTeacher\nOttawa, May 1st, 1934.\n\nMadam:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th instant, in which you state that Sister Mary of St. Bridget and Sister Mary of the Guardian Angel have replaced Sister Mary of St. Luc and Sister Mary of St. Viateur, at the Restigouche Indian Day School. The appointment of the first two named Sisters is approved.

Q.\nAugust 13, 1934\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to give notice that Sister Mary of the Guardian Angel is compelled to withdraw from teaching on account of her health. Consequently, I respectfully pray the Department to accept Sister Mary of St Peter in her stead; the latter being professionally qualified to replace her.\n\nI myself, after twenty-five years of incessant teaching in this school, feel I should somewhat alleviate my task and take a little rest. So I\nbeg leave to share my work with the Superior of our community, Sister Mary of St John the Baptist, who besides sundry qualifications has many years' experience in teaching. Besides teaching teaching as much as my strength will permit, I will continue to have the general management of the school and will train the little girls in household work.\n\nRelying on your habitual benevolence, I am assured that you will kindly comply with my request. Begging you to do so, I respectfully extend to you my cordial thanks for past kindness.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSr. Mary of St Joseph\nOttawa, August 17, 1934.\n\nMadam:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant, I beg to say that the appointment of Sister Mary of St. Peter, to replace Sister Mary of the Guardian Angel at the Restigouche Indian Day School, is approved.\n\nAs you are aware, the salaries of the teachers of Indian Day Schools are being paid monthly, and, from your letter, it appears that the following names should appear on our September pay list:\n\nSister Mary of St. Joseph,\n\" \" \" \" Bridget,\n\" \" \" \" Peter.\n\nIf the above is incorrect, you should advise me at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Richard,\nIndian Agent.\nRestigouche, 10th September 1936.\n\nReport of Council Meeting.\n\nOn this 9th day of September, 1936, according to the request of Chief, Frank Isaac, a Council meeting was held this day at 7 o'clock P.M. in the Indian Office for the general purposes of the Restigouche Indian Reserve, on the presidency of Dr. Art. Richard, Indian Agent.\n\nWere present:- Chief Frank Isaac and all the Councillors, James Weyouche, Albert Martin, Anthony Dedam and Dan Basque.\n\n1. It was moved by Chief Frank Isaac, seconded by all the Councillors that all kind of disturbances being increased upon the Restigouche Reserve, and some children being running in the road during the school time and late at night, we, Officers, beseech the Department to appoint an Indian man as Constable and Truant-Officer in order to keep the good order upon the Restigouche Reserve.\n\n2. It was moved by Chief, Frank Isaac, seconded by all the Councillors that we would like to have in the same time or our new school next year a teacher well qualified for high class for the pupils willing to perform good education.\n\nAfter having talk and come to good understanding for the best administration of the Reserve, the meeting closed at 9 o'clock P.M.\n\nDr. Art. Richard,\nIndian Agent.\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAllow me to bring to your knowledge a few reasons that urge us to ask the permission to begin school at 12.40 P.M. and close at 3.40.\n\nAll the children having their dinner here are too numerous, as you know, to be served at the same time. While the third and the fourth group are taking their dinner, the first and the second group are out of doors and they find it hard to stay out in the cold until 1 o'clock. Many poorly clad little bodies shiver from the cold while we are powerless to better their condition. Had we a gymnasium it would be easy to send them in under the direction of one teacher!.....\n\nBut, the future prepares better days, does it not?.....\n\nIt would also be very advantageous to sweep the school rooms by day light. As there are no lights in the school, it is quite dark at 4 o'clock during the winter months.\nPlease, suffer another request. The teacher of the Superior Class being very skillful in drawing and carpenter's work, has given the boys a fondness for that handicraft which is a marvellous means to keep them at school, as well as to develop their skill.\n\nThe boys are anxious to have their share of work to exhibit, next June, along with the girls' sewing and knitting.\n\nFor the purpose, will you please, supply us with six (6) Coping Saws, three (3) sets of twelve blades and six (6) sheets 3 ply board, about 4 x 8 ft, or allow us to buy them at Eaton's. The whole will cost about $5.00.\n\nWe shall send the Department a few samples of their work.\n\nAwaiting a favorable answer and thanking you for past favors,\n\nI am,\nDear and kind Sir,\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nSister Mary of St. Leo, Principal\n\nIndian Day School\nRistigouche, Nov. 24, 1936.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sister Mary of St. Leo, Principal of the Restigouche Indian Day School, requesting permission to re-open the school after the noon recess at 12.40 p.m. and close for the day at 3.40 p.m.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, owing to the circumstances, as mentioned in the Principal's letter, the Department will have no objection to the classes at this school being conducted between the hours as mentioned by the Principal.\n\nThe Department will approve of an expenditure of approximately $8.00 in the supplying of six coping saws, 3 sets of 12 blades and 6 sheets of 3-ply board, to be used in giving instruction to the boys in handicraft work. Please obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nPlease advise the Rev. Principal of the approval granted for the conducting of the classes during the hours mentioned in her letter and for the supplying of the material for the boys for handicraft purposes.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nDr. A. Richard,\nIndian Agent,\nRestigouche,\nQue.\nTo Mr Sutherland, Superintendent\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nKind and dear Sir,\n\nThe honor of meeting you has not been conferred on me yet; nevertheless the high position you occupy is a testimony of the beautiful qualities with which you are endowed. Fully confident in your kindness and benevolence I respectfully come to ask you the favor of a \"bonus\" about one hundred and seventy-five ($175.00) dollars.\n\nAllow me to sum up a few reasons that provoke such a demand:\n\nFirstly, to help paying the expenses of \"Nurse Training\" I am actually engaged in, at Campbellton Hospital. Then I intend to go to St-John N.B. or to Montreal where children only are treated. That special training is for the benefit of our little Micmac children and their mothers, as we live with the prospect of a dispensary in a near future.\n\nSecondly, our Sisters here, since over 25 years have done the work of a janitor without any salary. Do you realize the amount of work and fatigue of those sisters who light, poke up and clean the furnace, cord wood besides the sweeping of the class-rooms?\n\nThirdly, during the recent fire the devotedness of\nthe Sisters prevented greater damage and losses in the Indian School. For were it not for the watchfulness exercised by one of them, the heating furnace, the pupils' seats and desks would have been torn to pieces. Owing to a timely \"stop\" just a couple of pipes and a few seats were dislocated.\n\nIn fine, on the occasion of two glorious events: that of the crowning of His Majesty King George VI and that of the Golden Jubilee of our Reverend Mother Superior General. On similar occasions, the Government has already granted rewards or bonuses to some persons who distinguished themselves with some particular achievement.\n\nThose commentaries, I agree, are somewhat superfluous; your kind heart would have accepted my petition with less details; but knowing your manifold callings I thought it proper to give you the intuition of our situation.\n\nWith every good wish for an abundance of blessings both spiritual and temporal, throughout the new year, and thanking you for past favors,\n\nI am,\n\nDear and kind Sir,\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nSister Mary of St. Leo, Principal\n\nIndian Day School\nRestigouche, Jan. 8, 1937.\nOttawa, January 13, 1937.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your recent letter requesting a grant of $175 to assist you in paying your expenses in taking a proposed \"Nurse Training\" course.\n\nWhile the Department appreciates the excellent services given at Restigouche by the Reverend Sisters, I regret that we have no appropriation from which to provide the grant you request.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Eucharist Senior Class $550\nSister M. of St. Peter Intermediate Course\nSister M. of St. Cecilia Primary Course\n\nA fourth teacher shall be appointed when the new school is ready.\nEvery day this week we expected to be told by Agent Dr. Richard, that we should look for a local to open school; but as he is still silent, we respectfully beg that you let us know as soon as possible whether you intend to have classes open in September.\n\nWith humble submission,\n\nI am,\nDear Sir,\nVery respectfully Yours,\nSister Mary of St. Leo\nOttawa, September 3, 1937\n\nDear Madam,\n\nI note from your letter of the 27th ultimo that the following staff will be in charge of the Restigouche Indian Day School during the academic year 1937-38:\n\nSister M. of St. Leo - Principal\nSister M.

Isaac, Peter Sewell, Anthony Dedam, absent Dan Basque, Sr.\n\nI\n\nIt was moved by Chief Frank Isaac, seconded by all the Councillors that considering the young pupils starting the school don't understand, for the part of them, the English language, we request the Department to place in the first class a Teacher talking good English and good Micmac language. In doing so we believe that our young pupils shall have more encouragement and earlier learning.\n\nII\n\nIt was moved by Chief Frank Isaac, seconded by all the Councillors and the Band that upon the Restigouche Indian Reserve having no regular Police to patrol the Reserve and to keep the good order regularly, we beseech the Department to appoint a man as Truant Officer in order to have all the children at the school.\n\nAlso we beseech the Department to appoint a man as Janitor in order to look after the school building and to keep the furnace with good fire all winter.\n\nIf these two requests are accepted we recommend the nomination of the Indian Jos Gray as Truant Officer and as Janitor.\n\nMeeting closed at 8\u00bd p.m.\n\nIndian Agent.\nRestigouche, November 24th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to include the minutes of the Council meeting of this Reserve held Saturday evening at 7 o'clock p.m. for the general purposes of the Reserve.\n\nAt this meeting two motions were moved for which motions I am submitting the approval of the Department. In the first motion asking for Teacher talking good Micmac, we will have to take a Micmac girl, because no Sister Teacher able to speak good Micmac.

In addition, no funds were especially provided in the current year's appropriation for a fourth teacher. Under the circumstances just mentioned, the Department is not prepared to authorize a fourth teacher during the balance of the current academic year.\n\nThe matter will be again carefully reviewed at the end of June 1938 and, if funds can be provided for the academic year 1938-39 for a fourth teacher, you will be notified in time for you to secure the services of such a teacher before September 1st.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

In this new school building are three classrooms well arranged with one hundred seats, than for one hundred pupils. Now the question is what we will do with the over thirty others asking to follow the classes.\n\nI want to ask to the Department to tell us what is the best measure to be taken to satisfy the majority of them, and to prevent trouble.\n\nOur suggestion, the Principal and I, was that the Department could send us order to refuse the admittance to school all the youngest aged 7 and 8 years of age. If your experience gives us better ways to resolve this problem, we will be very pleased to accept it. We don't want trouble and we like to give satisfaction.

For a time last year there were over sixty in the same room, and the teacher could not learn them on account of the quantity. Having not seats enough the teacher have to pile them everywhere. If at the opening of the school are not too many the teacher will keep them all day, but too many the teacher don't know how to do.

If there are too many for the teachers to handle you may divide them into two sections, one half of the children to come in the morning and the other in the afternoon.\n\nAuthority has already been given to you to repair the desks. It is not possible for the Department to secure the pieces of iron which you mention. Possibly you could secure these from some blacksmith in the vicinity of Restigouche.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Richard, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nRestigouche, Que.\nOttawa, Ont., March 31, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following inspection report made at L\u00e9vis, Quebec, from March 16th to 22nd, 1938.\n\nII. Upon my visit to the new school, I found three classes with following presence:\n\nSenior Class - 9 boys out of 12 registered.\n   6 girls out of 14 registered.\n\n3rd and 4th Grades - 15 boys out of 22 registered.\n   15 girls out of 16 registered.\n\nBaby class - There is a registration of 45 girls and 25 boys.\n   I was informed that owing to shortage of school room, 36 boys were present in forenoon and 30 girls, whom I saw, came in the afternoon.\n\nIt was a surprise to me that the new school did not provide more space than the old school did, and with more children to be of school age next September. It is hardly believable that the department did not have a proper report as to the number of children of school age. If all children of school age are to attend school, an additional wing could easily be erected and should receive immediate attention.\n\nI particularly noticed the healthy appearance of the school children in general, which is due to the extra food milk and cold liver oil freely distributed to the children at school since last year. Their eyes are bright and smiling, their faces show colour and their spirits are high and happy. The sisters expressed their satisfaction of such treatment to the children.\n\nJude Thibault,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nQuebec Inspectorate.\nOttawa, Ont., March 31, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following inspection report made at Restigouche, Que. from March 16th to 22nd, 1938.\n\n12.\n\nA council meeting was held on March 17th in the evening.\n\nA few matters were brought up.\n\n1. Why was the suggestion of an Indian teacher for the school refused in 1937?\n\nTo the first question, my answer was that the Department must have decided it best to trust all teaching to the one community of sisters.\n\nJude Thibault,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nQuebec Inspectorate.\nIndian Day School\nRestigouche, June 20, 1938.\n\nTo the Secretary\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter 26- I - I, Jan. 12 I respectfully beg that you let us know, as soon as possible, whether the Department will authorize a fourth teacher for the Indian Day School for the year 1938-39.\n\nAs our Reverend Mother General has to give the Sisters' appointment early in July, your answer would greatly oblige her.\n\nNo doubt, the Department is aware of the fact that 53 boys and 30 girls of the baby class are at school but 3 hours daily owing to lack of space.\n\nWith sentiments of religious esteem,\n\nI am,\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nSister Mary of St. Leo, Principal\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJuly 6, 1938.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo in reference to the possibility of allowing a fourth teacher at the Restigouche Indian school for the academic year 1938-39. I regret that in preparing our estimates for the current fiscal year, it was not found possible to include the salary for a fourth teacher. Consequently, we will not be able to authorize the employment of one.\n\nIn preparing our appropriation for the fiscal year 1939-40, we will include the amount necessary for a fourth teacher and this will permit such an appointment from September 1, 1939.\n\nI feel certain that the Reverend Sisters will do the best they can under the circumstances during the coming academic year, as we have expended a very large amount of money at the Restigouche school during the past 18 months, and we have so many demands from other parts of the country that we are unable to allow Restigouche as much as you may consider we should.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\n\nSister Mary of St. Leo, Principal,\nIndian Day School,\nRestigouche, Quebec.\nTo the Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nI respectfully beg leave to recall the attention of the honourable Department of Indian affairs to the fact a fourth teacher is necessarily required at the Restigouche Indian Day School, as the pupils of Grades - one and two now number eighty - four.\n\nNo teacher can properly manage to order improve-alone so many giddy little Indian heads.\n\nI trust you will kindly take the matter under benevolent consideration and provide for the appointment of a fourth teacher at our Indian Day School for the fiscal year 1939-1940, as you have previously stated - in your honoured letter of July 6th 1938, you would do so.\n\nWith hearty thanks for past favors and season's greetings.\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nGentlemen,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nIndian Day School,\nRestigouche, Jan. 17, 1939.\nDear Madam:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant you may engage a fourth teacher for the Restigouche school for the academic year 1939-40.

She has been teaching these last 38 years, of which one in Restigouche Indian School and always proved to be successful.\n\nMoreover, the said sister has gone through a special training of wood work, and will attend the technical summer school, this year, so as to gain full practical knowledge in tooling.\n\nOwing to these special qualifications, I would insist on having this fourth teacher granted a salary of $600.00. Another reason which makes me apply for said salary is to help us paying the firewood for teachers' Residence which is entirely to our charge; whilst in other Indian schools, I hear, teachers are not charged with the heating of their residence.\n\nTrusting that you will consider these facts and grant them just regards,\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nGentlemen,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSister Mary of St Leo, Principal\n\nIndian Affairs.

Bonaventure, 1816-1870\n\nMonsieur,\n\nPermettez-moi de vous faire remarquer que le ch\u00e8que perdu en remplacement duquel nous avons demand\u00e9 une duplicata \u00e9tait en faveur de S\u0153ur Marie de S.-L\u00e9germond et non de S\u0153ur Marie de Sainte-Brigitte, bien qu'\u00e9tant de m\u00eame valeur.\n\nNous comptons donc cette fois une r\u00e9ponse favorable.\n\nS\u0153ur M. de S.-L\u00e9germond\n\u00c9cole indienne\nRestigouche\nKettlecreek Indian School,\nSaanich County,\nNovember 16, 1940.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to bring your attention to the fact that the cheque in replacement of which we were asking for a duplicate was issued in favour of St. Marie de S. Ignace but not in favour of St. Marie de Sainte-Beatrix although being for the same amount as the latter. Therefore we hope to receive this time, a favorable answer.\n\n(Signed) Sam. P. de S. Ignace\nIndian School\nKettlecreek\nOttawa, November 18, 1940.\n\nReverend Sister,\n\nRetirement Fund.\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 16th instant, I have to inform you that Order-in-Council, No.1/1569, dated April 19, 1940, authorizes the Department to deduct, from May 1, 1940, 5% of the salaries of employees appointed to temporary positions since September 1, 1930, to be deposited in the Retirement Fund and paid on resignation from the Public Service with interest at the rate of 4% per annum.\n\nFrom the 1st May to the 30th June and continuously from the 1st September, 5% has been deducted from your salary and deposited in the Retirement Fund. We did not request the Department of Finance to issue a cheque in your favour for the amount at your credit in the Fund on the 30th June, as you were to continue teaching in the Restigouche Indian Day School during the academic year 1940-1941, beginning September 1, 1940. In fact the Department of Finance cannot issue a cheque covering any part of the amount at your credit in the Retirement Fund, but the total amount will be returned to you when you cease to receive a salary from the Department.\n\nSr. Mary of St. Brigid's services ceased July 1, 1940, therefore a cheque No.2445, for $6.01, covering the amount deducted from her salary from 1st May to 30th June, inclusive, with interest at 4%, was forwarded to her.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL.W.

Nous n'avons pas demand\u00e9 au minist\u00e8re d'\u00e9mettre un ch\u00e8que en votre faveur pour la somme apparaissant \u00e0 votre cr\u00e9dit au fonds de retraite le 30 juin, car vous deviez continuer \u00e0 enseigner \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole indienne de Restigouche pendant l'ann\u00e9e acad\u00e9mique 1940-41, commen\u00e7ant le 1er septembre 1940. En fait, le minist\u00e8re des Finances ne peut \u00e9mettre un ch\u00e8que couvrant une partie quelconque de la somme \u00e0 votre cr\u00e9dit au fonds de retraite, mais le montant total vous sera remis lorsque vous cesserez de recevoir un salaire de ce minist\u00e8re.\n\nLes services de Soeur Marie de Sainte-Brigitte ont cess\u00e9 le 1er juillet 1940.

The said Society states on receiving our enrolment forms.\n\n\"There is no membership fee; but Branches are asked to donate towards the cost of supplies sent to them. Sums varying from a few cents to $1.00 per member. This donation however, is not compulsory for membership.\"\n\nThe Junior Red Cross has already forwarded to us a generous box of material, to be confectioned, and every one is eager to exhibit her or his skill.\n\nI am asking you, kind Mr. Hoey, to fix the amount you would judge reasonable for the postage of parcels sent to the Headquarters monthly.\n\nIn my opinion, $5.00 to $8.00 would be sufficient.

In this section, the children are not kept home to work at crops or digging potatoes, as it happens in some reserves; besides, there is an economy in fuel and light by closing school in January.

He even looked himself in our environment for a vacant apartment where a temporary classroom could be placed.\n\nBy your letter of the 3rd instant you benevolently stated that the Honourable Staff of Indian Affairs realized the necessity of an increase accommodation for the school but having to face the present crisis, you would have to postpone such a heavy expenditure till after war.\n\nAfter discussing this fact with the local authorities, we have thought that the most economic means to remedy this case, would be to have an auxiliary for the primary grade. This person could teach about two hours daily to the twenty new-comers, in the sewing room. Such procedure would occasion an expense of only $15.00 monthly and also permit me to maintain the same teacher, Sister Mary of St. Lucia, in the same class without exposing her health.\n\nThe teaching staff of the Restigouche Indian Day School would then be:\n\n- Sister Mary of St. Lucia, Primary Grade.\n- Mrs. Joe Labillois, Helping Teacher to the primary Grade. (A well educated Indian widow.)\n- Sister Mary of St. Luke, Intermediate.\n- Sister Mary of St. Andrew, Senior class of girls.\n- Sister Mary of the Holy Eucharist, Senior class of boys and principal.\n\nIf this proposal is suitable, kindly give your benevolent approbation.

This teacher's name will not appear on the pay list. It will be necessary, therefore, for you to make out a monthly voucher, have this voucher duly signed by the agent and forwarded to the Department.

Would you kindly let me have a cheque in her favour for the amount at her credit in the Retirement Fund? No overpayment of any kind to this employee is outstanding.\n\nW. JACKSON\nDeputy Minister.\nDear Sir,\n\nWith the arrival of the young Indian boys and girls who can neither understand nor utter an English word, the principal of the Restigouche Indian Day School has discussed the problem with the local authorities and we have felt prudent to present the matter to the Honourable Staff of Indian Affairs to see if it would be possible to engage the same Indian widow, Mrs. Joe Labillois, for about two hours daily at $15.00 a month, as an interpret teacher. Such would be a great help for the beginners and teachers.\n\nThat lady was in our midst last year and has proved herself worthy of our confidence. I could also quote that the said Indian widow has adopted last spring five young orphan children, on the death of both the father and mother of the abandoned ones. Do you not suppose that her small monthly salary which she would receive would not only be a help to her, but particularly a great encouragement to persist in her heroic charity? To my humble opinion, such devotedness on the part of an old mother who has generously brought up her own ten children decently deserves a special attention.\n\nI am leaving the whole to your well-known benevolence for your final decision. An affirmative answer from the Honourable Staff of Indian Affairs would be highly appreciated by your teaching staff.\n\nMost gratefully yours,\n\nSister M. of the Holy Eucharist, r.h.r.\nSister M. of the Holy Eucharist, r.h.r.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Richard, Indian Agent, Restigouche, Que.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the lst instant, forwarding a request from the Principal of the Restigouche School that we engage Mrs. Joe Labillois as interpreter.\n\nIt is definitely against the policy of the Department to employ an interpreter at an Indian school. Present teaching devices assist teachers in training pupils in English. Under these circumstances it is impossible to consider employment of the woman mentioned as an interpreter.\n\nIf Mrs. Labillois desires work it might be possible to employ her at some other activity.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir,\n\nThe teaching staff at the Restigouche Indian Day School has studied the previous volume of \"A Teacher's Guide Book of the Activating Program,\" and has been greatly interested in our instructional school program. We trust that such studies will be of great benefit towards the growth of our children.\n\nIt is obvious that the Activating Program calls for far more skilled teachers than normally in a normal situation.\n\nTo avoid failure, besides possessing thorough knowledge of the materials now contained in the new instructional school, the classes should be well provided with a necessary library for pupils and guides for the teacher, which we presently are lacking.\n\nI notice that for the preparation of a unit of work, one teacher has consulted three different libraries of the city, besides their school library. The answers we have had with success. Such investigations in our environment are not available but could be found out by an educated child. Could it not?\n\nWe feel strongly about the need to begin the study of the activating program during the fall semester.\n\nThe children who started in October are working with the new method and the change appears to be fascinating. The children seem to love school and teachers, but our experience is not long and we are not yet able to appreciate.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nSister M. of the Holy Eucharist,\nSister Mary of the Holy Innocent\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Mother Provincial of our Institute asked the teaching staff of the Restigoushe Indian Day School to make a yearly Triduum Retreat from January 30th to February 1st.\n\nSuch permission exceeds our kind Indian Agent's power.\n\nI am humbly soliciting these three holidays from your well-known benevolence, trusting that you will answer affirmatively to the Mother Provincial's ardent desire.\n\nGratefully yours,\n\nSister M. of the Holy Eucharist\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa\n\nBart.

The Act coming into effect only after the end of the present school year, we will not feel the reaction until next September.\n\nA display of made-over clothing was on exhibition for my visit, when I met members of the Women's Club.

Believe they should have at least one hour and a half. All over the province of Quebec close finishes at 14:30 and starts a new school.

Salary will be allowed her at the rate of $60.00 per teaching month, effective June 1, 1946.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\nOttawa, April 10, 1946.\n\nMEDICAL\n\nMr. Isaac Caplin, Councillor, and his wife, came to the front of the hall, and Mrs. Caplin gave a very realistic demonstration of a whipping her child had received from one of the Teaching Sisters. During her talk she became very excited, waving her arms\u2014kicking at times\u2014and stated that the teacher had called her child \"skunk, stink,\" etc.; she advised that as a result of this punishment the child's ears had been injured. I then asked her if she had witnessed the assault on her child, and she said \"no,\" but that her child had informed her of the ill-treatment she had received. I asked her when this happened and she informed me that it was about five years ago, and admitted, when questioned, that the Sister who administered the punishment was no longer at the school. I told the Chief that this charge was too ridiculous to be entertained, and that it would not be possible now to investigate the complaint and satisfactorily decide whether the punishment was unjust or not.\n\nMrs. W.P. Martin then came forward, and in tears and a quavering voice she stated that she did not want me to come back to Ottawa and condemn and blacken the good name and character of all the Indians at Restigouche because of an unfounded charge submitted by a disgruntled Indian woman, as there\nnot a word of truth in Mrs. Caplin's accusations. She stated that she and her large family had all gone utmost kindness and consideration. She further stated that, as a member of the Women's Homemakers' Club she spent a great deal of her time in the school and she never saw a school child ill-treated or abused, adding that if the children attended school regularly and applied themselves, undoubtedly, they would be much brighter and more intelligent. One of Mrs. Martin's boys, about eighteen years of age, came forward and corroborated his mother's statements. Other women members of the Homemakers' Club willingly confirmed everything said by Mrs. Martin. Note, there is a school for white children on the lot immediately adjoining the Indian school property. The teachers at this school are Sisters of the same Order as those teaching in the Indian school (residing in our residence). If they are qualified and satisfactory to teach the white children the, undoubtedly, they are capable of teaching in the Indian school.\n\nWhen I returned to Restigouche Indian Agent Arsenault informed me that Councillor Isaac Caplin had come to his office and complained that his little girl had been ill-treated by the teacher in the morning, and that as a result he was not going to send her to school anymore. Mr. Arsenault, being aware that this particular child had a heart condition, did not think that the teachers would ill-treat her because they had a couch in the school on which she was permitted to rest during the day. He therefore informed the Superior, Sister Euphrasia, of this charge. The Sister had a meeting of all the pupils in the class, and they stated very emphatically that the teacher had not in any way touched the child. The Superior then asked the teacher what happened, and she advised that just before lunch the child made the statement that she was not coming back to school again. I am firmly convinced that Isaac Caplin and his wife are deliberately trying to stir up resentment amongst the teachers. Complaints submitted by this couple should not be treated seriously.\n\nX X X\nJ.B. Morris,\nWelfare Division.\nMr. R. A. Hoey, Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe teaching staff of the Restigouche Indian Day School humbly applied in 1945, to the Honourable Department of Indian Affairs for an increase of the salary of each of its members, from $55. to $100. a month.\n\nTheir request was judged fair, but owing to lack of funds at that time, the grant was postponed. I sincerely trust that you now stand in the position of granting\u2014for this school year 1946\u201447 and subsequent ones\u2014to both Indian Day Schools of Restigouche and Dimock Creek (Maria) Reserves, to each teacher $100.00 a month during the ten regular school months.\n\nYou are no doubt aware that the principal of each of these two schools, supervises the work of a large school-garden which the pupils cultivate. She also keeps the Sunday School meetings of the Mothers' Clubs regularly during her summer holidays, thus, never allowing herself any vacation rest. Should you not consider it just that the principal be paid on a schedule of twelve months a year?\n\nUntil now, the teachers have received their monthly payments separately as lay teachers; they have been taxed, but were entitled to the living bonus. Would you permit us to enlist the teaching Sisters of both Indian Day Schools, as religious Communities, paying them each a monthly salary of $100.00 which I consider would be sufficient to meet their expenses. I and they understand that such procedure would deprive them of the living bonus grant, and at the same time cancel the tax charges to which they and I fully agree.\n\nPlease, take this my urgent request in kind consideration, for which I would feel gratefully obliged to you.\n\nRespectfully and cordially\n\nSister Mary of the Annunciation,\nSuperior General\nOttawa, August 29, 1946.\n\nReverend and dear Sister:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, regarding an increase in salary for the teachers at the Restigouche and Maria Indian Day Schools. Before deciding the salary rate that can be allowed in each case I would appreciate it if you would have each of the teachers complete and return one of the enclosed forms.\n\nWe are prepared to allow the Principal at each school salary at the rate of $100.00 a teaching month and for the assistants we will allow $90.00 a teaching month, if they hold the proper certificates and $80.00 a teaching month if they do not possess the required certificates.\n\nAs soon as you return the enclosed forms properly filled out your request will receive further consideration.\n\nI also note that in future you do not wish to pay Income Tax as all the Sisters are members of a Religious Order.

Sister Mary of St Lucia, teaching sister at the Restigouche School. In spite of that Sister does not possess the required qualifications for teaching, the inspector was very satisfied of the result obtained in that class and moreover he asked the Principal of the School to have the said Sister give a teaching demonstration to the teachers convention of this locality. She seems to be particularly gifted for the activity programme and the special demand from the inspector speaks in her favour.\n\nThe astonishing articles of woodwork exhibited, made under her supervision, have been highly proclaimed by the inspectors of the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEdgar Renault, Indian Agent.\nApplication FOR EMPLOYMENT IN INDIAN DAY SCHOOLS\n\nI hereby make application for employment in the ..............................................................

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nDear Sir:\n\nWould you please furnish me with the necessary information concerning the following matter.\n\nWe have here on Restigouche Reserve the family of Isaac Martin; this man is married to a white woman who, before her marriage had a child (son) the father of whom was also a white man. What I would want to know is whether or not this child has any rights as to schooling in the Indian school.\n\nApparently the boy is undisciplined, and it was for this reason that Sister Mary of Holy Eucharist sent him home. Also when Mr. Doucet last visited this Reserve, and we visited the school, he told me that the school was quite full enough and, although this matter was not taken up with him at the time I thought that if any room at all was available it should be for Indians only.\n\nThe parents of the boy do not seem to have the means to send him outside although his mother told me that she had made inquiries at the Cross Point school (bordering the Reserve) and they told her that they could not accept him as he was Indian. I am therefore at a loss to know just what I can do to help him out as it seems as though he would like to go to school; he will be 14 years of age on May 16th next.\n\nI would greatly appreciate your instructions and comments in the matter.\n\nI remain, Sir;\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n(C.H.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nIndian Day School, Restigouche, P.Q.\nMarch 23, 1949.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Principal of the Restigouche Indian Day School has to solve a problem which she presently stands unable to resolve alone!\n\nOn April 1st we generally admit among our pupils the seven year old children for three months preparation which has proven a great help to them when they return in the Fall. This Spring, the Indian pupils are too numerous and attend too regularly to permit us to accept any new comers. The 1st and 2nd grade department made to accommodate 30 pupils respectively register 36 and 45 young ones with an attendance of 93% last month. Some of them sit on the blackboard platforms and kneel on the floor to write. Would you prefer turning the sewingroom into a classroom for which I could no doubt obtain a teacher or would it be better accepting all pupils of school age and give them only half a day each? To my humble opinion they would advance more by separating them in two groups than to have overcrowded classrooms.\n\nKindly advise me how to act in this matter if it be your desire to favour the beginners.\n\nThe enlargement of the Restigouche Indian Day School is indispensable for September if the Honourable Department of Indian Affairs wish to provide schooling to all the pupils of school age.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Bernard Neary, Supt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n1st April, 1949.\n\nMr. C.R.

The children who have reached 7 years of age will have to wait until September 1st to attend school.\n\nWe do not favour the Principal's suggestion that the sewing room be converted into a classroom.

Would you kindly advise us if the Honourable Department of Indian Affairs accept the classroom at the French school for our new class.\n\nWould you please send us ten forms for application for classification on Indian Teacher's Salary schedule.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist, r.s.r.\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nIndian Day School,\nRestigouche, P.Q.\nJuly 14, 1949\n\nMr. A.J. Doucet,\nSupervisor, Vocational Training,\nEducation Division.\n\nDear Mr. Doucet,\n\nI am pleased to inform you, kind Mr. Doucet, that we have presented eight pupils for the 7th Grade examinations sent by the Department of Public Instruction of the Province and all received their certificate. This statement admits them to the 9th Grade in New Brunswick. I am presently trying to place six in different High Schools. One boy, Brennie Labellois 16 years of age, would be desirous of taking a carpenter and painting course.\n\nWould you kindly send me the address of the Montreal School where such trade is taught. I could then make the application for the said pupil myself while asking for the prospectus.\n\nTwo electricians came to make their electric-wiring estimates. They seem to be figuring about $1500.00 I guess. The approximate price per outlet is $5.00 This explains the difference between Ontario and Quebec.\n\nReverend Father Lucien is not giving me any hope for the land between the French and Indian School. The last I spoke to him about, he stated that he intended to annex a town hall at the end of the present school. It might change yet, as their nominations will take place in September only.\n\nKeeping a kind remembrance of your short but worthy visit.\n\nMost gratefully yours,\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist...\nAugust 8, 1949.\n\nMr. C. R. Nadeau,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nRostigouche, P.Q.\n\nRestigouche Indian Day School.\n\nPlease find attached copy of a letter I have sent today to Sister Mary of the Holy Eucharist. We have approved the replacement of Sister Mary of St. Angella by Sister Mary of St. Bernadeth. We have also approved the appointment of Sister Mary of St. Bernice for the new classroom to be operated, as approved now, in the white school.\n\nI will be inspecting this school on September 6 or 7, when I can discuss with you other matters concerning its operation. Please do not notify the teachers of my intended inspection trip.\n\nBernard F.

It is not an easy matter to get someone to do it, so I have offered $5.00 to anyone who will do the work, and I will pay another $5.00 if they do not respond.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The windows and doors should also be attended to in order that the building may be habitable next winter.\n\nWith regard to the closets, while the price asked for cleaning them appears excessive, the matter should not be neglected and you may have them cleaned and the repairs above mentioned done during the approaching summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Pitre, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPointe \u00e0 la Garde, Que.\nSir,\n\nThe divers correspondences concerning the repairs to be done on the schoolhouse I beg to say that I have got an expert on the matter to examine what would likely cost to make the house habitable for the winter. After a thorough examination he states as follows: \"The roof has to be made a new, the lower part of the wall is very rotten I can break a part of it with my finger there appear to be nothing holding the sleeper specially at the east end, the floor is heading down, the base board, the corner cut and a part, at least, of the windows has to be renewed, in fact, one can tell what will really be renewed until he commences to work. It will certainly cost \u00a32 or \u00a3300.00 and yet it will last long. The building don't matter while it is repaired, it will soon tumble down.\"\n\nWhen asked him would be the probable cost of a new one, he said that a good house to suit the purpose could be built for between \u00a3150.00 and \u00a3180.00.\n\nI hereby enclose a letter from the Revd Father Bapsthim that affords, there certainly some thought in what they are saying, the Indians are imagining that they are little more.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is not without necessity. However, I am not disposed to be very much pleased about this; I should very much prefer that you should do what must be done sooner or later\u2014that you should rebuild. You will recollect that the Superintendent of Public Instruction condemned the school last year, not directly because it was in need of repairs, but because the building itself did not comply with the school regulations. And I believe that he would have insisted, if he had not thought that with the Hon. the present Minister of Indian Affairs a first warning would be sufficient. As for myself, I will tell you frankly that when the Government gave such a good example of progress (of which our white commissioners were much in need) in improving so considerably the treatment of its school mistresses, I am very much astonished that it remains, I was going to say, behind in the matter of building. Not only have the schools at Sandy Hill and Oak Bay been improved, but there is being built at present for the whites, not far from the old Government buildings, a wholly new school, spacious and (by comparison) magnificent. Several Indians have seemed to be annoyed at thus being passed over at their place; perhaps they would have shown this discontent if you had said more plainly that their Department wants\nto repair instead of to build.\n\nI am quite certain that if Mr. J.C. Scott, who is so zealous about schools, would spend only two or three days here, looking and listening, he would feel keenly the comparison that I suggest and would act without delay in getting the Department to take the place again that it is going to lose here if it is satisfied with costly and temporary repairs.\n\nPerhaps they are waiting to do better! However, we cannot wait much longer.\n\nI remain with respect\n\nYour, &c.,\n\nF.

General,\n\nMr. Marcil, M.P., forwards a letter from the Rev. Father Pierre in reference to the need for a new school building at Restigouche. The Department has recognized the necessity for a new building there and has made provision in the estimates for next year for $3000 for this purpose, but until the money is voted I do not see that anything could be done in the way of getting out stone or other material this winter as mentioned by Mr. Marcil.\n\nPlans will have to be prepared for a new building and tenders called for; and it is not likely that the successful tenderer would be willing to pay the full cost of getting out the stone. I think the best thing to do would be to tell Mr. Marcil that the Department hopes to be able to put up a new school building next summer, if money is available, and in the meantime I would suggest that Mr. Ogilvie be instructed to provide suitable plans.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Although postmarked Campbellton 14th, it could hardly have left there until the 15th - which Messrs. Hann & Baxter might be expected to be aware of, as the two trains per day leaving there for western points at this time of year leave very early in the morning - before the post office would be open - at 2.30 and 6.15.

Department will pay expense.\"\n\nYou will be good enough to see that the drainage for the new school building at Restigouche is properly attended to before the work proceeds too far.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Pitre, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPoint a la Garde, P.Q.\nSir,\n\nOn the 25th ultimo I carefully examined the school site on the St Anne de Restigouche reserve. Work was actively proceeding on the building.\n\nThe foundation stone, about which complaints have been made is flat free stone, thin but of good dimensions. So far as I can see it is free from objection and from the opinions gathered this was adopted as my opinion without obtaining an expert to examine it. The supercies of most of the stone is such that it will itself form a bond for the foundations. In conversation with the working masons I was told that it made a splendid foundation but the expenses of the contractor would be increased by the amount of mortar required.\n\nThe foreman in charge of building required immediate instruction regarding drainage. The choice lay between making a new drain to the river bank some three or four hundred feet and connecting with an adjacent and satisfactory at a distance of twenty or thirty feet. As there\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nseemed to be no objection to the short connection unless such were raised by the Sister Superior of the nuns who occupy the residence which closely adjoins the school building. She was seen at my request by Mr. Patric and said the connection might be made. The foreman was consequently so instructed and was told that he might go on with the work leaving it to the Department and the contractor to determine whether the cost was included in the building contracts or not.\n\nThe area of the selected lot is small and will not afford room for the gardening that it has been proposed to instruct pupils in. There is, however, a good playground between the building and the road and the site is a nice one.\n\nSome little objection was heard to the building being placed on property which belongs to the Roman Catholic church instead of on the Indian reserve. Father Pacifique, Superior of the mission, says as to this that as the building is upon a lot which has been so long used for school purposes the Bishop of the diocese could not well object to continuance of such use even if so disposed. But objection would hardly arise from this source as the mission is gaining a valuable building intended in part for school purposes and in part as a residence for the reverend sisters who control the teaching and a practical future control of the education of children on\nthe reserve. But if at any time it is desired to put\nthe teaching into other hands or to secure the residence\nfor a lay teacher objections might come from other sources.\n\nThe lot has nice shade trees upon it and the position\nis central and most salubrious. It is approached on both\nsides by a considerable length of sidewalk and fronts\nupon the main street of the village.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nI.I.A. & R.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of No.\n\nBy the specification of the new school house it is mentioned that the work must be done at the satisfaction of the Indian Agent or other officers named by the Department. Does the Department want me to inspect the work every day or at certain intervals? Until now I have been able to see it every day for I had other business to settle, but in future I want to know what I have to do -\n\nThe Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mission at that place, I beg to inform you that so far back as the year 1853 the Govt. contributed $200.00 towards the construction of the building for an school at Restigouche Point & the money was paid over to the Roman Catholic Church Authorities.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6100, file 326-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nIn 1855 the resident missionary applied for a grant towards the teacher's salary, and this application was supported by the Rev. Mr. Cazeau. The grant applied for was $200.00 towards the teacher's salary was made on receipt of a certificate that the school was in operation on the 11th of May 1857 at the request of Bishop Flox, an Order-in-Council was passed authorizing the annual payment of $200.00 towards the teacher's salary, which has ever since been continued.\n\nIn 1870 a further grant of $100.00 was made towards repairs or additions to said school-house. In 1885\nthe sum of $387.67 was granted to further repair the school, to still later viz., in 1887 the sum of $447.79 was expended thereon. The beft therefore considers that it has certainly a right to the school building.\n\nConsidering the expenditure at least an equitable right to occupy the land on which the school is situated.

Napier enclosed extract from letter from Rev. Mr. Underwood, asking for a grant to build a school at Restigouche and Col. Napier stated that he had without hesitation handed him over the \u00a350 granted for this purpose. In his letter Col. Napier recommended the appointment of a teacher at a salary of \u00a350 per annum.\n\nOn the 15th Dec. 1835 and on 15th Oct. 1836 Col. Napier enclosed letters from the Missionary and from Wm. Gent. Cazier asking for assistance toward establishment of a school at Restigouche. In reply to these letters Col. Napier was informed that so soon as he was able to certify that the school was in operation under a teacher approved by the Dept., that a grant of \u00a350 would be made with the understanding that this was not to be an annual grant.\n\nOn the 14th April 1837 Col.

Sanderson Esq.\nDept. of A.\n\nSir,\n\nI am obliged to inform you that I have received a letter from Mr. Gray, Indian Superintendent at my Agency, dated the 15th March last.\n\nThe reason why I enclose this letter is that on the 23rd day of April, Mr. Gray wrote me that he had heard from Mr. Gray that he had been instructed by the Department to communicate with the Department.\n\nMay I call your attention to this fact that there is no mention of any letter referring to the land occupied by the Indians School, but that the Church property is mentioned.\n\nMr. Gray further states that he has the sole control of this land that he will be able to sell it to the Indians or the Department.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted that the screws in a few of the desks should be tightened, and that a lock should be installed on the door and three cellar windows repaired, and that you estimate the cost will not exceed the sum of $12.

The Department has, apparently, given no authority for these expenditures. It has been decided, however, to pay the accounts, but I would point out that unauthorized expenditures will not be paid for in future.\n\nOur funds this year are extremely limited and while, last year, an allowance of $20 a month was made for midday meal supplies, the Department finds it necessary to reduce the expenditure this year. You should, therefore, confer with the teacher and arrange to discontinue supplying a number of articles so as to reduce the total cost. In addition, the midday meal should not be supplied after the end of April. Before incurring any further expenditure for this purpose, you should advise the Department what reduction the Principal of the school and yourself consider can be made in the cost of the midday meal supplies for the months of January, February, March and April.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. Richard, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nRestigouche, Que.\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Ind. Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nKind Sir,\n\nMr. Richard, Esq., Ind. Agent,\nhas transmitted me your letter of\nthe 13th instant, no 26-1-5, informing\nus that the Department is wishing\nto reduce the monthly grant of $1\ngiven since February 1920, in view of\nteaching cooking to our Indian girls\nand to provide a midday meal\nfor children living far from school.\nTo comply with the desire of the\nDepartment we think that, by re-\nquesting the children to bring their\nown bread, it would be possible\nto make a reduction of $1 a month.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6101, file 326-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nBut I am really sorry that the Department refuses to buy any more serving materials.\n\nBeing in charge of this school for the past twenty-three years, I am in position to certify that a midday meal and teaching of domestic science are the two agents which have helped us to secure the fine attendance we presently notice. This winter we sometimes number over hundred children in our classes.\n\nCooking and serving greatly interest both parents and children; attract the girls and draw them to prolong their school years. Previously no children above 2 years old were seen in our classrooms, while this year we have boys of 15 years and girls of 16 and 17 years. In fact, I can assure that the\nteaching of domestic science is very successful in this school, as acknowledged by school inspectors and all authorized visitors.\n\nSo, the Department would greatly oblige us by giving us the authorization to purchase school materials for at least $5 more, making this a reduction of $5 on the annual grant of $50 allowed us in March 1881.\n\nHoping that my humble request will be favored with a generous compliance, I beg the Department to accept in advance my sincerest thanks.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSr. M. of St. Joseph\n\nD'Art. Richard\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 23, 1932.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, regarding the grant provided for the purchase of supplies for the pupils' midday meal at the Restigouche Indian Day School, and also regarding the grant allowed for the purchase of sewing material.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, after giving the matter full consideration, it has been decided to allow a grant at the rate of $15 per month in the purchase of supplies for the pupils' midday lunch for the period from January 1st, next, to the end of April, 1933. It is considered that the serving of the lunch during the winter months will be sufficient. It is noted that you can have the children bring their own bread, and this would help in the cost of the other supplies.\n\nRegarding a grant for the purchase of material for the sewing classes, I have to say that the Department will allow the sum of $35 for the present school year for this purpose. Our funds this year have been so considerably reduced that it is regretted the above amounts for the purchase of supplies for the midday lunch and for the sewing classes are all the Department is able to authorize. I am sure you will join with the Department in endeavouring to keep all expenses as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nSister Mary of St. Joseph,\nRestigouche, P.E.\nOttawa, December 23, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received the communication from Sister M. of St. Joseph, Principal of the Restigouche Indian Day School, regarding the grant to be allowed in the purchase of supplies for the pupils' midday meal and for the sewing classes.\n\nIn this connection I enclose herewith, for your information, copy of a communication which is today being sent to the Reverend Sister. It is considered that $15 per month should be sufficient to cover the cost of the supplies for the midday lunch, which may be served until the end of April, next, and $35 to cover the cost of sewing material.\n\nYou should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the supplies for the midday lunch and also for the sewing material.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA.
