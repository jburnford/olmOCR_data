Sweezy.\n\nIn connection with this, let me inform you that the school-house needs repairs very badly to make it habitable for a teacher, who will, if necessary, have to dwell therein and board there.\n\nThe place is lonesome enough for a person coming from a white commu\nEssex Co., Anne\nGodfrey, Ont.\n\nTruly, without putting her desire in an uncomfortable dwelling place.\n\nThe White Fish Lake Band of Indians have been without chief since 17th of March last and without teacher since the 1st of May; hence I see myself obliged to represent the situation to the Department, hoping it will be generous towards these poor people.\n\nIt is very difficult to secure a teacher for the above school, as Indian Agent there can testify.\n\nThis, but yesterday, I received the answer of a good teacher who had applied for this school. It reads thus: \"When I applied as teacher in your school, I did not think the surroundings were the same as you have described. So I think I would not like it and would rather not accept it.\"\n\nOf course I have to tell the person...\nEgline St. Anne\nSydney, Ont.\n\nI do apologize for the position which kind of a home they will find. You may believe me, dear sir, that the White Fish Lake Schoolhouse needs repainting from top to bottom. I am willing to receive a favorable reply to this communication.\n\nYours very truly,\nYour obedient servant\n(Rev) Jno. Specht, S.J.\nMissionary\nThe roof also looks as though it might need renovating, but it does not appear to leak as it was raining quite hard when I was there and it appeared to keep out the rain. To put in new floors, paper the dwelling, whitewash the school room and make other minor repairs around the premises would cost about $160.00.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning, Ont.\n26th July 1911\n\n284---19 Sir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a letter addressed to you from the Rev. Jos. Specht in reference to the Whitefish Lake school and in regard to his statement that the school house needs repairs from top to bottom so I have the honor to report as follows. I visited this school within the last week and found that the building is not in such a deplorable condition as the letter of Father Specht would lead one to believe; true, the building is an old one built of logs but it is quite habitable and I cannot see how any extensive improvements could be done to it as I consider that this would be only wasting money. The floors in the school and teachers quarters are not as good as they might be and the walls of the dwelling require re-papering and the walls of the school treated to a coat of whitewash.\n\nIt is not the condition of the school or dwelling that makes it difficult to get a teacher for this school but its environment, as the school is situated in a very lonely place. I think if there were new floors put in the school and dwelling, the walls of dwelling re-papered and the school room whitewashed that this is all that should be done at the present time as it would be much better to build a new school than to put out any extensive improvements on the old log building.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 1, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo in reference to the repairs to the Whitefish Lake School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department would like to have had an estimate in more detail than that furnished by you, but in order to avoid delay you are hereby authorized to have the repairs mentioned in your letter made, the total expenditure not to exceed the amount quoted. You might communicate with Rev. Father Specht and advise him of the action that is being taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAss't Deputy and Secretary.\n\nO. L. D. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning, Ont.\n16th September 1911\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of date lst Ult. authorizing certain repairs to the Whitefish Lake School, I have the honor to report that I have not been successful in getting this work done as it was simply impossible to get any one to undertake so small a job in such an out of the way place in the busy season. In view of this fact that the repairs have not been made and on further consideration I think it would be better if the Department would consider the question of erecting a new school on this reserve in place of repairing the old one.\n\nThe old building could be used until such times as the new school was completed, without any further repairs. I am sure this would be the much better way and if a new building is built accommodation for the teacher could be provided as well in the new building.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 29, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant in reference to repairs to the Whitefish Lake school building.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your suggestion that it would be better to erect a new building than to incur a large expenditure on the present one.

One is from Mr. J. Lalonde, of St. Andrews East, for $3850.00, but acceptance is made dependent upon his receiving the contract for the Golden Lake School. The second tender is from Mr. H. D. Evans, of Sudbury, for $4000.00.\n\nThe architect's estimated cost of this building is $3200.00.\n\nThis school is only 4\u00bd miles from the railway station and there is a good road leading to it. In view of this fact I consider that Mr. Evans tender is altogether too high and his cheque should be returned. It might be well to hold Mr. Lalonde's tender until the 20th instant, the date on which the tenders are receivable for the Golden Lake building.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nOttawa, 18th March, 1913.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith for taxation an account rendered at $8.50 from the \"Mining News\" of Sudbury, for advertising done for this Department.

April 9, 1912\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to official letter of date 23rd ultimo regarding tenders received for the erection of the school-house at Whitefish Lake.\n\nIn answer to same I beg to state that I think if you would, in calling for tenders, put an advertisement in the Manitoulin Expositor, Little Current, Ont., and send a set of plans and specifications to John Young, Postmaster, Little Current, for reference by any one who might tender at that place you might receive tenders from there.\n\nI have spoken to one or two contractors on the Manitoulin and they said they would tender for same.\n\nIn answer to the final paragraph of your letter I beg to say that no doubt it would be possible to have the work done in the manner suggested, but, it would be a very complicated and expensive undertaking before completion if done in this way. There is no reason why the building at Whitefish Lake should not be put up by tender as there are lots of more out-of-the-way places than it is, in fact, it is nearer the base of supplies than South Bay, not nearly so far to team the material. The hardest part to contend with there will, I think, be in getting material for the foundation, as building stone is not to be had anywhere in the vicinity. This could be amended, I presume, if it proved a\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, April 16, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nIn March, last, the Department received tenders for the erection of a school on the Whitefish Lake Reserve, near Naughton, Ont., two in number, but each of them was considered too high. The Agent was written to and asked whether it would be possible to have this work done by day labour. He now replies stating that he does not think it would be practicable and he recommends that tenders be again called for and that plans this time be placed at Little Current and the advertisement inserted in the Manitoulin Expositor of that place. The advertisement appeared before in the papers of Blind River, North Bay and Sudbury, all on the North Shore. Mr. Sims states that there are one or two contractors on the Island who, he thinks, might tender under these conditions. This is no doubt because building operations are not so active on the Island as on the mainland. The Manitoulin Expositor is not, however, on the patronage list. The Agent also suggests that cement be substituted for stone in the foundation, as stone is not available.\nIf you will grant the necessary authority I would recommend that a change in the specifications be made and that new tenders be called for, the advertisement to be inserted in the Little Current paper.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\nBelow are photographs\nROYAL ARMS.\n\nTENDERS.\n\nSealed tenders addressed to the undersigned and marked on the envelope \"Tender for school-house, Whitefish Lake,\" will be received up to noon of May 26, 1912, for the construction of a frame school-house on the Whitefish Lake Reserve about four miles from Naughton, Ont.\n\nPlans and specifications may be seen at the Post Offices, Sudbury; North Bay, Blind River and Manitowaning, and at the office of the Indian Agent, Manitowaning.\n\nEach tender must be accompanied by an accepted cheque on a chartered bank for ten per cent of the amount of the tender, made payable to the order of the undersigned, which will be forfeited if the person or persons tendering decline to enter into a contract when called upon to do so, or fail to complete the work contracted for.

The late Agent, Mr. Sims, was not in favour of trying to have the work done by day labour and I think it might be well under the circumstances to accept Mr. Booth's offer.\n\nBy a resolution of the Band of November 15th the money is to be taken from the Capital Funds of the Band and an Order in Council will be necessary.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\nThis is to certify that Mr. Benson has been appointed as Agent for the Band.\nOttawa, July 10, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nIn February, last, the Department called for tenders for the erection of a combined school-house and teacher's residence at Whitefish Lake. Two tenders were received, one from Mr. Evans of Sudbury for $4000.00 and one from Mr. Joseph Lalonde of St. Andrew's East, Que., for $3850.00. Mr. Lalonde's tender was conditional on his receiving the contract for the Golden Lake School, but he did not receive this and of course his tender for Whitefish Lake could not be considered. Mr. Evans's tender was considered too high at the time as Mr. Ghene's estimate of the cost was only $3200.00.\n\nIn April the Department, after making some changes in the specifications, which if they would not lower the price would make it more convenient to get the work done, again\nagain called for tenders. The result was that only one was received from Mr. Evans and his price this time was $4500.00, $500.00 more than the first time. This, he stated, was due to an increase in the cost of material and labour and the difficulty in getting in the material when the ice had gone.\n\nAbout the time these tenders were due Mr. F. A. Booth, carpenter and builder of Ottawa, saw the advertisement and called at the Department. At your direction he was given a set of the plans and specifications and he now submits an offer to erect the building for $4364.28; or, if spruce v joint be substituted for plaster on the walls, for $4513.28. Mr. Chene's estimate of the cost of this work was based upon the assumption that material would only have to be drawn four miles, but the Department understands that it has to be teamed from Sudbury, a distance of 15 miles, and a portion of the road, that on the reserve, is very bad; in fact it is so bad that it will necessitate doubling teams to take in a load of material of any size. In view of this fact it may be that Mr. Booth's offer is a reasonable one!\n\nThe day school has not been in operation since the first of this year, as there is no accommodation for a teacher. It is desirable that it should be re-opened at an early date, if it is possible to have the building erected.\nOttawa, July 12, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nSince writing the memorandum to you on the question of the building of the Whitefish Lake school and residence the resident Missionary has nominated for the position of teacher Miss Mary Martha Pleas, who is at present teaching a public school at Naughton, about four miles from the reserve. Miss Pleas is an experienced teacher and is at present teaching under a permit from the Ontario Government. It is proposed to approve of this nomination and it would be well, if at all possible, to see that proper accommodation is provided for Miss Pleas before the cold weather sets in. She has promised the Missionary to remain at least one year.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, 19th July, 1912.\n\nHis Royal Highness\n\nThe Governor General in Council,\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report that, it being necessary to erect a combined school-house and teacher's residence on the Whitefish Lake reserve, on Georgian Bay, in the province of Ontario, tenders were called for in February, 1912. Two tenders were received, one from H. D. Evans, of Sudbury, for $4,000.00, and one from J. Lalonde, of Andrews Pant, P.Q., for $3,850.00.\n\nMr. Lalonde's tender was conditional on his receiving the contract for another school-house (the Golden Lake) which was being otherwise disposed of, and his tender for Whitefish Lake school could not therefore be considered. Mr. Evans's tender was considered to be too high at the time, as the estimate of the engineer employed by the Department amounted to only $3,800.00.\n\nIn April, 1912, the Department, after making some changes in the specifications which, if they would not lower the cost, would make it more convenient to get the work done, again called for tenders. The result was that only one was received - from Mr. Evans, and his price this time was $4,500.00 - $500.00 more than his previous tender. This, he stated, was due to an increase in the cost of materi-\nand labour and the difficulty in getting in the material when the ice had gone.\n\nAbout the time when these tenders were due, Mr. F. A. Booth, carpenter and builder of Ottawa, saw the advertisement and called at the Department and was given a set of the plans and specifications; and he now submits an offer to erect the building for $4,364.88, or, if sprung v joint be substituted for planter on the walls, for $4,315.88.\n\nThe estimate, above mentioned, of the engineer employed by the Department, was based upon the assumption that material would have to be drawn only four miles; but the Department understands that it has to be hauled from Sudbury, a distance of fifteen miles, and a portion of the road - that on the reserve - is very bad; in fact it is so bad that it will necessitate doubling teams in order to take in a load of material of any size.\n\nA resolution has been passed by the Whitefish Lake band in favour of the cost of the building being charged to their capital.\n\nIn view of the circumstances above mentioned, the undersigned would recommend that the offer of Mr. Booth to erect the building referred to for $4,315.88 be accepted and that the cost be charged, under section 90 of the Indian Act - as the work when completed will be in the nature of a permanent improvement - to the capital at the credit of the Whitefish Lake band, which amounts to $46,668.88.\n\nActing Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nand labour and the difficulty in getting in the material when the ice had gone.\n\nAbout the time when these tenders were due, Mr. F.

Six tenders were received; Mr. Lalonde's being second highest, there were four lower than his, and the lowest was accepted; so that Mr. Lalonde's tender for Whitefish Lake could not be considered.\n\nMr. Evans's tender for Whitefish Lake is too high.

He suggests that a foundation be placed under the building and that some other repairs be made and I have to ask you to be good enough to enumerate the repairs necessary with an estimate of the cost in detail, stating whether you can have this work done by day labour and under what supervision.\n\nThe foundation may be constructed as follows: cement piers 18\" by 18\", three feet below the grade line, should be placed eight feet apart, with a cement wall 6 inches thick and the same depth between the piers. The cement should come up to the joists above the ground.\n\nA new teacher has been engaged for this school and the Department desires to have the school-house and living quarters made comfortable before the winter sets in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWm. McLeod, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\n\nAugust 1st, 1912.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to Official Letter, No. 151715/5 of April 17th, last, regarding building a new School at Whitefish Lake Reserve.\n\nI would most respectfully ask, if any tender was accepted by the Department. If not I would most respectfully recommend, that the old school building be raised about two feet and a stone or cement foundation be put under it. The teachers dwelling also needs a general over-hauling. The total cost of the foundation and the repairs to the teachers dwelling should not exceed $250.00. If the above repairs were done this school would compare favorably with any rural school in the District. Mr Conley saw the building when he was at Whitefish Lake with me and can give you any further information required, also in reference to the old and new school sites.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nIndian Agent,\n151715/5, Indian Office, Manitowaning,\nAugust, 10th, 1918.\n\nSir:\u2014\n\nIn reply to Official Letter No. 151715/5 of July 31st, last, I have the honor to report that I have consulted different contractors, and men capable of doing the work of repairs at Whitefish Lake School, and none of them are desirous of taking the contract of work, but would go and work by the day. I could get two men who reside here to go there per day work and get the rest of labor required by engaging Indians.\n\nAs Whitefish Lake School is in an out of the way place I think it almost impossible to get any one to take the contract, the best way would be take the men over there, and purchase all material they would require, and the work would be done in much less time than waiting to receive any tender.\n\nThe men ask $2.50 per day and board and fares to and from Naughton, they would also have to do their own cooking. The total cost of repairs and foundation should not exceed $250.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont..\nOttawa, August 16, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th inst., and in reply I beg to say that the Department approves your recommendation to have the repairs at the Whitefish Lake school done by day labour.\n\nYou may engage the two men referred to and the necessary Indian labour. The white men will be paid $2.50 a day and will be allowed $4.00 per week each for board. They will also be given transportation to and from Emugton. The Indians should be allowed a fair rate of wages.\n\nThe accounts should show in detail all materials purchased with prices, which must be fair, and the total number of days' labour of each workman. You should be guided by the patronage list in making the purchases, and the total expenditure should be kept within the estimate. The work should be rushed forward and completed as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst.

She informed me that the floor was flooded with water, and that the water had risen to a height of several inches.

Father Specht has written the Department advising that during the Easter Vacation the school-house at Whitefish Lake was flooded. As a result the floor is swollen and there is great dampness in the room, as the water appears to be staying under the building.\n\nThe Department regrets this, although it is a matter for which nobody is responsible. No doubt the water will drain away and possibly the floor also will right itself if the fire is kept on. The Department would, however, like to know whether anything could be done to prevent a recurrence next spring and would be glad to have your opinion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.D.

Upon raising a loose board in the floor I found two feet of water under the class-room, and some of the sleepers so decayed that they will not hold the nails. No concrete foundation can be seen above the ground, and the sills appear to be still below the surface and are sprung out of place with the frost. I should judge by the hole underneath the class-room that the building has been raised two feet since it was first erected, but no new sleepers or floor were put in.\n\nI might say that this building is situated below the hill on the level with the Whitefish Lake and cannot be drained, the water lies under the school room nine months in each year, which causes it to be very unsanitary. During the winter months the frost heaves the building which breaks the plaster between the logs and twists the doors in such positions that they will not close, therefore the building has to be repaired quite often.\n\nI authorized the chief, Michael Faillie, to patch the floor for the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n| DATE       | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------|\n| 1917 March 30 |        |\n|            | Authorized by Dept.

If so, kindly submit an estimate of the cost of putting it in fit condition for opening school after the summer holidays. You should also advise the Department as to who is the owner of this building and on what terms it could be secured for school purposes and also whether suitable accommodation could be found for the teacher in the neighbourhood.

This building is owned by Alexander Osawagosh, but he only occupies it for a few months during the summer, and his reason for moving out during the colder months is, I should judge, because that it is not in a fit condition for occupation.\n\nI did not try to secure this building for school purposes from the owner because I thought that it would have to be all repaired before it could be used for a class room, such as a new floor, roof, closets, and replastered, also a portion built to it to accommodate the teacher on account of there not being any suitable accommodation in the neighbourhood.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSudbury Aug 3 1917\n\nMr. Martin Benson\nInd. School Department\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Indians of the Ojibweish Lake reserve would be pleased to know if it is the intention of the Department to open their school next month. They needed a new school, could be built this summer by but so far they heard nothing of it. Because the school will not be there, they would be satisfied only having the school opened in some house of the village. There is a schoolhouse that can be turned into a room, into a good school room and there is plenty of space, the best part, where we will accept teaching in that temporary school house.\n\nMrs. M. A. Murray, teacher at Garden Village School, forwarding. We are anxious to accept teaching in any school, like present, or the vacant school hall. Should this prove so, in case that school would prosper, I have been advised to teach at Garden Village. We hope to have trouble over a few weeks.\nof the reserve, but it was a matter of board.\nI had no complaint against her teaching.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nT. A. Desautels, LL.\n\nSincerely.\nOttawa, August 4, 1917.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant addressed to Mr. Benson of this Department, in which you state that the Indians of the Whitefish Lake Reserve would be pleased to know if it is the intention of the Department to open their school next month and that there is a house that can be turned, with a few repairs, into a good school-house.\n\nIn reply I have to ask you to be good enough to advise the Department of the name of the owner of the house you refer to. Mr. Agent Lewis advised the Department that there is a house belonging to Alexander Osawagosh that could be secured, but that it is in very bad condition. Kindly state whether this is the house you have reference to.\n\nIn reference to the last paragraph of your letter in which you state that Mrs. Alex. Lamoureux, Theessalon, Ont., previously teacher at the Garden Village School, would accept teaching in any school I beg to say that it is presumed you mean Mrs. Alex.

There are between 25 and 30 children of school age on the reserve and a building after the plan of the one erected at Kaboni in 1916 would meet their requirements. The Kaboni School cost $3,765.00 but the price would likely be higher now. It would be well to obtain an Order in Council for enough to cover the probable cost, say about $4500.00 or $5000.00.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nMarch 26th, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 24th ultimo in reference to erection of a new school on the Whitefish Lake Reserve, and in reply to say that the Department approves of the erection of this school. Before proceeding further, however, it will be necessary to know the nature of the soil there, stating if sand, clay or rocks, also if the ground is such as to permit of proper drainage of a cellar if provided. A sketch showing the dimensions of the ground with fall for drainage and the distance to which this must be carried should be sent. You should also state if stone and lime are available for the foundation or if a concrete foundation will be more economical in that position.\n\nAs the Department desires to make an early report on the plans, the information requested should be forwarded as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAust., Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRe.

Plans and specifications were placed in the several post offices in that vicinity and were also available on application to this Department.\n\nOne tender only has been received, that of the Laberge Lumber Company, of Sudbury, Ont., at $6055.00.\n\nThis tender is somewhat in excess of the Department's estimate of cost, but as the school site is difficult of access and materials and labour constantly advancing in price, it is questionable if a lower tender can be obtained at a later date.\n\nI would, therefore, recommend that the Laberge tender be accepted for the erection of the building.\n\nThe Department's estimate of cost of building is $5670.00.\n\nArchitect.\nWHITE FISH LAKE SCHOOL.\n\nLog Building 36' x 25'6\" x 12' ceiling.\n\nFloor, sub, 1000 ft. @ $50.00 = $50.00\nfinish, 1500 ft. @ $60.00 = $90.00\nCeilings, 1500 ft. @ $60.00 = $90.00\nPartitions, 500 ft. @ $60.00 = $30.00\nRafters, pole, 20.00\nRoof boards, 1500 ft. @ $50.00 = $75.00\ngables, 500 ft. @ $50.00 = $25.00\noutside door frame, 10 ft. @ $18.00 = $18.00\ninside door frame, 20 ft. @ $60.00 = $60.00\nwindow frames @ $20 each, 100 @ $2000.00\ncloak-rooms @ $100 each, 2 @ $200.00\nfelt under floor and shingles, 25.00\nshingles, roof and gables @ $20 M., 100 @ $2000.00\nlabour taking out logs @ $2.50, 95 @ $237.50\nerecting frame, etc., 175 @ $175.00\nchinking and plastering same, 35 @ $35.00\nfinishing building, 200 @ $200.00\npaint, hardware, glass, etc., 200 @ $200.00\nfreight, std., 50 @ $50.00\nboarding men, 200 @ $200.00\nsundries, 167 @ $167.00\n\nTeacher's residence 16 x 24, two rooms say, 1200 @ $1200.00\n\nIf foundation of concrete is built for school, 20 yds. @ $11.00 = $220.00\nexcavating, 30 @ $30.00\nIf foundation for cottage is built, of concrete, 14 yds. @ $11.00 = $154.00\nexcavating, 25 @ $25.00\n\nOne year after erection of school, sheeting up of interior should be done, as shrinkage of the green logs will permit of this.\n1764 ft. of V joint sheeting @ $70 per M. @ $123.48\nlabour erecting same, 14 days @ $5.00 = $70.00\npainting, 165 yds. two coats @ $40.00 = $67.20\n\nTotal: $3629.00\nJune 11, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nEnclosed please find security cheque sent with tender for the White Fish Lake Indian School, which is being returned to you as it is not intended to proceed with the work at this time, the tenders being considerably in excess of the estimated cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nfor Asst.

There is an abundance of logs on the reserve suitable for the work. It is proposed to have these taken out by the band and a log frame erected, using logs and poles for the ceiling joists and rafters to as great an extent as possible. The lumber and frames necessary for the finishing would have to be purchased outside as economically as possible.\n\nThe work can no doubt be successfully carried out by the band, as I am informed that there are many skilled workmen there. Before authorising the work, however, it is considered advisable to have you report and advise on the best method of carrying this out.\n\nIt is proposed to use the plan of the frame building on which tenders have been taken, and arrange the specifications for the log building. The walls to be erected on sleepers or on a stone or concrete bed, as would in your opinion be most advisable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. J.

In reply I have the honor to report that a log building would be quite suitable for the purpose, and it should be erected more economically than a frame structure.\n\nThere is an abundance of logs on the reserve suitable for the work just across the lake from where the proposed school is to be erected.\n\nIt is my opinion that the work can be carried out by the Indians, but there will have to be a white man, who is a skilled workman, in charge, in order that the building may be erected in accordance with the plan, and to keep the Indians at work.\n\nA system of contract work would be better than allowing them to erect the walls on, as the slopers not too quickly push the building up banked with earth.\n\nI must say that the only way the Department can have the Indians do this work is to have some white man in charge and pay him a wage by the day to look after the work for as the building is left to the Indians to erect alone, it will never be completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nJune 30, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 29th instant in reference to Whitefish Lake School, and in reply to ask if you can recommend a reliable person capable of carrying out the work on this building as suggested, and who could be employed at a reasonable rate of payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nWhite Fish Lake Reserve\n\nJuly 5th 1919\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe learn through the Saltege Chamber B. that the Department has suddenly refused to erect on our Reserve the school which was officially promised us last May. We are deeply grieved at this refusal and we beg to protest with the utmost vehemence against this change of mind. At the request of Mr. Agent Lewis we had voluntarily cleared a nice piece of land and were waiting for the contractor to begin the works.\n\nThis refusal is very strange indeed. The Department knew very well last May that the materials are costly. Why this change? The government is spending millions and millions to erect Parliament Buildings and other constructions and we are refused a few thousand dollars of our own money to build a decent shelter where our children could receive comfortably a reasonable sum of instruction.\n\nAgain; splendid and costly schools and sometimes roads grants have been given to many Reserves and we are denied equal\ntreatment with others. We have never asked for any grant of any kind, road grants, farm implements etc., the Department has never spent one cent for any school building on our Reserve. The old school was a log building put up by the Indians.\n\nFor nearly two years we had no teaching at all. Last year our children were taught in a church too large for a class-room, as Inspector Sinn has declared. It is not all this provoking. Last year we refused joining a General Union of all Indians in Canada to vindicate our rights and obtain justice because we trusted the Department. Now the Department deceives our hopes by not fulfilling its promise. We therefore appeal to you Mr. Scott and beg you to build our school this summer.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nfor all the Whitefish Mission Band \u2014 Joseph & Pelatoose\n\nLake Band \u2014 Joseph & Pelatoose\n\nJames Shawbawangewa\n\nAmbroise Nebenique\n\nJames Nebenique\n\nAlex Nebenique\n\nJoseph Bere\n\nStephen Nebenique\nJuly 15, 1919.\n\nDear Chief -\n\nI have a letter signed by yourself and several Indians regarding the erection of a school-house on your reserve.\n\nIn reply I would state that the Department would not accept the only tender that was received for the construction of this building because it was not considered advisable to expend so much of your funds for a new school-house. We are in communication with the agent and we hope to be able to erect you a comfortable log building at an early date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nChief Michel Paillie,\nWhitefish Lake Reserve,\nNaughton, Ont.\nRoyal Arms\n\nTENDERS WANTED.\n\nTENDERS MUST be addressed to the undersigned, registered and endorsed on the envelope, \"Tender for school,\" at Whitefish Lake Indian Reserve, Ont., and will be received up to noon of the 25th day of May next.\n\nPlans and specifications may be seen at the office of the Indian Agent, Hanlonanag, Ont., and at the Post Office at Sudbury, North Bay, Blind River, and at the Department of Ottawa.\n\nEach tender must be accompanied by an accepted cheque or a certified bank for ten per cent of the amount of the tender, payable to the order of the undersigned.

We have found two good houses that we want to break out and use up for building our new school. These houses are presently at the gold mine behind Whitefish Lake. The price of the two houses would be $300.00. No stranger will work in the construction of that new school, only the Indians of the Reserve will work at it. They will ask only for a little payment.\n\nSigned, Jos.

Mahzenekeshik.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nJuly 26, 1920.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a copy of a resolution by the principal man of the Whitefish Lake Band requesting the Department to purchase two buildings situated at the gold mine about six miles from Whitefish Lake for $300.00 and the Indians will move them to Whitefish Lake Village and re-erect them for a school and teacher's residence.\n\nI might say that I have not seen these buildings but I have heard that they are very good buildings and would be suitable for a school and residence if moved to Whitefish Lake. I have also been informed that they can be taken down without much damage to the material.\n\nIt appears that the Indians wish to do the work themselves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nCANADA Ottawa, August 4, 1920.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Agent Lewis, Manitowaning, has forwarded a request from the principal men of the Whitefish Lake Band requesting the Department to purchase two buildings situated at the gold mine, about six miles distant, and have them moved to Whitefish Lake Village and re-erect them for use as a school and teacher's residence. The agent states that he has not seen these buildings but has been informed that they are in good condition and would be suitable for the purpose. He also states that they can be taken down without much damage to the material and that the Indians will do all the work themselves in connection with the removing and rebuilding.\n\nThe school at this point was burned on May 15th, 1917, and classes have been conducted since that time in the church building which has been used as a school room and teacher's residence for which a rental of $50.00 per annum is paid.\n\nThe summer of last year tenders were called for the erection of a log building and only one tender was received which was considered too high. The amount of the tender was $6,058.00. It was then decided, as there was an abundance of logs on the reserve, to have the work done by Indian labour under the oversight of competent foreman. As the foreman engaged took ill it was considered that it would be too late in the season to begin the work and the agent was informed that it was to be postponed until the following spring (1920).\n\nThe Indians of this band have to their credit in Capital Account $62,438.00, and the entire cost, if the two buildings mentioned above are purchased, removed and fitted up as a school and residence, could be paid from the capital at the credit of the band.\n\nI would suggest that Agent Lewis be instructed to inspect the buildings and if he considers that they would be suitable for the purpose and can be removed, that he be\nauthorized to have the Indians proceed with the work and also if he considers that the price asked for, namely, $930.00 is reasonable, that the cost of the purchase be paid from the capital funds of the band.\n\nIn view of the communication from the principal men of the band authorizing the expenditure it would not be, I think, necessary to receive a resolution from the Band-in-Council to provide the funds required. It would, no doubt, be a great deal cheaper to purchase these buildings and have them removed than to erect a new school building.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will inform me as to what reply to make to the above request.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. A. [Signature]\nOttawa, August 7, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, enclosing a resolution from the Whitefish Lake band requesting the Department to purchase two buildings for use as a school and teacher's residence at Whitefish Lake.\n\nIn reply I beg to say I would request you to inspect these buildings as soon as you are able to do so and report fully if you consider that the cost of them is reasonable and that they would be suitable for the purpose and can be removed.\n\nIn forwarding your report you should state definitely whether the Indians will move these buildings without cost. If there is likely to be any expenditure other than the cost of the buildings, you should state so in your report.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitouining,\nONT.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\nWhitefish Lake Band Aug. 23/1920\n\nTo Indian Affairs Office\n\nWe are still waiting to reply about the school at Whitefish Lake & build the new school we had been writing you, and never answer, and to buy the two building at the value price nine hundred dollars.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nChief Joseph Petahtagoose\nHaughton, P.S.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, August 26, 1920.\n\nChief,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant regarding the purchase and fitting up of two buildings for use as a school and teacher's residence at Whitefish Lake.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Agent Lewis forwarded the request made by the principal men of the band regarding this matter and he has been requested to inspect these buildings and report as to whether the price asked is reasonable and if they would be suitable for the purpose and can be moved. You should consult Mr. Agent Lewis in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChief Joseph Petahtagnoose,\nNaughton P.O., Ont.\nIn reply to Official Letter No.19-8-5 of the 7th ultimo, in regard to the question of purchase of two buildings at the Gold Mine near Whitefish Lake Reserve for use as school and teacher's residence at Whitefish Lake, I have the honor to report that I inspected these buildings on the 31st ultimo, and found one of the buildings, which is built of logs, not suitable for a teacher's residence, as the logs are found pine with the bark on them and are beginning to decay. The cost of moving these logs would be above their value.\n\nWith regard to the other building which is a frame cottage of one story ready cut type. Inside dimensions are length 31 feet, width 23 feet, height of ceiling 10 feet; outside of building is finished with clapboards covered layer of mineral-hair felt fastened to half inch boards; roof is covered with two layers of heavy tar paper and hair felt in between. Interior is finished with beaver board and hardwood floors throughout; all windows and doors are finished with white enamel. There are six windows 33 inches by 63 inches, upper and lower sashes each containing one sheet of glass, and storm shades are complete for all windows. Entrance door is 2 feet 10 inches by 6 feet 10 inches and contains one sheet of glass 35 inches by 32\u00bd inches.\n\nThis building is situated at the present time seven miles from Whitefish Lake Indian Village, and I consider it suitable for a school if moved to the Village, but the Indians cannot move it free of charge as they cannot afford to work for nothing and let their families suffer. I consider that it will cost at least $600.00 to have the building moved, and rebuilt, so the Indians will have to get some wages in order to board themselves while working, and the cost of team work moving the material, and also nails and new roofing paper will have to be purchased.\n\nThe owner, Mr. Rowley, asks $700.00 for the building it stands at the Gold Mine, which is quite reasonable for a building of its appearance, and the Indians claim that they can take it down, move it to the village at Whitefish Lake and re-erect it in two weeks time.\n\nAs these will have to be a school erected at Whitefish Lake and the cost of erecting a modern school in such backward place will be very high, therefore, I would recommend the building in question be purchased and have the Indians move to the Village.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 7, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant with reference to the purchase of the buildings at the gold mine near Whitefish Lake Reserve for use as a school and teacher's residence at Whitefish Lake.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is noted that one of these buildings, which is built of logs, would not be suitable for the purpose of a teacher's residence and the Department could not, therefore, consent to the purchase of this building.\n\nWith regard to the frame cottage, which it is proposed to use for school purposes, I have to request that you will be good enough to state how the Indians propose to move this building, also whether they have the equipment necessary and are competent to do the work of removing and fixing up this building. It is considered that it would be impracticable to put up such a classroom. It will be necessary to secure the Minister's consent for obtaining the funds required, which will be taken from the interest at the credit of the band, namely, $700.00 to purchase the building and also for the $400.00 estimated by you as being required for having the building removed and rebuilt and for any material required to fit up the building. You should state when the Indians propose to undertake this work and the probable length of time they would be in moving the building and having it fitted up for school purposes.\n\nThe Department is disposed on your recommendation to authorize the purchase of this building and its removal, but, before doing so, would like to have further information, as requested above.\n\nYou should state whether, if the work is gone on with, you would require an accountable cheque besides the amount to purchase the building, to pay the Indians while they are doing the work of moving and fitting it up, also whether the Indians would guarantee to have the building placed in a satisfactory condition for school purposes without further expense other than the equipment, such as desks, blackboards, etc. You should also state under whose supervision the work will be carried on, as it is thought that the Indians themselves would not be likely to carry out the work satisfactorily.\n\nAn early reply, giving full information, is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst. Deputy-and-Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of Official Letter No.19-8-5 of the 4th instant, with further reference to the question of purchase of the buildings to be removed from the Gold Mine to Whitefish Lake for the use of a school, and in reply I have the honor to report that the same footage which I recommended the purchase of to the Department will have to be taken down and drawn on wagons to Whitefish Lake and re-built, which the Indians claim they are capable of doing, and that they have the horses and wagons. The Indians are ready to start the work at any time and are now waiting for the Department to purchase the building; they claim that they can take the building down, move it to Whitefish Lake and set it up again and have it ready for use as a school in two weeks from the time they start to work, but while at work they would like to have a little money to purchase supplies for their families.\n\nThe Indians wish to do all the work themselves as they consider that they are capable of moving the building in question and rebuilding and placing it in a satisfactory condition for school purposes without further expense other than the equipment.\n\nAs the Indians are quite handy with carpenter tools and build all their own houses without any person to supervise the work, therefore, I imagine that they should be capable of moving this building and placing it in a fit condition for a school themselves. If there is a man taken in to supervise the work the cost will be much higher.\n\nIf the work is gone on with, I will require an accountable cheque besides the amount to purchase the building, to pay the Indians for their work, as they will have to have supplies while at work.\n\nI might also state that Mr. Rowley, the owner of this building, is awaiting the department's decision in this matter, as he has a chance to dispose of the building to a party residing near Midway.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\ncapital account $62,435.00 and $1,000.00 to the credit of interest, and the entire cost could be paid from the funds at the credit of the band.\n\nI consider that this building would be suitable for school purposes, that the price asked is reasonable and would be much cheaper than erecting a new building. I would therefore, submit for your approval that this building be purchased, that Agent Lewis be authorised to instruct the Indians to proceed with the work and that an accountable cheque for $1,000.00 to cover the cost thereof be forwarded to the Agent.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nMEMORANDUM,\n\nSir James A. Loughhead, K.C.M.G.,\n\nThe school building on the Whitefish Lake Reserve in the Manitouining Agency, Ont., was destroyed by fire on May 15, 1917, and classes have, since that time, been conducted in the church building, which is used as a school-room and teacher's residence and for which a rental of $50.00 per annum is paid.\n\nIn the summer of 1919 tenders were called for the erection of a log building to be used as a combined school and teacher's residence, one tender only being received. The amount of the tender was $6,055.00. This was considered too high and the matter was dropped.\n\nThe Agent now forwards a request from the principal men of the band to purchase the building situated at the gold mine about seven miles distant, and have it moved to Whitefish Lake Village and re-erected for school purposes.

School, October 22, 1923.\n\nThere is no woodshed. I was wondering what the teacher\nwill do to keep the wood dry in winter. A woodshed should\nbe built.\n\nI doubt if there is sufficient wood to last the winter.\n\nThere is no well and the teacher has to get water from\nthe lake down a rather steep hill, some 300 feet. Some-\nthing should be done. It means real work to get water\nfor washing and household use.\n\nA pair of blankets and a bed spread, if possible, are\nurgent. I blame lack of good bed blankets as contribut-\ning cause of the teacher's cold.\n\nThe stove is in urgent need of repair. The ash pan cannot\nbe closed properly and it cannot even be forced in. The\nresult is no way of checking it from below.\n\nThis teacher should be sent a coffee pot of some kind.\n\nJ. M. Bennett, Insp.\nOttawa, Nov. 2nd, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Whitefish Lake Indian Day School, states that a woodshed is necessary in order to keep the wood dry in winter. He also states that he doubts if there is sufficient wood on hand to last the winter. I have to request that you will state whether you can arrange to have an inexpensive building suitable for the purpose of storing wood erected this fall; and, if so, the probable cost of the material and labour. You should also arrange to have an ample supply of firewood purchased and delivered at the school. This wood should be cut into proper stove lengths.\n\nThe Inspector also states that a pair of blankets, a bedspread and a coffee pot are required for the teacher's use. You may purchase and have delivered one pair of blankets, a bedspread and a coffee pot.\n\nThe Inspector further states that the stove is in urgent need of repairs. The ash pan cannot be closed properly. You should arrange to have any repairs required made to the stove, and you may purchase any new parts required for the purpose.\n\nYou should give all the above matters your prompt attention, in order that conditions will be made as comfortable as possible for the teacher, and properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the above supplies.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you regarding the woodshed as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

J. Lewis,\nAgt.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nNovember 7th, 1925.\n\nI am in receipt of Official Letter No.: 19-8-5 of the 2nd instant, in regard to the Separate School Inspector's report on the Whitefish Lake Indian School, and in reply I have the honour to report that there is at the present time a small wood shed at the back of the school but it is not large enough to hold a supply of firewood for the winter, and a larger one cannot be erected this fall on account of the bridge across the Vermillion River at Naughton being washed out it being impossible to transport building material to Whitefish Lake Village, but after the bridge is replaced by a new one it might be possible to erect an inexpensive shed next summer.\n\nWhen I visited Whitefish Lake recently to make payment of fall interest to the Indians arrangement was made with the members of the band for a supply of firewood for winter use for the school and teacher's residence.\n\nWith regard to the urgent repairs required to the stove, by the Inspector, I have to report that a new grate for the firebox has been ordered from the McClary Company of London, Ont., which should arrive in the near future, and I might state that when I removed two large buckets of ashes from around the ash pan it closed properly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, Nov. 26th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, regarding the report of the Separate School Inspector on the facilities provided for the storing of fuel at the Whitefish Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that the woodshed is not of sufficient size to meet the requirements at this school. The question of erecting a new woodshed should be drawn to the attention of the Department early next spring, when it will then be decided whether the work of erecting a new building can be authorized or not.\n\nIt is noted that upon the occasion of your recent visit you arranged with the Indians to obtain the firewood required for the winter's use for the school and teacher's residence. It is hoped that the Indians have responded to the supplying of the quantity of wood required. We also note that you have arranged for the repairs required to the stove.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Mclean,\nAest. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J.

He states that this would mean only a little work with a shovel.\n\nYou should arrange to have this building re-banked before the extreme cold weather sets in. No unnecessary expense should be incurred for the purpose.\n\nThe inspector further recommends that a barrel be supplied to store water for the teacher's use during the winter in order to overcome the difficulty of obtaining a supply. You may purchase and have delivered a barrel that would be suitable for storage of water.\n\nThe following supplies are also needed and you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of same:- twelve lengths of stove pipes, one wash basin, one granite pail, a small quantity of soap and six yards of towelling. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the above authorized expenditure. The purchase of these supplies should receive early attention.\n\nThe inspector further states that a cupboard is required in which to keep the books and other classroom equipment.

On account of the Indian Reserve being so far away from any locality where building material can be procured the cost of transportation would be high.\n\nMessrs. Ludgate and Thompson, whom I presume are the timber licensees now, are erecting a tile and lumber mill at the Indian Village, at Whitefish Lake, on the Reserve, which will in the near future be under operation and next summer material can be procured for a woodshed at a reasonable price.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 5, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, referring to the question of erecting a woodshed at the Whitefish Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted you recommend that, owing to the cost, the erection of a woodshed be left until next summer, when the materials required can be obtained at a more reasonable price. Please make a note of this requirement and draw the attention of the Department to the matter early next spring, stating at that time the probable cost of the material and labour required.\n\nIt is presumed that you have arranged for the purchase of the supplies mentioned in official letter of September 30th, last, for the use of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In this connection I beg to refer you to your letter of November 4th, last, in which you stated that owing to the difficulty in obtaining material the building of this shed would be left over until the coming summer when the work could be done at a reasonable cost. You should make enquiry as to whether you can arrange to obtain the materials and have the work done. It is not intended that an expensive shed be erected, but it should be of a size suitable to meet the requirements, the walls rough boarded, with a sloping shingled roof, and the door should have a good strong fastening.\n\nThe Inspector also states that the roof leaks over the dining room. You should enquire into this, and state what repairs would be required. It might be advisable to have them carried out at the same time as the woodshed is being erected.\n\nThe Inspector further states that a new stove is required in the classroom. Please state whether you consider this is necessary, and, if so, furnish an estimate of the cost of supplying it.\n\nPlease also state whether you would recommend that any cleaning and painting be done to the interior of the school building, and, if so, you should furnish an estimate of the cost and state whether you can arrange for the labour in having the work done.\n\nYour early reply giving full information will be appreciated, in order that if it is decided to authorize having any work done it can be carried out during the coming summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

King for supplies for use at the Whitefish Lake Day School.\n\nSewing and knitting material should be furnished for the sewing class, and the articles made will be given to the pupils in need.\n\nThe roof and doors of the school building require repairs. I believe it would be well to put a new roof on the building as the material in the roof at present is only paper and has been in use for the last ten years past and has outlived its usefulness. The cost of a new roof would be approximately $100.\n\nWith regard to the request of the teacher for a well, a report on this matter was made to the Department on the 29th of April last.\n\nThe clock in the class room is not keeping correct time. It would appear to me that it requires setting.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 28, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, enclosing a requisition for sewing and knitting material and other supplies for the use of the Whitefish Lake Indian Day School, and also requesting that certain repairs be carried out to the roof and doors of the school building.\n\nIn reply I have to say that an order will be forwarded to the Government Stationery Office to send the classroom supplies asked for by the teacher. You may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the following when the school reopens: 1 alarm clock of the \"Big Ben\" type, 4 pillow slips, 10 yards sewing material, 3 packages sewing needles, 6 pounds knitting material, 1 washtub and 1 dustpan.\n\nRelative to the repairs required to the roof and doors, the Department will approve of your arranging to have a new roof installed and the doors repaired and placed in a satisfactory condition. It is noted you estimate the cost of a new roof to be approximately $100, and this amount should not, if possible, be exceeded in the cost of the materials and labour in putting on the new roof. This work should be carried out before the school reopens after the holidays.\n\nAfter you have made the above authorized purchases and carried out the repairs to the roof and doors, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

I would like to let you know that the school is in good shape, but there is still work to be done.\n\nIn a letter dated [date], I mentioned that I have asked about the possibility of having a new school building constructed. The Department has not yet responded to my request for a new school building.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. If you need any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Date]\nwell, she said, not because I am sure a pump would be more suitable than a well.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPoveshell\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, September 11, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Miss Stella M. King, teacher of the Whitefish Lake Indian Day School, in which she states that she has not received all the supplies asked for by her on requisition dated June 24th, last, and which you forwarded under cover of your letter of July 21st. She apparently has received the classroom supplies, but the other supplies which you were authorised to purchase by official letter of July 24th, last, have not been received. I have to request that you will, at the earliest possible date, arrange for the purchase and delivery at the school of the sewing material, pillow slips, wash tub, dustpan and alarm clock as mentioned in letter referred to.\n\nPlease inform the Department whether you have carried out the repairs required to the roof and doors. The account which you forwarded for the eleven rolls of roofing material has been paid, and it is hoped that you have had this work completed.\n\nThe teacher states that it is very hard to obtain water in winter, as a hole has to be made in the ice from which to obtain the water required. Please advise the Department whether there is a well in connection with this school, and, if so, what is required to place same in a satisfactory condition. If there is no well, please advise whether you would recommend that one be drilled, and if so, you should give full particulars as to the cost, etc. The Department will expect your report as to the steps you would advise be taken to provide a supply of water for use at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning,\nOnt.\n19-6-5.\n\nOttawa, September 11, 1930.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, relative to the supplies asked for on your requisition dated June 24th, last, for the use of the Whitefish Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that we are requesting Mr. Agent Lewis to arrange for the immediate purchase and delivery of the sewing and knitting materials, pillow slips, washtub, dustpan and alarm clock asked for. The four articles which you state you received are, no doubt, the catechisms, lead pencils, pens and chalk.\n\nWe are requesting Mr. Agent Lewis to furnish a report regarding the providing of a suitable water supply for the use of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Stella M. King,\nTeacher, Whitefish Lake Indian Day School,\nNaughton, Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nSeptember 13, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of Departmental Letter No. 19-8-5 of the 11th instant, with reference to supplies, repairs to roof and a supply of water, in connection with the Whitefish Lake Day School, and in reply I have the honour to report that Miss Stella M. King was advised that the sewing material, pillow slips, washup, etc., would be delivered direct from this office to the school by myself within a few days when I would visit the school to settle with the Indians for their labour in carrying out the repairs to the roof of the school building.\n\nThe chief has advised me that they have carried out the repairs required to the roof and doors of the school building.\n\nWith regard to a supply of water for the school, I have to report that there is not any well in connection with this school, and not even a well on the whole Reserve. All the inhabitants carry their supply of water from the inland lakes. The school is situated on a high grade between two lakes where it will be difficult to obtain water by digging. If a well is drilled it will be costly as it will have to be lowered below the level of the lakes and when the water is taken from such a great depth it will be a question whether, or not, it will be fit for drinking.\n\nIn my opinion it would be wise for the Department to pay a certain amount each quarter to have water carried from the lake for use of the teacher rather than drill a well.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 17, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, informing the Department that you have arranged to supply the sewing material and other articles asked for by the teacher of the Whitefish Lake Indian Day School, also that the repairs required to the roof and doors of the school building have been carried out.\n\nRelative to a supply of water for the use of the school, it is noted that there would be considerable difficulty and expense in digging a well and that you recommend that a set amount be paid each quarter to have the water required carried from the lake rather than drill a well. I have to request that you will state what arrangements you could make for this service during the coming winter months - from November 1st to the end of April, next - and the amount that would be charged each month for this service. The teacher could, no doubt, arrange with one of the older Indian boys to carry the water required at a small expense. Then we have information as to the cost involved, etc., consideration will then be given to authorizing the expenditure required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. U.

It should be painted in a light shade and kept clean. Cleanliness of the inside of the school is somewhat lacking. The school was cold during the winter months. Storm sashes should be provided.\nOttawa, June 25, 1945.\n\nMr. J. A. Marlean, Indian Agent,\nSturgeon Falls, Ont.\n\nI enclose the Inspector's report regarding his inspection of the Whitefish Lake R.C. School on June 18. Please study this report carefully and let me have a report regarding what action can be taken to carry out the Inspector's suggestions. When replying, the report should be returned.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nThe Whitefish Lake Band has practically completed a very necessary well at the school house at Lake Penage. This well has been cribbed with planks and the drain is almost completed to the lake.\n\nIt will be necessary to install a hand pump, the cost of which will be approximately $20.00. The work has been done by members of the band.\n\nAs it is very hard to get pumps, I have had one set aside at Ceehrane-Dunlops, North Bay, and will await the Department's permission to purchase it.\n\nJ. A. Marleau,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 27, 1945.\n\nMr. J. A. Marleau, Indian Agent,\nBurgeoan Falls, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of\nthe 23rd instant, the Department approves an\nexpenditure of $60.00 to purchase a pump for the\nwell at the Whitefish Lake School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSturgeon Falls, June 30th, 1945\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe - Attached Report,\nWhitefish Lake School.\n\nIn reply to your letter of June 25th with reference to above, you will recall that this school house at Lake Penage was considered a temporary school and was built by the Indians with lumber given for the purpose by the A. H. Brunne Company, Timber operators on the Whitefish Lake Reserve.\n\nThe building is much in keeping with the other buildings on the mill site, built of rough lumber with heavy white paper on inside walls and a good spruce floor, tar paper on outside walls. The entrance is at the wrong end of building but a proper door and two additional windows would give the required light. The equipment, benches, blackboards, stove, etc., were moved from the old school at Naughton. My letter of February 27, 1945, re Post War Plans, will give you the estimate for completion of building.\n\nIt is correct that there is no teacher's residence and so far there has been no necessity for one since Mrs. Petchegoose and her predecessor, Mrs. Euphosee, own their own homes and reside with their husbands and children.\n\nConcerning the inspector's report on the teacher, I believe it is exaggerated and I would suggest that, if possible, white teachers be employed. These Indian women are all married and raising families and the inspector might have added that their \"timing is perfect\" as I know that the addition to Mrs. Petchegoose's family is due in July.\n\nThe school yard is partly completed by draining and filling with saw dust and there are now making a baseball grounds. I recently purchased the land for the school house.\nwell and this will be installed immediately.\n\nIf the Department feels that this school should be completed this summer, I will make arrangements to do so.\n\nJ.A. Maclean,\nIndian Agent.\nOn my last visit to Lake Penage, I was very pleased with the cooperation between whites and Indians. The swamp by the school has been drained and a playground and baseball field built on it; Indians and whites working together. There was a great deal of work attending to the enterprise as the trees had to be cut and stumped and quantities of filling were required. The A.R. Brome Company supplied the lumber, furnished the bull-dozer and trucks to haul gravel and saw dust for filling to make the task possible.\n\nIn the process of draining the swamp, they have built a well at the spring, also built a hemlock drain underground to carry the excess water to the lake. The pump for the well was purchased by the Department.\n\nThis is another example of what can be achieved with Indians if they are given an opportunity to mingle at work and school with whites. Five years ago this band was at a standstill, filthy and sick. Now with the heads of families earning a fair wage, they are content, properly fed and healthy.\n\nJ.A.

Marleau, Indian Agent,\nSturgeon Falls, Ont.\n\nWith reference to our interview this morning, the Department approves an expenditure of approximately $400.00 for repairs to the Whitefish Lake School.\n\nThe amount mentioned is expected to cover both material and labour. Please forward a requisition for the materials required. If you can obtain the materials locally, you should state the name of the firm from whom they can be obtained and the price.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nFollowing is a list of materials needed for the Whitefish Lake School repair:\n\n- Roof, 42x32 - 14 squares of roofing at $7.04 per sq. $98.56\n- Walls, 44x24x10 - 28 packages brick siding, 40 ft. at $5.95 $166.60\n- Interior - 2000 ft. Ten feet or Donacoma board at $0.00 M $100.00\n- Nails and strapping $10.00\n- Trucking $10.00\n\nTotal $385.16\n\nThe roofing and brick siding is available at Cochrane Dunlop, Sudbury. The wall board for interior is out of stock for the past six weeks and may not be in for another month. Perhaps the Department could purchase this material cheaper in Ottawa and have it sent.\n\nThe Departmental letter of September 15th authorizes an expenditure of $400.00 for material and labour. At the present these are the only materials available and would leave less than $15.00 for the labour. You will agree that this would be impossible.\n\nThe Laberge Lumber Company, Sudbury has quoted the following prices on lumber and interior wall board:\n\n- White pine siding at $0.20 per M\n- Log siding at $0.90 per M, Jack pine and spruce.\n- Wall board, white in stock, at $0.40 per M.\n\nOn the lumber, of course, there would be an added 13% for tongue and groove. Although the cheapest lumber would cost approximately the same, there would be additional expenditure for painting and labour.\n\nMy original estimate which I forwarded to Department calls for an expenditure of $500.00. I believe it would cost all of this by the time the interior is painted.\n\nA.

I am sending you a copy of this memorandum which is self-explanatory.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated.\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nTraining Division.\n\nEnclosure:\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI have to advise you that the memorandum re building material for the Whitefish Indian Day School was not attached to your letter of November 14th.\n\nAt the time of my requisition to the department, the Laberge Lumber Company could not supply the material; consequently, I would have to see the memorandum in order to know what product the purchasing agent could get.\n\nSorry for the delay, I have been absent for the past 12 days.\n\n[Signature]\nH. A. Marleau,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 26, 1945.\n\nMr. J.A. Marleau, Indian Agent, Sturgeon Falls, Ont.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th instant, I regret that the copy of the memorandum to which we referred did not accompany our letter. I enclose memorandum together with the quotation received by the Purchasing Branch. Please let me have your opinion in this matter. When replying you should return the enclosed memorandum and request for quotation.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEnclosure\nSturgeon Falls, December 3rd, 1945\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nIn reply to your letter of November 28th with memorandum from Purchasing Branch. At the time my estimate was forwarded to Department, the Laberge Lumber Company did not have the brick siding nor shingles.\n\nI would ask you to consider the roofing. My quotation called for shingles, weight 210 lbs., price $7.04. These I believe would make a more permanent finish than the paper and can now be supplied by the Laberge Company.\n\nThe other items are satisfactory and I would be greatly obliged if the order can be placed shortly. I would like to have the exterior of school fixed during Christmas vacation.\n\nJ. A. Marleau,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 5th December, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nI desire to refer to our requisition of October 31st and your memorandum of November 12th with reference to building material for the Whitefish Indian Day School.\n\nThe following reply has been received from Indian Agent Marleau:\n\n\"In reply to your letter of November 28th with memorandum from Purchasing Branch.

INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nI was only able to visit this school on a Sunday and therefore it was not in operation.\n\nTEACHER\n\nMrs. Istahtegone has a first class certificate and has had 5 years' experience. She seems a bright and capable enough teacher and is definitely interested in her pupils. She has a large family herself and at times seems more interested in her family than in the school. She has made her classroom attractive and is quite keen to learn of new methods and on the whole would seem to be satisfactory. She lives with her husband in a small house near the school.\n\nBUILDING\n\nThis is a temporary structure which is gradually being converted into a permanent one. It has now been covered with insul brick and is beginning to look attractive. The inside is covered with Ten Test and is given a coat of paint in order to help brighten the inside. Mr. Marleau is planning small teacher's quarters and cloak-room for the back of the building. As the structure has no basement or furnace it differs greatly from our standard plan. However, it will serve the needs of these Indians, particularly in view of the fact that the mill has now closed down. Therefore there is a possibility that some of these Indians or all of them may move away.\n\nBernard F.

Sir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 11th instant in which you deal with the day school at Wikwemikong next year I beg to say that the appointment of Miss Frawley is approved.\n\nIn this connection I may say that the Department has asked once or twice with reference to the building previously used for class-rooms and would like to know if it would be available for day school purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

The building needs repainting, the roof is in bad condition and needs to be repaired at once.\n\nFor other information regarding the building address yourself to Mr. C. D.

Sir,\n\nFrom a letter just received it would appear that Miss Duhamel is at Wikwemikong ready to take charge of the day school there. Sometime ago the Department approved of the appointment of Miss Prawley to take charge of this school and Miss Duhamel was to be transferred from Shoeshogwanning to South Bay. If there has been any change in this arrangement the Department would like to be informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. STEWART\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Desautels,\nWikwemikong, Ont.\nOttawa, September 15, 1913.\n\nMadam,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 1st instant I beg to say that the returns for the Sheshagshewaning School have not been received by the Department, but about the 3rd instant a cheque for $100.00 in payment of your salary for the June quarter was sent to the Indian Agent at Manitowaning and no doubt you have received it by this time.\n\nThe Department will await the accounts from Sheshagshewaning to which you refer.\n\nIt was understood by the Department that you were to go to the South Bay School and Father Desmitels has been written to in regard to this.\n\nWith reference to the supplies for the Wikwemikong Day School the Department regrets that it cannot order these now, as arrangements have not yet been made for the use of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent, Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Adele Duhamel,\nTeacher,\nWikwemikong, Ont.\nWinnipeg, Oct. Sept. 16, 1913\n\nNo. 430214\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn answer to yours of Sept. 7, I beg to state that it is by misunderstanding that the Department has not been informed of the transfer of Miss Maclean to Winnipeg school in place of Miss Cranley who is teaching at South Bay.\n\nFor my part, I thought that the Department had been notified of the change and that it had been approved. I beg for the approval of this transfer and will pay attention that similar irregularities does not happen in future.\n\nTruly Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary of the Dept. of Ind.

S.I.P.:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department approves of Miss Duhamel taking charge of the Wikwemikong Day School and Miss Frawley of the South Bay School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

She has a large school and with the teaching and other instruction her duties are hard. If the Department would approve of it, Miss Mercier's services can be secured and should make a good assistant.\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, June 25, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report on the Wikwemikong School for the month of May and with regard to that portion in which you recommend that the school be closed for a time I beg to say that, provided you can make arrangements to have the children who should attend this school placed in the Spanish River Industrial School, the Department will consent to the closing of the school. If the school is to remain closed after the summer holidays it will be necessary for you to have the windows boarded up and the school property safeguarded.\n\nIn the event of this arrangement being carried out you may engage the services of Miss Mercier as assistant to Miss Duhamel at the Wikwemikong Day School.\n\nThe Department would like to have a reply from you as to the feasibility of carrying out this arrangement, so that there may be time to secure the services of another teacher for the Wikwemikong School, if necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ D M\n\nAsst.

I would suggest removing the teacher's desk and what seats would be required from the Wikwemikongeing school to Wikwemikong school, as there would be sufficient there without purchasing new ones while that school remains closed.\n\nW. McLeod,\nIndian Agent\nIndian Office, Manitowaning, Ont.,\nJuly 13th, 1914.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to report that Miss Adele Duhamel, teacher of the Wikwemikong Indian Day School requests the Department to increase her salary as the work is difficult and the average attendance is large.\n\nI would most respectfully recommend that her salary be raised to $500.00 per annum, the same as Miss Pravley's.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, July 18, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant recommending that the salary of Miss Duhamel, teacher of the Wikwemikong Indian Day School, be increased to $500.00.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the large average attendance at this school, the Department has decided to grant her request and this increase will date from the 1st instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

D. McLeod,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWm. McLeod, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nOttawa, October 7, 1913.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nI called on Mr. agent yesterday that night and let him know I was going to Winnipeg on Sunday. He sent me the next day and I am pleased to say that I arrived at a satisfactory arrangement with Father Desautels, the priest in charge, in regard to the occupancy of the old school building for the new school on the site. Miss Dubreuil has been engaged to assume her duties as soon as this matter is settled. I may say that owing to the good offices of Father Dumas, who gave me a letter of introduction to Father Desautels, I had very little trouble in arriving at a satisfactory settlement. We are to give the rent of as much of the building as we require for rooms free of cost. As I was authorized to see what kind of rooms might be suitable for the purpose, I took one of the rooms and said it fitted up very well for Miss Dubreuil and her helper. I instructed Mr. McCauley to order the number of desks required for their school from the Millar Co., Toronto, and I can assure you they will turn in reference to the shipment.\n\nMartin Conner.\n154-5-10, Indian Office, Manitowaning, Ont.,\nOctober 10th, 1914.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to report that the Rev.\nT.

She is now paid at the rate of $450.00 a year and is deserving of an increase, or at least $50.00.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\n$580.\nOttawa, November 11, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your remarks on the vouchers for the salary of the teachers of the Wikwemikong Day School for the quarter ended September 30th, last, that Miss Kelly deserves a raise in her salary to $500.00 per annum, as she claims that she has too much work to do for the salary and has taught school for seven years. I beg to say that the Department has decided to grant her an increase of $50.00 in her salary as assistant teacher of this school.

As there is a vacancy there now owing to the resignation of Miss Kelly, there will be no need of an exchange of positions between yourself and Miss Duhamel, as suggested, and the arrangement of classes will be left to yourselves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

As there is a vacancy there now owing to the resignation of Miss Kelly there will be no need for an exchange of positions between yourself and Miss Moffitt. You can both remain at this school and the arranging of the classes will be left to yourselves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Adele Dihessel,\nTeacher,\nWikwemikong Day School,\nSpanish, Ont.\nOttawa, August 16, 1916.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th and 13th instant in further reference to the change of teachers in the Indian schools conducted under the auspices of your diocese.\n\nThe Department has noted that it has been decided to continue Miss Morrell at Cape Croker.\n\nWith regard to the other changes recommended by you I beg to say that the Misses Burke, whose employment you recommend for the West Bay and Wikwemikong schools, were both previously in the service of the Department and should have known that it was necessary for them to make their applications to the Department. It is a question, had they done so, whether they would have been employed, as the Department is in receipt of a number of applications from experienced Roman Catholic teachers who are possessed of higher qualifications. As you are practically committed to their employment, Miss Mary Burke may be placed in charge of the West Bay School at a salary of $500.00 per annum and Miss Annie Burke may act as assistant teacher at Wikwemikong at a salary of $450.00 per annum.\n\nWith regard to the employment of Miss Liddey I may say that the Department does not approve of the employment of aliens, but, as you are again committed in her case,\n\nRev. L. H. Thomas, S.J.,\nPrincipal,\nSpanish River Industrial School,\nManitou, Ont.\nshe may take charge of the South Bay school on the same conditions as were applied to Miss Moffitt's engagement at Cape Croker in 1903, which were that she be possessed of the required qualifications and be a British subject.\n\nThe Department will require Miss Mckay at the first available opportunity to take out her naturalization papers and secure a provincial certificate as was done by Miss Moffitt. Miss Mckay will be paid at the rate of $500.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAunt, Deputy and Secretary.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR FINN ON THE WIKWEMIKONG DAY SCHOOL.\n\nNUMBER OF CHILDREN OF PRESERVE,- 50\n\nNumber of pupils present,- 21\n\nDate of Inspection,- October 17th, 1916.\n\nI expect that the attendance will improve within a few weeks when the parents return from other quarters. The only solution for the irregular attendance at this school would be the appointment of a truant officer.\nOttawa, November 2, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Finn in his report on the Wikwemikong Day School states that there are fifty children on the reserve and that at the time of his inspection there were only twenty-one pupils present in the school. He says that the only solution for the irregular attendance at this school would be the appointment of a truant officer.\n\nKindly state whether you consider a truant officer should be appointed and, if so, give the name of a suitable Indian to act in this capacity and state what remuneration he would expect for his services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nR.

I might say that during last year truant officers were appointed on the Sucker Creek and Shegianandah reserves which did not help matters any.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 17, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, with regard to the attendance at the Wikwemikong Day School.\n\nIt is hoped that the attendance will improve as you think it will. The Department considers that it would be well for you to point out to the Indians the necessity of their children attending school, and you might also inform them that, if the children do not attend school regularly, the regulations will have to be enforced.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nR.

You should consult her in this matter and, if she consents, she may take charge as assistant teacher at Wikwemikong and you can appoint Miss St. James as teacher of the West Bay School.\n\nThe salary of Miss Grimes, if she consents to take charge as assistant at Wikwemikong, will be $450.00 a year and you may appoint Miss St. James at this same amount.

She is getting only $450 while her assistant, who knows little about the work, is getting a salary of $500. I am sure it is but an oversight.\n\nJ. P.

He stated that the building in use at the present time for a day school is large enough for class-rooms, and a portion of the large building used as a residence could be made comfortable for sleeping quarters for the children, and that he thought that the children would receive better results at the boarding school than they are getting at the present time at the day school, on account of so many having good excuses for not attending regularly, such as no shoes, and others not having clothes.\n\nI might say that I believe that the children would get better results from the boarding school on account of the attendance, but as the Department has been at a big expense re-fitting the building for a day school, and the children appear to be doing nicely I would not recommend that a boarding school be started, but will leave it to the decision of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 21, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant reporting that the Reverend Father Artus, now in charge of the Roman Catholic Mission at Wikwemikong, has called at your office on two different occasions and requested you to take up with the Department the matter of starting a small boarding school at Wikwemikong for the Indian children residing in the vicinity of the village alone.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is unable to establish a boarding school there, as it has no funds available for this purpose.\n\nIn reference to Father Artus' statement that so many of the children have good excuses for not attending the day school regularly, such as no shoes and not having clothes, I beg to say that, if there are any Indians who are not able to provide clothing for their children, the band should pass a resolution authorizing the expenditure of the necessary amount from their funds to provide shoes and clothing for these children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMagdalen Bay, Ont.\n\nAsst.

I only intended to help the Indian Department in selecting to whom objects who can be recommended. I had asked Mr. Simon Injester whether he knew of any; he said no. I also sent Mr. Agent Lewis of the advisability to advertise his post; and, as a matter of fact, to the said Agent I have sent the applications of such candidates who seemed to me suitable.\n\nWith these in mind, I regret that your Department has taken away from the missionary the selection of the teacher, because he is the most interested in the choice, and the most able to know the qualities required to have success with our Indians. I wrote before not to act in perfect union with regard to the overtures disposed more or less kindly by the Indians; and I thank you for consideration so far given to my suggestions.\n\nRemain, dear Sir,\n\nI am here for a few days only.\n\nWith consideration,\n\nYours in the end,\n\nGeo.

Father Artus, of Wikwemikong, has informed me that Miss Angela Morris has resigned her position as assistant teacher at the Wikwemikong day school, and Miss Gertrude Tierney of Allumette Island, Que., has applied for the position.\n\nThe reverend gentleman states that Miss Tierney holds a model diploma of qualification, is twenty-five years old, had seven years of successful experience as teacher, three of which have been in Ontario.\n\nI would most respectfully recommend that Miss Tierney be appointed as assistant teacher at Wikwemikong day school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 30, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th instant reporting that the Rev. Father Artus of Wikwemikong has informed you that Miss Angela Morris has resigned her position as assistant teacher at the Wikwemikong Day School and that Miss Gertrude Tierney of Allumette Island, Que., has applied for the position, and recommending that she be appointed.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the appointment of Miss Tierney as assistant teacher of the Wikwemikong Day school, her duties to commence on the re-opening of the school after the summer holidays. She will be allowed a salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum. Kindly inform her of her appointment, and also Father Artus.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAest. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nSeptember 10th, 1918.\n\nReferring to Official Letter 430214/I of July 30th, last, in regard to the Department approving of the appointment of Miss Tierney to the position as assistant teacher at the Wikwemikong Day School, I have the honor to report that I have been advised by the Rev. Father Artus, Missionary in charge of Wikwemikong Mission, that Miss Tierney is to be married on the 16th Instant, and has declined the position as teacher at Wikwemikong.\n\nThe Reverend Gentleman has requested that Miss Mary Sullivan, of Sheenboro, Que., be appointed to the position. She has graduated from Pembroke Convent this past July, and holds an entrance to Normal Diploma.\n\nI would most respectfully recommend that Miss Sullivan be appointed to the position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 15, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, stating that you have been informed by Rev. Father Artus, of Wikwemikong, that Miss Tierney, who was recently appointed assistant teacher at the Wikwemikong Indian Day School has declined the position and requesting that Miss Mary Sullivan of Greenboro, Quebec, be appointed in her place.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will consent to the temporary appointment of Miss Sullivan and will pay her a salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum. It is noted that she has no professional qualifications and you should advise Rev. Father Artus that the Department would like him to obtain the services of a teacher with professional qualifications as soon as he can arrange to do so. It is considered that a teacher with the education which Miss Sullivan possesses would not meet with much success in the Indian Day Schools.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform the Rev. Father of the temporary appointment of Miss Sullivan and she should arrive at Wikwemikong and take up her duties as assistant teacher as soon as possible. You will be good enough to inform the Department of the date on which she begins duty.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning,\nOnt.\nOttawa, October 9, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 10th instant in regard to the appointment of Miss Mary Sullivan to the position of assistant teacher at the Wikwemikong Bay School I have to request that you will be good enough to state whether the Rev. Father Artus has been successful in securing her services. It is noted from the quarterly returns received that temporary teachers carried on the work in the junior class-room during the quarter. If Miss Sullivan accepts the position you will be good enough to inform the Department of the date on which she began duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. J.

Father Artus, Missionary in charge at Wikwemikong, to recommend another teacher for the position, and he informed me that he had not anything further to do with recommending teachers for the schools. He informed me further that he had received a letter from the Department in connection with the appointment of teachers for the Indian Schools which displeased him very much, and in future he could not make any more recommendations; therefore, the Department will have to appoint a teacher for the position as assistant at Wikwemikong School without the recommendation of the Missionary in charge.\n\nThe work in the junior class-room is being successfully carried on by a temporary teacher, Mrs. Chas. S. King, who taught at South Bay School some years ago, and she will continue to teach until the Department secures the services of another teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 17, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, in which you state that Miss Mary Sullivan, who was offered the position as assistant teacher at the Wikwemikong Day School, has declined to accept the offer, as she is attending Normal School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will endeavour to secure the services of another teacher for this position and will inform you, should it succeed in obtaining the services of a suitable person.\n\nIn the meantime, Mrs. Chas.

Her present salary is at the rate of $500.00\nper annum, which was raised from $450.00 from the first of\nSeptember, 1917, the time she was transferred to this school\nfrom the East Bay Day School. She has a Normal School Certi-\nficate and the Inspector states that the work done in the\nSenior Room is excellent and that Miss St. James is deserving\nof a much higher salary.

She has been granted this extra leave and will be at the school to assume duties on the above date.\n\nShe has suggested that, in the meantime, it might be possible to secure the services as a substitute teacher of Mrs. King or her daughter, Miss King, who have formerly taught in a like capacity during the past. You may therefore arrange with one of these ladies to teach temporarily from the time the school re-opens after the present holidays until Miss Sloane returns. Miss Sloane will arrange to pay the salary of the substitute teacher and, in preparing a return for the September quarter, will include the days taught by the substitute with the days taught by herself and the cheque for the September quarter's salary will be made payable and sent to Miss Sloane. You will be good enough to endeavour to arrange for a substitute, in order that there will be a teacher to take up the work in the junior room when the school re-opens.

The restrooms in some schools and the teachers' rooms are much too large.\n\nW.C.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am sending you the school reports on the Catholic Indian Schools of Whitefish Lake, West Bay, Buswah, South Bay, Kaboni, Wikwemikong.\n\nAlso enclosed you will find a report on the Indian children in attendance at the Little Current Separate School. Please take particular note of this as I feel that the school board concerned should be reimbursed. An early reply to this will favour. I trust you will look on it favourably.\n\nWould you be good enough to give each report a close scrutiny for the following reasons?\n\nSouth Bay has just been opened after some years being closed. Naturally there are things needed.\n\nWest Bay needs some very heavy articles.\n\nBuswah school school can only be condemned as a school building. However if other school buildings were to be erected to meet the needs of other parts of this reserve I would suggest that this be left as it is and kept in repair until a new school could be built. When you contemplate this I would suggest that it be located somewhere east of the Buswah church on the Wikwemikong road. The present location is not at all central for the territory served.\n\nWikwemikong school serves a good number of children but it cannot serve all that it is supposed to do. Across the bay from this school is a group of children (30) who never can come due to the distance. North West of here about five miles and more at a place called Rock Village is another group unable to attend. I found this out on enquiry from the teacher as to the large number (150) on the reserve attending this school and the few in comparison that attend (57). I am a firm believer in the efficiency of the small rural school if properly staffed, and in its ability to serve the people. Can something be done to build small schools one at each of these places?\n\nThe school at Wikwemikong is closed. Some 10 children here are not at school. Kaboni is too far over five miles.\n\nNow regarding Whitefish Lake school five miles from the C.P.R. Station at Naughton. This school is being held in the Indian church and the teachers rooms are in a lean to at the back. This is my first visit here. Last year I had very little time to spare. I will not say very much except that you know the situation well and no doubt agree that it is not suitable to hold school in the Indian church here. I urgently call this to your attention. When could the Department arrange to build?\n\nI present the above to your favourable consideration.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nInspector of Separate Schools\nNorthern Ontario.\nOttawa, September 27, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant furnishing your reports of inspection on the Roman Catholic Indian Schools on Manitoulin Island.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as you have already been informed, your report on each of the schools visited has been given careful attention and the various matters referred to therein are being attended to.\n\nWith reference, however, to the school situation at Wikwemikong, in which you recommend that two new schools be established for the purpose of accommodating the children residing at a place called Jocko Village and also at a point across Smith Bay from Wikwemikong, I beg to say that, owing to the many calls on the Department at the present time, it will not be possible to erect new school buildings this year. The matter of providing school accommodation for the children at both these points will not be lost sight of.\n\nThe Department has to thank you for the full reports you forwarded regarding each of the schools visited and for the interest you take in the education of the Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

She has had normal training in the U.S.A.\n\nThere is an enrollment of 113 children at this school with an average attendance of 84; 50 pupils are enrolled in the senior room with an average of 38, and 63 in the junior room with an average of 46.\n\nMr. Bennett, the Separate School Inspector, in his report of inspection dated September 14th, last, states that Miss St. James is one of the most capable and earnest teachers in the Indian schools. The work done by her is of a very high order and he recommended that her salary be increased.\n\nThe junior teacher, Miss Peltier, is paid at the rate of $550 per annum and bonus of $150. There is a difference of only $50 in the amount received by these teachers.\n\nThe salaries are paid from the appropriation for Indian education, and I would beg to recommend, in consideration of Miss St. James' many years experience and the satisfactory work she is performing, that she be granted an increase of $100 from the 1st of September, last, the beginning of the present school year.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, Oct. 4th, 1921.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, applying for an increase in your salary as senior teacher of the Wikwemikong Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that in view of your experience, and the satisfactory work you are performing, the Department will approve of an increase of $100 in salary being granted you from the 1st of September, last.

Owing to the fact that justice forces me to oppose the actual chiefs in what I wrote above, they did not speak to me of their idea of having here a third teacher. I would have told them that there is no need of it, because, while for a short period every year when I have preparation for first communications, and again for a short while when there is to be an entertainment, the average attendance is never more than what the two present teachers can very well manage. I would have added that next year the number of pupils shall be smaller, owing to a good many of them going to the Industrial School, - and again that the families having more and more the village to live on the farm, the attendance at school shall no more be large as it has been.\n\nOf course, if there had been a real need of a third teacher, worth the expense of it, it is I first and the teachers who would have applied for it.\n\nIf there is money to spend, they should support some better their poor, their old or sick people.\n\nRev.

Attendance is fair but especially good at Wikwemikong, where I think another teacher could well be provided as the classes are too large for the present staff.\n\n(Lgd.) C. C. Parker.\nNikwemikong, Ont.\nDec. 18th, 1922.\n\nTo the Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs,-\n\nThe following is the report of my work on this reserve for the past month.\n\nIf only they all would send their children to school. I see so many children of school age running around the roads during school hours.\n\nOn November 15th I visited the two school rooms here. I did not think it was a good idea to have two single desks close together as they have them. The primary teacher frequently complains of her pupils having sore throats. My idea of the children sitting close together, is that they catch one another's breath, and they transmit their diseases this way. I am mentioning this to Mr. Lewis, the Indian Agent.\n\nAgnes Sampson.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report that Miss Isabelle Feltier, assistant teacher at the Wikwemikong School, is ill and cannot perform her duties in the class-room, and rather than have the junior room closed arrangement has been made with Mrs. Chas.

I shall be glad to hear from you whether or not you can obtain a teacher to succeed Miss St. James.

This will make her salary from that date at the rate of $600 per annum. She will also be entitled to the bonus provided by law. Payment of both salary and bonus is based on ten teaching months in the year. A cheque for $5, being the balance due at the increased rate for the month of September, last, will be sent Miss Fox.

Lewis Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitouining Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAt a meeting of the Indians of Manitoulin Island, which was held this day in council and called in accordance with the rules of the Band. It was proposed by John F. Bebanmitte and John Odaowanmitte and carried unanimously that a request be sent to the Department of Indian Affairs for the erection of a new school house in the vicinity of Rabbit Island in the lot of Isaac Wabassime. There are about forty-one children of school age which necessitates having a school at that place.\n\nThe Band is in favour of using the capital funds of the band for the construction of said school.\n\nJohn F. Bebanmitte\nJohn Odaowanmitte\nJoseph Wabassime\nJoseph E. Odaowanmitte\nJames Shewahna\nJno X Pontiac\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nFebruary 5th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a copy of a resolution by the Chief and Councillors of the Manitoulin Island Unceded Band, of the 2nd instant, requesting the Department to authorize the erection of a new schoolhouse in the vicinity of Rabbit Island on the land of Mr. Isaac W. Assinewai on the Manitoulin Island Unceded Reserve and the cost of the same be charged against the funds at the credit of the Band.\n\nIt is claimed by some of the members of the Band that there are forty-one children in the section where they ask the school building to be erected; but on looking over the whole district I find that there are a number of these children under school age and it is a question if there would be ample children of school age who could attend regularly to warrant the opening of a school.\n\nAt the present time I cannot recommend to the Department that a new building be erected and a school opened in the section of Rabbit Island.\n\nI might also say for the information of the Department that Rabbit Island section referred to, is a farming section north of Wikwemikong Village, and the location for the proposed school is about a distance of four miles from Wikwemikong.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 12th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, enclosing copy of a resolution of the Chief and Councillors of the Manitoulin Island Unceded Band dated the 2nd instant, requesting the Department to erect a school for the benefit of the Indian children residing in the vicinity of Rabbit Island, the cost thereof to be charged against the funds at the credit of the Band.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department, after considering this request, is not prepared at the present time to erect a new building and open a school at this point. Arrangements could, no doubt, be made to have a number of children of school age who are too far distant to attend the day school at Wikwemikong placed in the Spanish Residential School. However, as the Spanish School has at present the full number of pupils in residence which it can accommodate, the placing of any of the children residing in the vicinity of Rabbit Island would have to remain in abeyance until after the summer holidays next. You might take up with the Principal the matter of placing a number of these children in the Spanish School, and he could consider it when arranging for recruiting for the school next summer.\n\nPlease inform the Indians interested that the Department is unable to accede to the request as contained in their resolution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitouining, Ont.\nSt. Mary's, Mar. 27th\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that I am unable to attend the meeting of the Board of Directors at this time.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nI have read the instructions for the new school system. It seems that the school board will be responsible for the management of the school. It also mentions that the school board will be responsible for the maintenance of the school buildings.\n\nThe school board will also be responsible for the hiring of teachers and the administration of the school. It is important that the school board follows these instructions closely to ensure the success of the new school system.\n\nI hope this information helps you understand the new school system better.\nMiss Louise Bennett,\nIndian Residential School,\nSpanish, Ont.\n\nDepartment approves of Miss Lariviere acting as substitute for Miss Burke at Wikwemikong.\n\nJ.

We are in correspondence with a prospective teacher and hope to be able to make a temporary appointment at an early date. The authorities also informed us in writing of the illness of Miss Burke recommended the appointment of Miss Lariviere, but subsequently informed us that she could not accept.

If desired, Miss Fox, the junior teacher, could be appointed to take charge of the senior room and the new teacher could replace her in the junior room. Miss Fox would be paid salary at the same rate as Miss Burke received, if she takes charge of the senior room, and the teacher of the junior room would be paid the same salary as Miss Fox is at present receiving.

Miss Ines Moultrie of Demers Centre, Que., who claims to have had three years of successful experience in teaching has asked for a school, and Miss Mary Stella Macdonald, Macalister, Ont., who has a good standing in her first year in High School and has been teaching in the Convent, is very anxious for a position as teacher in a school; also Miss Isabelle Peltier who has taught as a junior class-room at Wikwemikong on previous occasions and has charge of different schools under the supervision of the Department, has made application for the position as junior teacher at Wikwemikong, but I understand that Miss Peltier has charge of a school in the agency at Sainte-Marie, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 12, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 154-5-29 of the 7th instant, recommending that Miss Susan A.

Fox, teacher in charge of the Senior Class room at the Wikwemikong School, is in poor health and it is necessary for her to undergo an operation which will mean that she will have to be granted one month leave of absence.\n\nIt is thought that Miss Charlebois, teacher in charge of the Junior Classes, can manage all the Classes during the absence of Miss Fox.\n\nI enclose a copy of a certificate by Dr. J.A. Dixon, of Sudbury, regarding this case.\n\nI would most respectfully recommend that Miss Fox be given one month leave of absence in order that she may have the necessary operation performed, and that Miss Charlebois be given charge of all the Classes during her absence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 20, 1930.\n\nThe Department has received the resignation of Miss Charlebois, teacher of the junior classroom at the Wikwemikong Indian Day School, to take effect at the end of the present school year.

Fox, senior teacher of the Wikwemikong Indian Day School, to be granted one month's leave of absence, and enclosing a doctor's certificate regarding her case. In reply I beg to say that the illness of Miss Fox is regretted. Her absence from duty for a period of approximately one month is approved.\n\nIn view of your report that Miss Josephine Charlebois, the assistant teacher, can take charge of all the classes during the absence of Miss Fox, the Department will approve of this arrangement. It is hoped that Miss Fox will be able to resume duties at the end of the month's leave of absence and that in the meantime Miss Charlebois will be able to carry on the work. Miss Fox will be allowed salary during the month she is absent. Please advise her of the leave of absence granted.\n\nIt should be definitely stated on the quarterly return the date on which Miss Fox gave up duties and also the date on which she resumes same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It is noted that, owing to the large number of pupils attending, Miss Charlebois, the assistant teacher, finds it impossible to give both classes the required attention.\n\nRather than close the senior classroom, you should, if you can arrange to do so, engage the services of a substitute teacher until the Christmas holidays, by which time it is hoped Miss Fox will be able to resume duties. Miss Charlebois could take charge of the senior room and the substitute teacher the junior room. The question of salary to be allowed a substitute will be determined when we have particulars as to the name, qualifications, etc. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to make the necessary arrangements for carrying on the work until Miss Fox returns, and you should state, at an early date, the name, qualifications, etc., of the substitute teacher engaged. We note that you are of the opinion that a substitute teacher can be obtained locally.\n\nYou should ascertain from Miss Fox when she expects to be able to return duties, and if her condition of health will not permit her to return after the Christmas holidays, the services of a qualified teacher could then be engaged.\n\nPlease give the matter of obtaining a substitute teacher your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The Department will arrange for a substitute teacher for the remainder of the academic year.\n\nCheques covering your salary as teacher and for the janitor services and the carrying of water are being sent you.

The illness of Miss Fox is regretted. We are informing her that the matter of engaging the services of a substitute to begin duties January 3rd next, will be dealt with by the Department. You will be informed later as to the name, qualifications, etc., of the teacher appointed for the balance of the school year.\n\nThe Department has had no reply to its letter of the last instant, relative to the obtaining of a substitute teacher to carry on the work to the end of the current quarter, and I shall be pleased if you will state whether a substitute was engaged or whether Miss Fox was able to carry on the work. If a substitute was engaged, you should furnish full particulars as to the dates between which she taught, in order that the salary due her can be paid.\n\nWe are forwarding Miss Fox cheques for her salary as teacher, janitor services and for the carrying of the water during the present quarter. It will, therefore, not be necessary for you to forward vouchers covering these services. She states that there is an amount due her of $5 for prizes for the senior room, and you should obtain and forward itemized accounts, properly certified, for the amount due, and you should state thereon the address to which the cheques should be sent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

As it is uncertain whether\nshe will return, or not, I believe that it would be\nadvisable to engage a teacher to take charge of the\nsenior class-room, to replace Miss Fox, for at least\nthe March quarter, next, or until the end of the school\n\nArrangement was under way to secure the services\nof a substitute teacher, in the person of Miss Jean\nMcDonald who taught for some years at the West Bay\nschool, to take charge of Miss Fox's until the\nChristmas holidays, but as Miss Fox could not decide\non the exact date she would enter the hospital,\nI could not carry out any arrangement in the way of\nsecuring the services of a substitute teacher or\nadvise the Department in the matter. Now that she\nhas finally decided to go to the hospital next\nweek, I would ask the Department to make an effort\nto secure the services of a suitable teacher to\nsucceed her. It may be the case that the services\nof Miss McDonald are still available, but I cannot\nassure the Department of this as at this season of\nthe year communication with Killarney, where Miss\nMcDonald resides, is closed for two weeks or more\non account of ice condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 5, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 164-8-32 of the 22nd ultimo, with reference to the appointment of a teacher to replace Miss Pax for the rest of the academic year.

We understood from previous correspondence received from Miss Fox and the Indian Agent that she would be unable to return to the school for a considerable period of time and we therefore felt it necessary to secure a teacher.\n\nBefore making any appointment, however, Mr. Phelan received a letter from Miss O'Driscoll, suggesting the name of Miss D'Amour. We waited until Wednesday, last, but no application was received from her and, as a matter of fact, we have not yet heard from her.\n\nWe did not wish the school to be without a teacher and therefore engaged the services of Miss Rita Chisholm, who holds Ontario qualifications, to take charge until June 30th, next. It was intended, when she was appointed the other day, to have both Miss Charlebois and herself leave here on the 20th instant; but Miss Charlebois is not well at present and we have therefore arranged for them to delay their departure until the 17th instant.\n\nI wish to assure you that, in appointing Miss Chisholm, the Department was only acting in what was considered the best interest of all concerned, as I understand that your Order had not a teacher available. As pointed out above, her appointment is only until the end of the current academic year, as we could not secure her consent to go for a shorter time. It is impossible for us to cancel her appointment at present and I trust that, when you have given this letter your careful consideration, our action will meet with your concurrence. It is distinctly understood, of course, that for the new academic year, beginning September first, next, we will look to you to nominate a suitable teacher, or teachers, if you have two available, for this school.\n\nWith best wishes for the New Year,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMiss L.

That Miss Charlebois returns should give no cause of complaint to those who favor Agnes; while the appointment of a new teacher, would cause friction with her many relatives.\n\nMiss Alice Straine is the teacher named for senior room. She has a New York Academic Certificate, but no professional, she is taking the Summer Course in Ottawa at present, to qualify for her Ontario professional - has had two years' as teacher in white schools and four years as prefect in the school at Spanish.\n\nHoping this is satisfactory.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPOOR COPY\n19-6-1.\n\nOttawa, July 26th, 1927.\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, nominating the services of Miss Alice Straine as senior teacher of the Wikwemikong Indian Day School for the next school year, and stating the qualifications and experience which she possesses.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the appointment of Miss Straine is approved, to begin duties when the school reopens after the present summer holidays.

Lewis about Miss Hickory, one of the Spanish ladies who came here. She was sent to take charge of the smaller children at the school. I informed him of my objection to the return of Miss Everard. I have frequent occasion to find out that this young lady seems caring nothing for the Indians in general; she has little interest in her own pupils, neither as one who wants to take a little trouble to handle or have a good time as much as one can; and based on experience with the children of that class, I believe more than once a week during the whole year is that they have made very little impression. Despite of any discipline, there is no teacher, whether for the Indians or others.\n\nShould she come again, it will be another great loss for the institution. If Miss Hickory was not to come, I would expect much more of Miss Mary than from the other.\n\nI hope, dear Sir, that you will take an interest in Indian education, even if you consider favorably this my letter.\n\nI remain,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, August 6th, 1929.\n\nDear Miss Charlebois,\n\nThe Marjane Sisters have intimated to the Department their desire to place a second member of their Order in the Wikwemikong School. I am advising them that you have been re-engaged but, as there is a vacancy at West Bay Indian Day School and, possibly, a vacancy at another of the day schools near Wikwemikong. I thought that you might possibly consider a transfer to one of these schools and thus permit the Marjane Sisters to have full charge of the Wikwemikong School, as they had in former years. Would it be possible for you to visit the Department in the near future in connection with this matter? If not, you should write me at once.\n\nI may say that both at West Bay and at the other school mentioned there is only one teacher but at both of them very comfortable teachers' quarters are provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSept. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Josephine Charlebois,\nDunrobin,\nOntario.\nOttawa, August 6th, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to the teachers at the Wikwemikong Indian Day School.

It is hoped that our efforts in this regard will meet with the approval of all concerned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. G. A. Arden, S.J.,\nWikwemikong,\nOntario.\nDear Sir,\n\nThe school year is gone, and I am not pleased with the results. The children have not been able to keep up with the schedule. The sickness of one child has kept me from doing my work properly.\n\nBut as for the group women in charge of the mission, who have been the principal for the second part of the year, it is difficult, and I wish they could come more often. It is evident that she cannot get the Indians to discipline them...so that she would not even eat excellent bread made by Mrs. King.\n\nShe does not seem to care any more for the progress of the children at school, since she would rather punish them or leave them alone for a while, likely under the pretense of getting her own meat today. Since she had obtained permission to take Easter holidays out of the time, where the children went there, she may be able to attend here. Since she did give no kind of examination or exhibitions, while being principal.\n\nAnd, so what I have seen in her case, it does not seem that she knew how to train children to think and to work. She is a good enough disciplinarian, but, at least...\nFor our Indian Schools I don't think that the\nweather property\nHow I believe that Miss Minnie is very better\none, and if she was offered to her she would accept\nto take Miss Chisholm's room, while one of the\nSpanish ladies should take the seniors and be the\nprincipal.\n\nI also wish to remark that the\nfence along the main road and the steps down to\nthe school are in very poor condition.\n\nDone in the lot\n\n[Signature]\n\nE.

SCOTT,\n\nOn the 23rd ultimo, I visited the Wikwemikong Indian Day School, which is at present conducted in the old building near the church. As far as I could learn from a brief visit, Miss Sadie Burke and Miss Agnes Manitowab - the latter an Indian girl - are doing very efficient work.\n\nI visited the new building which was erected during the fall and early winter, and I believe it very suitable for our purposes. There is considerable still to be done, however, before school can be conducted there, as follows:\n\n1. Well and water supply system.\n2. Sewage disposal system.\n3. Outdoor toilets for boys and girls.\n4. Benches for Monday lunch.\n5. Cupboards for children's dishes.\n6. Woodshed.\n7. Kitchen cupboards and tables.\n8. Dry storeroom in the cellar.\n9. Cupboards and bookcases in classrooms.\n10. Levelling the grounds and fencing.\n11. Chemical toilets for teachers.\n\nThe ladies of the Hardene Order, who are responsible for the teaching at this school, also requested that we provide a summer kitchen at the back. After the building is occupied, the need for this will be better determined. I believe the Department should seriously consider purchasing a few more feet at the back of the building, to take in a rather low spot there. This could\nbe fenced so that cattle would not get into it, and we should consider draining it. I looked at the contour of the land behind and I believe that the draining would be comparatively inexpensive. New desks are not required, as the ones now in use can be sanded and varnished and moved over.\n\nTo properly prepare the building and grounds for school purposes will require a considerable outlay and I propose to place an item in the Estimates for the coming fiscal year. Of course, there are no funds at the present time for the purpose, and, anyway, for some reason or other, the teachers are not in a hurry to move to their new quarters. They asked that the final work be postponed until next fall. Father Artus also requested that we postpone moving to the new building until 1928. In view of the fact that funds were not available to prepare the school for occupation, I informed them that we would consider their request.\n\nIn view of the whole situation, I wish to recommend that we prepare new school for occupation early in 1928 and that the classes and teachers move over as from September first of that year.\n\nRussell T. Girrier\nSupt. of Indian Education\nJuly 3rd, 1931.\n\nDear Miss Ings,\n\nI enclose copy of letter received from one of the teachers at Wikwemikong regarding the condition of the school property after the clinics held there last year. I also enclose copy of letter written to Miss Burk in this connection for your information.\n\nYou will understand, of course, that wherever you are sent, any property used is expected to be left in good condition, and if necessary you should engage a charwoman to do the necessary work. This applies whether the condition in which you find any building or equipment is satisfactory when you arrive or not.\n\nMiss Moodie tells me that the condition of the beds at the old school at Wikwemikong was anything but satisfactory, and you will observe that I have mentioned this to Miss Burk.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you in this connection.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nMiss Olive Ings,\nc/o G.H. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.\nJuly 4 / 31\n\nDear Mr Mac Kenzie,\n\nYour letter of July 3rd to hand. With reference to the school at Wikwemikong I wish to state as follows.\n\nIt is quite evident that someone else used the school building after the clinic was held. The building was left in good order. Two Indian women cleaned the rooms that were used.\n\nMost of the bedding that was used (including quilts and sheets & blankets) was furnished by the 4 Indian women who took care of the tonsil cases. Such bedding belonging to the school as was used was laundered afterwards. The first night Miss Moodie and I stayed at the school the condition of the beds was just as she stated. In addition the mattress of one of the beds at that time was stained. At the time the second clinic was held most of the children slept on cots provided by the Indian Agent for that purpose. The 2 gasoline lamps were not used at either clinic.\n\nYours truly,\n\nO. Sye.\nCopy for Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nTORONTO, January 16th, 1942.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant and to state in reply that reports on Indian Schools are made by the Inspectors to the Department of Indian Affairs and any records of the School Inspectors mentioned by you would be in the above Department at Ottawa.\n\nA copy of your letter and a copy of this letter are being sent to the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nChief Inspector.\n\nJames Hanlon Esq.,\nSt. Mary's Orphanage,\nCresson, Pennsylvania.\n\nV.K.O.-K.B.\nSt. Mary's Orphanage,\nCresson, Penna.\nJanuary 12th, 1932.\n\nDepartment of Education,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nI taught in the Wikwemikong Industrial School from January 1904 to June 1908. Two Inspectors, Mr. Power and Mr. O'Brien made their periodical inspections. They must have made to your Department some report as to the character of my work and of my scholastic attainments. I should like to have a transcription of that report - or a few lines from you stating that I taught successfully for about four years in Ontario. This is necessary for me now as I am about to apply to the State Department here for a Permanent Certificate. Thanking you for your courtesy in this instance\n\nI am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nSigned - James Hanlon,\nOttawa, January 30, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received, from the Provincial Department of Education, Toronto, a copy of your letter of the 12th instant, requesting a report on your services during the period you taught at the Wikwemikong Boys' Industrial School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that your services were engaged by the authorities of the school, and, from the information which we have on our files, you taught as senior teacher during the period from January, 1904, to the end of October, 1907. The Department was advised by Mr. T. H. Couture, Principal of the school at the time, that you had resigned, having left for Europe. The only report this Department has from a public school inspector during the period of your service was covering an inspection made by Mr. Michael O'Brien, Separate School Inspector, dated October 17, 1904, in which he stated as follows: \"The Principal, or Senior Teacher, is Mr. James Hanlon, an intelligent, well educated young man. He is energetic and ambitious and he has a bright, well trained class of Indian boys.\" Our records are incomplete for the period covered by your service as teacher at the Wikwemikong Indian Residential School, owing to the fact that you were engaged and salary paid by the school management.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Parrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJames Hanlon, Esq.,\nSt. Mary's Orphanage,\nCresson, Penn.,\nU. S. A.\nToronto, April 5th, 1932.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg leave to acknowledge your letter of March 31st., and in reply to state that the Department of Education receives many requests similar to that made by Miss Sadie J. Burke and you can understand how difficult it would be to break the Regulations for individual cases.\n\nCompulsory attendance at the Second Year Course has been postponed for one year for those teachers who hold Interim certificates obtained in 1928. No decision has been made with regard to those teachers who obtained Interim certificates in 1929. When a decision has been reached a public announcement will be made and Miss Burke will learn the course which will apply to her particular case.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nAssistant to the Deputy Minister.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nEXTRACT from Inspector Greening's Report regarding his visit to the WIKWEMIKONG INDIAN DAY SCHOOL on June 2, 1932.\n\nOriginal on File 19-6-6.\n\nThis school is doing really splendid work. The Ontario Department of Education permits inspectors to recommend for promotion without actual writing of Department Examinations Fifth Form pupils from such schools as the Inspector considers worthy of such consideration. Outside of the large schools in Fort Arthur and Fort William, the writer has felt able to recommend this concession in the case of only one school, Wikwemikong Indian Day School, an indication of his grading of the school.\n\nAt this inspection the Inspector was accompanied by the Director of the Junior Red Cross for Ontario. In her honour, the pupils of the school, aided by the Reserve Brass Band, put on a little concert, the main feature of which was a \"Health Play\". Both the Inspector and the Director of Junior Red Cross saw two of these plays presented at the Ontario Educational Association Meeting at Toronto last Easter. Both agree that the play seen at Wikwemikong was decidedly superior to one of the plays seen at Toronto and did not need to fear comparison with the other.\nW. J. GREENING, B.A., B.PAED.\nInspector of Separate Schools\nPORT ARTHUR\nONTARIO\n\n454 St. Patrick's Square,\nPort Arthur, Ontario.\nJune 18, 1932.\n\nTo\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Education,\nTORONTO, Ontario.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit, herewith, Exam. Form 165B in connection with the Fifth Forms conducted in the following city schools:\n\nSt. Patrick's, Fort William\nSt. Andrew's, Port Arthur\n\nI have given this matter very careful consideration, having in mind the recent circular from the Chief Inspector of Public and Separate Schools in regard to the number to be chosen to write the Departmental Examinations, and the manner enclosed forms represent the results of my investigations and selections. Where a mark is given in red, it indicates that the candidate will write the Departmental examination, and the mark indicates our estimate of what he should do thereat under normal conditions.\n\nThere is also enclosed, herewith, a similar form recommending that two young girls of the Indian Day School at Wikwemikong, (Manitoulin Island), be given standing on recommendation. This Indian Day School is staffed by very superior Second Class (Ontario) teachers. My estimate of its efficiency is to be deduced from the fact that, although I have two two-roomed Provincial separate Schools taking Fifth Form work, (Rainy River, and Shadden No. 1 at Spanish), I am not prepared, at present, to recommend a like treatment in their cases. It is possible, however, that I shall reach and maintain or gain privilege at Rainy River next year if its efficiency continues to increase as it has done these past two years. Wikwemikong is the Indian Day School about which the writer consulted the Registrar, (Major Cowles), at Easter. The Registrar concurred in my request that standing upon recommendation be given to these young ladies, and asked me to so state in this letter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector.\nGirls' Residential School,\nSpanish Ont.\nAug. 27, 1932.\n\nDear Miss Kenzie,\n\nMiss Leusch's health has been failing and on consulting a doctor was advised not to teach this coming year. She will therefore return to Nipigon as companion and house keeper to Miss Burke.\n\nMiss Burke had to undergo an operation early in July and is not getting along as well as the doctors hoped she would. As Nipigon is a much smaller and easier school than Wikwemikong we think it would be advisable to send Miss Burke to Nipigon with Miss Leusch.\n\nMiss Louise Gatty would go to Wikwemikong. She has had a number of years' experience in white schools and has taught for us here in the house. She holds a permanent Second Class Certificate and will, I think, do well at Wikwemikong.\n\nKindly let us know, at your earliest convenience, if this change meets with the approval of the Department.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 29, 1938.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant, informing the Department that, on account of failing health, Miss Leusch will not be resuming duties as teacher at Lake Helen and recommending the transfer of Miss Sadie J. Burke, formerly teacher at the Wikwemikong Indian Day School, to succeed Miss Leusch at Lake Helen. The Department will approve of this transfer. The salary allowed Miss Burke will be at the same rate as paid Miss Leusch, viz.: $100 per teaching month, less 10% for the current fiscal year.\n\nApproval is granted for the appointment of Miss Louise Gatty to succeed Miss Burke at the Wikwemikong Indian Day School. The salary allowed in her case will be the same as was paid Miss Burke, viz.: $95 per teaching month, less 10% for the current fiscal year.\n\nThe respective Indian agents are being informed of the above appointments and will be requested to give each of the teachers every assistance they can in their work at the schools.\n\nThe Department learns with regret that Miss Leusch is giving up teaching duties, after many years' successful service. Her service while teaching for this Department have been entirely satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Louise Bennet,\nPrincipal,\nGirls' Indian Residential School,\nSpanish, Ont.\nOttawa, August 29, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department is approving of the transfer of Miss Sadie J. Burke, senior teacher of the Wikwemikong Indian Day School, to the Lake Helen Indian Day School, in the Port Arthur agency. Miss Louise Gatty has been appointed to succeed Miss Burke at Wikwemikong, with salary at the rate of $95 per teaching month, less 10% for the current fiscal year.\n\nI have to request that you will give Miss Gatty any assistance you can in her work at the school and in encouraging a regular attendance of the Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Burke to the effect that on account of ill health she requests the Department to accept her resignation as principal of the Wikwemikong Indian Day School.\n\nMiss Burke has advised also that Miss Betty, of Spanish, is recommended by the Roman Catholic Mission to be her successor, and that that she is a thoroughly qualified teacher for the province as she holds a permanent second class certificate and has several years of successful teaching in public schools in the north.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nOct. 14th 1932.\n\nDuncan Scott Esq.\nDear Sir,\n\nWould it be possible for the new school that was built here about two years ago to be opened? It's about time that this old school was condemned. It will fit for young children to be in upstairs in the young class, the roof leaks badly, & the boys have to go sweeping the floor every time it rains. It even comes on the children desks and another thing, the yard where the children play is disgraceful every fall, offering nothing but a pool of water. I have seen it myself so I know at night the children have to go play on the front steps. I have four children going to school there several all close. It's a shame that they have to be in a school like that when there is a new school. Would it be too much for you to see if the new school can be used.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\n19-6-1.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, October 7, 1932.\n\nTo: Mrs. D.

There is an enrolment of thirty-four in the senior class-room, and fifty in the junior class-room.\n\nI might also say that a number of pupils who were attending this school last year have been admitted to the Residential School at Spanish as the parents consider it too great a distance from this school to allow them to attend regularly.\n\nIt would appear to me that the attendance this year, so far, is quite satisfactory as the enrolment being eighty-four this quarter compared with seventy-six during June Quarter last without making any allowance for the number of pupils sent to the Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n19-6-1\n\nThe Secretary,\nMcKerrow's Office,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nThe Manitoulin Island Agricultural Society requests to have the use of the new school building at Whitecorming village for agricultural purposes, that is for holding parties etc., for raising funds for the society.\n\nIt is the request to have the school open for use by the Society until it is open for school purposes next summer.\n\nThe said Society will keep the said building in good order and clean.\n\nYours truly,\n\nManitoulin Island Agricultural Society\n\nSports Committee\n\n[Signature]\nJ.

The signatures to the letter are as follows:\nR. P. Naseegiig, J. E. Jacko and Thomas Pelletier.\nThey request the use of the new school building at Wikwemikong for the purpose of holding parties, etc., in order to raise funds for the Society, until such time as the building is required for school purposes. They state they will keep the building in good order and in a cleanly condition.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your opinion regarding this request. I may say that unless the Department is definitely assured that no damage would be incurred, we would not be prepared to consider the request. It is thought the members of the Agricultural Society could make other arrangements for the holding of their assemblies. There would be danger of damage to the new school building if used for the purposes mentioned. We will await your report regarding the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Some time ago the Sports Committee asked a similar request at this office, and they were advised to the effect that under no consideration would they be allowed to make use of the new building as an amusement hall as it was erected for the purpose of a school building, and the interior finish should be kept clean and in good condition until such time as it would be re-opened for school purposes. On account of this refusal they carried their request to the Department.\n\nAn effort has been made to have this building kept in as good a condition as possible until the present time, by having the constable to keep on fires during the cold weather and see that no garbage does get dumped in the building; therefore, I consider that it would be well to let the constable carry on in looking after this building, and not let any organization make use of it to hold social gatherings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n19-6-1.\n\nOttawa, February 15, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, regarding the request made by the Sports Committee of the Manitoulin Island Unceded Band Agricultural Society to use the new school building at Wikwemikong for the purpose of holding parties in order to raise funds.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Sports Committee are being informed that the Department cannot grant them permission to use this building.

At the outset I may say that we do not appear to have had any report from the Indian Agent with reference to the matter to which you refer in the second paragraph of your letter.\n\nWhile regretting that the conduct of the children after school hours is not all it might be at the same time I think that it is extremely difficult for you to take this into account when preparing the quarterly return. This is presumed to be a report on the children in attendance at school and includes their grading, the number of days they attend and their standing in the class. If this information is supplied on the return I think you are doing all that you are required to do.\n\nOf course, if at any time you feel that moral conditions on the Reserve are not as good as they should be it is your privilege to either bring the matter to the attention of the Indian Agent or direct to the Department. In all such cases, of course, it is necessary for us to have complete facts such as names, places and a brief account, at least, of the occurrence which you think is undesirable.\n\nWith kind personal regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss Catherine O'Driscoll,\nIndian Day School,\nWikwemikong, Ont.\n19-6-1\n\nHikwe mikwong,\nKawartha Lake,\nOntario.\n\nNov 9th 1939.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Gentlemen,\n\nI have kindly let me know whether or not I may be allowed to teach till the end of June, 1940, if I got married sometime soon.\n\nI am teaching the senior class at Hikwe mikwong Day School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRita Trudeau.\nOttawa,\nNovember 16, 1939.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant present regulations do not permit our employing teachers who are married and whose husbands are able to support them.

I am accordingly again asking your assistance in placing our students in schools where the week may be as beneficial as possible.\n\nDue to the fact that it is not possible to assign all our students to rural schools at one time, some will do urban teaching in January, having previously taught in a rural school in November. Where at all feasible rural schools should be regarded as those with not more than two teachers, no doubt though in some cases three-teacher schools will have to be used for the rural week.\n\nIn most instances the students have indicated their choice of schools. Should such schools not be satisfactory, kindly make any changes that you deem advisable.\n\nI should be pleased to have you return one copy of the enclosed allocation sheets by December 1st; the other may be retained for your files.\n\nAgain thanking you for your assistance in this phase of teacher training, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nE. C. Beaconsfield\nPrincipal\n\nMr. W. J. Greening, B.A., B.Paed.,\n288 Harrington Avenue,\nPORT ARTHUR, ONT.\nW.J. GREENING, B.A., B.PAED.\nInspector of Separate Schools\nPORT ARTHUR\nONTARIO\n\n288 Harrington Avenue,\nPort Arthur, Ontario.\nNovember 25, 1940.\n\nDear Mrs. Beacom:\n\nI was away from Port Arthur, on this last trip, for only some eight days terminating today, and so am answering your letter of November in a little more speedily than usual. It is hoped that the unusually prompt reply won't give you a shock or anything like that.\n\nThe school at Wikwemikong is an Indian Lay school, operated by the Indian Affairs Branch of the Dominion Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nHitherto, when any teacher has applied to be permitted to do practice teaching in an Indian School I have always preferred their going to a regular Provincial school.\n\nHowever, there are some special circumstances in this case. Miss Wikwemikong is an Indian maiden, and she will, in all probability, be teaching in an Indian school among her own people, since Indian Affairs is genuinely interested in helping along promising Indian pupils.\n\nMoreover, Sister H. Lallamont, who is in charge of the Wikwemikong Indian Lay School has had over twenty years' experience in various provincial schools before taking over the Wikwemikong school in September, 1947. She has a Permanent First Class Certificate, with special certificates in Art, and in Art and Crafts. She is genuinely interested in Indian school work, (although she has not had much more than a year's experience at it), because, although she was principal of a Provincial school, she volunteered for Wikwemikong when it fell vacant.\n\nBecause of the special features of this case, I am prepared to recommend that Miss Wikwemikong be allowed to do her teaching at the Wikwemikong Indian Lay School. Special arrangements, I suppose, will have to be made with Indian Affairs for permission to use the Wikwemikong Indian Lay School for this purpose, but I have no doubt that it will be more than willingly granted. I am attaching a copy of a letter I have written to Indian Affairs at Ottawa in this connection. A reply will doubtless be reaching you in a short time.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nW.J. Greening\n\nA.C. Beacom, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nNormal School,\nNorth Bay, Ontario.\nW.J. GREENING, B.A., B.PAED.\nInspector of Separate Schools\nPORT ARTHUR\nONTARIO\n\n288 Harrington Avenue,\nPort Arthur, Ontario.\nNovember 27, 1948.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI believe that the attached copy of letter explains itself.\n\nIt would save time if you sent the principal of the North Bay Normal School the necessary authority for him to use the Wikwemikong Indian Day School for Miss Pitawanakwat's work in Continuous Practice Teaching in Rural schools.\n\nThere is just the one point upon which I am not too certain as to your own views. You know the Wikwemikong situation pretty clearly, including the fact that it is a three-roomed school, a rather unusual school for neophyte Indian teachers to start in.\n\nSuch a teacher would more likely start in a one-roomed school, such as Rabbit Island, or Murray Hill Indian Day School, (if the latter school is yet in operation). Murray Hill Indian Day School is not so very far from the Wikwemikong Indian Day School and if Mrs. John Wabegijig, (Agnes Lantowabi), is in charge, she could give you many valuable \"tips\". As you may perhaps suspect, I have always been very fond of Agnes. She is one of the young ladies I think of first when thinking of what can be turned out from Indian schools.\n\nIt is something for you to think about, as I suppose Gertrude will be in one of your schools next September. Don't be afraid to tell Mr. Beacom just what you think. You will find him prepared \"to lean over backwards\" in grasping any opportunity to help any of his students.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDecember 2, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Greening:\n\nImmediately upon receipt of your letter of November 27th I wrote two letters, copies of which are attached.\n\nI concur with you entirely that it will be preferable for a Practice Teacher to work in a one-room school. However, as I explained to Mr. Beacon, I am not too sure of Mrs. Mcnasse at Rabbit Island and I doubt if Murray Hill will have been in operation long enough to be suitable for our purpose. I am very interested in Gertrude Pitawankwat and hope that we will be able to start her in a fairly easy school next year. In fact, this is one of the things I wish to discuss with you on our proposed joint trip next spring. That is, the matter of placing these young girls in schools in which they have a good chance of making a successful start in their teaching careers.\n\nI have just had good news concerning the Senior Room at West Bay. We have been able to interest a Mrs. Eva Hibbert in this position. She has a Second Class Certificate and taught last year at Iroquois Falls, Ontario. She is prepared to take over this room immediately after the Christmas holidays. I hope that she will prove satisfactory as I realize this school has suffered greatly in the past two or three years.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nMr. W.J.

A copy of this letter is going directly to Sister Lalemant so that it will not be necessary for you to write her in this regard. Sister Lalemant will receive further instructions directly from Mr. E.C. Beacon, Principal of the North Bay Normal School.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nDept. of Indian Education.\nschool for her essay in \"Continuous Practice Teaching in Rural Schools\" and it will be in order for you to write Sister Lalement with any further instructions which you wish to issue.\n\nPlease rest assured that in this and all other matters, we are most anxious to co-operate with you in furthering our program of Indian Education.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nE.C. Beacon, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nNorth Bay Normal School,\nNorth Bay, Ontario.\n\nBF/LH.\nDecember 2, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received a letter from Mr. Inspector Greening concerning the Practice Teaching to be done by Miss Pitawankwat during the period January 3 to January 7, 1949.\n\nI understand that Mr. Greening has recommended that she teach at the Wikwemikong Indian Day School and I concur heartily in his recommendation. Sister Lalement attended your Normal School in 1924-25 and holds a First Class Teachers' Certificate. She has had twenty-one years' of teaching experience and has attended Refresher Courses in 1939 and 1945.\n\nNormally, it would be preferable for Miss Pitawankwat to do her practice teaching in one of our one-room schools. However, none of our schools in the vicinity of Wikwemikong are suitable for practice teaching. The teacher at Rabbit Island has been absent from teaching for some years and her techniques might not be as satisfactory as you would desire. The Murray Hill school is only now nearing completion and it will probably take the teacher a few weeks to get the children into a satisfactory routine.\n\nIn view of this situation, I concur in Mr. Greening's recommendation concerning the Wikwemikong Indian Day School. I have today written to both Mr. Indian Superintendent Johnston and to Sister Lalement advising them that Miss Pitawankwat will be using this\nJanuary 7, 1949.\n\nHonourable:\n\nThe Director\n\nSchool Inspection Trips\n\nAs you are probably aware, I have only been able to inspect a relatively small number of the schools operated by this Division. This was mainly due to the fact that Mr. Hoey wished me to remain in Ottawa during the time when the Parliamentary Committee was in session. There were many educational problems coming to the fore almost daily, and I was therefore in attendance at most of its sessions.\n\nI am constantly being requested by Church officials, Provincial School Inspectors and our own officials to make further inspection trips to schools which I have never yet had an opportunity to see in operation.\n\nThe attached letter will serve to illustrate what I mean and will also provide an opportunity for discussing with you the general policy of what school inspection trips I should make during the next calendar year.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n29th January, 1949.\n\nMr. W.J. Greening,\n288 Harrington Avenue,\nFort Arthur, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Greening:\n\nI presume that you are wondering why I have not answered to your letter of recent date concerning your trip to Ottawa.\n\nI referred this matter immediately to our Director, and have not yet had a decision from him. However, I will be seeing him on Wednesday next, and will take this matter up with him at that time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPP/T\n\nBernard F. Berry,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nEXTRACT FROM INSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nDated May 13, 1949.\n\nWIKWEMIKONG Indian Day School\n\nThere are seven pupils in the \"Entrance\" class, of these three are not up to standard and ought not to attempt the examinations this year. There is, however, one little lady, RITA ESHKANKOGAN who shows very considerable promise, and who should be watched carefully.

SIR,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant in reference to increases to the salaries of the teachers at Wikweikong, Wikweikongsing, South Bay, West Bay, and Shooshigwaning schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the salary of Miss Prewley was increased to $350.00 from April 1st, 1910, and that of Miss Duhamel at Shooshigwaning to $400.00 from the same date. Evidently you were not aware of these increases had been made.\n\nMiss Frances Solomon is only temporarily engaged as a substitute to the late Miss Peacock at West Bay, but if a competent teacher with proper qualifications is secured the Department will pay a salary of $400.00.\n\nIn view of the satisfactory record of Miss St. James, teacher of the South Bay school, her salary will be increased to $400.00 to take effect from the 1st instant.\n\nA special report on the work of the teachers at the Wikweikong day schools is being called for and when this is received the question of increase will be given due consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nREV.

I don't mind doing since I don't need to things not being needed, and then I'd have to send them and not have to worry about them. So I'm sure you'll want to take the girls to cook, and also to give them some work to do at school every day, as we think at noon, but if they were writing\nother maintenance.\n\nIt is impossible for us to keep on as we are under the present circumstances without a lot of help from anybody. We have some children whose fathers are dead and their lands nothing for their children to live on. If those little ones get to attending school, you will have to pay sixty dollars a year for every one of them, so why not give us something here, so that we can put them to work or at least without your children who all half naked.\n377642\n\nI have answered this in the new letter, winter is approaching and I would like to see these children covered.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Name]\nOttawa, November 3, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have acknowledged the receipt of your letter undated in reference to the supplies for the Wikwemikongising school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say no requisition for school supplies has been received since April last, and if you will forward one it will receive immediate attention. I may say that these supplies have to be ordered through the Government Stationery Office and some delay in your receiving them is unavoidable. For this reason orders should be placed sometime before the articles are absolutely required.\n\nOn July 24th, last, Mr. Sims was authorized to purchase for you a web of flannelette and some other necessary supplies to teach sewing to the children. I would ask you, therefore, to be good enough to communicate with him and the Department will also write him by this mail.\n\nMr. Sims will also be instructed to purchase for you some flour and oatmeal as well as some beans, sugar and tea for a mid-day meal. The object of this mid-day lunch as supplied by the Department is not so much to give a full meal as to supplement the lunches brought by the children and it is hoped that you will find this an incentive to regular attendance.\n\nMiss Emily Frowley,\nTeacher,\nWikwemikongising, Ont.\nThe Department will also authorize Mr. Sims to purchase for you some shoes for the needy children attending your school.\n\nI may say in conclusion that the Department appreciates very much your work at this school and as a further recognition of your services it has been decided to grant you the increase in salary formerly asked, making it $400.00 per annum from the 1st of April, last, and a cheque for the balance due you will be sent in a few days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nI may add that the Department has decided to grant Miss Frawley the increase in salary which she asked for in the spring and she will be paid at the rate of $400.00 per annum from the 1st of April, last.\n\nKindly give these matters your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOTTAWA, NOVEMBER 4, 1910.\n\nSIR,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Miss Frewley, teacher of the Wikwemikonging school, in which she states that she ordered school supplies in August, last. I may say that no requisition appears to have reached the Department and Miss Frewley has been asked to forward one at once. She also says that she has not received the flannelette and other accessories to teach sewing which you were authorized to purchase on July 29th, last. You will be good enough to see that Miss Frewley receives the flannelette, etc., asked for.\n\nYou are also authorized to purchase for her sole flour, oatmeal, beans, bacon and tea with which she may furnish a mid-day meal to the children attending the school. Miss Frewley has been informed that the object is not to supply a full meal but rather to supplement the lunches brought by the children and to give instructions to the girls in preparing the meal.\n\nShe further states that there are four children who are in need of shoes and whose feet are badly injured. You may purchase for these four children a pair of good serviceable shoes each.\n\nI am,\nD. L. D. MINTZ, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWhitewater, Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitouining, Ont.\n10th October 1910\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of date 4th Instant informing me that the Department is in receipt of a letter from Miss Frawley, teacher at Wikwemikensing in which she states that she ordered school supplies in August last, also that she had not yet received the flannelette and other accessories to teach sewing which was authorized in July.\n\nIn reply to this I beg to report that in so far as her first complaint is concerned that this Office has no record of receiving any Requisition from Miss Frawley during the month of August or subsequent although she was furnished with the necessary blanks. In regard to her second complaint that she has not received the flannel-ette &c., I beg to say that this is a deliberate and uncalled for falsehood and I am very much surprised that she should make such a statement. She must have taken leave of her senses. The flannel-ette and all accessories authorized was forwarded to her on the 26th August and she receipted for same and forwarded receipt on the 27th August. I presume her Requisition for school supplies was made in her imagination if she has one, her memory must be failing, but, I would think that she would have at least a part of the flannel-ette to remind her that this had been supplied.\n\nI am writing Miss Frawley, under even date, asking her\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nher what she means by making such deliberate and uncalled for misstatements.\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter in which you state that her salary has been raised to $400 per annum I beg most respectfully to say that I am sure that the salary of this school at $350 was quite adequate considering the qualifications of the teacher. There are other schools in this agency that are more entitled to receive a raise in salary than the Wikwemikong school all things being considered.\n\nYour instructions regarding the furnishing of provisions and shoes will be duly attended to. You do not state...what quantities of flour, oatmeal, bacon &c. should be furnished or how long the supply is to be kept up.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOTTAWA, NOVEMBER 25, 1910.\n\nSIR,\n\nMr. Jones, in his report on the Mikamikoming school, recommends a school garden, and I have to ask you to be good enough to report on this case in accordance with instructions given you in connection with the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant, Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ.

As Kaboui is evidently quite able to properly care for his children and as there is no reason why they should not attend the day school I have to ask you to be good enough to inform him that if the girl is not sent regularly to school after the holidays Section 7 of the Regulations relating to the Education of Indian Children will be put into effect. This is an important matter and I would ask you not to lose sight of it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy Secretary\n\nC. L. D.

The Department must insist upon this girl being sent to school and you will be good enough to so inform the father. If the Department's wishes are not carried out the regulations will have to be enforced. The Department will expect to be informed of the result of your action in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. L. D.

I have the honor to report that this man has already been notified by me according to the instructions contained in your letter of 6th July last. I have not had an opportunity to talk to him personally and do not know if he has received my letter or not. I will take the matter up with the secretary of the reserve and request him to let Kaboni know what your wishes are and also try to find out his reasons for refusing to send the child to school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nIndian Office, Manitouwining, Ont.\n\n4th October 1911\n\nReferring to official letter of date 16th July and previous correspondence regarding the refusal of John Kabein to send his daughter Elizabeth to school.\n\nI have the honor to report that I have interviewed this Indian and he has agreed to send the girl to school when the weather permits her to go. He lives quite a long way from the school and during stormy weather he says she will not be able to attend as she has not been in very good health. His principal objection was to the companion of the teacher a Miss Fisher who he claims was unkind to his daughter while she was attending at Wikwemikongising. He states he has not any fault to find with the teacher but that he objects to Miss Fisher. He could not give any very good reasons as to his opposition to Miss Fisher and I informed him that he must send the girl to school or put up with the consequences; he agreed to this stating that it was his intention to send his girl somewhere else just as soon as he could make the necessary arrangements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nMr. Pedley,\n\nAfter taking the pupils to the Wikwemikong Industrial School I visited, as instructed, the Wikwemikongising and South Bay Day Schools, which are situated on the unceded portion of Manitoulin Island. The reports of the Separate School Inspector on the work at these two schools have always been most commendatory and, after personal visits, I feel that these reports are entirely correct.\n\nI reached Wikwemikongising about 9.30 a.m., and found ten children present, nine of whom were girls. The girls were in the midst of a lesson in domestic science and there was just being removed from the oven in the teacher's residence a tempting looking batch of bread. Miss Frawley and her companion are certainly enthusiastic workers. The school-room and living quarters were clean and tidy. All the children in this school can knit and they are given sewing lessons in addition to the instruction in baking. Seven girls out of the nine are kept from Monday morning till Friday night in the old school building.\nbuilding. The Department now furnishes some supplies for a mid-day meal and the Indian parents are supposed to supply other provisions. Miss Frawley, however, states that they are somewhat remiss in their duty and it often falls upon her to provide from her slender means the funds for buying these provisions, as well as clothes occasionally. They were making some quilts for the beds which were furnished by the Department a few years ago and I would recommend that the Department furnish seven pairs of blankets and sufficient enamel to re-enamel their bedsteads and also linoleum for the dormitory room, which is about 14 feet by 15. It is in this room that they have their sewing lessons and it is very difficult for the teacher to keep the floor clean. The linoleum can be purchased at a reasonable price in Manitowaning. A teacher's chair is also needed.\n\nMiss Leuch, teacher at the South Bay School, is most energetic. So far as the class-room work is concerned the standing at her school may be a little higher than at Miss Frawley's and she also is doing a great deal for the young Indians of the section in which she is working. There were sixteen children present on the afternoon of my visit. There is at present before you\nfor approval a letter authorizing the purchase of some furnishings for the school-room and teacher's quarters, etc., at this school. It is their intention to keep in residence during the winter some of the pupils living at a distance from the school.\n\nI am sorry that these schools are so situated that they are seldom seen by anybody except the Indian Agent and the missionaries who visit the reserves, as either or both of them would be distinctly a credit to any white neighborhood, in respect to buildings, equipment and class-room work. In both these schools there are organs, for the purchase of which the Department was not asked to contribute and, taking everything into consideration, the Department should do what it can to make conditions comfortable for those who are making such a sacrifice for the Indian children. I may here mention that both Miss Frawley and Miss Leuch are the holders of teacher's certificates. At South Bay too there is a companion for the teacher, who assists in the domestic science work and in the care of the resident children. The Department does not allow any salary for these helpers. These are virtually improved day schools of the best type and for similar service in the west we are called upon to pay\nwages to those who prepare the mid-day meals, etc.\n\nI would, therefore, recommend that as a recognition of merit and to aid in the financing of their work, the salaries of these two teachers be increased from $400.00 to $450.00 per annum.\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. F. MacKenzie\nOttawa, November 14, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the teacher of the Wikwemikonging School has been authorized to expend the sum of $5.00 in the purchase of prizes at the end of the present school term for the children attending the school.

Miss Frawley boarded several of the children as they lived too far away to go home in the evenings and back in the morning.

Some of the children of the place have applied to enter the Spanish River Industrial, we will refuse those that can easily attend their school if it is to open. I sent to Mr. Agent McLeod a complete list of all the Schoolage children with their approximate distance to school and their aptitude to go. The average last year was 10, but it was due to six that were boarding at the school. My opinion is that without boarders at the school, the average want be above 5.

Mercier has been engaged as assistant to Miss Duhamel at the Wikwemikong School, this school will require some more seats for to accommodate the number of pupils which will attend after the holidays, I would most respectfully recommend that some of the seats be moved from the Wikwemikong school, as they can be returned when needed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, July 18, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant stating that it has been decided to close the Wikwemikong Day School for a time and that the services of Miss Mary I.

Now, the Indians from the village ask if the department would consent to reopen their school, and promise to send their children regularly. None of them is anxious to see their children going to the new school in Saboni settlement. \"It is too far,\" they say. In fact, the shortest distance for the nearest families would be 3\u00bd miles, and the longest distance 6\u00bd miles. In my opinion, the only way to solve the school's problem in this place, would be to have two schools in operation, on account of distances. Nothing, of course, could be done without the consent of the department; but should the department be willing to reopen again the village's school, it would facilitate immensely the problem of educating the Indian children of Witwenmitong.\n\nRespectfully yours,\nErnest [signature]\n\nThe two schools would be 'pretty close four miles' distance, from each other.\nOttawa, October 22, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant in which you point out that even if a school is opened in the Kiboni settlement it will be too far away from the Indians living in Wikwemikong to allow the children there to attend and recommend that the school at Wikwemikong, where there is a building, should be re-opened at once.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to carry on either of these schools this winter. The Kiboni School building has not yet been started and it is not considered feasible to make a success of a school at Wikwemikong during the winter months owing to the distance that nearly all the pupils would have to go and the difficulty of obtaining a properly qualified teacher at this time of the year. I may say, however, that the educational needs of the children on this portion of the reserve will receive due consideration.\n\nIn the meantime, if any of the parents are as anxious as they appear to be to have their children educated, they might take advantage of the facilities offered at the Spanish River Industrial School, where there is room for more pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. Ernest Comte, C.J.,\nWikwemikong, Ont.\n\nAssistant Secretary.\nOttawa, June 2nd, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Bureau School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Kaboni Indian Day School, states that there are about 17 children of school age at Mikwemikong who are too far away to attend. He recommends that a bus service be arranged for after the summer holidays to take these children to and from their homes, which would be cheaper than re-opening the Mikwemikong school.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will make inquiry regarding the situation mentioned by the Inspector. You should state the number of children of school age at Mikwemikong who do not attend school, and if you could give your views regarding the suggestion made regarding the establishment of such a bus service to carry these children to the Kaboni school. You should also state whether it would be possible to arrange with an Indian agency the necessary team and rig for the purpose, and the cost per month that would be charged for the service. The Inspector is of the opinion that, if a bus service is instituted for a period of, say, 6 months in each year, it would not cost more than approximately $40 per month.\n\nYou will be good enough to give this matter your consideration, and report your opinion to the Department, in order that, if it is decided to arrange for a bus service, the necessary steps can be taken to begin the work on or about the 1st of October next, or the 1st of September, if you think it should start from this earlier date. Such an arrangement, if carried out, might be the easiest solution of providing educational facilities for the children residing at Mikwemikong.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. McFarlane\n\nJ. L.

Moore,\nA/Superintendent of Medical Services,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Doctor Moore:\n\nYou will recall our visit to Manitoulin Island and to the old Jesuit School on the Manitowaning Reserve. I understand there are between fifteen hundred to two thousand Indians on this reservation. One could assume that there would be at least fifty cases of tuberculosis requiring treatment if a complete survey were made.\n\nIt seems unfortunate that this school building is not put to any worthwhile use other than a small part of it providing quarters for the clergy. Do you think the Department would be willing to turn this school into a hospital and sanatorium?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. C. Brink\n( G. C.

It is noted that, owing to the large number of pupils attending, Miss Charlebois, the assistant teacher, finds it impossible to give both classes the required attention.\n\nRather than close the senior classroom, you should, if you can arrange to do so, engage the services of a substitute teacher until the Christmas holidays, by which time it is hoped Miss Fox will be able to resume duties. Miss Charlebois could take charge of the senior room and the substitute teacher the junior room. The question of salary to be allowed a substitute will be determined when we have particulars as to the name, qualifications, etc. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to make the best arrangement for carrying on the work until Miss Fox returns, and you should state, at an early date, the name, qualifications, etc., of the substitute teacher engaged. We note that you are of the opinion that a substitute teacher can be obtained locally.\n\nYou should ascertain from Miss Fox when she expects to be able to resume duties, and if her condition of health will not permit her to return after the Christmas holidays, the services of a qualified teacher could then be engaged.\n\nPlease give the matter of obtaining a substitute teacher your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

And there is another thing that they wish is to have one or two chimneys in the school because we are always afraid the school might catch on fire, because the school was burnt once before. And we were talking about that one day & that what I've said to have it finished real good because its no use fixing it all the time its just wasting money. But so it wouldn't have to be fixed again because there is such a bother fixing it all the time.\n\nChief John Harris\nWikwemikonging\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a request from the Wikwemikonging band for repairs to their School.\n\nIf the Department has funds available for this purpose, I would most respectfully recommend that the request be granted in so far as slab boarding the outside of the school is concerned and the building of a substantial brick or stone chimney on the school.\n\nThis work could be done I presume for the sum of $75.00 and which amount I recommend be granted for the purpose, provided funds are available.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, 19th September, 1899\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant enclosing a communication from the Chief of the Wikwemikong Band, in which he asks that certain necessary repairs be done to their school building; and in reply I beg to say that you may have the school house re-boarded on the outside and a substantial chimney built, the cost of the whole work not to exceed your estimate of $75.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

C. Guthrie has the new school building well under way and expects to have it completed by the 1st Prem.\n\nThe plasterers are now at work and the building has had one coat of paint outside.\n\nI beg to call your attention to the fact that no provision was made for either closets or wood shed for the new school and as it is quite a little distance from the old buildings it will be absolutely necessary that suitable closets and shed be provided. The old closets are not worth moving and in any event one of them will be required where it is for use with the teachers dwelling.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a requisition for school material for the Wikwemikong school among other things requisitioned for is a stove; the stove that I took from the old Buzwah school could be sent over to them and would save buying one.\n\nWill you be good enough to advise me as to what it is to be done in regard to closets and shed in order that I may, if you conclude to build them, get prices from Mr. Guthrie while he is on the ground.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 27, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th inst., and in reply I beg to say that there are being sent you under separate cover plans for a dry-earth closet and a woodshed, and I have to request that you will be good enough to obtain from Mr. Guthrie prices for the erection of two closets, with screened approaches and a shed in accordance with these plans.\n\nThe location of these outbuildings should be carefully chosen, and the Department will leave this matter with you.\n\nThe stove formerly in use at Runnack may be transferred to this school, if it is suitable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

He now offers to do the work for $180.00 providing his offer is accepted at once as he will be through with the school building in this week. He informs me that it is a very expensive place to build at owing to the distance the material has to be conveyed and also the fact that all materials for the construction of the buildings has to be freighted from either Owen Sound or Collingwood to Manitowaning and then teamed to the reserve. This may seem strange to you, but, I can assure you that it is a fact nevertheless. Nearly all the building material for use in the construction of buildings in this place is imported from either of the above places as it is impossible to get good dry material anywhere nearer. If you wish Mr Guthrie to do this work I wish you would wire your decision as soon as you receive this in order that he may make arrangements to complete the work at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 1, 1909,\n\nC.

The Department has had several school-houses erected this summer and all are apparently a credit to the workmen and itself, and it hopes that the Wikremikongeeng school will be no exception.\n\nA suggestion has been made to the Department that quarters ought to be provided in which some of the\n\nC.L.D.

Hinds, amounting to $4.35, for the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont..\nSir,\n\nReferring to Official letter of date last inst confirming telegram of even date accepting the offer of Mr Guthrie for the erection of a wood shed and two closets in connection with the Wikwemikongising Indian school.\n\nI have the honor to report that the contents of your letter have been carefully noted and can assure you that the instructions contained therein will be carried out to the letter. I have made several inspections of the school building and it is about completed and it certainly is a credit to the Department and contractor. The chimney on the teacher's residence requires attention and also the shed. The chimney requires re-pointing and a few new bricks, the shed requires a new covering on the roof as it leaks very badly. A covering of Paroid roofing would be the best thing for this.\n\nIn regard to the suggestion that quarters be provided for some of the children I bet to say that the teacher and her companion at this school have kept from five to eight boarders, children from a distance, the old school building is intended\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nto be used as a dormitory for these as the old school building and the teachers quarters adjoin.\n\nHeretofore they have been very much cramped for room but now it is hoped they will have ample accommodation for the pupils they keep. These pupils have been kept by the Mission and no pay asked for from the Department. It will be necessary that a little furnishing be supplied to equip the sleeping apartment which will not amount to very much. I will find out exactly what is needed the next time I visit Wikwemikong and report as to the cost of same.\n\nThe teacher requires a single iron bed with spring and mattress as they have only one bed now, for the teacher and her companion, this was asked for on requisition referred to by you in your letter of 20th Ult. The cost of a new bedstead, spring and mattress will be about $9.00. The teacher and her companion deserve every consideration possible as they take great interest in the education of the children taking into consideration that they are doing it purely for charity's sake. They should at least be allowed the smaller comforts asked for in the way of sleeping accommodation.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 8th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to learn that the new school at Wikwemikonging is being constructed in so satisfactory a manner.\n\nYou may have the chimney repaired and the shed roof recovered as suggested by you.\n\nWith reference to furnishing sleeping apartments for the children, the requisition will receive consideration when received. In the mean time you may supply the iron bed, springs and mattress needed at a cost not exceeding $2.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. STEWART\n\nAgent, Secretary.\n\nC. L. D.

I have received a quotation from the furniture dealer here of $50. for the eight iron cots with springs and Mattresses which he assures me is a very close price for same.\n\nThe eight pairs of blankets would cost about $3.25 per pair.\n\nIt will also be necessary to supply three extra school seats and two rear seats to furnish the required seating accommodation in the new school.\n\nTrusting the above will receive the favourable consideration of the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be\nSir\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 19th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, stating that eight iron cots with springs and mattresses, and eight pairs of blankets are required to furnish sleeping accommodation for the children who remain during the week at the Wikwemikong School, and in reply I have to say that you may purchase these articles; the total cost not to exceed the sum mentioned by you, $76.00.\n\nI am not able to state whether the three extra desks and two rear seats required for the new school building can be purchased by you and quote the price.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

So we plan to keep this travel or these roads in mind. A season is in danger of reaching their bones. It is true that there is a barrel in the ground and it is also true that we cannot find the two objects.\nright about it and\nthere is the old barrel at\nthe foot of the hill which\nwe have every fire I\nthat comes along. Every\nfire lasts we have to\nempty it out or if\nnot you would need\nto have a pretty bad\ncold in the head when\nyou could stand over\nit for five minutes.\nThis is the order they\nhave been drinking for\nthe past five or six years\nand it felt like a four\nhanded man was\ndoing it human being.\nBe all the kind above\nmentioned. John Wilson\nI've been there and I've had a lovely spring well but when I moved away from there, he closed it up. There's lots of stones into it; just for the cattle might fall in. He didn't mind at all what people would suffer in consequence. Now it won't be much to pull those few logs out of the well so please do move with it. Clear water is fine. I agree we should try to keep it done in the same way so we will look forward to that time.\nWhat about a fence around the school. It looks rather wild to be without one. It would be a good thing if we could keep the animals away from the door, for they are very fondly there. Well we will leave the well and the fence to you. Hoping you will visit us soon. \n\n[Signature]\nRespectfully,\nEmily [signature]\nOttawa, January 20, 1911.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd ultimo in reference to a supply of water at the Wikwemikong school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this matter will be taken up with Mr. Sims, the Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

This provides for a more uniform heating of the rooms and also for a supply of fresh air.\n\nI am enclosing you herewith a copy of the plan and specifications for the installation of a jacketed oil heating stove which will be a guidance to you as to the manner in which the installation should be made. It would be well for you to purchase at once a suitable stove and then submit to the Department an estimate of the cost of having it jacketed along the lines of the one in the drawing. It is presumed that you will use a wood stove.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAss't. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. L. D. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nOctober 6th, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to Official Letter 152019/5, April 21, 1911.\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith an account in favor of Miss Frawley, amounting to $6.25 for prizes for the children for September quarter.\n\nAlso an account for $2.00, for caretaking and scrubbing, the Wikwemikonguing Indian School.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 16, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 6th instant in reference to the installation of a jacketed stove at the Wikwemikongising School I may say that the Department overlooked giving any instructions with regard to the carrying off of the foul air. This can be done by running ordinary stove pipes from the smoke pipe near the chimney to within six inches of the school floor, or, if it is not convenient to put it there, this pipe may be placed at the rear of the stove. It is thought, however, that it might be more effective if placed near the chimney. The object of this pipe is to carry off the foul air which is at the lower portion of the school-room.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nC. L. D. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitouwining, Ont.\nOct. 20th 1911\n\n391665\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of date 6th Inst., regarding the report of Mr. Inspector O'Brien as to the stove at Wikwemikong school and enclosing a blueprint and specifications for a jacketed stove with instructions to purchase one and then submit an estimate of the cost for having same jacketed along the lines of the one in the drawing.\n\nI have the honor to report that the stove at this school is in very fair condition yet and is a very good one of its kind; not very badly broken either.\n\nI note you wish me to purchase a wood stove, do you intend it to be of the upright pattern, like a coal stove? I can arrange to get a stove but I do not think I can get an estimate of the cost of having it jacketed here as there is not anyone available who could do this work and it would be very costly to import a mechanic to do the work at Wikwemikong, more so, in my opinion than the circumstances warrant.\n\nSo far as my experience goes with wood stoves, and have used them all my life, is that upright wood stoves are not a success as heaters, they usually smoke very badly when the wood is being put in and are not nearly as good as an ordinary chimney stove. I will await your further instructions before buying a stove for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 25, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant in reference to the stove for the Wikwemikongeing School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Separate School Inspector in his report stated that the \"stove is an old one, broken and otherwise unsuitable\". It is not advisable to have a broken stove in the school-room on account of the danger from fire and it is thought that you should arrange for the purchase of a new wood stove.\n\nWith regard to the jacketing of the stove I may say that the ordinary box stove can be jacketed just as well as an upright stove. The plan sent you showed an upright coal stove, but this plan was only sent for guidance. As, however, it would appear that there is no mechanic in the neighborhood who can attend to this work the question of jacketing may be allowed to stand over. It would, however, be advisable to arrange to have a piece of zinc placed around the stove for the protection of the pupils who have to sit nearest it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nO.

I have the honor to enclose herewith an account in favor of Messrs Kingsboro & Baxter, Little Current, Ont., for the sum of $15.00 being for one heating stove for the school above mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of date 26th Ult asking me to report on what action has been taken in regard to the purchase of a new stove for the Wikwemikong school.\n\nI have the honor to report that immediately on receipt of your letter of October 24th last in which you authorized me to purchase a stove for this school I ordered one from the local dealer in Manitowaning. He did not have a suitable stove in stock at the time but assured me that he had one ordered, showed me the cut of it in a stove catalogue, and I told him I would take it on its arrival. I inquired for it several times but each time was informed that it was on the way but owing to the heavy freight traffic at that season of the year it would be late in arriving. As the condition of the roads did not warrant me in taking the stove over during the early part of December I did not go to see about it until the 15th Ult when I went to the store to take delivery of the stove and take it over to the school and have it set up, when to my extreme surprise Mr. Stove Dealer informed that his clerk had sold the stove and he had not another suitable engin stock. This is how I was humbugged in not having it in place. The roads since then have been almost impassible and I was unable, until today, to get another stove from outside dealers for the school. I have one here now and will\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nhave it placed in position at the earliest possible moment. I got it from a Little Current dealer and it will fill the bill to the letter.\n\nRegretting the delay in this which I can assure you was quite unavoidable on my part\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning, Ont.,\n15th January 1912\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to official letter under date 24th October last in regard to the jacketing of the stove at Wikwemikongising school.\n\nI have the honor to report that I have just received a communication from Mr. Michael O'Brien, Separate school Inspector, Peterborough, enclosing me a plan for jacketing the stove which appears to be very much more simple than the one sent by the Department. The Inspector states that the system as suggested by him is the best for heating and ventilation for country schools. I am of the opinion that this could be done as suggested by the Inspector by an Indian tinker who does odd jobs of tinkering around Manitowaning if he the work was under supervision while being done. If the Department wishes I will have him undertake the work, but I cannot give an estimate as to what it will cost as he will have to make the jacket and fit it to the stove at Wikwemikongising. The Inspector will no doubt give you details as to the system he suggests.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 24, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. O. L. D. Sims, Indian Agent, Manitowaning, reports that you supplied him with a plan for a jacketed stove, which appears to him to be preferable to the one sent by the Department.\n\nI would ask you to be good enough to let the Department have details and drawings of this plan, if possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMichael O'Brien, Esq.,\nSeparate School Inspector,\nPeterborough, Ont.\nMaterial: salvaged wire - stock size sheets will do, although it would be better to have the other side of the floor covered in the same.\n\nShape: make a plan of a square top, sloping at the top before sloping to add something to its appearance.\n\nConstruction: put together with small bolts rather than nails, so that it may be easily pulled apart when down.\n\nElectric: let jack be set on floor all around cold air register on floor, but an ordinary box stove back there in the corner, in front of jacket, and which will give some heat within a radius of about 15 feet. Jack should be set in the corner, but the opening in the wall behind it should be large enough to allow for a chimney pipe. Jack should be set in the corner of the floor and stove. The opening in the wall behind it should be cut to fit either the stove or the jack. There should also be an opening of about diameter circular at back of stove jacklet for the opening to the cold air off floor in the chimney, and through which the air from the fire will be accessible. This opening should be covered with a cover.\n\nNotes: the jack should be fitted air register from the top, and there must be a point of the jack to the end, which is made of pipe and wood inside and outside, and should be a wooden floor. It can be placed in the house, and kept in the air register, which could be closed at night and opened during the day.\nDear Sir,\n\nThey tell me that the government has approved the purchase of a new schoolhouse and I am pleased to hear of this. I visited the district last fall and found that a new school had been recently built in the area. It was a very satisfactory arrangement for the children but I did not have the opportunity to see it.\n\nI was sorry to learn that something had been done for the Indians, as both Chiefs and Councils were present there last winter. I know that they are still interested in their own affairs and I believe that the new school will be a great benefit to them.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMichael O'Brien\nOttawa, January 31, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 13th instant I beg to say that you may have the stove at the Wikwemikong school jacketed in accordance with the plans and details submitted to you by the Separate School Inspector.\n\nIt is noted that the principle is the same as that involved in the plans sent by the Department, but that submitted by the inspector may be somewhat simpler and as expert workmen are not available the Department considers that it would well do to adopt it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC.

The Rev. Father Papineau, who was informed of the grant, has evidently misunderstood the Department's letter and told the teachers that the grant would be $6.25 for each quarter.\n\nThe amount, $6.25, for the year may be a little small and the Department has decided to increase it to $10.00, or $2.50 per quarter for each of the two schools. You will be good enough to advise the teachers accordingly, so that they will not make purchase for the current quarter over that amount. In the meantime as the other prizes were evidently purchased in good faith you should submit the accounts for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\n\nG. L. D.

Also a supply of school books, slate maps etc., to be used in the Day School.\n\nMiss Dubois, who is to have charge of the Day School, is having a few old broken desks and a table placed in the school room.

As there are a large number of children living in the village of Wikwemikong for whom a school should be provided, the Department intends to continue the day school there, which was formerly held in the industrial school building. The Department has been in communication with Mr. Agent McLeod who states that the Rev. Father Desautels, who is acting for the church, demands a rent of $20.00 a month for the use of the building and that the church authorities insist that an agreement should be made between them and the Department before the Department takes possession of the building. They are either willing to rent or sell. The building needs repairs and refurnishing, as they were allowed to remove the desks to Spanish River.\n\nAfter careful examination of the old records I do not see that the church has any title to the property under which they could claim rent. They have been using a certain\ncertain portion of the land in the village for mission and school purposes, but, as they have given up the school, I consider that the building used for that purpose reverts to the band. Father Desautels claims that the school and dependants are built on land ceded by the Indians for the use of the Missionaries. I think that any concession made years ago to the missionaries was on condition that they should maintain a mission and school. As the school has been abandoned they lose any claim they ever had to the property.\n\nThe school is now closed awaiting settlement. The teacher is under salary and school material and supplies will have to be furnished before it can be opened. I think it well, as I am going to Spanish River and Sault Ste. Marie, to interview Father Desautels and find out on what he bases his claim for compensation for the use of the building. It would not be well for the Department to enter into an agreement recognizing their title to the property, as it has never been surrendered and they have simply been granted use for certain purposes. There is no doubt that the Department has a perfect right to take possession of the building, as it has contributed $8,000.00, as shown by the papers on file, towards\ntowards its erection and it is built on unsurrendered land. I consider that Father Desautels is endeavouring to obtain recognition of their claim to the land, which does not exist. The opening of the school in this building would not interfere with any valid claim the church might have for compensation, but until they can show that they have such claim there is no reason why they should be allowed to virtually close the school.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nINFORMATION TRUST FUND\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nTo Messrs.

Proper building should be built and whitewashed so that these teachers can take care of them. They are in such dirty condition now that no one feels like going near them. Somebody did come but all they did was fix the doors last June.\n\nThe yard needs some attention for in spring and fall it is so muddy that the 100 children must stay in. All that is necessary is to use a plow and make a ditch or two.\n\nJ. K. Bennett,\n\n[Stamp]\nOTTAWA, May 28th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Bennett, Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Wikwemikong Indian Day School, states that the out buildings need urgent attention. He recommends that new closets be built, and white washed, so that the teachers can take care of them. He states that the ones in use at present are in a very dirty condition.\n\nThe Inspector also states that the school yard needs some attention, as in the Spring and Fall it is so muddy that the children must stay in the school. He states that all that is necessary is to use a plough and make a ditch or two, which would be sufficient to drain the yard.\n\nI have to request that you will take immediate steps to have the out buildings cleaned and put in good condition. You should arrange, if possible, with a competent Indian to do this work. I should also be pleased if you will furnish an estimate of the cost of having two closets erected, with screens and fences separating each.\n\nYou should also furnish an estimate of the cost of having the yard put in good condition, and properly drained. It is considered that if the Inspector's suggestion is carried out that this should not cost very much.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Mclean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. J.

Moyer Company, of Toronto, stating that they are confronted with some heavy payments which they have to meet during the year and would request payment of $22.47 for two clocks, and express prepaid, one for Wikwemikong school and one for Busmah school.\n\nThe books of this office show that on the 9th of April last, certified vouchers were forwarded to the Department, amounting to $22.35, for to cover the amount due this company for the two clocks, but since then they have added .12 to the account.\n\nWould the Department kindly look into this matter?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, June 17th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant with reference to the account of the E.

They have not been in use for the past seven years and are now depreciating in value. I consider that these closets could be moved to Wikwemikong and repaired for about $50.00 where it would cost $150.00 to erect two new ones suitable for the Wikwemikong school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, July 22nd, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, in which you recommend that the closets at the Wikwemikongeing Indian Day School be removed to the Wikwemikong Indian Day School, as it would be much cheaper if this were done instead of having new closets erected.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that, as the former school is not likely to be reopened, the Department will approve of having the closets removed and placed on a suitable site near the Wikwemikong Day School. You may, therefore, arrange to have the work of the removal of the closets carried out, and the cost should not exceed approximately the estimate given by you for their removal and any necessary repairs, viz $50.00.\n\nWhen these closets have been removed and put in good condition at the Wikwemikong School, you will be good enough to forward properly receipted vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYou should arrange to have this work done before the school reopens after the present holidays.\n\nAll expenditure for the purpose should be kept down to the lowest possible point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The Inspector also states that more desks are required for both classes.\n\nRegarding the stove, I have to request that you will be good enough to arrange for the purchase and delivery of a suitable stove in the necessary stove place for the junior room. Before making this purchase, competitive prices should be obtained from a number of dealers and the purchase of the stove and pipe made upon the firm quoting you the lowest price. You should give this matter your early attention in order that the stove can be delivered and set up in the school room before the weather gets too cold. When the purchase has been made, you should furnish properly receipted vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred, to which you should attach a memorandum giving the names of the firms asked to quote a price and the prices quoted.\n\nI have also to request that you will furnish a report as to the desks that you consider are required to provide seating accommodation in both class rooms. You should state the name of the manufacturer of the present desks and whether they are single or double desks. In forwarding the number of new desks required you should give the sizes, but, if unable to do so, the ages of the children for which they are required should be given. When this information has been received, the Department will then consider the providing of a further number of desks.\n\nThese matters should receive your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

McLaughlin\namounting to $4.73 for brooms, pails and scrubbing\nbrushes furnished to the Wikwemikong School.\n\nRECOMMENDED FOR PAYMENT\n\nApproved,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report that the lower floor in the North East side of the Wikwemikong School has dropped down and is in very bad condition. On examining closely the floor I found that it is nailed to planks 2x8 inches which are placed on sills around the wall, and all these have decayed and let the floor down. New timber will have to be put in and part of the floor replaced with new lumber. The roof has been leaking and requires fixing also the windows are in bad condition as the old frames are so old and decayed that they will not hold the putty.\n\nWith regard to the above I estimate that it will cost approximately $150.00 to have the repairs made in order that the building may be made comfortable for the winter.\n\nI have started two men to repair the floor as it is necessary that it should be repaired at once in order that no accident may happen to any of the school children.\n\nI might say for the information of the Department that this building is so old, extensive and poorly constructed that it will always be very expensive to keep it in repair.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nSeptember 19th, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to Official Letter No.8-6-5 of July 22nd, last, with regard to removing the closets from the Wikwemikonging School, which is closed, to the Wikwemikong School, I have the honour to report that I find that the closets are so heavy and the roads so rough between the two school that it is impossible to move them on a wagon without doing much damage to them, or it might be the case that they would be spoiled entirely.\n\nAfter the first fall of snow they could be moved quite easily on a sleigh without any injury, but not at the present time.\n\nI would most respectfully recommend that I be given authority to make a few minor repairs to the old closets in order that they may do until these closets can be removed, or be given authority to build new buildings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nSeptember 22nd, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report that there is a heating stove required for the Junior Classroom as the one that has been in use is the property of the Roman Catholic Mission and the Rev. Father Artus, Missionary in Charge at Wikwemikong, is taking the stove away.\n\nMr. G.W. Rinde, dealer in this village, has a suitable stove in stock at the present time which costs $28.00. It takes a 36 inch block of wood and weighs 270 pounds.\n\nIt is the Junior classroom in the Wikwemikong School where the stove is required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, Sept. 27th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, reporting on the condition of the lower floor on the north-east side of the Wikwemikong Indian Day School, and stating the repairs required to place it in a serviceable condition.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that you may make the necessary arrangements to have the repairs absolutely necessary made to the floor. The roof should also be repaired, and repairs should also be made to the windows. Only repairs absolutely necessary in each case should be carried out, and the expenditure for the purpose should be kept down to the lowest possible point, and in any event should not exceed your estimate of approximately $150. In the purchase of any material required you should obtain competitive prices and quotes from the firms quoting the lowest prices. You can arrange with the Indians or other constant persons to perform the labour required in the carrying out of the repairs. When the repairs have been completed you should furnish properly receipted vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the material and in the labour required. These repairs should be completed as soon as possible and the work should be carried on without unduly interfering with the class-room work.\n\nRegarding the moving of the closets from the Wikwemikong school, I beg to say that this work may be held over until there is sufficient snow to have them moved on sleighs. You should arrange to have this work done as soon as conditions permit. In the meantime, you may have a few minor repairs made to the old closets in order that they will be serviceable until the other closets are moved and put in condition.\n\nThe Department will leave the above matters in your hands to arrange and have completed at the lowest possible cost and at the earliest possible date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Ass't Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. J. Leslie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitoulin, Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nSeptember 24th, 1921.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nI have the honour to report that the authorities of the Roman Catholic Mission supplied the Wikwemikong School with water during the summer months from a tank from which the water was forced up by a gasoline engine and pump, and during the winter months there was enough water in the well at the school for the use of the teachers and pupils, but the water pipes between the Wikwemikong Bay and the tanks have burst and the supply of water is cut off from the school, and the well has gone dry so that the only supply of water at the school is what the teachers and pupils carry from the Bay, which is a long distance from the school. The Rev. Father Artus who is superior at the Mission informed me that he does not intend to repair the water system as it has not been satisfactory.\n\nAs it is impossible for the teachers and pupils to get along without water at the school, I would recommend that I be authorised to have a new well drilled and a pump put in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nSeptember 24, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report that the ladder in use at the Wikwemikong School has all decayed and fell down in a heap when the Indians were repairing the windows in the school building.\n\nI would most respectfully recommend that I be authorized to purchase a new one which will cost \u00a315.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 29, 1921.\n\n154-5-24\n\nSir,\n\nI have acknowledged the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, requesting that authority be granted you to purchase a ladder for the use of the Wikwemikong Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the purchase of a ladder for this school. As the price will likely exceed $10.00, it will be necessary to obtain competitive prices before making the purchase. You should, therefore, obtain quotes and have the ladder supplied by the firm quoting the lowest price and properly receipted vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the same date regarding the water supply at the school and recommending that a well be drilled and a pump put in, I have to request that you will be good enough to state the probable depth that will have to be drilled in order to obtain a good supply of water. This can be judged by the depth of the wells in the neighbourhood. You should also state the approximate cost involved in drilling the well and installing the pump. As soon as this information is received, the Department will be in a position to consider the question of having a well drilled for this school. Kindly obtain full information, in order that if it is decided to authorize the work being done, it can be carried out before the winter sets in.\n\nYou will be informed later regarding the desks required to complete the seating accommodation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nL. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning,\nONT.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nSeptember 24th, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to Official Letter No.19-6-5 of\nthe 20th instant, requesting a report as to the\nnumber of desks required for the class-rooms in\nthe Wikwemikong School, I have the honor to\nreport that there should be 34 single desks placed\nin the class-rooms in this school in order to accom-\nmodate all the pupils that the teachers expect to\nattend during the coming winter.\n\nThe majority of the desks in the class-rooms\nare individual Globe Steel Automatic Desks with cherry\nfinish made by the Globe Furniture Company of Waterloo,\nOnt. The sizes should be 13 No.1 and 12 No.3, as the\ndesks in the senior class-room are too small & lime for\nthe pupils and they could be removed to the junior room,\nand replaced with the larger ones. The desks in the\nsenior room at the present time are size 3.\n\nI would prefer if the desks would be set up and\ncrated before shipping from the factory as it is very\ndifficult to secure the services of a man that will put\nthem together properly.\n\nI might say that they should be shipped via\nOwen Sound to Wikwemikong, as there is a boat from\nthat place which calls at Wikwemikong once every\nmonth.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, Sept. 30th, 1921.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nI have to report that you will be able enough to ship, and I am obliged to R.

Leslie Esq., Indian Agent, Wikwemikong, Ont., the following number of Globe Steel Automatic Single Desks, viz:\n\n12 - #2 for pupils 16 to 20 years,\n12 - #3 = 12 to 18\n\nThese desks are required to complete the seating accommodation at the Wikwemikong Indian Day School. The price should be that charged in your latest price list, which should include transportation charges.\n\nThese desks should be shipped in a knocked down condition, all parts complete, via Owen Sound to Wikwemikong, as there is a boat from that place which calls at Wikwemikong once a month.\n\nWhen the desks have been shipped, you should forward your accounts in duplicate, together with Bill of Lading, to Mr. Agent Leslie, whose post office address is Manitouining, Ontario, and he will be instructed, upon arrival of the desks, if in good condition, to certify the accounts and forward them to the Department in order that payment can be made.\n\nI will be pleased if you will arrange for the shipment of these desks by an early boat from Owen Sound and to be informed of the date of shipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. H. Page,\nAccountant and Purchasing Agent.\n\nGlobe Furniture Co.

When the desks arrive, if in good condition, you will be good enough to certify the account and forward to the Department in order that payment can be made.\n\nAs these desks, if shipped in a set up condition, would occupy too much space, thereby greatly increasing the freight charges, it will not be possible to comply with your request to have them shipped set up for use. You should arrange to have them set up in the senior class room, and a re-arrangement made of the desks at present in the school, in order that there will be sufficient accommodation in both class rooms for all the pupil children who will attend.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy Secretary.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Place]\n[Date]\nWaterloo, Ontario,\nOctober 3rd, 1921.\n\nMr. F. H.

LIMITED\n\nGeneral Manager\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nOctober 10th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to the third paragraph of Official Letter No. 19-6-5 of the 29th ultimo in regard to the question of having a well drilled at the Wikemikong School in order to obtain a supply of water for the school, I have the honour to report that I have made an effort to procure the above well but not having this well drilled and a pump installed, but find that there are three drilling machines owned in this village and at the present time all are busy working on other parts of this district, one is working at Gore Bay, one at Little Current and the other is at Providence Bay.\n\nIt might be possible that water could be obtained by digging as in the vicinity of the school there are several running springs. There is a shallow well at the school now which is dry and if it is dug somewhat deeper a sufficient supply of water might be obtained.\n\nI would recommend that I be authorized to deepen the old well at the school as the work can be performed by Indian labour and if water can be obtained by digging the cost will be much less than by drilling.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, October 17th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, regarding a water supply for the Wikwemikong Indian Day School, and recommending that the shallow well, which is now dry, be deepened.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of this being carried out. The work of deepening this well should be performed by Indian labour, and the expenditure for the purpose should be kept down to the lowest possible cost. It is hoped that it will not be necessary to dig to a great depth, and that an ample supply of water will be obtained at a moderate cost.\n\nWhen the well is deepened, it will be necessary to have it boxed in and a pump installed. In the purchase of any material for this purpose it will be necessary to obtain competitive prices before the purchase is made.\n\nThe Department will leave this matter in your hands to make the best arrangements possible for obtaining an adequate supply of water, and it is expected that you will see that no unnecessary expense is incurred. Properly receipted vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst. Deputy A Secretary.\n\nR. J.

J. LEWIS, DATED APRIL 16TH, 1923, ON THE WIKWAEMIKONG DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThe building requires some repairs such as having the floor in the hall at the entrance to the classrooms repaired, and two doors adjusted so they will not close properly.\nOttawa, April 23rd, 1913.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your report dated the 16th instant on the Mikmaktonk Indian Day School, I have received your request regarding the building. I have to say that you may arrange to have the floors in the hall at the entrance to the classrooms repaired and the trim across adjusted in order that they will close properly. No undue expenditure should be incurred in having this work done.\n\nProperly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nThese repairs should receive your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.D. McLEAN\n\nJ. L. Hobson,\nAsst. Agent & Secretary.\n\nR. J. Leveson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMantoulin Island, Ont.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the QIKWEHIKONG School. May 23, 1923.\n\nClassroom interiors are satisfactory. The woodwork of the upstairs room might be painted however.\n\nInterior of the building needs attention of some kind. The building is so large that to paint it would cost much, yet something should be done for appearance sake.\n\nOutside toilets. The old ones should be removed. They are an eyesore and give a bad example to the children. The boys have only two useful ones and these certainly are not sufficient. This matter is important.\n\nUsual supply of wood was not sent to this school during the winter for next winter's use. I hope that this does not mean that this school will have to use green wood next winter.\n\nRe. Flag pole and flag? ? ?\n\nJ. M. Bennet,\nInsp.\n19-6-5.\n\nOttawa, June 2nd, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Wikwemikong Indian Day School, draws attention to the condition of the outside toilets. He states that the old ones should be removed, as they are an eyesore, and give a bad example to the children. He also states that more toilet accommodation is required. Kindly furnish a report regarding this matter, together with your views as to what you would suggest be done to make proper arrangements for the purpose.\n\nThe Inspector makes the following reference in his report to the fuel supplied:\n\n\"Usual supply of wood was not sent to this school during the winter for next winter's use. I hope that this does not mean that this school will have to use green wood next winter.\"\n\nAs you have already been requested in another communication, you will be good enough to see that arrangements are made to obtain the supply of wood required for next winter's use at all the day schools in your Agency.\n\nKindly state whether there is a flag pole at this school, as the Inspector recommends that a flag be supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning,\nOnt.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nJune 15th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nIn regard to Official Letter No. 19-6-5 of the 2nd instant, in connection with the report of the Separate School Inspector in regard to the toilet accommodation, supply of fuel and a flag pole at the Wikwemikong School, I have the honour to report that at the present time there are fourteen closets in use at this school, without the old buildings that the Inspector recommends should be removed, and I always considered that this school was very well supplied with toilet accommodation. I might say that there are only two large closets in use for the accommodation of the boys, as the others are in use by the girls and the school staff, and it may be that it is more toilet accommodation for the boys that the Inspector has reference to.\n\nWith regard to a supply of fuel, I have the honour to report that a portion of the usual supply has been put in the wood shed and the balance will be delivered in the near future.\n\nThere has never been a flag pole at this school since the building was turned into a day school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 23, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, regarding the toilet accommodation at the Wikwemikong Indian Day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is considered that it would be advisable to have the old toilet buildings, referred to by the Inspector, removed and the ground on which they stand filled in and properly levelled. If you consider that this would improve the conditions complained of by the Inspector you may arrange to have the work done. Regarding additional toilet accommodation for the boys, it might be possible to arrange for more space by an addition to the present building. The material in the old building could be utilized for the purpose. We shall be pleased to hear from you, further, as to what you would recommend having done in this matter also the probable cost of providing more accommodation for the boys.\n\nRegarding the erection of a flag pole, it is considered that the Indians should provide a suitable pole and have it erected. The Department will supply the necessary guy wires, rope and pulley. If the Indians will undertake the work, you may purchase the wire, rope and pulley. The Department will furnish a flag when the pole has been put up. If the Indians will not undertake the work of furnishing and putting up the pole, without cost to the Department, the supplying of a flag pole will have to remain in abeyance for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In addition to the present\nbuilding to provide more toilet accommodation for\nthe boys will cost approximately $60.00. The mat-\nerial in the old building is of very little value\nand only a small amount can be utilized for the\npurpose of erecting another building.\n\nWith regard to the question of the Indians\nfurnishing a flag pole for the school, I have the\nhonour to report that they will furnish the pole\nwithout cost to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n124-7-26.\n\nOttawa, July 20th, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th inst., with reference to the provision of more toilet accommodation for the boys' at the Wikwemikong Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange to have an addition erected to the present building. You should purchase and have delivered the material required, and the work should be done by day labour. You should see that the additional accommodation is of a type that will be satisfactory for the purpose. The Department will leave the erection of this addition in your hands, to make the best arrangements possible for the increased requirements. No unnecessary expenditure should be incurred, and properly certified vouchers covering the cost of the material supplied, and for the labour, should be forwarded. This work should be proceeded with and completed before the school re-opens after the present summer holidays. We note that you estimate the cost to be approximately $50, and it should be kept within that figure, if possible.\n\nWe also note that the old toilet building is being removed, and the ground levelled, also that none of the material can be utilised for the purposes of erecting the new addition.\n\nWe further notice that the Indians will furnish a flag pole, without cost to the Department. It is presumed that this is for the pole and the work of putting up the same. If the Indians do not buy, by the wire, rope and pulley, you may purchase the same, as instructed in official letter of June 23rd, last. When the pole has been put up, you should requisition for a flag of the size required\u2014either a 6' or a 9' being the standard size.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. J.

I might say that these blackboards were always too high for the small children, but movable steps in front of them were not used until this year. The teacher in charge of the classroom at the present time does not approve of the steps and it is her request to either lower the blackboards or build a small platform in front of them.\n\nOn account of the blackboards being used to a great extent in teaching the small children more space is required, the dimensions required being plate board 4 feet by 6 feet, and to extend the one in the room at the present time which is plate, 3\u00bd feet by 7 feet.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. R. J. LEWIS,\nINDIAN AGENT, FOR THE MONTH OF OCTOBER, 1924.\n\nOriginal on No. 7 - School File.\n\nThe desks in the back part of the junior classroom are close to the stove and at times some of the pupils complain of the heat from the large stove which heats the room. I consider it would be well to have a casing around the stove in order to make the pupils who have to sit close to the stove more comfortable.\nOttawa, October 30, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your report for the current month on the Wikwemikong Indian Day School, in which you recommend that casing be placed around the stove in order to make the pupils who have to sit close thereto more comfortable, I beg to say it is considered that if this casing were put up it would prevent the heat from radiating throughout the classroom. If, however, you are of the opinion that this casing would not interfere with the spreading of the heat from the stove and that it will protect the pupils sitting near, you may arrange to have a casing of the height and type which you consider will meet the requirements placed around the stove. If this casing is erected, no unnecessary expense should be incurred. Vouchers should be forwarded in the usual manner for any expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

The total cost of the\njob will cost approximately $250, which will\ninclude both material and labour.\n\nWoodchuck servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 12th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, relative to the repairs required to the roof of the Wikwemikong Indian Day School building.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is considered that the most satisfactory arrangement would be to take off the singles at present on the roof and put on 3 ply of heavy roofing paper and have the joints well tarred. This would, no doubt, cost more than the arrangement suggested by you to have heavy roofing paper put on over the shingles, but it is considered it would make a more satisfactory job. You may arrange to have a competent man undertake the work of removing the singles and putting on 3 ply of roofing paper and tarring the joints. You can either give this work to a contractor, he to supply all material and labour, or you can make the purchase of the material and have the work carried out by day labour. In either case, you should obtain the best prices possible to have a satisfactory job completed. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to carry out the work and at the least possible cost.

These people have no clocks, naturally do not come on time. The present bell was never intended as a school bell. It is a yard one only. It will aid discipline and punctuality if you provide a bell large enough to be heard in the village.\n\nSomething must be done regarding the toilets. The girls' toilets are close to school and high off the ground and every girl entering them is seen by the boys and everyone on the playground. They are old.\n\nThe boys need a screen across and should be made individual toilets for the sake of morals. Besides a few wooden or zinc urinals should be made as the seats are continually wet. It is dangerous to health. The seats are also too high.\n\nCan you furnish the senior room with desks? There are 24 single there now and it would aid much in discipline, order and appearance if you provided 12 more single with 4 backs and 4 fronts. As it is it is difficult to get around as aisles are too narrow and doubles are in the road. Besides the single have to be put alongside each other destroying their usefulness.\n\nThe teachers have no place to keep their supplies from mice. The cellar is cool but a concrete room 12' x 15' wo would be necessary to arrange in it. Can it be done?\n\nA buffet (cheap) for dishes and linen would be welcomed. There is no furniture except six ordinary chairs, two beds and Coleman lamp.\n\nJ. M. Bennett, INSP.\nOttawa, September 30, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nThe School Inspector in a report on his recent inspection of the Wikwemikong Indian Day School reports as follows regarding the toilets:\n\n- Something must be done regarding the toilets. The girls' toilets are close to school and high off the ground and every girl entering them is seen by the boys and everyone on the playground. They are vile.\n\n- The boys need a screen across and should be made individual toilets for the sake of morals. Besides a few wooden or zinc urinals should be made as the seats are continually wet. It is dangerous to health. The seats are also too high.\n\nPlease state your views regarding the Inspector's suggestion and also what you would recommend to be done in improving the condition of these toilets. The cost of any work recommended by you should be stated.\n\nThe Inspector further recommends that a cheap buffet be supplied in which to store dishes and linen.

As the shingles had to be removed by the use of crowbars, this retarded the progress of the work was slow.\n\nIt took an Indian five days to clean up all the old shingles and pile them in the woodshed at the school, and then rake and clean around the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nOctober 16th, 1925.\n\nReferring to Official Letter No. 13-C-5A\nof September 20th last, relating to the report\nof the Separate School Inspector on the toilets\nat the Wikwemikong School, I have the honour to\nreport that I was of the opinion that the toilet\naccommodation at this school was pretty fair and\nalmost equal to the closest accommodation in any\nof the neighbouring rural White schools.\n\nThe girls' toilets consist of twelve individual\ntoilets erected at the end of the woodshed on the\neast side of the playground. They are somewhat high\noff the ground and have been in use for a number of\nyears, but with only little repairs and a screen\nerected along in front of them should put them in\na satisfactory condition.\n\nThe boys' consist of three different buildings,\neach having a double toilet. They are all new buildings\nhaving a stone foundation under each and are in first\nclass condition. Before the school re-opened after the\nholidays these buildings were thoroughly cleaned and\nscrubbed and put in a state of good repair. It might\nbe well to have a screen erected in front of these\nbuildings, but I cannot see why individual toilets\nshould be made as they consist of three separate\nbuildings at the present time.\n\nI would recommend that a screen be erected in front\nof both the girls' and boys' toilets, and the seats\nlowered so those that are too high, the cost of the\nsand will be considerable and they cover a lot of space\nand will require considerable lumber to build the screens,\nI would estimate that the cost of the material and labour\nwould be approximately $50.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 21, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant reporting on the condition of the toilets at the Wikwemikong Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say, it is noted that these toilets are in good condition. The Department will approve of the erection of a screen in front of both the boys' and girls' toilets and the seats lowered in those that are too high. This matter will be left in your hands to have screened approaches to the toilets erected in a manner considered by you to be satisfactory and at the lowest possible cost. The seats may also be lowered when required. The building of the screens and the lowering of the seats, including the material and labour should, if possible, not exceed your estimate of approximately $50.00. You should arrange to have this work carried out at an early date and when completed you should forward properly certified vouchers in duplicate covering the cost of the material and labour employed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.

Fox, principal teacher at the Wikwemikong Day School, for labour performed carrying water from Wikwemikong Bay to the School during the month of September, 1925, and also for labour performed washing and cleaning storm windows for the school building.\n\nWith regard to a supply of water for this school, I have to report to the Department that the well has been thoroughly cleaned and pumped dry on several occasions, but the analysis and report from the Dominion Experimental Farm says, \"This water must be condemned as a drinking supply; therefore I thought it better to purchase an iron tank, which will cost approximately $5.00, and have the drinking supply of water drawn from Wikwemikong Bay which is only a very short distance from the school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nNovember 17th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to Official Letter No. 43021/5\nof January the 14th, 1918, authorizing an\nallowance of $4.00 a quarter for prizes to\nthe pupils of the Wikwemikong School, I have\nthe honour to report that the teachers of\nthis school complain that the amount is too\nsmall for the number of pupils attending and\na number have to go without a prize.\n\nAs there are in the neighbourhood of\neighty pupils attending at the present time,\nit would appear that the amount authorized\nis rather small to purchase ample prizes\nto distribute among all the pupils.\n\nI would recommend that the amount be\nraised to $6.00 a quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 21st, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, relative to the grant that was authorized for the obtaining of prizes to be awarded to the pupils of the Wikwemikong Indian Day School each quarter, and requesting that the amount be increased.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in view of the large attendance at this school, the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding $6 each quarter being incurred in the purchase of gifts considered suitable to be awarded as prizes to the pupils. Vouchers, in duplicate, properly certified should be forwarded in the usual manner covering the expenditure.\n\nI have also your letter of the same date enclosing a voucher for the labour performed in carrying water to the school during the month of September and for the washing of the storm windows. This account will be paid.\n\nRegarding the water supply, it is noted that although the well has been thoroughly cleaned and pumped dry on several occasions, the analysis of the water shows that it has been confirmed for drinking purposes and that it will be necessary to have the drinking supply drawn from Wikwemikong Bay and placed in a tank. If you are assured that the water from the Bay will be satisfactory, you may purchase the tank at a cost of approximately $6. Please state whether it will be necessary to pay for the carrying of the water and also if it will be possible to obtain a supply from the Bay during the winter months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

If this work is not yet completed, I have to request that you will arrange to have it done at the earliest opportunity.\n\nWe are informed that the teachers have no place in which to keep their supplies from the mice. Would it be possible to fit up a room in the cellar that could be made mice-proof and of sufficient size to meet the requirements? I have to request that you will furnish a report regarding this matter, stating what you would advise be done in arranging for a suitable place in which to store supplies, at the same time stating the cost of any work you would recommend be undertaken.\n\nAnother matter that should be borne in mind is the providing of window screens early next spring.

B. Jacko, Wikwemikong, Ont.\n\nfor expenses incurred for pupils at Wikwemikong School by Miss Susan A.

As there is a stretch of fifteen closets to be screened quite a lot of material is required and some of the material is hard to procure in this district.\n\nWith regard to the question of fitting up a room for the teachers to keep their supplies, I have to report that on account of the condition of the cellar under this building it would be a costly undertaking to fit up a mouse proof room of sufficient size for storing supplies, and at the present time I cannot make an estimate as part of the basement would have to be removed in order to make a suitable entrance if a store room was built in. At the present time there is a portion of a room on the ground floor partitioned off for the use of storing supplies, which the teachers should be able to keep the mice down if a little effort was made to do so. I believe it better to try and have a room fitted up on the ground floor if the Department decides to have the work done.\n\nWith regard to the roof leaking in one or two places, I have to say that I have been trying to remedy this and had a man on two different occasions to repair the roof but it appears that during the last heavy rain a few drops leaked through. As this is a paper roof it cannot be repaired until the warm weather sets in.

On every occasion I visit the school I find something is required in the way of repairs, especially the windows there are over one hundred in the building and each window contains twenty four small glass. The same are old and will not hold the putty.\n\nThe purchase of one dozen castor cups included in this account was authorized by Official Letter No.19-8-8 of September 2nd, 1925.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning\nJanuary 18th, 1926.\n\nReferring to Official Letter No. 19-6-5 of the\n2nd, ultimo, and previous correspondence in connection\nwith repairs to the toilets at the Wikwemikong School;\nI have the honour to report in connection with the\neffect that I authorized the necessary repairs to be\ncarried out such as having screen erected and the seats\nwhich were too high to be lowered, but before the work\nwas all complete Miss Fox, the principal teacher at the\nschool, protested strongly against the manner in which\nthe repairs were being made, and therefore, the work has\nbeen suspended for the present.\n\nIt appears that she is not in favour of the screens\nin front of the toilets, but she insists on individual\nclosets being erected with two zinc urinals installed for\nthe boys, and the toilets to be erected on the plan re-\ncommended by the Department for public and separate\nschools in the Province of Ontario.\n\nI may say that the toilets in use for the boys at\npresent are three double dry earth toilets with a stone\nfoundation under each one, and are similar to the toilets\nin use at the other schools on the Reserve which were\nerected according to plans laid down by the Department,\nbut they do not meet with the approval of the teacher\nin charge of the school at the present time.\n\nAs the teacher is bent on having the individual\nbuilding erected, or the buildings in use at present\nremodelled into individual buildings, and I understand\nit is her intention to take the matter up direct with\nthe Department, and before proceeding any further with\nthe proposed repairs I thought it better to wait for\nfurther instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 22, 1926.\n\nMadam:\n\nIn September last the Separate School Inspector drew attention to the condition of the toilets at the Wikwemikong Indian Day School, and we requested Mr. Agent Lewis to arrange for the erection of a screen in front of both the boys' and the girls' toilets and to have the seats lowered in those that were too high. The Agent reports that he authorized the necessary repairs to be carried out but that you have protested strongly against the manner in which these repairs are being made, and that, therefore, the work has been suspended for the present.\n\nI have to request that you will furnish a report stating definitely and as clearly as possible what arrangements you would advise being carried out in order to provide suitable toilet accommodation for both the boys and girls. It is considered that the present toilets can be remodeled without a very large expense. We are requesting Mr. Lewis to defer any further work until we hear from you as to what is required. Your early response will oblige.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAgent, Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Susan A. Fox,\nTeacher, Indian Day School,\nWikwemikong, ONT.\nOttawa, January 22, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, relative to the repairs and alterations required to the toilets at Wikwemikong Indian Day School. It is noted that the teacher has taken exception to the manner in which the repairs are being made and that, therefore, you have suspended work for the present.\n\nWe are communicating with Miss Fox and asking her to state definitely what she would recommend being done to place the toilets in a satisfactory condition. In the meantime, it will not be necessary for you to take any further action in carrying out the repairs.\n\nWith reference to the question of fitting up a room for the teachers to keep their supplies as referred to in your letter of the 29th ultimo, I beg to say that no action need be taken at the present time regarding this matter.\n\nWe note that you will attend to any repairs required to the roof as soon as weather conditions permit next Spring.\n\nRelative to the supplying of a new cook stove for the residential portion of the school, I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of a new stove. The stove supplied should be of a type suitable to meet all requirements. Competitive prices should be obtained from a number of dealers and the stove purchased from the one quoting the lowest price. We note that you estimate the cost of the new stove as approximately $68.00.\n\nWe regret that your letter requesting authority to purchase this stove was inadvertently overlooked and I now have to request that you will arrange for the supplying of the stove at an early date as possible. When the stove has been delivered please forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAust. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, ONT.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nJanuary 21st, 1926.\n\nSir:\u2014\n\nReferring to Official Letter No. 13-8-5\nof November 21st, 1925, I have the honour to\nenclose herewith a voucher in favour of Miss\nSusan A. Fox, Teacher at the Wikwemikong School,\namounting to $2.25 for carrying water for the\nuse of the pupils during December quarter 1925.\n\nAs the pupils will not carry the supply of\nwater required for use at the school without be-\ning paid for their work, Miss Fox had to pay\nthem the amount of the account enclosed herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n19-6-5\n\nW. W. King, M.D.\nJan 21st 1926\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI wrote you a letter last week, and I am sorry to have to write you again about more difficulties.\n\nIn regard to the repairing of the boys' toilets here, I must inform you that what has already been done is not satisfactory. The work has been suspended since two weeks past, but I do not really know for what reason.\n\nThere is one point especially that I'd like to draw your attention to regarding these toilets.\n\nIf Mr. Bennett did not mention this in his report, he must have entirely forgotten to do so.\n\nThe three boys' toilets are double compartments and they should be individual ones. Individual toilets are most urgently required and there are plenty big enough to be divided.\n\nMr. Lewis absolutely refuses to sanction\nI am writing toward this work, if the department is not able to do it all, for Mr. Lewis tells me that he can only spend $50.00 on these repairs. I told him I didn't see why so much money would be spent and still not have the work done satisfactorily.\n\nI don't know if you will be surprised to receive a letter like this from me, but I feel I know you by hearing how Charlebois talk about you, and besides I am confident that you will not refuse this request.\n\nI'm not writing this letter to complain about Mr. Lewis, but I can't let things go if he doesn't want to bother about them.\n\nThanking you in anticipation for all favors, and awaiting an early reply, I am\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nSusan J. Faye\n\nMr. Louise Ferrie,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 26th, 1926.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, relative to the alterations and repairs which you require to have made to the toilets at the Wikwemikong Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I beg to enclose herewith copy of a communication to Mr. Agent Lewis in which he has been granted authority to have the changes in the toilets as suggested by you carried out. The Department does not wish to incur any undue expenditure, and I shall be pleased if you will limit the work which you wish to have done to the smallest extent, having in view the carrying out of any alterations and repairs that will provide satisfactory equipment for toilet purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Susan A. Fox,\nTeacher, Indian Day School,\nWikwemikong, Ont.\nOttawa, January 26th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 18th and the Department's reply thereto of the 22nd instant, relative to the repairs and alterations required to the toilets at the Wikwemikong Indian Day School, I now beg to inform you that a communication regarding this matter has been received from Miss Fox, the teacher. She requests that the 3 boys' toilets with double compartments be divided into individual compartments, and states that they are large enough to be so divided.\n\nYou may arrange to have the necessary partitions erected to divide these toilets into individual compartments. You should consult Miss Fox and ascertain from her definitely as to the alterations she requires and also the making of any repairs. Regarding the cost of this work, the Department expects that you will see that it is kept down to the lowest possible point, having in view the carrying out of Miss Fox's ideas in a satisfactory manner. You should see that the work is performed at the earliest date possible and the toilets placed in an satisfactory condition. We are sure that Miss Fox will not ask that any unnecessary expenditure be incurred. We are forwarding a copy of this letter to her.\n\nWhen the work has been completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred. It would be advisable to keep time sheets, in duplicate, for all labour employed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitoulin, Ont.\nJanuary 26th, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 21st instant, I beg to say the Department does not propose to pay Miss Fox for carrying water for use by pupils of the Wikwemikong School. It is considered that the children should be able to get water for themselves. It is being assumed that the water supply is not far from the school. Arrangements could be made whereby the children can take turns in procuring the water required.\n\nThe account which you submitted in Miss Fox's favour is returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.D. McLean)\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR.J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your two letters dated Jan. 25th and 26th and thank you for same.\n\nI had composed a letter in answer to yours of the 22nd but delayed sending it, owing to the letter I had written to Mr. Ferrier before receiving yours.\n\nIn answer to your letter of the 26th I beg to inform you that I will write you at length later when I shall have had a satisfactory interview with Mr. Ferrier.\n\nI have been addressing myself to Mr. Ferrier, for I do not know to who else in the Dept. I should write to regarding these matters.\n\nThanking you for past favors, I am very respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWikwemikong, Oct.\nFeb. 3rd 1924\nINDIAN TRUST FUND\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nTo C.

W. Hinds of Manitowaning, amounting to $75.90, for a Water-Tank, Cook-Stove and Coffee Percolator, furnished for use in the teacher's quarters at the Wikwemikong Indian Day School.\n\nIt was impossible to ask for competitive prices on the Cook-Stove as asked for by the Department, as Mr. Hinds is the only person in this village who handles stoves, so I purchased the same from him at a reasonable price, and would most respectfully recommend that the account be paid.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Official Letters No.'s 19-6-4 and 19-6-5 dated November 21st and December 22nd, 1925, and January 22nd, 1926.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the repairs have been in operation here since last week, and the able carpenter that was hired is giving great satisfaction.\n\nWe are just having the double compartments divided, and suitable platforms put in front of the seats, because to lower the seats, the foundation would have to be cut down etc., and this would have incurred greater expenses; so I suggested to have the platforms built instead.\n\nMr. Agent Lewis had consulted last December to have urinals installed in the boys' toilets, but in his last visit here, he mentioned that he would have new toilets built for the girls in the spring, so I suggested to let the question of urinals go for now, and that when the new toilets were being erected for the girls, the present ones could be moved to the west end of the boys' toilets, because they are only the old urinal stables that were in use for the boys when the boarding school was here.\nThis would prevent any undue expenditure.\n\nUnions in boys' tents are most essential, because it is impossible, no matter how hard we try in other ways, to keep the boys truthful and in a sanitary condition.\n\nNow, and I refrain from disclosing to you, the terrible condition the boys' tents always was in at this school, and when I made this remark to my principal, two years ago, she informed me, that she had referred the matter again and again to the superintendent, but had received no assistance from him in the matter.\n\nLast September, when I came here as principal, that was the first thing I said before him, but it was all in vain.\n\nLosing all confidence in him, I applied to the Board, and when the repairs did begin here the last week of December, I laid all my plans before Mr. Lewis on several occasions, but he did not heed them, except in the urinals.\n\nThe present fires' backs have no seats\u2014All the fires have to sit on is the thickness of an inch board.\n\nIt was when I suggested having seats put in them that Mr. Lewis mentioned the erection of new ones.\n\nI admit there are anything but what they should be for girls; however, I am willing to put up with them.\nto keep down expenses.\n\nWhat I have just described to you in this letter is the deplorable state of the toilet accommodation that has always existed in the Shuswap Indian day school.\n\nI am not writing to complain of Mr. Lewis, but simply to inform you of the state of affairs here. Surely this will be satisfactory to you and thanking you for your kind assistance in the past.\n\nI am\n\nYour respectfully yours,\n\nSusan A. Fay\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nFebruary 15th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to Official Letter No.13-6-5 of\nthe 30th ultimo, in which the Department re-enclosed\naccount in favor of Miss Fox for payment for carrying\nwater for the Wikwemikong School, I have the\nhonor to report to the effect that the water in the\nwell has been condemned for drinking purposes and a\nsupply of water for the school and teacher's residence\ncannot be procured at a closer distance than Wikwem-\nikong Bay which is over a quarter of one mile from\nthe school.\n\nAs the Department has refused to pay for the\ncarrying of a supply of water for the use of the\npupils and the teacher's residence some other\nprovision for a supply of water for this building\nwill have to be made immediately as it is impossible\nfor them to be without a supply of water and the\npupils cannot lug it through the deep snow between\nWikwemikong Bay and the school during the winter\nmonths.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 19th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant relative to the payment for the carrying of water for drinking and domestic purposes for the use of the Wikwemikong Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, after reviewing your reports regarding the condition of the well and the conditions under which water is obtainable from the bay, it has been decided to allow payment for the carrying of the water used during the present winter. You may, therefore, return the voucher which was sent you in letter of the 26th ultimo, and you may forward vouchers from time to time for the amount charged for the carrying of the water.\n\nYou should take up early in the spring the question of the best arrangements to be carried out to provide the water supply required for the use of this school, stating whether you would advise that any further work be undertaken to the present well, either by deepening or otherwise, to make the water fit for use, or whether you would recommend the drilling of a new well on some other location near the school. The approximate cost of any recommendation made by you to secure a water supply next spring should be stated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. J.

As the Department is anxious to have satisfactory toilet accommodation provided for the use of girls in the school during the present summer, I have to request that you will furnish a report as soon as possible, stating what work you would advise be undertaken.

Fox for carrying water for use at Wikamikong School and teacher's residence during June quarter 1926.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. ... dated February 19th, 1926.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nJuly 21st, 1936.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nIn reply to Official Letter No. 19-8-5 of\nthe 28th of June, last, relating to the question\nof providing satisfactory toilet accommodation\nfor the girls at Wikwemikong School, and also\nthe question of a water supply for the school\nand teacher's residence, I have the honour to\nreport to the effect that as the toilets in use\nby the girls are not satisfactory to the teachers\nnew buildings will have to be erected as it will\ncost more to remove the old buildings than to\nerect new ones. The old buildings have been in\nuse for a great number of years and the material\nof which they are constructed is of very little\nvalue. In order to erect a suitable building\nwith five different compartments the cost of the\nsame will be approximately $250. If there is to\nbe a change in the toilet accommodation for the\ngirls I would recommend a new building be erected.\n\nThe only means of procuring a water supply for\nthis school is to have a well installed and if this\nmeans is carried out it will have to be drilled quite\ndeep in order to get below the surface water. At the\npresent time there is a well at the school equipped\nwith a new pump, but the water is not fit for drink-\ning purposes. Judging from the location where the school\nis situated the prospects of obtaining a supply of\ngood water is not very bright but it can be given a\ntest and if it may prove a success, to have a drilling\noutfit moved to Wikwemikong and have this work carried\nout I estimate it will cost at least $300.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 26th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant relative to the providing of toilet accommodation for the girls at the Indian Industrial School, and give an estimate of the cost of erecting a new building with 5 different compartments.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that it would cost more to remodel the present closets than to erect a new one. It is considered, however, that if a building having 3 compartments were erected it would provide ample accommodation, and I have to request that you will ask for prices for the erection of a building for toilet purposes having 3 compartments only. Any material in the old building which would be of use might be used in the construction of the new toilets for the girls. Kindly reply giving the information asked for as to the cost involved as soon as possible.\n\nRelative to the deepening of the present well, I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to incur the expenditure required in having a drilling outfit drill the present well to a greater depth, so it is very doubtful if a good supply of water could be obtained. The present arrangement for the providing of water for the use of the school will have to be continued.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMinto, Ont.\n194-5-31. Indian Office, Manitowaning,\nJuly 30th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of Official Letter No.19-6-5\nof the 28th instant, with further reference to the\ncost of erecting suitable toilet accommodation for\nthe girls at the Mikmaklong School, and in reply\nI have the honour to report that in order to erect\na suitable building with three compartments the\ncost will be approximately $175. Building material\nin this district is very high and the material in\nthe old building is of little value as the building\nhas been in use for over thirty years.\n\nThis building will be erected by day labour,\nand the work carried out as cheaply as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 5th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, giving an estimate of the cost of erecting a suitable toilet with three compartments for the girls at the Wikwemikong Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange to have this toilet erected by day labour under the charge of a competent foreman. You should arrange for the purchase, after obtaining competitive prices if possible, of all material required. Proper time sheets should be kept for the labour employed, and certified vouchers should be forwarded covering the cost of the material. Any material of value in the old building should be utilized as far as possible in the erection of the new toilet. This work should be carried out as cheaply as possible, and it is hoped that it will cost less than your estimate of approximately $175.00.\n\nPlease arrange to have this work started at an early date, as it is hoped to have it ready when the school reopens after the present summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.
