The only thing he may (and does) expect is that his unpretentious little work may be found useful, not only to the more learned writer of the twentieth century, but to those hundreds of tourists and travelers who daily seek in vain for some records of the foundation and growth of the capital of the Canadian Northwest.\n\nWhen A.D. 1987 is writ on the tablets of Time, when the pioneers of '82\n\n\"Sleep the sleep that knows no waking,\"\n\nand when no tongue remains to speak with authority on \"the founding of the city,\" *The History of Regina*, published one hundred years before, may appear useful and interesting to the citizens of a rich and prosperous capital.\n\nThe writer has spared no pains in the collection of facts herein given; and where any doubt remained, steps were taken to obtain the proper information from the best sources available.\n\nJustice has been conscientiously meted to all, and we have, to use the words of Longfellow, \"in all things kept ourselves loyal to truth.\"\n\nIn the compilation of such matter, of course, some errors will creep in, in spite of every precaution, but in this instance it is hoped few corrections need be made, for a second edition in course of preparation.\n\nThe writer expresses his deepest thanks to the public, who not only subscribed for the first edition of *The History of Regina* in an incredibly short space of time, but who were ever ready to assist in making the little work a successful production.\n\nJ.

In the buffalo hunting days hunters usually camped at this crossing of the stream, killing and preparing for Winter the bison captured in the Fall hunt. The rich and vast prairie for miles round the \"pile\" was a favorite haunt of the buffalo, and where could a hunter's camp and pemmican factory be more conveniently established than contiguous to the bute aforesaid? That great essential, water, was at hand; poles were to be had for drying scaffolds; the adjacent grounds were level as billiard tables for the stretching and drying of the skins, and above all, the spot lay in the centre of a region abounding in choice game. Every season contributed its quota of bones to the \"pile,\" and the red man's nomenclature, which is of a piece with his entire surroundings, readily furnished a name to the meandering creek which drained that section of country. Oskana in the Cree language means bones, and from this word is derived the more mellifluous and dignified Wascana. And the tortuous stream, which has its marshy source fifteen miles South-West of the Hurricane Hills, and meanders Northwestwards along a dozen townships until it reaches the Qu'Appelle River some twenty miles from Regina, is now known to the map-makers and world in general, as the Wascana, or Pile of Bones Creek.\n\nIn the neighborhood of a quarter of a century ago this pile of buffalo bones stood six feet high, cylinder-shaped, and boasted a diameter of forty feet at its base. In justice to the pile-builders, it will be admitted that the bleached\nmaterials were laid with artistic skill and taste, shin and other bones radiating from a centre with that grace characteristic of the rude children of Nature.\n\nOpposite the \"pile,\" and on the east side, was situated the \"pond\" or \"pound\" into which were driven the decoyed bison. The bute itself served as a signal station for the sentry, whose duty it was to give notice of the approach of buffalo from the east. We all know Pilot Bute. The Crees called this hill Ota-sa-wa-pa-win, or \"Indian Outlook,\" and an admirable signal-station it made, standing as it did in a splendid tract of country, from which the roving herds could be observed for miles in all directions.\n\nOld Indian folks had their superstitious failings like other people, and one of these appears to have been, that live buffalo were very loath to abandon a locality which contained the bones of their slain comrades. This belief raised the \"pile.\" Until very recently ample proofs existed of the immense numbers of buffalo that roamed this part of the country. Whitened bones and skeletons paved the prairie, clearly demonstrating that the choice herbage of our lands was dearly loved by the lordly bison. But the bones have recently become an article of commerce, being used in the east as fertilizers. Our half-breeds, as well as those unbelieving Indians who do not expect a sudden re-appearance of the bison while white men rule the Northwest, have been sufficiently unsentimental to collect these bones and carry them to the railroad where they command a ready sale at a few dollars a ton. Fifteen hundred dollars' worth of the bleached left Regina alone during 1886.\n\nThe great pile itself has long since ceased to exist in pil-lared form, having ingloriously gone the way of all buffalo bones. The bute alone remains keeping silent and unromantic vigil over the once celebrated camping ground of the red-skinned hunters, whose race, like the almost extinct bison, will ere long be known in the world's story as creatures that were.\nCHAPTER II.\n\nThe Great Northwest\u2014Bread and Work for All\u2014Lord Lorne's Poetry\u2014The Winnipeg Boom\u2014Early Settlers\u2014Regina Town-site in '82\u2014Later Arrivals\u2014Grangers and Navvies\u2014Looked on the Prairies.\n\nFive years ago glorious visions of Manitoba and the Great Northwest filled the minds of Eastern Canadians and Britishers desirous of improving their condition in strange lands. An El Dorado had been discovered towards the setting sun. A land flowing with milk and honey had been closed for centuries through the selfish misrepresentations of fur-trading monopolists. A virgin soil, inexhaustible in genial fertility has covered thousands of miles of glorious country, blushing unseen in the sweetness of the prairie air. What a land for the sturdy pioneer in which to carve a future, fame, and fortune! No labors of a lifetime to perform before the husbandman could honestly say, At last my work is done! No depth of Canadian wild to chop as had our forefathers, before waving fields of yellow corn smiled round the log dwelling.\n\nThe settler of the wooded country spent at least nine thousand of the best days of his life in clearing a small farm of one hundred acres, while the prairie farmer had only to tickle our lands with a hoe the first year, sow his crops, and expect to reap profits the second season.\n\nLord Lorne had been on a tour through Northwestern Canada in 1881, and seemingly became enchanted with all he saw. His ready and glowing imagination painted the beauty and resources of the great prairie region in colors of gold, which sent an electric thrill of sanguine adventure from Winnipeg to Old Westminster. Then began the exodus from older climes. The agriculturist sought measureless fields for pasture and tillage, the merchant a mart for more profitable traffic, the manufacturer an extension of the home market for the disposal of his wares, and the capitalist a field almost interminable in extent for the profitable investment of his funds. Limited means were not heavily\nhandicapped as in lands still groaning under the last kicks of an expiring feudalism, and there was a bright field for industry and intelligence. Every species of mental ingenuity and manual labour might be developed and brought into action with advantage to the individual and the whole family of man. There was a plentiful supply of timber; coal and other minerals were abundant; powerful land companies aided a liberal government in the early settlement of lands, and a great transcontinental railway was being constructed from ocean to ocean, which should open up the rich and opulent marts of the east to the great Canadian Northwest.\n\nExtraordinary stories of the Winnipeg boom penetrated to the uttermost ends of the earth, and in an almost incredible space of time everybody boasting a spark of ambition, a stout heart, and a little worldly wealth, prepared to visit \"the sunlit and breezy ocean of meadow-land\" which reposed in silent grandeur from the illimitable forests of Keewaydin to the mountain peaks of British Columbia.\n\nMr. Edward Carss claims to be the pioneer settler of the Regina District. Having sought and found a splendid ranch country, he settled on Carssdale, at the junction of the Wascana and Qu'Appelle Rivers, in September, 1881.\n\nIn May, 1882, an advanced party of eminently desirable settlers arrived at the Pile O' Bones Creek near the location of the present reservoir. It consisted of T. S. Gore, D.L.S., now of the Winnipeg Dominion Lands Office; H. G. Forsyth, who died here in April, '86; Geo. S. Patton, at present a Montreal stock-broker; Geo. B. Moffatt, Inspector N.W.M. Police; Messrs. T. C. Kerr and Geo. R. Binger, still farming on the town-site corner, and Henry Le Jeune and T. N. Christie, Managers of Lafferty and Smith's banks at Regina and Moosomin.\n\nOn the arrival of this party the country looked first-class, notwithstanding the prevalence of numerous sloughs and ponds. As in every piece of land then in the Territories\ncontaining a square foot of water, ducks plentifully abounded, the party shooting a great number.\n\nThere is one matter here connected with Regina's first season of '82, that deserves, perhaps, more than a passing notice.\n\nAll our early settlers agree that the adequate moisture of our soil, the abundance of water in the sloughs, and the luxuriant grasses and herbage which everywhere met the eye in 1882 could only have been produced by a succession of moist seasons. The Wascana, south of the town was then a creek expansion of fair volume. It exceeded a stone's throw in width, according to Mr. Le Jeune, and Mr. D. S. McCannel tells us he found he could not ford the stream on one occasion without walking a few miles farther up.\n\nOn the 10th of June, D. S. McCannel arrived with his brothers John and Neil, Archie McCannel, Hector McGilvray and Donald McDougall, and camped on the Wascana, close to the present gaol site. The party at once secured the services of Surveyor Gore in locating several half-sections. On these were built sod shanties, and possession was taken in squatter fashion. After sowing a few bushels of potatoes, this party left for Winnipeg, returning to Regina on the 18th of August following.\n\nThese were the happy days when lynx-eyed conductors were little feared, and when train fare merely amounted to a bagatelle. Every west-bound wight, speculator, land-hunter, navvy, or bum, boarded the cars \"to work at the end of the track.\" He coolly got off where he pleased or remained on the road to shoulder ties or drive spikes. The C.P.R. did not bother themselves much with the passenger traffic. The Company were opening a channel for a stream of westward immigration, and if Jones and Robinson did not lay hold of a hammer or shovel at the end of the line it was a consolation to find these worthies locked on the prairies anyway. They might become good members of society one day or another.\nAmongst other early settlers we notice the names of Geo. Arkle, John Shera, D. Woodward and Woodworth, John McIntyre, Matthew and Thomas Evoy, Childs Bros., T. S. Stubbing, W. Montgomery, Wm. Davis and several others.\n\nCHAPTER III.\nLocating the Town-site\u2014Somebody Blundered\u2014The Two Surveyors\u2014First Arrivals\u2014Merchants and Artisans\u2014High Prices and Lively Times.\n\nThe town-site of Regina was selected by the joint judgment of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the Government. \"The Company had laid out a plan,\" says Sir John A. Macdonald, \"for building a railroad northward from Regina to Prince Albert and southward to the Turtle Hills to the southwestern branch; they published a map with that purpose indicated, and we agreed that that would be the proper place to have a town.\" Just so. The C.P.R. published a map and laid it before the Government. Sir John Macdonald, to his honor be it recorded, has ever been the warm friend of Northwest interests, and with our capital before his eyes a great railroad centre, there appeared to be no harm in leaving the exact location of Regina in the hands of the C.P.R. The Syndicate could not move it from the Pile O' Bones Creek anyway. A small digression may here be necessary, in justice, perhaps, to \"the Company.\"\n\nThese were days when most exaggerated and absurd ideas were being held and promulgated on the values of Northwest lands. Every settler spoke as if his particular claim was the only good one in the country, and he imagined if he had only got \"the patent\" in his pocket he could sell his three hundred and twenty acres for at least four thousand dollars. The immensity of the fertile lands of the Northwest had little or no existence in the settlers' ideas; even our great political economists were mixed up on the subject, and the hard-and-fast law governing demand and supply had been lost sight of in the babel of airy castle-building which the excited Children of Speculation had en-\ngaged in throughout the country. The possession of broad acres of prairie meant wealth untold, and the man was a fool who had not \"taken up land.\"\n\nThe C.P.R. had an eye to the pitch and toss as well as other people, and small blame to them. They had entered upon a gigantic undertaking for the successful carrying out of which they required millions of dollars, and these they would have by hook or by crook. It may be presumed that without the Government subsidies the scheme should collapse, and it is because the Canadian tax-payer cheerfully helped the C.P.R. along, that we would expect the Company to look to other things in the laying out of a town site besides a selfish grasping of the mighty dollar.\n\nC.P.R. officials were well aware that a railway station located the town, and notwithstanding the specious plea that a railroad depot requires to be built on level grounds for switching and siding facilities, the Company cannot show they acted, in fixing the Regina town-site, as they ought to have, towards an honorable government and a liberal public. Three quarters of a mile nearer the Wascana, the lands are level as a cricket field, and would have made first-class station grounds. But perhaps the section had been wrongly numbered.\n\nThe first C.P.R. survey curved a few miles north of here, crossing the Wascana near Mr. Cowdry's premises. This was subsequently abandoned for the present line, and, of course, soon as the exact railroad crossing became known to the public, the settlers and business men naturally put up their tents in the immediate vicinity of the present railway bridge spanning the creek. Few then supposed the railway station would be built two miles from the Wascana on a C.P.R. section.\n\nThe erection of the present railroad offices surprised everybody, but our business men considered the best thing to do was to pull up stakes, move eastwards, and bow to the inevitable.\n\nA few days saw the triangular piece of land fronting the\nstation grounds, and commonly known as \"the gore,\" dotted with tents and alive with industry. Our early pioneers set to work in good earnest, their uppermost thought being, what Cowper would call \"a business with an income at its heels.\"\n\nAmongst the first arrivals were Sprague & Scarlett, J. J. Campbell, and F. Hoskins & Co., (now Tinning & Hoskins) general stores; Owen Carson and Ives & Co., groceries; Curry Bros., (now of Swift Current,) and Lytle & McLeod, general stores; Smith & Ferguson, hardware; W. B. Lindsay, flour and grain, etc.\n\nMowat Bros. were the first to open business on the new town-site, and the Smith Bros. to finish the first residence.\n\nJ. A. McCaul, Pope and Lafferty, and T. E. Martin went into the lumber business; C. J. McCusker, D. A. McDonald and R. Gordon carried on blacksmithing. E. B. Read was our first tin-smith, Geo. Rice, the first plasterer, and A. R. Roberts, the first watchmaker. McNicol Bros. put up the first frame building (now the Lansdowne Hotel) used as a store on South Railway St.; James Crack managed the butchering business for the Mowat Bros.; T. Waldron opened a harness shop, and John Cottingham became the first saddler. The pioneer barber was Geo. Webb, John Densmore stuck to his last, and Parrish gave to the Reginaans their supply of daily bread.\n\nJohn Roadley launched his scow on the turbid waters of the Wascana; Kean built the first livery stable in town, and Mr. M. P. Zindord opened his billiard hall close to the old Dominion Hotel. Our old timers will remember the striped tent of Gowanlock and Broley, used as a restaurant, in which the first gospel service was held. Poor Gowanlock, it may be noticed, afterwards went north and engaged in the milling business. He fell, with Farm Instructor Delaney and the Roman Catholic priests, in the unfortunate Frog Lake massacre. Our station agent, Mr. Fowler, has been with us from the beginning, and is the oldest agent at any one station of the C.P.R. Western division at the present\ntime. In addition to the business men and general settlers, there was a large population of a speculative class, and business in general, boomed.\n\nIt may be interesting to note early prices. Wood fetched twelve dollars a load; creek water sold at fifty cents a barrel; bakers had no need to give sixteen loaves for a dollar as at present; bread sold for twenty-five cents a loaf. Teamsters got ten dollars a day, or a dollar and a half an hour; carpenters got five dollars a day, and tinsmiths made little fortunes.\n\nThe Northwest capital showed early promises of future greatness (weather permitting) and the Winnipeg press believed the time had come to open fire on the poor Pile O' Bones. Our citizens' dignity was now and again a little hurt, but money circulated freely and everybody rode the horse of high hopes and great expectations. The jingling of the guineas blunt the uncharitable shafts levelled at \"the tadpoles and beetles\" of the Wascana waters.\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nChristening the City\u2014List of Distinguished Visitors\u2014Speeches of the Hon. Judge Johnson and Lieutenant-Governor Dewdney\u2014Great Enthusiasm.\n\nAt nine o'clock on the morning of the 23rd of August, 1882, the Canadian Pacific Railway reached the banks of the Wascana, and it was only fitting that \"on such an suspicious occasion,\" the Northwest Capital should be christened with due ceremony. A large party assembled in Mr. Van Horne's special car, and named the new city with much enthusiasm.\n\nAmongst those present were Lieut-Governor, and Mrs. Dewdney; the Hon. Judge Johnson; Mr. D. McIntyre, Vice-President of the Railway; the Hon. (now Sir Donald) A. Smith, and Miss Smith; General Manager Van Horne; the Hon. J. J. C. Abbot; J. H. McTavish, Land Commissioner; Messrs. Graham and McDonald, H. B. Co'y.; Rufus Stephenson; Mr. Clouston, Bank of Montreal; Messrs. Cassells,\nWilliam Stephens, Henry Nathan; the Rev. S. A. Venables, of Nice; Messrs. John Ross, and C. E. L. Porteous of Lindsay; John McIntyre, James Wright, H. B. Co'y.; Mr. Armit, Sec. H. B. Co'y., and Mrs. Armit, John Burns, Chairman, Credit Valley Board of Directors.\n\nJudge Johnson proposed \"Success to the City of Regina.\" He said that many years ago he had held an office in that magnificent country, resembling in some degree that which Governor Dewdney now held. Since then his interest in its future never flagged, and it gave him great pleasure to ask those present to drink \"Success to Regina, the Queen City of the Plains.\" He had walked over its site in a lovely rolling prairie, intersected by the valley of a winding river whose name would soon be forgotten under the august title which the good taste of his Excellency Lord Lorne had selected for it; and, although among the numerous opinions he had that day heard, no two agreed as to the precise nature of the soil. He asked everyone present to join him in wishing success to Regina, and coupled with it the name of Lieut.-Governor and Mrs. Dewdney.\n\nThe toast was drunk with hearty cheers.\n\nGovernor Dewdney said that he had much gratification in finding that the selection of the site of the capital of the great Northwest had met with the approval of those so qualified to judge of it as those present on that occasion. He had given the subject much attention himself, and had been in some degree instrumental in making the choice, and thought it had been a very satisfactory one. He trusted that before long they were to see material proof of its prosperity, and he hoped that in other years those present would re-visit Regina, when he and Mrs. Dewdney would be able to offer them the hospitality of their own roof, and when he did, no doubt they would see in the development of the flourishing city an endorsement by the public of the selection made for the site of what Judge Johnson had called the Queen City of the Plains.\nOn behalf of himself and Mrs. Dewdney, he thanked them most cordially for the kind manner in which their names had been received.\n\nAn event otherwise bearing no greater significance than that attached to the death and burial of a toiling stranger claims a place in these chronicles. At the time the O.P.R. was being rushed through here, a Swedish navvy died and was hurriedly buried in a spot about thirty yards south of Mr. McCusker's workshop. The bustle and activity displayed in the rapid construction of the road made the death of a fellow-man a matter of little moment, and it is no wonder the last resting-place of the poor Swede bears sorry contrast with the tomb of a Capulet.\n\n\"Stand not upon the order of your going. But go at once\"\n\nsaid the Syndicate, and on went the iron road, unmindful of everything but the speedy spanning of a continent. The Koran says Hast\u00e9 is of the Devil, and with this magnate as boss, there was little time to spend in scooping out graves for navvies.\n\nPerhaps at some future day the bones of Karl Hansen may turn up from the digger's spade, and it is to throw light on the subject beforehand allusion is made to the occurrence here.\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nEarly \"Hotels\"\u2014Bacon, Beef, Bunks and Beer\u2014Prodigals, Reformed and Unreformed\u2014The Grand Union\u2014Royal\u2014Queen's\u2014Dominion\u2014Commercial\u2014Criterion\u2014Distinguished Visitors\u2014A Joke taken in Earnest\u2014Mr. Davin resolves to become a Northwest Journalist.\n\nCarpenters and tinsmiths did not come in for the lions' share of circulating capital in those pioneer days. The hotel keeper was around and pegged his tent wherever a good opening occurred for the disposal of bacon, beef, bunks and beer. Few arrivals came penniless, and many brought the portion of that scriptural son who gathered his goods to-\ngether and took a walk into a far country. Some wasted their dollars in riotous living like the jolly prodigal, while not a small number of those who had already gone through the unfortunate mill of prodigalism\u2014had eaten husks of the upas-tree with their fellow-swine and come to themselves\u2014were now clothed in robes of the best, with massive rings on their hands and gold watches in their fobs.\n\nOne way and another a large amount of ready cash changed hands in Regina in '82, much of which got into hotels, bar-rooms and billiard halls.\n\nThe GRAND UNION was kept by W. P. McCormick, and was noted as being the best, cleanest and tidiest hotel on The Gore. The present Palmer House was built by McQuarrie in the Fall of '82, and afterwards sold to Palmer & Stanton. The latter put up the Palmer House front as it now stands. The back portion of the hotel is the old Criterion.\n\nThe ROYAL stood on Broad Street, nearly opposite the present Palmer House, and belonged to Moulton & Howson. It was moved to its present position in the Spring of '83 and named the WINDSOR HOUSE.\n\nThe QUEEN'S was kept by Thomas & Dempsey on The Gore opposite Lamont's present book store. This hotel was afterwards removed to Broad Street. It is the Pacific of to-day. Since the days of Thomas it has been held or rented by Stephen McKinnon, Ed. White, Jack Nugent, Al Morton and John O'Flynn.\n\nThe DOMINION belonged to Kennelly & Runciman. It was situated on The Gore opposite the store of Sprague & Scarlett.\n\nShupe & Prest ran the COMMERCIAL. It was a frame building on Osler Street, and is now the warehouse of R. B. Fergusson.\n\nThe CRITERION, a part tent and part timber structure, stood at the north end of Broad Street, facing the Railway Station. It was the property of \"Major Granville,\" of Brandon, and was managed by Charlie Munson, who modestly claimed to be a nephew of the Duke of Rutland.\nIt was here, in the Fall of '82, that Mr. Davin, M.P., in company with Mr. Scarth, M.P., and the Lieut.-Governor of Ontario, met the leading Reginans at dinner. While satisfying the inner man, jokes innumerable kept the tables in a roar. Somebody proposed that the distinguished litterateur and savant, Mr. Davin, start a newspaper in the city. What would be an appropriate name for this exponent of Northwest ideas? One said the Regina Shagginappy, another suggested that it be called the Blizzard, a third wag ventured to propose Scalper, a fourth the Buffalo, and so on. Mr. Davin entirely relished the whole thing in common with the entire party, but the joke set him very soon a-thinking.\n\nIt is related, when the fun was over the future member for Western Assiniboia was observed, cane in hand, taking a solitary ramble over the adjoining prairie, absorbed in profoundest thought. During this walk, so full of importance to the embryo capital, Mr. Davin became fascinated with the Northwest, its refreshing breezes, laden with life-giving ozone, and its immensity of fertile bosom peopled with a hale and hopeful peasantry.\n\nHorace, in one of his satires, tells us how\n\nJoking decides great things\nStronglier and better oft than earnest can.\n\n'Twas so in this instance. Mr. Davin was inclined to seriously consider the proposition of establishing a paper in the Northwest capital; and the principal citizens promising him a liberal support, he left for the East, shortly to return and throw in his lot with the early pioneers of the new country.\n\nCHAPTER VI\nThe Winter of '82-3\u2014Awaiting the Spring\u2014The Leader's Encouragement\u2014Meetings and Lectures\u2014Fire Protection Considered\u2014Town Commissioners Appointed\u2014Their Names\u2014Resignation of Commissioners\u2014The Citizens' Committee\u2014Clubs and Social Gatherings\u2014Early Appearance of Terpaichoire.\n\nThe winter of '82-3 passed off pleasantly, all drawbacks considered. The town was yet an odd-looking jumble, the\nstreets were neither laid out nor graded, a sort of diluvian confusion characterizing everything in general. But 'neath that huge curtain of whitish patchwork which hid \"The Gore\" reposed the backbone of a civic commonwealth worthy of the future Northwest capital. Materials were at hand for the building of the city; the surveyor and architect had not been idle, and cheerful industry merely awaited the ethereal breath of Springtide to lay the solid foundations of a handsome prairie town.\n\nTo several tenderfeet, a Northwest winter appears pretty severe,\n\n\"The icy fang\nAnd churlish chiding of the Winter's wind\"\n\ngiving refreshing assurance that Dame Nature would have a healthful and hardy race of children or none at all.\n\nThe Leader, ever ready with encouraging words to sustain the drooping spirit, assured all good Reginans that \"The cold Winter is not a thing to fear but to enjoy. On such a day biliousness is a thing disproved and dyspepsia dies like a thing unclean. Talk of the palms and temples of the South, orange groves, viney hills\u2014their joys are effeminate compared with the vigorous rapture of traveling across the prairie of a bright day with the snowy wind going at the rate of eighty (!) miles an hour. It would give Death's head a complexion, and make a delicate stomach regard sheet-iron beefsteak as sweet-bread.\"\n\nAs early as November, those more refining children of Civilization, meetings and lectures, received their birth, and the local talent displayed surprised many of those who had expected to find nought on the prairie region but Speculators, Canaanites, and Know-nothings.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, 5th December, the residents of Regina held a meeting at the Royal Hotel to consider the question of fire protection, Mr. James Brown in the chair. Mr. Johnston acted as secretary. At this meeting Messrs. Johnston, Reilly, Runciman, Reid, Hambly, Fergusson and Brown were appointed a committee \"to draft a Report and\nformulate Rules of Association, and what would be required to put the Company in working order.\" At the adjourned meeting held on the 7th, the Committee submitted a very able report recommending amongst other things the formation of a Fire Brigade, with a Hook and Ladder and Salvage Corps, and that their appliances consist of water pails, shovels, ladders, hooks, ropes, pipes, etc. The sum required for establishing a proper fire-protective system was estimated by the Committee at $1,000.\n\nThe Committee further recommended \"that Commissioners be elected by the Citizens and duly and regularly authorized to carry out the organization of the above Company, and raise funds therefor, by subscription or assessment, or otherwise as should seem most practicable, and whose duty it would be to look after the public interests and affairs of the Town in the same manner and to the like extent as a Council of an incorporated City.\"\n\nOn the 8th December was held a meeting for the election of Commissioners. The following were elected: D. Mowat, James Reilly, D. L. Scott, W. H. Gibbs, Junr., J. A. McCaul, J. D. Moulton, and Percy Pope. At the first meeting held on the 9th, Mr. Gibbs was elected chairman, and Mr. D. L. Scott, secretary. Mr. Cottingham was appointed Chief of the Fire Brigade.\n\nAt a public meeting held in the Methodist Church, on the following 13th of July, Mr. N. F. Davin in the chair, the Commissioners, through Mr. Scott, tendered their resignations, which were accepted. A warm vote of thanks was passed that useful body on the motion of Dr. Lafferty. On the 16th the following were elected as a \"Citizens' Committee\" to take charge of the business of the town until its incorporation: Dr. Lafferty, N. F. Davin, D. L. Scott, A. D. Fergusson, J. A. McCaul, J. H. Benson, W. H. Gibbs, J. A. Kerr, Jas. Hambly, W. C. Hamilton, and John Secord. Of this Committee, Mr. D. L. Scott was appointed Chairman and Mr. John Secord, Secretary. These gentlemen administered our local affairs with great wisdom and ability until\nthe event of incorporation, which took place early in January, 1884.\n\nLet us now return to December, '82. At this early stage in Regina's history but scant accommodation existed for those happy social gatherings which nowadays add wings to the heels of Wintertide. Nevertheless, our elite founded \"a club,\" secured a piano and a pack of cards, and managed to pass a good time in general.\n\nNow and again Terpischoire presided in some festal hall where our Master Fentons capered and danced with the charming city ladies, and learned to forget in woman's smile and girlhood's beauty the darkling gloom and frozen solitude which characterized the Northwest nights of 1882.\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n1883.\n\nOpening of '83\u2014Stir of Business\u2014Smuggled Whiskey\u2014The Winnipeg Times shows its Fangs\u2014Regina Gazetted the Northwest Capital\u2014Mr. Searth's Improvements\u2014Celebrating the Queen's Birthday\u2014\"The Bungalow\"\u2014Mrs. Hobourg\u2014Her Devices in Whiskey Smuggling\u2014The Regina Reserve\u2014The Free Press on Regina\u2014Important Buildings Completed\u2014The Orangemen Organize\u2014The First \"Assembly\"\u2014The First Carnival\u2014Death of the Old Year.\n\nEarly in '83 new buildings began to loom up along Broadstreet; the railway traffic increased; arrangements were made for digging a public well, a citizen* had been born to the town; lawyers by the dozen had hung out their shingles, the hotels were full, and the lands around Regina for twenty miles were taken up. The Canada Northwest Land Company opened their office on Broad Street, and the town boasted a school with Miss Laidlaw as teacher. Occasionally Odger's smuggled whiskey made some folks somewhat noisy, but the boys could afford a bit of a spree then. Buildings went up on all sides, and the sound of the hammer was heard far and near.\n\n*Regina Mary Rowell, born 18th December, 1883.\nNow came the *Winnipeg Times'* chance to attack the Northwest capital. That (now long-defunct) organ represented our town as a few tents and shacks; spoke of our water-supply as being anything but pure and wholesome, and of our sanitary accommodations as being very poor indeed. Of course the other Winnipeg papers chimed in with the *Times*, and a pretty hot fire continued to play upon our walls, until the beginning of '84, when Mr. Davin made a headlong charge on the enemy, in the shape of a clever poetic effusion, spiked their guns, and routed them pell mell from the field.\n\nThe pioneers of '83 will recollect many of the leading features of the Winnipeg press of that time mainly consisted in well-sustained (though lying and venomous) attacks on the infant capital of the Northwest. It may safely be presumed neither the editors nor proprietors of these papers harbored any grudgings towards the growth of Regina other than those dislikings provoked by capital on labor:\n\n\"For gold in phisiko is a cordial,\" says Chaucer, and \"phisiking\" newspapers with this precious metal produces such a cordial in the bowels of the attacking party as the son of Semele himself would fain mix in his cantharus for the performance of some wonderful absurdity.\n\nThe *Sun* argued the Northwest capital should be removed from Regina because \"the town was dead beyond resurrection,\" because the Canadian Pacific Railway ran the trains through the town after dark, and a hundred other reasons.\n\nMr. Davin handled Regina's enemies without gloves. \"To give Moose Jaw,\" he says, \"a lift at the expense of Regina; has been the fondest hope of poor God-forsaken, bankrupt Winnipeg. Mr. A. W. Ross is accused of stirring up the wrath of the Winnipeg papers. The commercial interests of Winnipeg and this gentleman, said the *Leader*, were in one tangle, and Mr. Ross got lost in his speculations regarding his surveyed sections near Regina. Nobody bought them.\"\nHence proceeded the tears. \"Ross was badly bitten and he howled. His howls found echo in the throats of his worthy 'hangers-on.' It was considered here at the time, that Mr. Egan and the C.P.R. did actually try to boom Moose Jaw at Regina's expense, and all things considered, it may be concluded the belief is correct enough. At all events young Regina passed through the fire of many powerful and unsprupulous enemies.\n\nMr. Davin took up the gauntlets flung at his adopted prairie home, and fought all foes. Regina could not have found a better man to return a blow with compound interest, or to handle all weapons with such telling effect. When prose had failed to batter the town, \"poetry\" was called into requisition. \"Futuro\" very cleverly transformed himself into Macaulay's New Zealander, and sketched the ruins of the \"Pile O' Bones.\" This poetic effusion appeared in the Winnipeg Times of Jan. 3rd, '84, and was supposed to have been penned by \"Ned\" of that paper, a gentleman of the highest order of journalistic ability, whose jewelled pen is probably employed at present on our Dominion 'Thunderer,\" the Toronto Mail. Here's the rhyme:\n\n\"PILE OF BONES.\"\n\nBY FUTURO.\n\nWhat mounds are these carefully ploughed around?\nSome hunters' graves or Indian burial ground?\nNot so, my friend\u2014some twenty years gone by,\nA town sprung up right here where you and I\nNow stand, which first as Pile of Bones was known,\nBut later won a name of sweeter tone,\nRegina\u2014Some may ask what's in a name?\n'Tis all that's left of that dead city's fame,\nWhich led the van in all the noble arts,\nErratic pumps and shaky water carts;\nFor I must not neglect, my friend to tell\nThe City Reservoir (a dug out well)\nAt times went dry, when all had then to seek\nWhat they called water from a neighboring creek.\nBut the result when once 'twas analysed\nLeft those who thought it water much surprised,\nHere's the report: Tadpoles and beetles five\nNot dead, remember, no sir, alive;\nPure mud was placed at twenty and the rest\nWas fluid (what if you like that best)\nThough poor this people yet were proud,\nAnd amongst themselves, at balls or any crowd\nWhere they did meet, their wives would vie\nIn dress, and spend good money lavishly.\nOne dwelt among them who with mighty pen\nAssumed to be the leader of these men;\nWhose drooping hopes he oftentimes did cheer\nWith gilded prospects of the coming year,\nBut hope deferred to them proved hope in vain,\nAnd one by one moved westward o'er the plain;\nWhich now, my friends, explains these mounds of stones,\nThey mark the spot where once stood \"Pile Of Bones.\"\n\nThe Leader (we may presume to the great joy of the Reginans) was equal to the occasion; for, just a week after \"Ned's\" squib, appeared the following in its columns from the pen of an erudite editor:\n\nTHE WINNIPEG TIMES DROPS INTO POETRY.\n\nThe prophetic soul of the Editor of the Winnipeg Times was recently delivered of the following poem. The bantling goes a little awkwardly on its feet, but in its more characteristic lineaments, it has the first virtue of all children, that of being like its father. The misstatements again reiterated in prose reappear here in verse.\n\n\"On reading the above, we remember that in Greek and Hebrew history untruthful oracles and prophets were neutralized by the utterances of genuine prophets and more trustworthy oracles. We therefore repaired to one of the prophets of Assiniboia, and yesterday he handed us the following, which he said had come to him in a manner which could leave no doubt as to its truly prophetic character:\n\nVerses supposed to be recited on Victoria Street, in the year of the City A. U. C. 22, or some twenty years and six months hence.\n\nREGINA.\n\nA pleasant city on a boundless plain,\nAround rich land where peace and plenty reign;\nA legal camp, the province wisdom's home,\nA rich cathedral, learning's splendid dome;\nA teeming mart, wide streets, broad squares, bright flowers,\nA marble figure whence a fountain showers\u2014\nWhat city's this! A gentile princess famed\nFor happy genius it Regina named.\nIts youth\u2014(though born beneath a happy star)\nWas stormy, and each our from near and far\nBark'd at the town, each ribald loudly talked,\nHirelings\u2014proectors whose vile plans were balked\u2014\nThey lied, they swore: loud was the ceaseless bray;\nReginans smiled\u2014Regina held her way.\nThe while traducers perished one by one,\nAnd fate o'ertook each guilty mother's son.\nFailing to bleed the tenderfoot, they bled\nThemselves, or like their sire by hempen thread\nExpired; and Winnipeg the city where\nThey lived and died, soon perished like a pear.\nThey had the yellows: long the Times is dead,\nThe Sun has set, the Free Press' days are fled:\nThe lot of one wild scribbler stands alone,\nThe gods in anger turned him into stone,\nAnd by an irony Ned called \"divilish square,\"\nHim made a fountain in Regina's square.\nAnd there he stands\u2014no wonder you're amused\u2014\nSpouting the water he so oft abused.\n\nAfter this, further attacks on Regina didn't amount to anything. Faint rumblings were now and again heard, but the storm had virtually passed away. A new Sun arose which now sheds upon us its enlivening rays, and The Call and Free Press, two of the ablest newspapers in Canada, are not less friendly to the growth of the Northwest, and to the warm advocacy of Northwest rights and privileges.\n\nMuch satisfaction was expressed early in April by gazetting Regina the Northwest capital. About the middle of this month we boasted fifteen buildings used as stores, two banks, four large feed stables, two carriage shops and four good hotels. An idea of the enterprise and go-aheadness of our pioneers may be gathered from the fact that our stores, churches, sidewalks, etc., were nearly all erected during three of the worst months of Winter. Early in May, Mr. W. B. Scarth, the able and popular Managing Director of the Northwest Land Company, wired Mr. Lunan to grade the streets, a work immediately begun under contractor Bonneau. Mr. Scarth also intimated his willingness to give five hundred dollars towards the building of a bridge across the Wascana.\n\nThe first steam plow arrived here on the 14th of May, and on the 20th, the race-course south of the town was completed.\n\nThe first public celebration took place on the Queen's Birthday, May 24th, and turned out a fine affair. The athletic sports, horse-racing, boat-racing, etc., were splendid, and the day's programme closed with a grand concert in St Paul's Church. Down town, Sandy Dunnet practically ex-\nplained the science of sparring to the \"Bungalow\" (Charlie Woolhouse) before a crowded house, and, taken as a whole, our first celebration of the Queen's Birthday was most creditable to the loyal and jolly pioneers of all ages, nations, tastes, and sporting proclivities.\n\nOn May 30th, the first meeting of the I.O.G.T. was held in the Methodist Church, and it is significant that shortly afterwards arrangements were made whereby persons requiring stimulants for medicinal purposes could procure the same from Messrs. Sibbald & Lindsay, who had been duly authorized to keep a stock of liquor on hand for the weary and languid.\n\nWho remembers not that great smuggling heroine, Mrs. Hobourg? This lady was somewhat lacking in those genuine qualities of praise in lovely woman, mentioned by Euripides\u2014silence and chaste reserve. Mrs. H. was a woman of daring and originality. One of her innumerable smuggling plans was the wearing a circular rubber bag around the waist, which invariably arrived from Winnipeg or Brandon ominously distended. Another, was the dressing of a (full) keg as an interesting young Hobourg, or as a pillow, on which the artless lady might rest her head, while the police went through a rather old-fashioned but absolutely teetotalized valise. Though Mrs. Hobourg often boasted she \"could down all the police in the Northwest,\" she failed to do so, for on the 14th of June she was compelled to hand over a fine of two hundred dollars and costs for importing two barrels of \"beef and beans\" to Pasqua Station. Mr. Le Jeune was the presiding justice on that memorable occasion, and the worthy magistrate was told in very plain language by the lady of the dropsical air, the sort of warm reception he was likely to meet from the clan-Hobourg on his arrival\u2014if ever\u2014in the hallowed precincts of Moose Jaw. Shortly afterwards we find this lady led to the altar by a lover long fascinated by her many rare accomplishments. The happy couple are doubtless still in the enjoyment of their honeymoon on the grounds of Uncle Sam.\nOn the 21st of June tenders for the construction of the reservoir were opened, the South Railway street squatters were asked to move on to their respective lots, and the townsite Trustees bonused Aitcheson, Reilly and Reilly, in the erection of a planing mill.\n\nOn the 5th of July, Mr. William White obtained \"an opinion\" from Dalton McCarthy, that the settlers who had located on the Regina Reserve within the Mile Belt before the alterations of the projected line of the C.P.R. were entitled to receive entries for their holdings. Auctioneer Metcalfe had already failed to dispose of these squatters' claims by public auction at Regina and Winnipeg.\n\nAn idea of the Regina of August, '83 may be gathered from a Free Press correspondent of the time who wrote: \"One year ago Regina was nothing but the unbroken prairie, with a few adventurers' tents squatted in speculative expectation of the teeming thousands that were waiting for the signal to rally together and build a city. Today it is an incorporated city (?) with regular blocks, graded streets and municipal institutions.* It is the centre to which throb the vital interests of a vast empire, whose boundaries are wider than those of Europe, and will, before many years become a nation of hardy pioneers, who will look to Regina for their laws, their justice, their education and their prosperity.\"\n\nOur Indian Offices were completed in October by Contractor Zindord, and \"Scarth's Building\"\u2014a square structure with the roof sloping from a central cupola\u2014finished at a cost of fifteen thousand dollars. During the Fall and Winter meetings of a \"Dramatic Club\" were held; the city Orangemen took steps to organize on the 10th of November, in the Ontario House, Mr. Harry Hamilton in the chair; and on the 30th, the first \"Assembly\" met in McNicol's Hall\u2014\n\n\"To chase the glowing hours with flying feet.\"\n\nOur Merchant's Bank closed on the 10th of December, and\n\n*Regina was proclaimed an incorporated town, 1st December, 1883.\non the 11th was held the first ice carnival, under the management of Mr. Keller. King Christmas made things merry as a marriage bell, and the Old Year expired in a vision befitting to welcome its more important successor, 1884.\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n1884.\n\nIncorporation of Regina\u2014O-sha-way\u2014Important Deputation to Ottawa\u2014The Delegates' Demands\u2014Successful Results\u2014The Ottawa Citizen on the North-West\u2014Blizzards, Hard Tack, Bacon and Pemmican\u2014The First Execution\u2014John and George Stephenson\u2014Confession of the Murderers\u2014Departure of the Rev. W. J. Hewitt\u2014Citizens' Address\u2014The Rev. Mr. Pooley\u2014Arrival of the Bishop of Qu'Appelle\u2014Consecration of the Roman Catholic Church\u2014First Annual Exhibition\u2014A Batch of Notables Arrive\u2014A Cemetery Laid Out\u2014Canada's Day of Rejoicing\u2014The Regina Deputation.\n\nThe Northwest Territories Gazette of 1st December, '83, contained the proclamation incorporating Regina, and on the next following 3rd of January ('84) the nominations for a Mayor and four Councillors took place, with Mr. William Johnson, Advocate, as Returning-Officer. Election day came off a week later. D. L. Scott, Q.C., was the people's choice as City Father, and Messrs. J. W. Smith, J. A. Kerr, J. D. Sibbald and James Hambly, were elected Councillors. The voting stood: J. W. Smith, 160; J. A. Kerr, 155; J. D. Sibbald, 137; James Hambly, 127. The total number of votes polled was 213. The first Council Meeting was held on the 21st inst., in Dr. Cotton's Hall. Mr. Secord was appointed Clerk. It was decided that future meetings be held in the Methodist Church, for which a rent of $12.50 would be paid.\n\nIt becomes our unpleasant duty to chronicle the death of a noble red woman, at the railway station, on the 23rd of February. The lady in question rejoiced in the name of O-sha-way-way, and visited the Happy Hunting Grounds through accidentally falling into the O.P.R. well on this Sabbath morning.\nOn the following day, Monday, Mayor Scott laid before our citizens in public meeting assembled, the results of his and Mr. Davin's labors as delegates to Ottawa. Little less than a month before, the largest public meeting held up to that time took place in the Methodist Church, and appointed the two gentlemen named to proceed to Ottawa with the view of representing to the Government and the C.P.R., the claims of Regina as regards railway facilities and other matters. After Mr. Scott had addressed the meeting on the work done by the deputation, Mr. Benson proposed and Mr. J. W. Smith seconded, a hearty vote of thanks to Messrs. Scott and Davin for the highly satisfactory manner in which they discharged their duties.\n\nAs this event in the history of Regina produced most needed and important results, we cannot afford to dismiss the matter with a brief notice.\n\nThe delegation demanded (1) the restoration of the end of the division to Regina; (2) the creation of appeal from magistrates unlearned in the law; (3) the removal of doubts respecting the power of municipal bodies to impose and collect taxes; (4) the construction of a railway north of Regina; and (5) representation for the Territories.\n\nThe results of these demands may be summarized as follows: (1) To bring back the end of the division, Van Horne declared to be \"a physical impossibility.\" (2) Sir J. A. Macdonald made it impossible for ignorant or \"tyrannical\" J.P.'s to make a wrong use of their authority by inserting a clause in the proper Act giving an appeal from magistrates unlearned in the law. (3) With regard to the doubt that existed regarding the authority of Northwest Municipal bodies to levy taxes it may be noted that only an elected body can impose taxes in a free country. But the North-West Council was partly a nominated body, and as a doubt existed as to the authority to endow bodies corporate to receive monies for municipal purposes, the Premier, in his Bill, adopted a necessary clause by Mr. Davin, removing any such doubts; (4) a land grant was obtained for the Regina and\nLong Lake Railroad, and (5) the representation question was postponed for the time being.\n\nThe rapid strides made by prosperous settlement and civilization during the past eighteen months had been enormous, not only in Regina and its District, but the Territories. This is what the Ottawa Citizen said on April 21st:\n\n\"Two years have not yet elapsed since the Northwest was the Great Lone Land, known to us only through the graphic pen of a Milton, or the dashing style of a Butler. It says something for the Government and Constitution of Canada that the railway whistle had hardly started for the first time the wild silence of illimitable plains, when a quasi-representative Assembly was deliberating in the capital of the Northwest and passing an Ordinance for the establishment of Municipal institutions. The country had been practically before this under military rule; the Indian, the hunter, the smuggler, the trader\u2014of such was the population of the Northwest, and the duties of keeping out liquor, of preserving order, of maintaining law, were all discharged by the Mounted Police.\n\nBut with the smoke of the locomotive, and the ease of the pullman car, the poetry of adventure, or of real or supposed danger, the genuine charm of hardship, long rides through blizzards, hard tack, bacon, pemmican, and a fair chance of being frozen; all this disappeared like the dream of a school girl during her early days of fashionable gaiety. Civic man stood on the prairie and reared his little cities and built his farm houses, and the first burst of excitement over he began to ask himself how he was governed?\"\n\nThe C.P.R. Government loan of $22,500,000 granted this month, proved a boon to the towns along the main line, the amount spent upon Northwest railroad construction being very considerable.\n\nThe first execution took place at the police barracks, on the 3rd of April, the half-breed brothers, John and George Stephenson, suffering the extreme penalty of the law for the brutal murder of an old settler named McCarthy, near Troy.\n(now Qu'Appelle Station) on the 3rd of June, '83. The circumstances connected with this ghastly murder are still fresh in the minds of many of our citizens. The most novel feature was the discovery of the facts by the alleged playing of cards. The murderers made a full confession of their crime before execution, and died penitent.\n\nOn the 5th May, the Town Council declared Mr. Hambly's seat vacant, he having absented himself from three regular meetings. Mr. D. Mowat was elected to the vacancy by acclamation. Since then our present Mayor has kept in the front rank of our City Fathers.\n\nBefore the departure of the pioneer missionary, the Rev. W. J. Hewitt, in July, this worthy and zealous gentleman received the regret of his fellow citizens at a public meeting held in the freight shed. His Honor Lieutenant-Governor Dewdney read the address, which was signed by thirty-seven of the rev. preacher's brother pioneers. He was succeeded by the Rev. Mr. Pooley on the 20th of July.\n\nOn the 25th of July arrived here His Lordship Adelbert John Robert Anson, brother of the Earl of Lichfield, as Bishop of Assiniboia. He was presented with a beautifully engrossed address, read by the Churchwarden, Mr. William Cayley Hamilton. We give a sketch of Bishop Anson elsewhere. This episcopal diocese is now known as that of Qu'Appelle, the designation having been bestowed on the 18th of December (1884).\n\nOn the 3rd of August the Roman Catholic Church was consecrated by his grace Archbishop Tache, in the presence of the elite of Regina. There was a crowded assembly. In the evening there was a sacred concert towards the liquidation of the Church debt, at which His Honor, Governor Dewdney, Mrs. Dewdney, etc., were present. A large sum was realized. Previous to the erection of this Church the Roman Catholics held their services in McCusker's Hall and Bonneau's store. The pioneer R. C. Missionaries were Fathers St. Germain and Huggonard. Pere Larche took charge in the Spring of '84, and the present clergyman,\nFather Graton, whom we notice in the \"Sketches,\" arrived here from Montreal in May, 1886.\n\nThe first annual exhibition was held at Regina on the 2nd and 3rd of October, 1884. The money prizes were valued at $1500, and the entries numbered 980. The show ground for horses and cattle was Victoria Square, while the court-room and a vacant store-room in Scarth's building were utilized for exhibits of grain, roots and vegetables. Dinner was served on the evening of the 2nd in what was known as the Bowling Alley, Broad Street, with Mrs. Kelly (now Mrs. Doig) as cateress. The attendance numbered 150.\n\nThe following notables paid us a flying visit on the evening of the 3rd November: The Hon. Messrs. Carling, Postmaster-General Pope, the Minister of Agriculture; Alonzo Wright, M.P. for Ottawa County, better known as \"the King of the Gatineau;\" several C.P.R. magnates and others.\n\nFew sidewalks graced our streets those days, even along the most important thoroughfares. It was only on November 13th of this year that the one leading from Broad Street to the C.P.R. was completed. Several fine buildings went up on the suburbs, including the beautiful and commodious residence of Mr. J. C. Nelson, D.L.S., on section 26, by the Wascana.\n\nOn the 26th of November, the Townsite Trustees set apart twenty-three acres, to be used as a cemetery. The latter is situated outside the corporate limits on the North side of the town, and on the east side of the Regina and Long Lake Railway.\n\nThe 17th of December was one of great rejoicing in Canada. On that day in the Grand Opera House, Toronto, was presented amongst others, the Address of the citizens of Regina to Sir John A. Macdonald, in honor of the fortieth anniversary of that great statesman's entry into public life. The Address, signed by Mr. Benson and Mr. William McGirr, was presented by Messrs. N. F. Davin, W. White, Major Bell and Mr. Foy. In acknowledging the address, Sir John\nsaid: \"I am proud to receive the address from Regina, the capital of the Northwest. Regina was attacked, and those who acted with me were attacked for the selection of Regina as the capital. Experience has shown it is the center of one of the most beautiful tracts in that beautiful and fertile country. Its future is assured. It is in\n\nTHE RICHEST PORTION OF THE NORTHWEST\nfrom an agricultural point of view; is on the line of the C.P.R., and everyone can reach it from all parts of the Dominion with railway speed.\"\n\nFew can deny that Sir John Macdonald is and has been the true and sterling friend of the Northwest, and, like a great many others, with a great deal to give and the big heart to bestow it, he may well say with Plautus:\n\nUt acerbum est, pro benefactis cum mali messem metas.*\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n1885.\n\nEarly History of the Year\u2014Breaking out of the Rebellion\u2014The \"Blazers\" Organized\u2014Their Right to Scrip\u2014Erection of a Gaol and Lunatic Asylum\u2014The Regina and Long Lake Railroad Started\u2014Riel Arrives a Prisoner\u2014The Montreal Garrison Artillery\u2014The Riel Trial\u2014Names of Counsel\u2014Conviction and Execution of Prisoner\u2014Conclusion of Rebel Trials\u2014New Buildings\u2014Visit of Lord Lansdowne\u2014Sir Charles Tupper\u2014The Hon. Thomas White Welcomed\u2014Town Hall Erected\u2014Literary and Musical Society Formed\u2014Summing Up.\n\n\"This year,\" says the Leader, \"was ushered into existence in vigorous weather, with a full moon shedding its silvery light over our boundless prairies, clad in their spotless mantle with a beauty we never saw equalled.\"\n\nThe history of January and February would make dull reading. The town continued to grow steadily and our business men were hopeful. On the 4th of March, out of forty-two Notes and Drafts due at the Bank of Montreal here, not one went to protest.\n\nOn the 25th of March, the \"Blazers\" were organized.\n\n*How bitter it is to reap a harvest of evil for good that you have done.\nMiddleton had left Toronto for the scene of strife two days before, and with a commendable patriotism, the Regina Volunteer Corps placed themselves at the service of their Queen and country, under the able command of Lieut.-Col. Scott and Major Mowat. At the first meeting held in McNicol's Hall, 75 volunteers signed the roll. Instructions giving the necessary authority to form the corps were received from Sir A. P. Caron on the 28th, and on April 21st a \"Company Order\" appeared from the Officer commanding, calling the \"Blazers\" out for active service.\n\nThe men drilled regularly, and were prepared to defend the town or go to the front. In fact many did go where the fight raged hottest.\n\nThe fact that up to this the \"Blazers\" have been denied scrip or any reward whatsoever, is such a gross injustice as to need no comment. Mr. Davin, M.P., has taken up the matter, and it is to be hoped the hon. gentleman will be successful in his endeavors to procure justice for an efficient and loyal corps of Canada's citizen soldiers.\n\nAbout this date, tenders were asked for building the new gaol and lunatic asylum.\n\nThe grading of the Long Lake Railway commenced early in May, and on the 23rd, Louis David Riel was taken prisoner to the Northwest Mounted Police Barracks, by Captain Young.\n\nOn June 6th, a public meeting was held in McNicol's Hall, for bringing out members of the Northwest Council, and Regina was visited by the Montreal Garrison Artillery, who camped on the west bank of the Wascana near the railroad bridge, and immediately south of the dungeon keep of the unfortunate man who had by a mixture of genius, imbecility, and folly, attempted to grasp by a species of terrorism, what he claimed to be the rights of himself and of his race, and failing in such attempt, to plunge the Territories into the throes of a contest which should only result in deluging the Northwest with the blood of thousands of innocent persons. On the 6th of July, Riel was charged\nwith High Treason, before the Hon. Mr. Justice Richardson, and on the 20th, Regina became the theatre of one of the most interesting events which had ever taken place in Canada. A rebel leader was being tried by a State trial, and while the latter progressed, the civilized world looked on with interest and impatiently discussed a result. The little square building on the corner of Scarth and Victoria Streets was supplied with a telegraph office, and from its wires were flashed to a thousand and one sources, each hour's proceedings as it sped interestingly along. Christopher Robinson, Q.C., B. B. Osler, Q.C., G. W. Burbidge, Q.C., D. L. Scott, Q.C., (of this town,) and T. Chaise Casgrain represented the Crown, and the prisoner was defended by Messrs. Chas. Fitzpatrick, F. H. Lemieux, J. N. Greenshields and T. C. Johnstone, (Regina.) Conviction ensued after a most able defence and impartial trial. After several respite, Riel was finally executed at the police barracks, on the 16th of November. He died \"calm, resigned, brave, passionless, and forgiving. The way he left the world became him better than anything he did in it.\"\n\nThe other rebel trials, including those of Poundmaker, Big Bear, the Sioux Chief Whitecap, a number of half-breeds and Indians, and that of Mr. Scott, Prince Albert, dragged their slow lengths along, and the last of the Mohicans (Magnus Burton) was sentenced by Judge Richardson on the 10th of September.\n\nMany fine new buildings now began to rear their architectural forms, including those of Messrs. Fraser, Hayter Reed, and the present residence of the Hon. Mr. Justice Richardson. The total value of buildings erected amounted to $55,150.\n\nOn the 23rd of September, Regina gave a right vice-regal reception to Lord Lansdowne. On the 26th, His Excellency left for the West, accompanied by Lieutenant-Governor Dewdney. On the 8th October, we had a visit from Sir Charles Tupper. On the 20th, Regina warmly welcomed Canada's untiring worker in the field of onerous statesman-\nship, the Hon. Thomas White, Minister of the Interior. The Hon. gentleman was feted in Hambly's Hall, and left, having won golden opinions from everybody.\n\nThe 12th November was appointed General Thanksgiving Day throughout the Territories, and about the same date a Town Hall was put up at a cost of $2,500. On the 28th a Literary and Musical Society was formed, with Mr. James H. Benson as President.\n\nRegina's history for 1885, is most interesting and eventful. The rebellion brought us faces from the four corners of the Dominion. A new railroad was started. At the Riel trial pleaded the ablest of Canadian lawyers; we were visited by Canada's Governor-General and several of Canada's ablest statesmen, and the town grew considerably in size and beauty. We counted with Ovid, the sunny and cloudy days of the whole year, and found the sunshine to largely predominate.\n\nCHAPTER X.\n1886.\n\nLady Macdonald\u2014Her Love for the Northwest\u2014Trip to the Rockies\u2014Fire Brigade Organized\u2014Territorial Board of Education\u2014First Sitting\u2014New Police Commissioner\u2014The Grist Mill\u2014\"The Gore\" Planted\u2014Preparations to Receive Sir John A.

Thomas White Arrives\u2014Still Another Batch\u2014Mrs. Yeomans\u2014Crowfoot\u2014Mr. Davin Nominated M.P.\u2014Starting a Territorial Hospital.\n\nShould anybody ask Lady Macdonald why that distinguished personage so dearly loved the Northwest, her ladyship might fittingly reply by asking\n\n\"Is it, in heav'n a crime to love too well?\"\n\nSwinburne says there is no such thing as a dumb poet or a handless painter, and Lady Macdonald's intellectual faculties should be out of the fashion of that genius which lights up both poetry and painting were her ladyship unable to behold a solemnity in the unbroken panorama of distance\npresented by a section of Northwest prairie, or in those mountain giants farther west whose hoary peaks pierce the pall ing clouds and give such a sublimity to Nature as should make even the dullest mind poetical.\n\nWe have had many visits from Lady Macdonald. One of these was in January, '86. Early this month her ladyship arrived at Regina accompanied by Judge and Mrs. Brooks, en route to the Rockies. His Honor, Lieutenant-Governor Dewdney and Mrs. Dewdney joined the party, and on the return to Regina about the 8th, her ladyship held a reception at Government House, which, needless to say, was \"well attended.\"\n\nThe citizens' meeting in the Town Hall, to organize a fire brigade, took place on the 22nd, and the excellent fire protection now enjoyed by the Town shows the good accomplished by that meeting.\n\nThe first sitting of the Territorial Board of Education took place on the 11th of March, and this month also saw a new police commissioner quartered at the barracks, in the person of Mr. Lawrence Horchner.\n\nThe grist mill commenced working on the 25th of April, and on the 7th of May the Lieutenant-Governor, Town Council, and interested citizens, made a big arbor day of it by planting The Goro with a choice and suitable variety of trees. On the 20th, a public meeting was held in the Council Chamber, and elaborate preparations were made to receive Sir John A. Macdonald.\n\nAbout the middle of June the Brass Band was organized, the instruments coming to hand on the 25th. The officers elected were the Hon. E. Dewdney, Hon. President; Mr. D. W. Bole, President, Dr. Cotton, Vice-President, and Dr. Keown, Sec.-Treasurer.\n\nDominion day was celebrated with magnificence. The horse-racing was fine, and the Town Hall Concert splendid. There was a billiard tournament at the Palmer House, and the Carnival Knights paced the streets while the band played. \"Colonel\" Ingersoll appropriately led the procession dressed as an Archbishop. A great crowd received the\nfirst through train with a big Regina cheer, and presented\nthe engine driver with a flag. The jubilee terminated with\na monster bonfire north of the track.\n\n\"The Chieftain\" himself arrived on the 17th, and received\na royal reception. Perhaps the event was the most interest-\ning in the history of the Northwest. Sir John Macdonald\ncould well claim the honor to be called a Great Canadian.\nHe was the Father of Confederation, the Builder of the\nCanadian Pacific Railway, and the creator of the Northwest\nas a political entity. The people of Regina believed in his\nworth and services, and demonstrated their feelings during\nhis stay in their midst. On the 28th, the Hon. Thomas\nWhite arrived, accompanied by Mrs. and the Misses White.\nAfter receiving several deputations and paying visits the\ndistinguished visitors, accompanied by a large body of the\ncitizens, took a trip north on the Regina and Long Lake\nRailroad. The country and scenery traversed by this line\nare well worthy of admiration.\n\nOn the 1st September arrived the Hon. McKenzie Bowell,\nMinister of Customs, and the Misses Bowell; the Hon. Mr.\nFoster, Minister of Marine; the Hon. Mr. Royal, and others.\n\nOn the 25th September, we were honored by the visits of\ntwo distinguished personages. Let us give them a niche in\nthe Temple of History\u2014Mrs. Yeomans, the great temperance\nlecturer, and Crowfoot, Chief of the Blackfeet. Mrs. Yeo-\nmans lectured in the Knox Church on Sunday evening,\nwhile Crowfoot ordered the printing of a hundred visiting\ncards, for the dignification (excuse the coin) of his trip to\nOttawa.\n\nOn the 3rd November, a large and influential meeting of\nthe Conservative Association was held in the Town Hall, at\nwhich Mr. Nicholas Flood Davin was nominated M.P. for\nWestern Assiniboia, and on the 6th, a public meeting was\nheld in the same institution, to consider the feasibility of\nestablishing a Territorial Hospital at Regina. 'Twas meet\nthat the Old Year's approaching dissolution should be\nmarked with love and benefaction to the suffering and afflicted. Charity's lamp burns brightest at home, and\n\n\"The primal duties shine aloft like stars;\nThe charities that soothe and heal and bless\nAre scattered at the feet of men like flowers.\"\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n1887.\n\nThe General Elections\u2014The Two Great Parties\u2014Eastern Canada and the Territories\u2014We Cannot Indulge in Sentiment\u2014Mr. Blake's Supposed Policy\u2014Its Effect on the Electors\u2014Messrs. Davin and Ross\u2014The Civic Elections\u2014The General Hospital\u2014Meeting of the Directors\u2014Board of Trade Meeting\u2014The Burns' Anniversary Celebrated\u2014Petitions for re-appointment of Lieut-Governor Dowdney\u2014Lady Macdonald's Visit\u2014Congratulatory Address to the Queen\u2014Conclusion.\n\nSir Jno. A. Macdonald's appeal to the country early this year for a fresh lease of power startled nobody in particular, if we may except those drones and boodlers who had conceived a pretty fair idea that parliamentary dissolution meant for them relegation to private life. Eastern Canada had scented the battle from afar, and the two great political parties were in good fighting trim at the call of the reveille. The political genius of the Chieftain and the pride felt by the country in his daring and sagacious statesmanship, placed the Reform Party at great disadvantage, but, nevertheless, Mr. Blake and his men made a splendid fight, all things considered.\n\nIn Eastern Canada, age has stamped public institutions and public men with the seal of a conservatism which might at any time corrupt the commonwealth, unless watched by the eagle eye of a vigilant opposition. *Humanum est errare* is as true of a public servant as of the fool whose sun sets at noonday from the stealing of a dollar bill. The Reform press of the Eastern provinces had handled the Macdonald Ministry without gloves, and Sir John impatiently awaited the hour to clear the Conservative decks and give the enemy battle. He was too cool and clear-headed a statesman to be\ngoaded into action one moment before he was prepared. The result of the election would prove whether the Dominion believed the million and one charges laid at the door of modern Canadian conservatism, and whether those proclaiming Tory iniquity from the housetops received their exalted mission from the great bulk of the people or had consecrated themselves to become their own bishops. We know the result of the elections, and while all patriotic Canadians will rejoice in the triumph of a man who had placed the best years of his life and his best talents at the service of his country without fee or reward except the penny a day which any premier may command on entering the Cabinet vineyard\u2014while Canadians may rejoice in such triumph, it cannot be denied the Reform Party had had some grave grounds for complaint, and it is to be hoped the rectification of several abuses brought to light during the late contest will largely contribute towards the healthy progress of the country and the best interests of the Dominion.\n\nHere in the Northwest the present Government found staunch support. This is not to be wondered at. The country is still in its infancy, and a few successive seasons of drought have somewhat disheartened the settlers and caused them to look for support and encouragement to those whom they believe to be their best friends. The development and go-aheadness of the Territories have long been associated with Sir John Macdonald and the Conservative Party. On the other hand, Mr. Blake's supposed Northwest policy\u2014not only economic, but parsimonious\u2014had been viewed with alarm by the great bulk of the settlers, who had, in many instances, lost their all in a great lone land, and who regarded a policy other than considerate and liberal the death-blow to the country. There is very little ideal sentiment in the Northwest at the present time. Old Countrymen and Eastern Canadians came here years ago and invested every dollar of their capital in a soil the finest and richest on the face of the earth. Up to this the labor has been great and the reward small, and little blame to the\nNorthwest pioneer, who should regard a shower of rain or a fine wheat field with greater interest than the fanfaronade of some puritanical sponter who comes out West with sentiment in one hand and emptiness in the other.\n\nIn Western Assiniboia, the aspirants to parliamentary fame were Mr. Nicholas Flood Davin, and Mr. James Hamilton Ross. Mr. Davin was a man of transcendent ability, and had been with the people almost from the beginning. He was editor and proprietor of a newspaper which had fought and won many battles for Regina; he was known everywhere as an orator, a wit, and a litterateur, and his great influence at Ottawa had been recognised on more than one occasion. It would be impossible for such a man to exist without enemies, but despite envy and malice, the fact remained that Davin and Regina had become convertible terms, and the constituency were inclined to support a candidate who for four years had stood in the breach, and held the pass for the people's rights and liberties against all foes. Moreover, Mr. Davin represented the party supposed to be more favorable to the Northwest\u2014a very potent factor indeed in his claims for election.\n\nOf Mr. Ross nobody could say an unkind word. He was a young man, able, genial, honorable and popular, and made a good fight. The election came off on the 15th of March, 1,149 votes were polled out of 1,885; Davin receiving 726, and Ross 423.\n\nOf course there was the usual excitement in Regina during the contest, but with almost everybody Mr. Davin's return was a foregone conclusion. We have opened the chapter with these remarks because little else than election news remains for us to talk about so far.\n\nThe civic elections resulted in the return of Mayor Mowat to a second term of office, with Messrs. A. Martin, J. W. Smith, D. S. McCannell, and W. C. Hamilton, as Councillors. A graceful compliment was paid to Mr. Hamilton by electing him in his absence during a holiday trip to Ontario.\n\nOn the 11th of January there was a meeting of the\ndirectors of the Regina General Hospital. Mayor Mowat was appointed Chairman, Mr. A. L. Lunan Secretary, and Mr. John Secord, Treasurer. Messrs. Benson and Scott were appointed a committee to arrange for the collection of subscriptions. A strong appeal was directed to be made to the Territories for support, the institution being practically Territorial in object. An annual membership fee was fixed at four dollars, and the directors resolved to ask the Churches to devote the collections of the first Sunday in May each year to the hospital funds.\n\nThe annual meeting of the Board of Trade took place on the 18th. The officers appointed were, President, F. J. Hunter; Vice-Pres., D. W. Bole; Sec.-Treas., D. Mowat; Council: Messrs. McCaul, Lamont, Sheppard, Bayne, J. H. Smith, A. Martin, T. E. Martin, McNicol and Dawson.\n\nOn the 22nd of February was commemorated the 128th anniversary of the poet Robert Burns, by a dinner at the Windsor Hotel. Here occurred the first gathering of Scotchmen and their descendants that ever took place in Regina.\n\nTowards the latter part of March, the distribution of seed grain granted by the government on certain conditions to settlers took place under the supervision of Mr. Edward Carss, President of the Agricultural Society, and petitions for the re-appointment of His Honor Lieut.-Governor Dewdney poured into Ottawa from all parts of the country. A petition to this effect was forwarded to His Excellency the Governor-General, by the Mayor and Citizens of Regina. The Indian tribes also petitioned, not the least significant of the documents being that of Crowfoot, and seventeen other chiefs of the Blackfoot nation, who expressed their hope Mr. Dewdney would be allowed to remain in the Territories as their \"Great White Chief.\"\n\nOn March 30th, the Council of the Board of Trade met and a statement of business done in '86 was submitted. The total figured up $898,000. Of this $94,300 represented\nbuilding improvements, leaving $803,700 for mercantile trade proper.\n\nOn the 9th of April, Lady Macdonald arrived here from Banff on her way eastwards, and the last incident in the chronicles of Regina which remains for us to notice is the special meeting of the Town Council, held on the 19th of May, at which Messrs. Hamilton, McCannell and Smith, were appointed a committee to prepare a congratulatory address to Her Majesty Queen Victoria, on the occasion of the celebration of her Jubilee.*\n\nThis closes the history proper of Regina. Simple and unpretentious it is. How could it be otherwise? The Northwest Capital is yet scarcely five years old\u2014a moment in the ages of great capitals! But these, too, had their beginnings, perhaps far weaker and less hopeful than the little town founded a twentieth of a century ago on the bosom of a prairie sea, by men little accustomed to the hardships and disappointments of pioneer life. We are told a great destiny awaits the Northwest. If this be so may we not expect a bright future for the Town of Regina; and when gravestones have ceased to tell of the men who pitched their tents on The Gore and laid the foundations of a great city, generations yet unborn will remember with pride those sanguine forefathers who left the comforts and luxuries of eastern homes to carve for their children a priceless heritage, the grandeur of which those hardy and hopeful pioneers had not lived sufficiently long to even faintly realise.\n\n*At a public meeting held in the Town Hall on the 13th of June, Mr. J. W. Smith, J.P., in the chair, the 21st of June was set apart for the special celebration of the Queen's Jubilee on the motion of Mr. J. W. Powers. Thanks to the sterling loyalty of Regina, \"Jubilee Day\" was celebrated here with the greatest enthusiasm and success.\nHER MAJESTY, QUEEN VICTORIA.\n1837\u20141887.\n\nHer Majesty, Alexandrina Victoria, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland, and Empress of India, was born May 24th, 1819; succeeded William IV., June 20, 1837; crowned June 28, 1838; married February 10, 1840, to her cousin, H.R.H. Prince Albert of Saxe Cobourg, who died December 14, 1861. The Queen's surname is Guelph, one of her ancestors, the Marquis of Este, who married a Bavarian Princess, having taken that name. Her Majesty's family is a large one. She has seven still living out of nine children, thirty-one grand-children, and seven great grand-children.\n\nVictoria rules the greatest Empire recorded in history. As a Queen she stands above sovereigns in the niche of an exalted virtue so becoming the sphere of a great ruler. The story of this, her Jubilee year, will live for centuries in history, bearing golden testimony to the unalloyed affection of\nmillions of British subjects intensely loyal and loving to the purest, the noblest, the best of women ever crowned on \"The Stone of Destiny.\"\n\nDuring Queen Victoria's reign, Great Britain has added 7,260,000 square miles to her territory, and nearly trebled the population of her subjects in the Colonies and India. The State revenues have increased from $85,000,000 to $355,000,000, and in the Colonies and dependencies from $25,000,000 to $255,000,000!\n\nNORTHWEST MOUNTED POLICE.\n\nThis force was organized in 1874, the idea of its formation originating contemporaneously with the Wolseley expedition. At the time, Sir John A. Macdonald was Minister of Justice, and the first question which naturally presented itself to his able mind was whether the new force was to be of a civil or a military character. Our frontier was not clearly defined just then, and serious complications might arise by a military force marching through American Territory. It was therefore resolved the decided character of the force should be civil, not military. The particular color of the jacket next occupied attention. The Indian, it was well-known, had little love for the blue-coated soldiers of the States, whereas the British red jacket was, in the mind of the red man, always associated with clemency, honesty, and liberality. So the scarlet coat was decided upon.\n\nThe strength of the '74 force was 300. That Summer they marched from Winnipeg to Macleod and erected a Fort there. In 1875 the headquarters of the force was erected at Fort Walsh, in the Cypress Hills. In 1882, the body was increased to 500, and in 1885 at the close of the rebellion to a thousand men, about its present strength.\n\nThe force is divided into ten divisions of 100 N. C. Officers and men, each commanded by a Sergeant and three Inspectors.\nThe present divisional headquarters (1st May '87) are stationed:\u2014\"A\" Division, Maple Creek; \"B\" do., Regina; \"C\" do., Battleford; \"D\" do., Lethbridge; \"E\" do., Calgary; \"F\" do., Prince Albert; \"G\" do., Fort Saskatchewan; \"H\" do., Macleod; \"K\" do., Battleford. The depot divisional headquarters are at Regina, and training of recruits carried on. Each division is allowed the following N. C. Officers: Sergeant-Major, Qr.-Mr. Sergeant, Vety. Sergeant, Hospital Sergeant, seven Sergeants, and six Corporals.\n\nThe following is a list of the present commissioned officers: Commissioner, Lawrence W. Herchmer, Esq., Assistant Commissioner, Lieut-Col. W. M. Herchmer: appointed 1st of August, 1876; Messrs. J. Cotton, S. Gagnon, R. B. Denne (Adjutants) A. B. Perry, E. W. Jarvis, M. H. White-Fraser, W. S. Morris, G. A. Sanders, F. Drayner, J. Allan, Z. T. Wood, P. C. H. Primrose, A. R. Cuthbert, E. A. Snyder, H. D. Likely, A. Huot, J. D. Moodie, J. V. Begin, C. Starnes, T. W. Chalmers, W. G. Matthews, C. Constantine, H. S. Casey, V. Williams, R. Miller, G. A. Kennedy, H. Y. Baldwin and P. Aylen.\n\nThe following nineteen gentlemen were very worthily promoted from the ranks:\u2014Messrs. J. H. McIlree, P. R. Neale, S. B. Steele, A. H. Griesbach, A. R. Macdonell, W. D. Antrobus, F. Norman, J. Howe, G. B. Moffatt, W. Piercey, J. A. McGibbon, J. O. Wilson, T. Wattam, E. Bradley, S. G. Mills, F. Harper, M. Baker, W. H. Routledge, J. W. Rolph and R. Riddell.\n\nCOMMISSIONER HERCHMER\n\nreceived a thorough military education and training. He held a commission in the 46th Regiment, serving in India and elsewhere. On resigning his commission in the army, he came to Canada and was associated with the International Boundary Commission, being in charge of the commissariat for that expedition. Mr. Herchmer subsequently entered the service of the Indian Department, and held the position of Inspector of Indian Agencies on his retirement in the\nSpring of 1886. The Commissioner's departmental efficiency is too well known to require comment in this sketch. On the 1st of April, 1886, Mr. Herchmer assumed command of the Northwest Mounted Police Force upon the retirement of Lieut.-Col. Irvine, and one has only to look at the thorough efficiency of this fine body of men, the many improvements in barracks buildings, and other matters, to show the wisdom of the Government in its selection of Mr. Herchmer as Commissioner of Northwest Mounted Police.\n\nLIEUT.-COL. W. M. HERCHMER,\n\nAssistant Commissioner, is brother to the Commissioner. He commanded a company of the 1st Ontario Rifles, in the famous Red River Expedition of 1869-70 under Lord Wolseley, then Col. Wolseley. At the close of the expedition, Col. Herchmer remained in Winnipeg as second in command of the Provisional Battalion, and held that position till 1876 when he resigned to take the appointment of Supt. in the N.W.M.P. He served with distinction through the late rebellion in the Territories as second in command of Col. Otter's brigade, and was present at the battle of Cut Knife Hill. His conspicuous gallantry on that occasion caused him to be twice commended in dispatches from the front.\n\nCol. Herchmer is justly popular with all ranks of the force, in which he takes an absorbing interest, ably seconding the Commissioner in his efforts for the improvement of the Corps. This officer makes Calgary his headquarters.\n\nIt is probable the police force will be further augmented by 200 men, and that stations will be established in all the smaller Northwest towns along the C.P.R. east and west of Regina. It is to be hoped this will be done, as recent unfortunate troubles over horse-stealing and other cases have placed the country in a very unsettled condition. The mixed and scattered elements composing the Territorial population make the positions of the Northwest Mounted Police Officers most responsible and arduous, and it is some consolation to know the commanding officers and men of the\nForce have in them the requisite metal for the speedy suppression of wanton riot and bloodshed.\n\nA thousand men is a small number for a vast territory holding 30,000 Indians and Half-breeds alone, and we are sometimes inclined to judge harshly of the police force without waiting to consider the disadvantages under which they labor. To use the words of Aristotle, \"The virtue of justice consists in moderation as regulated by wisdom,\" and in ruling the mixed elements of the Northwest, a proper wisdom will undoubtedly score a larger record than reckless bravery or misguided zeal.\n\nNORTH-WEST GOVERNMENT OFFICES\n\nLIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR AND STAFF.\n\nLieutenant-Governor.\u2014His Honor Edgar Dewdney, C.E.\n\nSee \"Sketches.\"\n\nAM\u00c9D\u00c9E E.

Orolet, Montreal, 1876.\n\nMr. Forget is a gentleman of considerable ability. His matured judgment, courtesy, impartiality, and business assiduity, make him a valuable public official. He is deservedly popular with all and much esteemed by our Northwest Council.\n\nR. B. Gordon, J.P., at present (July '87) Acting-Secretary to the Lieutenant-Governor, is a gentleman of high literary and official attainments. He is a native of the Emerald Isle. Is B.A. of Trinity College, Dublin; called to the Irish bar, 1867; engaged in commercial life London (Eng.) till '85. Arrived in Canada, Dec. '85; engaged on Northwest\nGovernment staff, Nov. '86. Is Advocate of the Territories and sole issuer of billiard licenses.\n\nBesides the possession of a sound, thorough education, indispensable for the proper discharge of his departmental duties, Mr. Gordon's courtesy, readiness, and experience cannot fail to further enhance his worth as a valued Government official.\n\nJames Brown, Secretary to the Board of Education, hails Renfrewshire, Scotland, as his native heath. Coming to Montreal in 1872 he engaged in commercial pursuits. Arrived in Regina, November '82, in connection with the business of J. J. Campbell & Co. Became Mr. Forget's assistant, Jan. '85, and the following month received present appointment. Has been organist of St. Paul's Church since commencement of English Church services here. Mr. Brown is an excellent official, and well qualified to fill the responsible position of Secretary to the Northwest Board of Education.\n\nLouis Octave Bourget, Accountant, is a native of Quebec City, and first arrived in Manitoba, 1873. Became shortly afterwards Deputy Sheriff; then given charge of the \"Dawson Road\" from Winnipeg to Lake of the Woods. Entered Winnipeg Post Office, 1875, and on the opening of the Government buildings here in '83, joined the staff of the Lieut.-Governor. Mr. Bourget is a gentleman of first-rate business capabilities.\n\nJ. C. Pope, son of a late highly esteemed Cabinet Minister, handles the Permit work with the ease of an older hand. His energy and assiduity cannot fail to gain him a further well-merited promotion.\n\nHenry Fisher, Librarian, arrived here from England in '84 and engaged extensively in farming operations about four miles N.W. of Regina. Mr. Fisher's lands and farm buildings are some of the finest in Assiniboia.\n\nThe remainder of the staff consist of Thomas Brown, Clerk in charge of Public Works, Charles Bethbridge, and\nReginald Deane. John MacLachlan is Office Boy and Messenger, and Edward Tennant, Caretaker.\n\nINDIAN DEPARTMENT, REGINA.\n\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs\u2014The Hon. Edgar Dewdney.\n\nAssistant Indian Commissioner\u2014Hayter Reed, Esqr.\n\nChief Clerk\u2014William McGirr, Esqr.\n\nThese officials are noticed elsewhere.\n\nTHOMAS PAGE WADSWORTH, Inspector of Indian Agencies, is a native of Weston, Ont., educated at Upper Canada College; engaged in merchant milling at Humberford, County of York, 1867; chosen by Sir Jno. Macdonald to select sites for the Instructors' farms in the North-West Territories, 1879; appointed Superintendent of Farms and Inspector of Indian Agencies, 1880. Mr. Wadsworth is an excellent Indian Official. He has seen the Indian advance from the wild savage, wearing only breech clout and blanket, to his present civilized condition, and few know better than he what a difficult task reclaiming the \"wild savage\" has been. If Inspector Wadsworth desires to become a famous author we would ask him to publish a work entitled \"Seven Years among the Indians.\"\n\nALEXANDER MCGIBBON, Inspector of Indian Agencies, was born near Montreal; engaged in farming pursuits till 1846, when he moved to Montreal and engaged in the grocery business. As a merchant he became eminently successful and popular. Was Transport and Supply officer at Calgary during recent rebellion. Appointed Inspector of Indian Agencies and Reserves, May, 1886. Major McGibbon has already done good work for the Department. He has undoubtedly, an eye to business, and will see that departmental affairs on our reserves are handled in a proper manner.\n\nJ. A. MACREA (Education Department), is a native of Scotland; came to Canada in '74, and to the N.W.T. in '77; School teacher at White Fish Lake in '79; appointed Indian\nAgent at Carleton in '83, where he remained till the breaking out of the rebellion of '84-5. Mr. Macrae is a gentleman of considerable ability, and has had quite a large experience in the Territories.\n\nF. H. Paget, (Accountant's Office) was born at Elora, County of Wellington, Ont. After spending some time in the Bank of Hamilton, Ont., he joined the Indian Commissioner's staff at Winnipeg in June, '82. Came to Regina, July '83. Mr. Paget is a typical official worker, and deservedly esteemed by the Departmental authorities.\n\nThe following gentlemen, in addition to the above, comprise the Indian Commissioner's staff at Regina:\u2014R. G. R. Eden, C. W. H. Sanders, H. L. Reynolds, J. W. Jowett, J. J. Campbell, A. W. L. Gompertz, A. E. Lake, H. A. Carruthers, D. Pierce, J. P. Wright, A. P. Vankoughnet and Lewis Herchmer.

Received commission for P.L.S. (Ont.) in 1879, and obtained D.L.S. in 1882. Employed by the Indian Department at Regina, 1883. As a draughtsman Mr. Ponton takes no second place. He is one of the popular young bachelors of Regina, and now may be said to be fairly wedded to the Great Northwest.\n\nREGINA CHURCHES, SCHOOLS, &c.\n\nTHE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH.\n\nIn early pioneer days the Roman Catholics held services in McCusker's Hall, and Bonneau's Store (Broad Street). The plans for the erection of the present church were approved of by His Grace Archbishop Tache in April, 1884,\nand immediately afterwards building commenced. The opening services took place amidst much pomp on Sunday, 3rd August following, the Archbishop officiating before an immense concourse of citizens and friends. A sacred concert was held in the evening, at which their honors Mr. and Mrs. Dewdney, and the elite of Regina, were present. A large sum was realized, which went towards the liquidation of the Church debt. Per\u00e8 Larche took charge in the spring of '84, and Per\u00e8 Graton arrived here on May 22nd, 1886.\n\nFather Graton is a native of St. Martin, Laval Co., P.Q., and was educated at St. Theresa College, Terrebonne Co. Was ordained at the Grand Seminary of Montreal in 1882. This young clergyman is eminently fitted for the labors of a pioneer missionary. Energetic, zealous and devoted, he has already done good work for the Roman Catholic churches of the west. Father Graton's pastorate will shortly be marked by the establishment of an important R.C. educational institute on the Regina town site.\n\nST. PAUL'S CHURCH (EPISCOPAL).\n\nIn the spring of '83 the parish of Regina first received the ministrations of a resident clergyman, the Rev. Alfred Osborne, of P. E. Island, assuming the charge. There was no \"church\" during the first few months, but soon steps were taken to raise necessary funds for the erection of a suitable building for Divine worship. A rectory was also built for the incumbent. The building which still remains as a temporary church is $50 \\times 24$, with Norman tower, $8 \\times 8$ and 33 feet high, erected during the present incumbent's (the Rev. H. H. Smith's) residence. The tower has been built to admit of the swinging of a mellow-toned bell, purchased from the Troy bell foundry, New York, in 1885. The bell weighs 417 lbs. and cost $115.\n\nThe Rev. H. Havelock Smith was born at Dalhousie, N.B. His education was begun at the grammar school of that town, and completed at St. Augustine's College, Canterbury, England. Was ordained deacon in St. John's Cathedral,\nWinnipeg, 1883, and priest by the Bishop of Qu'Appelle on 21st December, 1884.\n\nMr. Smith has had charge of the parish from December, 1883, to the present time, a period exceeding 3\u00bd years. He is a faithful pastor, of zealous and retiring habits, and many of our citizens heartily regret his departure to a new scene of devoted labors.\n\nTHE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH.\n\nThe first Presbyterian Church was erected in the Fall of '82. It is now the residence of the pastor, Rev. A. Urquhart. The rapid growth of Regina soon rendered this \"portable\" structure too small to hold the crowds of Presbyterian worshippers, and the larger area afforded by McNicol's Hall (now the upper portion of the Lansdowne Hotel) was brought into requisition. The first Presbyterian Clergyman was the Rev. J. W. Mitchell, M.A., then the Rev. Mr. Anderson, the present pastor first visiting Regina during the Summer of '83, but returning in the Summer of '84 to make a permanent stay.\n\nThe Rev. A. Urquhart is a native of Invergordon, Ross-shire, Scotland; came to County of Oxford, Ont., in 1858; graduated at Knox College, Toronto, and ordained, May, 1884. Mr. Urquhart found his first congregation at Regina. He is a gentlemen of exemplary Christian virtues, and is extremely popular, not only with his people here, but with all those with whom the Rev. gentleman becomes pleasantly acquainted. Mr. Urquhart is a clever theological scholar, and has more than once, since his arrival at Regina, wielded the pen with the ability of a master-hand.\n\nTHE METHODIST CHURCH.\n\nWhile Regina was yet a city of tents, the Methodist Church raised its christianizing head and preached to our earlier pioneers through the first minister, the Rev. W. J. Hewitt. This zealous clergyman's successor was the Rev. J. Pooley, who remained in charge till the Summer of 1886. During the Winter of '86 an invitation was extended to the\nRev. Geo. Daniel of Winnipeg to become pastor. This was accepted and sanctioned by Conference, and the Rev. Mr. Daniel preached his first sermon here on the first Sabbath of July, 1886. In September the Church was moved from the old site to its present position on Scarth St., and after undergoing extensive repairs and seating accommodation for a third more people was re-opened in the month of October.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Daniel has been in the ministry sixteen years. He was one of the youngest ministers of the Methodist Conference, having preached his first sermon after his fifteenth birthday. Was educated at Cobourg; spent three years in Sarnia district, one year at Fingal and four in Niagara district. Came to Winnipeg from London, Ont. In 1874, Mr. Daniel delivered his first public lecture on \"The Methodists of the 18th Century.\" Since then the Rev. gentleman has lectured with great success in the principal cities of the Dominion, and the United States. His Church is rapidly growing, being now scarcely large enough to accommodate the present congregation.\n\nMr. Daniel is an untiring worker in the illimitable fields of Christian Salvation. Active of mind, fluent of speech, and soundly educated, he is an honor to the Methodist Church of Canada. The Rev. gentleman is very popular here, and his interesting lectures are invariably delivered before crowded audiences.\n\n---\n\nREGINA SCHOOLS.\n\nPUBLIC SCHOOL.\n\nThe first public school was taught by a Mr. Shaffner in the Methodist Church then situated near where Mr. Robert Gordon's house now stands. Towards the teacher's salary the Northwest Government contributed $25 a month, the remainder being raised from local sources.\n\nMr. D. S. McCannell, an excellent man, and one of our earliest pioneers, succeeded Mr. Shaffner in April '84. He\nfirst taught in the Methodist Church, next in his own building on South Railway Street, and then in Scarth St. In October, '85 the school was moved to Bonneau's Hall, and in March, '86, the Town Hall was rented to the School Trustees by the Municipal Council. Miss Kerr, Mr. McCannel's assistant received her appointment in April, '86. The present assistants are Miss Kerr and Mrs. Mackintosh.\n\nThe daily average attendance is 115, out of 200 on rolls. The children's ages vary from five to seventeen years. Mr. McCannel is an able and successful teacher. He is a member of the Municipal Council.\n\nPRIVATE SCHOOL.\n\nAn excellent private school is conducted on Eleventh Avenue, under the control of an accomplished Irish lady, Miss McReynolds. The course of study comprises English, (full course,) French, Drawing, Music (instrumental and vocal), etc.\n\nMiss McReynolds, who arrived here from Belfast in October, 1885, is being worthily and deservedly patronised. She is organist of Knox Church.\n\nPUBLIC OFFICES.\n\nPOST OFFICE\u2014(Scarth Street.)\n\nRegina's primitive post-office consisted of a packing-box, and the postmaster was the obliging store or hotel-keeper who allowed said box to lay inside his tent door for a few days in turn. Everybody hustled round and got his mail as best he could. It might be in the packing box or around town somewhere. To Mr. E. B. Reed is due the honor of changing this state of things. One fine morning on the 23rd of September, 1882, he collected six fifty-cent pieces and forwarded to Inspector Dewe, Ottawa, through the Rev. Mr. Hewitt, the following ultimatum:\u2014\"Immediate mail service indispensable. Great outcry at evident injustice in the non-appointment of an office here. Many letters lost to\nowners constantly.\" The diction is certainly not that of an Addison or Macaulay, but nevertheless the telegram did good work, Station Agent Fowler was soon addressed by Mr. Burgess as \"Assistant Postmaster.\" After six months Mr. Fowler turned over his responsibilities to Mr. J. J. Campbell and the big tent. Mr. Irvine arrived in Dec. '82. After two weeks spent in Campbell's tent he moved to South Railway St., and the following April ('83) to Stobart's building on Victoria St., commonly known as \"The Old Post Office.\" In January, '86, Mr. Irvine took possession of the splendid new square brick structure on Scarth St.\n\nThe business transacted in the Regina post-office is considerable, and the Postmaster-General's report of it will compare favorably with that of an Ontario town of 8,000 inhabitants. Mr. Irvine, the postmaster, is an excellent official.\n\nDOMINION LANDS OFFICE.\n\n(Corner Broad and Victoria Streets.) This Office (for the Qu'Appelle District) was opened at Moosomin by Mr. J. McD. Gordon, Agent, and Mr. A. J. Fraser, Asst.-Agent, on July 14, 1882, in a large tent brought from Ottawa for the purpose, and on the 9th Dec. same year the office was moved to Qu'Appelle, (Troy) where it remained till the 27th of Jan. 1883, when it was moved to Regina and opened by Mr. Fraser on the 20th March 1883, (Mr. Gordon being in Ottawa.) In May, 1884, Mr. Gordon was appointed agent for the Calgary District, and Mr. W. H. Stevenson succeeded him at Regina.\n\nSince July '82, 9,488 land entries have been made and patents issued to 1,112. The annual Return for '85-6 shows a payment from all sources to the Dominion Government of $23,060.84.\n\nMessrs. Stevenson and Fraser are able and courteous officials. The present clerks are, John Dobbin (Fermanagh, Ireland,) and W. D. Scott, (Dundas, Co. Wentworth, Ont.)\n\nREGISTRY OFFICE.\n\n(Albert St.) This office was first opened for business in\nNov. '83, Dr. Jukes acting in the dual capacity of Registrar and Surgeon to the N.W.M. Police. The Doctor, finding it was too much for him to properly handle both offices, resigned the registrarship, the present Registrar, Major Montgomery, taking charge on 1st July, '84. The number of \"Instruments\" registered from opening of office to 31st Dec. '86 is 2,031. On 1st Jan. '87, the \"Torrens System\" came into operation, and under it 558 \"Instruments\" have been registered. Mr. Chas. James is one of our earliest pioneers. He opened this office with Dr. Jukes, and was subsequently sworn in Deputy-Registrar. Mr. A. T. Abbey is clerk. The amount of work done in this office is considerable, and of daily growth. The officials are obliging, and they thoroughly understand their business.\n\nCUSTOMS OFFICE.\n\n(Railway Station). This office opened Sept. 27th, 1883, Mr. C. J. Miles acting as sub-collector from this date till Nov. 1, '84, when Mr. Chas. Walsh took charge and acted till the 11th of May, '85. Mr. Fred. Champness succeeded Mr. Walsh and remained with us till the 30th Aug. '86, when he left to open a Customs Office at Lethbridge. Mr. R. J. Jones (a valuable and courteous official) the present officer, came here on 1st Septr., '86.\n\nThe total collections from Sept. 27, '83 to present date, amount to more than $10,500, quite a large figure for a prairie town only a few years old.\n\nBANKS.\n\nBANK OF MONTREAL.\n\n(Corner of Victoria and Lorne Streets.) This was the first chartered Bank to open up in the Territories. The branch was opened in 1882 with A. D. Braithwaite as Acting-Manager. The present genial and popular manager, Mr. Francis J. Hunter took charge after Mr. Braithwaite's one year of office. Mr. Hunter had been in the Bank of Montreal,\nMoncton, N.B., for a period of five years, and was the first regularly appointed Manager of that Bank (Montreal) in the Northwest Territories.\n\nThe Regina branch of the Bank of Montreal is a flourishing institution: an idea of the business done may be gathered from the fact that the Bank has about 300 deposit ledger accounts.\n\nThe Accountant is Mr. D. J. Torrance (nephew of Sir A. T. Galt) who arrived here in Septr. '85; T. H. R. James, Deposit Ledger-Keeper, and Mr. J. D. Irvine, Junior Clerk. Mr. James has recently been removed to the Winnipeg Branch. He is succeeded by Mr. Leonard Craig.\n\nLAFFERTY & SMITH'S (Private) BANK.\n\nThis Bank firm had been \"Hepburn, Irwin & Smith,\" bankers, of Emerson, who opened out a branch at Regina in January, '83. Hepburn and Irwin withdrew, and Mr. Smith carried on the business himself for a while. In Feb. '85, he took Dr. Lafferty into partnership.\n\nMr. H. LeJeune, one of our earliest pioneers and a first-class business man, manages \"Lafferty & Smith's\" Bank here. There are branches at Calgary, (F. G. Smith); Edmonton, (P. G. Gray) and Moosomin, (T. N. Christie.) The Bank is favorably known throughout the Northwest.\n\nPROFESSIONAL.\n\nLEGAL.\n\nD. L. SCOTT, Q.C.; W. C. HAMILTON, Advocates, practising as \"Scott & Hamilton\" (corner of South Railway and Scarth Streets.) These gentlemen are noticed in the \"Biographical Sketches,\" which see.\n\nJOHN SECORD, Advocate.\u2014Born at Niagara, 1850; educated at Brantford High School; first practised law at Tillsonburg, Ont.; moved to Regina, 1882; became Town Clerk on its incorporation and still holds this position; elected to\nNorthwest Council, 1885. Is a member of the Protestant Section, Territorial Board of Education.\n\nMr. Secord is a sound lawyer of straightforward and honorable principles, and in the enjoyment of an extensive practice. He is one of the ablest men at the Northwest Council Board, and is popular in the Regina District. Office, South Railway Street.\n\nT. C. Johnstone, Advocate.\u2014Is a native of Brampton, Ont. (1851); a graduate of Toronto Law School; called to the Bar 1876; arrived in Regina, 1882; Counsel for \"Connors\" in Queen vs. \"Connors\" case, and which was appealed to Privy Council of England; defended Louis Riel and other half-breed prisoners, 1885; is senior member of the firm of \"Johnstone & Forbes,\" one of the leading firms of lawyers in the Northwest.\n\nMr. Johnstone is an able and successful lawyer, and has made his mark in the Northwest. As counsel for the defence in criminal cases he is almost invariably successful. His practice is extensive and lucrative. Office, South Railway Street.\n\nF. F. Forbes, (Johnstone & Forbes,) is a native of Nova Scotia. Called to the Bar of that Province, 1882, and to the Manitoba Bar, 1885. First settled in Regina, 1885. Mr. Forbes is a promising lawyer. He is in charge of the Moosomin office of Johnstone & Forbes.\n\nWilliam Johnson, Advocate\u2014Born in the Co. of Halton, Ont. Is an M.A. and B.A. of Queen's College, Kingston; called to the Bar, 1867; practised profession in Ont. till 1883, when he moved to Regina. Was Returning Officer at election for incorporation of the Northwest capital.\n\nMr. Johnson has proven himself to be a scholarly member of the Bar. When admitted a member of the Law Society he passed in the senior or graduate class, and his name stood at the top of the list of passmen graduates. He enjoys a growing practice in Regina. Office, Broad Street.\nMEDICAL.\n\nDr. Dodd, M. R. C. S. L., Eng.\u2014(See \"Biographical Sketches.\")\n\nDr. R. B. Cotton, Surgeon, Accoucheur, etc., is a native of Wellington County, Ont., and a graduate of Toronto University. He arrived in Regina in December '82, taking up his quarters at the \"Royal\" and subsequently with Mr. Secord on South Railway St. He moved to his present residence on Broad St. in July, '83.\n\nDr. Cotton has been one of Regina's most popular as well as most useful citizens since the Northwest capital was a town of tents. Skilful in his profession, genial, kind-hearted and attentive, no wonder his practice is extensive\u2014but not more so, indeed, than the people of Regina and the Regina District would wish.\nLieut.-Governor Dewdney.\n\nThe Hon. Edgar Dewdney, C.E., was born in Devonshire, England, 1835. In early life he visited British Columbia, where he commenced the practice of his profession as Civil Engineer, and as such was employed on the Canadian Pacific Railway Survey. In March, 1864, he married Mrs. Jane Shaw, eldest daughter of Stratton Moir, Esqr., of Ceylon. Mr. Dewdney took an active part in public affairs, and sat for Kootenay in the Local Assembly of British Columbia, 1868-9. When the Province was admitted to Confederation he was returned to the Commons at the general election of 1872. For years he was a prominent British Columbia representative at Ottawa. He was re-elected at the general elections of 1874, and again by acclamation in 1878. When, in 1879, he received the appointment of Indian Commissioner, he resigned his seat in the House. Two years later, Dec. 3, 1881, Mr. Dewdney was appointed Lieut.-Governor of the Northwest Territories.\n\nPrevious to Mr. Dewdney's appointment as Indian Commissioner, the Indians received no Government assistance whatever. After visiting the Crees at Fort Walsh in May '79, His Honor looked up and assisted the destitute Indians of Fort McLeod. From here Mr. Dewdney traveled to Edmonton via Calgary, the latter then consisting only of a police station, a trading store run by I. G. Baker, & Co., and a H.B. Coy's post. \"Calgary,\" remarked the Indian Commissioner to Col. Irvine, \"is one day destined to become a large and wealthy city.\" And the prediction is being daily verified.\n\nIn the course of his extensive tour through the Territories His Honor did not fail to observe much that needed reform or total change. The policy of paying annuities to large masses of Indians as was then in vogue Mr. Dewdney saw was an element of danger to the Dominion, and he recommended as soon as possible and where practicable, the Indians be paid on their reserves, a recommendation which has been carried out with the best results.\nHISTORY OF REGINA.\n\nCOMMISSIONER HERCHIMER.\nIn the Summer of '83, on the completion of the Indian Offices at Regina, the Indian Commissioner and his staff moved to the Northwest Capital. As Lieut.-Gov., Mr. Dewdney first visited the town in the Spring of '83. At the railway station he was met by Mayor Scott and a deputation of citizens, who warmly welcomed His Honor to \"The Queen City of the Prairies.\"\n\nDuring Mr. Dewdney's terms as Lieut.-Governor and Indian Commissioner, his important services to the Dominion of Canada and particularly to the Northwest Territories can hardly be over-estimated. To a fine physique are blended a kindly manner and observant eye, which go so far towards perfecting the typical ruler. As Lieut.-Governor of the Territories, His Honor's name is associated with everything tending to advance the best interests of the Northwest. The more he is known, the better he is liked, and long after Mr. and Mrs. Dewdney have left Government House, their kindness, generosity and hospitality will remain in the generous hearts of a grateful and unprejudiced public.\n\n---\n\nLawrence Herchmer, Esq.,\n(Commissioner, N. W. M. Police.)\n\n*For Sketch, see under \"Northwest Mounted Police.\"*\nD. L. Scott, Q.C.,\n(First Mayor of Regina.)\n\nD. L. Scott, Esq., Q.C., is a native of Brampton, Ont., and was educated at the Brampton Grammar School. He was called to the bar of Ontario in 1870, and practised his profession at Orangeville until 1882, when he came to the Northwest and located at Regina. He ably represented the Crown in the prosecution of Louis Riel for treason-felony in 1865, and this year Mr. Scott was worthily honored with the distinctive \"Q.C.\" In the numerous State Trials (besides that of Riel) which arose out of the late rebellion, Mr. Scott acted as Crown prosecutor, and was appointed C.P. for Assiniboia in 1885. Mr. D. L. Scott is a sound, steady, honest lawyer, with ballast as well as brains, and can do his duty at all times as Crown Prosecutor without becoming ungentlemanly or vindictive. The firm of Scott & Hamilton enjoy extensive practice. Address: Regina, Assiniboia, N.W.T.\nD. MOWAT, ESQR.,\n(Present Mayor of Regina.)\n\nMr. Mowat is an Ottawa man, and had been engaged in the manufacture of clothing in that city previous to coming out west in the Spring of 1879. Mr. Mowat first located at Shoal Lake, Man., opening a branch at Fort Qu'Appelle in '80, and in '82 opened out in Regina. Mr. M. was the first merchant to open business on the newly-surveyed town-site. His tent was pitched where Mr. MacCaul's lumber yard now is. Goods were brought from Broadview with ponies and carts. Finding the town growing eastwards, Mr. Mowat moved to his present stand on Broad Street, and built a fine store at a cost of $2,000. Himself and brother (A. Mowat) are the firm of \"Mowat Bros.\" The House is well established, and \"Mowat Bros.\" do a capital trade in Regina and the surrounding districts. Mayor Mowat is a firm, honest, upright business man, and whether at the counter or on the civic chair, he plays his part with courtesy, sound sense, and credit.\nNicholas Flood Davin, Esqr., M.P.\n(Western Assiniboia.)\n\nMr. Davin's ancestry hold a respectable place in the history of Ireland's premier County, Tipperary, where the brilliant M.P. himself was born forty-four years ago. Early in life he showed a remarkable aptitude for literary pursuits, which largely developed themselves after a brilliant course of education at Queen's College, Cork. Called to the English Bar by the Hon. Sec. of the Middle Temple, Hilary Term, 1868, but his decided literary tastes and journalistic tendencies caused him to abandon the law for a long pull through the exciting storms of journalism. While acting as war-correspondent of the Irish Times during the Franco-German war, he was wounded at the siege of Montenedy. Sent by the Canadian Govt. in 1879 to Washington, U.S., to inquire into the System of Management of Industrial Schools; Sec. to the Commission of '84 to inquire into the Chinese Immigration Question; was a delegate to Ottawa in 1884, to represent the requirements of the Northwest before Dominion Government.\n\nMr. Davin is a Liberal-Conservative, and favors a broad and generous policy for developing and peopling the Northwest. His five years residence in the Territories has been productive of the happiest results, for, not only Regina, but the entire Northwest. He holds a controlling interest in the (Regina) \"Leader Printing Co'y.\" Was proprietor and editor of the Regina Leader from March '83 to March '87. As a gentleman of high literary attainments, ability and eloquence, Mr. Davin ranks with the foremost men in the Western World.\u2014Regina, N.W.T., Albany Club, Toronto.\nHAYTER REED, ESQR.\n\n(Assistant Indian Commissioner, Regina, N.W.T.)\n\nMr. Reed is a Toronto gentleman. Prior to his arrival in Winnipeg in '71 with Captain, now Lieut.-Col. Scott, Mr. Reed was Brigade Major of the Sixth Brigade Division at Cobourg. On the disbanding of the Wolseley expeditionary forces, he undertook the important mission of inaugurating the Land Guide System in Manitoba and the Territories. Mr. Reed afterwards accepted an offer to join the Indian Departmental service, and entered on his new duties as Indian Agent at Battleford, Carlton and Pitt. About the beginning of '83 Mr. Reed was taken to the head office at Winnipeg, and after Mr. Elliot Galt's resignation, filled the position of Asst. Indian Commissioner. Shortly afterwards this appointment was confirmed, Mr. Reed was appointed M. N. W. Council in '82, and was acting Governor in '83.\n\nMr. Hayter Reed is, unquestionably, an excellent Indian official. He has had a long experience, combined with a rough and smooth training in every branch of the service. Irresponsible carpers will be found to howl at Indian officials because the latter will not allow either the Dominion or the Dominion's wards to be robbed and trampled upon. Mr. Reed has acted the part of holding the balance fair between the white and red man, and he is sustained by the noblest of all supports, that he is doing his duty conscientiously and well.\nWILLIAM McGIRR, Esqr.\n(Chief Clerk, Indian Department, Regina, N.W.T.)\n\nMr. McGirr is a native of Russell Co., Ont. He was educated at the Metcalfe Grammar School, and matriculated in McGill University, Montreal. While here, Mr. McGirr resolved on entering a course of Arts, but afterwards abandoned the idea for a commercial life. His apprenticeship with Stephen, Tucker & Son, the then famous lumbermen of the Lower Ottawa River, proved eminently satisfactory, as did also his connection with James McLaren & Co. Mr. McGirr next occupied the responsible position of head bookkeeper to Jas. Hope & Co., wholesale stationers, Ottawa, and then entered a more distinguished arena\u2014the Law Department of the House of Commons. In the Fall of '81, Mr. McGirr entered the service of the Northwest Indian Department under the present Indian Commissioner, Lieut.-Gov. Dewdney. He belongs to a family of able and successful public servants, his brother, John McGirr, Esqr., is Clerk of Statistics, in the Indian Dept., Ottawa.\n\nMr. McGirr is, par excellence, a valuable public official of large experience and proven capability, possessing an assiduity modeled from successful business habits; of a temperament placid and courteous, and possessing to a high degree an endurance and resolvedness in the discharge of his duties, his services to the Indian Dept. can hardly be over-estimated. With every detail of Indian management and supervision he is thoroughly conversant, and there can be little doubt, that, in the ordinary course of events, Mr. McGirr is destined to fulfil a higher office in that public sphere to which, it may be said with much truth, he is now almost a sine qua non.\nJOHN C. NELSON, ESQ., D.L.S.\n(In charge of Indian Department Surveys, N.W.T.)\n\nMr. Nelson is a North of Ireland man, his native heath being in Fermanagh. On his arrival at Ottawa in 1862, he engaged on a timber limit survey with Mr. Forrest, P.L.S., and for several years subsequently became engaged in lumbering operations and exploratory surveys on the headwaters of the Ottawa River. Mr. Nelson studied surveying under Lindsay Russell, Esq., late Surveyor-General. In the Winter of '67 and '8 he became a student at the Montreal Infantry School, and obtained on leaving that institution, a first-class certificate. In 1874 Mr. Nelson received an appointment on the Peace River Survey of the N. W. Territories under Mr. Russell, and in 1878 was sent to the McLeod District to make topographical surveys and establish the boundaries of Indian Reserves in Treaty 7. On his return to Ottawa in 1880, he married Miss Conroy, second daughter of R. Conroy, Esq., Aylmer, P.Q., after which he went on an exploratory survey of the North Saskatchewan for the Department of the Interior. In 1881 Mr. Nelson accepted a position in the Indian Dept. as Surveyor of Indian Reserves, and in 1883 was placed by Order in Council in charge of Indian Reserve Surveys with headquarters at Regina.\n\nAttached to Mr. Nelson's handsome and substantial residence on the north bank of the Wascana, is a garden four acres in extent in which experiments in the raising of various kinds of roots and vegetables have proved very successful, showing the soil is capable of producing quantity as well as quality.\n\nMr. Nelson takes a high place in the rank of able and valued Indian officials. He is a man of unwearied industry in the careful discharge of his important duties; is possessed of a vast amount of valuable information on Northwest matters, especially on Indian affairs, with which he has had an experience of fifteen years, and has been very successful with those chiefs and tribes with whom his professional duties have brought him into contact. Mr. Nelson is widely and popularly known throughout the Territories, where his genial (if apparently brusque manner) and his sterling qualities are much appreciated.\nDr. Dodd, M.R.C.L.S., London, (Eng.)\n\nDr. Dodd was born in Durham, (Eng.) in 1830. He was educated at Durham University and became M.D. in 1854. In '49 he crossed from Buffalo to California through Colorado and the N. pass of the Rockies, and joined Gen. Walker in Central America. Returning to England he took his degree in 1854. As surgeon to the 23rd Fusiliers he went through the Crimean war, returning to England in 1856. Dr. Dodd enjoyed good practice in New York previous to his arrival in the Northwest. He had been for years senior surgeon to the First East York Artillery. Dr. Dodd holds a high rank in his profession and deservedly enjoys an extensive practice. Address: Regina, N.W.T.\nWILLIAM CAYLEY HAMILTON, ESQ.R.\n(Advocate, Regina, N.W.T.)\n\nMr. Hamilton hails from Goderich, Ont. He was educated at the Goderich Grammar School, and studied law under Judge J. S. Sinclair, Hamilton, and Messrs. Mulock, Tilt & Co., Toronto. Mr. Hamilton was called to the Ontario Bar in '81, to the Manitoba Bar in '82, and enrolled an advocate of the N.W. Territories in '86. He is one of our earliest pioneers, being here since August '82 in the practice of his profession. Has been member of the Town Council during '86-7. Mr. Hamilton is partner of Mr. D. L. Scott, Q.C., (Scott & Hamilton) and is highly respected by all enjoying the pleasure of his genial acquaintance.\nJOSEPH C. IRVINE, ESQ.\n(Postmaster, Regina, N.W.T.)\n\nMr. Irvine is a native of Lerwick, Scotland. He came to Canada in 1858. Was Warden of Leeds and Grenville during 1880. Had been member of the County Council and Reeve of the township of Edwardsburg, and subsequently Reeve of Carcinal.\n\nMr. Irvine has won in the Northwest that valued esteem which marked his career in the Eastern Provinces. As a citizen, his name is connected with everything tending to promote the interests of Regina, and as an experienced public official, he is sans peur et sans reproche.\nThe following brief sketch of his Lordship the Bishop of Qu'Appelle has been unavoidably omitted from the matter under \"Churches,\" &c.\n\nDIOCESE OF QU'APPELLE.\n\nThe Rt. A. J. R. ANSON, M.A., D.C.L.,\n(Bishop of Qu'Appelle)\n\nis son of the late, and brother of the present Earl of Lichfield. Educated at Eton and Christ Church; ordained priest, 1865; labored from 1866 to 1883 at St. Leonard's, Bilston, St. Michael's, Handsworth, Sedgeley and Woolwich. Became commissary to the Bishop of Rupert's Land 1883, and consecrated Bishop of Qu'Appelle June 24, 1884, in Lambeth Parish Church; arrived in Regina July 26, 1884. At first his lordship made Regina his headquarters, but very shortly afterwards his house was burnt down. Most of a valuable library was saved, but all the Bishop's outfit, valuable papers, &c., were destroyed. His lordship has made Qu'Appelle Station his residence.\n\nThe Episcopal Church in Canada has no more zealous, earnest, scholarly laborer in the missionary field than the present Bishop of Qu'Appelle. Within a few years his untiring exertions have been crowned with great success; and should Providence so ordain, the close of the 19th century will have seen the 90,000 square miles, comprising the diocese of Qu'Appelle, bear abundant testimony to the indefatigable energies, deep earnestness, and lordly munificence of Bishop Anson. Address: Qu'Appelle Station, Assiniboia, N.W.T.\n\"DOING\" THE CITY.\n\n(Specially written for Canny Folk.)\n\nA child's among you taking notes.\nAnd, faith, he'll print it.\u2014Burns.\n\nREGINA is a very handsomely laid out prairie town, as everybody knows who takes a spin over the C.P.R. or reads the papers. This is what the special correspondent of the greatest newspaper in the world\u2014the London (Eng.) Times\u2014says of our noble streets, squares, etc., \"The city is laid out on a scale of magnificence rivaling even the usual spread made by frontier towns.\" Precisely so. And now let us take a walk through the city and see the streets and our friends.\n\nHere we are on Broad Street at Sternhorn's. What a splendid display of jewelry, and so reasonable! Let us make a few purchases and move on. This is the Italian warehouse of the Mowat Bros. They do an immense grocery and butchering business on the quick return and small profit system. Just look at Mr. Black's bookstore. What a splendid assortment of books, newspapers, periodicals! Come and feast your eyes on choice literature. If you require some kidney cure or a good cigar, or anything under the sun mentioned in the pharmacopoeia, let us walk into Dawson, Bole & Co.'s. A fine firm, not afraid to advertise. Everybody buys their medicines. This is W. M. Williamson's famous City Fruit Store. Some British Columbia grapes, please? Any surplus funds on hand you may invest with L. T. F. Smith, Bankers, etc. Mr. LeFune is their agent here, and a first-rate one he is. The firm is solid as the Bank of England. Don't forget mentioning Mrs. Simpson's millinery establishment to the Mrs. when you get home. The ladies must be kept in the newest style, you know. This is where you can get a first-class boot, valise, or trunk. Everybody patronises McCarthy & Co. Let us have breakfast at the \"Windsor.\" Mrs. Doig keeps a first-\nclass hotel, as all travelers know. Now let us walk into Mr. Howson's \"Regina Stables.\" Look at those carriages! Can they be surpassed for style, strength and beauty? I should think not. When you want a good rig remember Howson's Livery Stable. Now, we shall visit our friend Mr. Geo. B. Rice's grocery establishment. Splendid goods at Eastern prices! Mrs. Rice, please fill this ten dollar order. Let us go round by Victoria Street. Just here on the left is Mr. Secord's, and next door is Dr. Cotton's. Mr. Secord is a sound, honest lawyer, and Dr. Cotton is a first-class member of the medical profession. Now we are on Rose Street, let us deliver this order to Mrs. Burbank, Regina's first-class milliner dress & mantle maker. This building on the corner of Broad and Victoria Streets is our Dominion Lands Office. Here we are at the Leader Office. The whole world reads the Leader. It is a splendid paper. That's the editor, Mr. Jno. J. Young, at the window, and I see the able and obliging foreman, Mr. Burbank, is making up one of his artistic jobs.\n\nThis square brick building is the Court-house where Louis David Riel was tried and sentenced to death for leading the late Saskatchewan rebellion, and the fine brick structure north on Seventh St., is the new post office, the handsomest west of Winnipeg.\n\nWe shall cash these cheques at the Bank of Montreal further on. Mr. Hunter, the Manager, is one of our most popular citizens. Let us turn off on Albert St. and walk to the reservoir. Here we are at Ed. White's temperance brewery. This ale is quite refreshing, Mr. White. Fill 'em up again! That fine building east on the north edge of the lake is the new gaol and lunatic asylum. There seems to be a dearth of prisoners and lunatics in the Northwest, at present. Splendid climate, etc.\n\nHome by Albert Street. Here we are again near the corner of Albert and South Railway. The small house to your right is the registry office; and the handsome building\nnext it is the registrar's (Major Montgomery's.) Right across the track you see the planing mills of L. R. Reilly, where first-class work is done at reasonable figures, and north-east on Dewdney street you will notice the spacious premises of the Regina Milling Company. Our drive north-westwards takes us past the Northwest Government and Indian Offices. Another mile and we come to the gubernatorial residence near which is the beautiful home of Mr. and Mrs. Nelson, while right across the Wascana are the police barracks, a fine sight in themselves, and well worth a two mile drive. Eastward again by the railway track. This is Seventh St., called after the able and popular manager of the Northwest Land Co. Here's the pretty little Methodist Church, near our City Hall; further south is the Presbyterian, while further east you can see the tapering spire of the handsomely renovated Roman Catholic Church, on the corner of Cornwall Street and Eleventh Avenue. This on your left is Mr. Jackson's well-patronized butcher-shop, in connection with which is a livery, feed, and sale stable. On your right is Mr. J. R. Marshall's carriage shop, where excellent work is done most reasonably. Now we are on South Railway Street. We cannot pass the West End Fruit Store without calling in. Mrs. Asprey's selection of fruit and confectionery cannot be excelled. Mr. Slinn bakes beautiful bread; Tinning and Hoskin's dry goods cannot be surpassed for beauty and wear, and Mr. T. E. Martin, another of our rich bachelors, keeps the big lumber-yard you see to your left. Mr. Martin is a fine man, and sells A 1 lumber. Another lumber merchant, is Mr. J. A. MacCaul; whose extensive business is largely patronized. Mr. MacCaul is also insurance agent, and sells hard and soft coal. Mr. J. D. Sibbald does a big business in the flour and feed line. He is also agricultural implement agent, and the man to buy from.\n\nWe may have lunch at the Lansdowne. Mr. Arnold's hotel is one of the finest west of Winnipeg. Next door is Mr. Sheppard's. Talk of fine goods, millinery, and ladies'\nThat window is enough to attract all the bolles in the Regina District.\n\nNow we see something. This is the wonderful book-store of P. Lamont. Here you can select from authors immortal, and invest in anything from a baby's rattle to a stencil plate. We must walk through Mr. R. B. Fergusson's furniture store. What a splendid and varied stock he has got, and finely cut down in price! You can leave your furniture order here? Why, of course. Mr. Hunt's tailoring establishment reminds me I must get a new suit of clothes. Mr. Hunt will make them too. He has no equal in his line of work. That fine butcher shop belongs to Mr. W. M. Child. Mr. Child kills first-class beef, pork, mutton, etc., and is doing a big trade. The Colonization Store is away up. It always had a good name, which i now better than ever. Let us get ten dollars worth of groceries, and save two-fifty. MacKay & Cruickshank deserve to be patronized. While we are so near \"1691,\" let us visit his workshop. There's a landscape scene a Turner might envy. Here are painted \"signs\" for Virden, Brandon, Swift Current, etc. \"1691\" takes no second place at the brush. That building on Hamilton Street is Mr. McCusker's blacksmith shop and store-rooms. Mr. McCusker has a splendid selection of wagons, buckboards, etc., on hand at reasonable figures. He is also agent for the famous Massey Manufacturing Co'y. Give him a call and save money.\n\nNow we are at the Regina Journal Office. The Journal is the only pronounced Liberal paper in the Territories. It gives good local news, and keen, crisp editorials. The editor and proprietor, Mr. Atkinson, is a clever man, and understands his business. Here we are at J. F. Mowat's, the best house west of Copenhagen, in which to buy ladies' and gents' boots, hats, caps, suits, ties, shirts, etc. People lose money every day by not calling to see Mr. J. F. Mowat. Now, then, all you who want good hardware\u2014the very best in the Territories\u2014go to Mr. J. W. Smith. He will give you better stoves, tinware, paints, oils, glass, lamp goods, etc., and at\nlower prices than any man in town. Just see for yourself. Let us wind up by having a game of pool at Smith Bros. I'll spot you five. These are splendid tables. Now for a fragrant Maduro E Hijo cigar\u2014those sold by Davis & Sons, Montreal\u2014then hurrah for supper at the Palmer! McCormick's first-class hotel is known all over the continent. Ha! I see some immigrants asking about lands. You are quite right, sir, 'tis best to buy from the Northwest Land Co'y. They hold splendid agricultural lands, and at very reasonable prices, generally in closely settled districts, and along the line of the C.P.R. Speak to Mr. Marsh, up street. And you, sir, want good land intersected by Boggy Creek, the Wascana or Qu'Appelle Rivers. Have your choice from the \"Land Corporation of Canada,\" and make your home in the beautiful Long Lake country. See Mr. G. R. Pugsley at once, and then send for your friends and relations. As they come from the old country to Regina via Winnipeg, caution the ladies not to leave Manitoba's capital without that gem of gems\u2014A Wanzer Sewing Machine. Jas. D. Conklin, 433 Main Street, will supply these articles, things of beauty and joy forever.\n\nNORTHWEST COUNCIL.\n\n(To aid the Lieutenant-Governor in the Administration of the Northwest Territories.)\n\nNOTE.\u2014Under 28 Vic., Cap. 49, Sec. 11, authority is given the Lieut.-Gov., upon proof that any district or portion of the Northwest Territories, not exceeding an area of 1,000 square miles, contains a population of not less than 1,000 inhabitants of adult age, exclusive of aliens or unenfranchised Indians, to proclaim such district or portion into an electoral district and entitled to elect a member of the Council. Pending legislation for a more complete system of Territorial representation, the premier, during the recent session of the Dominion Parliament, introduced and passed a bill to prolong the life of the Council now present constituted for another year. The following names are alphabetically arranged:\n\nBEDFORD, SPENCER ARGOYLE, (Dist. of Moosomin) is a native of Brighton, England. First returned to N.W.C., 16 Sept., '86. Mr. Bedford is an excellent man in every sense of the term. BOULBE, VISCOUNT, (Dist. of Macleod,)\noldest son of Lord Shannon, engaged in cattle ranching; returned to N.W.C., 15 Sept., '85. There is nothing nonsensically aristocratic about Lord Boyle. He can talk sound common sense, and mind his own business and that of his constituents, too. Breland, Pascal, (a nominated member) is a French Half-breed. Appointed by the Crown, 1877.\n\nCayley, H. S., (Dist. of Calgary,) is a son of the Hon.

R. service, 1854; paymaster, commissariat and transport service, 1885; returned to N.W.C., 14 Oct., '86, to fill vacancy caused by resignation of the sitting member, Mr. Jackson. Mr. Crawford is an able and popular representative. Cunningham, Samuel, (District of St. Albert,) is an Irish Half-breed (and a good one) born at Lake St. Ann's, Saskatchewan district; engaged in farming. Elected to the N.W.C., 15 Sept., 1885. Mr. Cunningham is a thoroughly representative man amongst the northern Half-breed population. Hughes, Owen Edward, (Dist. of Lorne) is Sheriff of Saskatchewan and a representative man of that District. Was educated in France, Germany, and England, and married to a daughter of Sheriff Inkster at Winnipeg, 1881. Returned to N.W.C., 15 Sept., '86. Irvine, Lieut.-Col. Archibald Gordon, born at Quebec, 1837; served in Red River Expedition, under Lord Wolseley, 1870; became Commissioner North-West Mounted Police, 1880; resigned, 1886. Appointed member of Council by Crown, 1882. Col. Irvine has done good service for the Dominion, and is much respected by a wide circle of Canadian friends. Jelly, David Finlay, (Dist. of Regina) a native of Co. Middlesex, Ont.; was public school teacher five years. Settled in the Northwest, 1882. First returned to N.W.C., 1885. Mr. Jelly is one of the most attentive members at the Council. He is a painstaking and popular representative. Lauder, Dr. John D., (Dist. of Calgary) is a native of Ireland. Came to\nNorthwest as a member of N.W.P. force; retired after some years, and is now a practicing physician. Returned to N.W.C., July 14, '86. Dr. Lauder is in the enjoyment of an extensive practice. He is assiduous in his attention to N.W. Council business. Marshallbay, Chas., (Dist. of Broadview,) a native of Somersetshire, (Eng.) Spent several years in the English Civil Service. Arrived in Whitewood, Ass., 1883. Is a member of the Protestant Section, Territorial Board of Education. Elected to N.W. Council, Sept., 1885. Mr. Marshallbay has been one of the hardest workers in the Council. He is chiefly interested in educational matters. The School Act of 1885 is principally of his compilation.\n\nReed, Hayter, appointed by Crown, April, 1882. (See \"Biographical Sketches.\") Ross, James Hamilton, (Dist. of Moose Jaw) born in London, Ont., 1856. Ran unsuccessfully for Western Assiniboia at general election of '87 against N. F. Davin; has been M.N.W.C. since 1883. Mr. Ross is a gentleman of great ability and popularity. Moose Jaw could not send a better man to Regina as a representative. Secord, John, (Dist. of Regina,) returned to N.W. Council, 15 Sept.; '85. (For brief Sketch of Mr. Secord, see under \"Legal Profession.\") Sutherland, W., (Qu'Appelle Dist.,) returned June, 1887, cler W. D. Porley, elected M.P. for Eastern Assiniboia. Turiff, John Gillanders, (Dist. of Moose Mountain) was born at Little Motis, P.Q. 1885. Is a merchant and notary public; first returned to N.W. Council, June, 1884, and re-elected July, 1886. Mr. Turiff is an able and fearless debater, and an influential member of the N.W. Council. Moose Mountain should feel proud of such a plucky representative. Wilson, Herbert Charles, M.D., (Dist. of Edmonton,) is a native of Picton, Ont.; enjoys an extensive practice at Edmonton, where he is worthily popular. Returned to N.W. Council, 15 Sept., 1885. Dr. Wilson is an excellent Councillor, and is sure to be always welcomed at Regina.\n\nTHE NORTHWEST JUDGES are no longer members of the N.W. Council. By the N.W.T.\nAct, \"no Judge of the Supreme Court shall hold any other office of emolument under the Government of Canada, &c.\" But under sec. 7 of the same Act, the Governor-in-Council may appoint any persons not exceeding six in number to aid the Lieut.-Governor in administering the laws of the Territories, and the Judges of the Supreme Court are so eligible, but without emolument. Three of those six persons are already appointed, or rather their original appointments are confirmed by the premier's Act of last session, viz.: Messrs. Hayter Reed, P. Breland and Col. Irvine. Three others can only be appointed, and these will probably be\n\nThe Hon. Mr. Justice Richardson, born in England, 1820; arrived in Canada 1831; called to the Bar 1847; Officer of Militia 1864-1875, when he retired with rank of Lieut.-Colonel. Appointed Stipendiary Magistrate and legal adviser to the Lieut.Gov. of N.W. Territories, 1876, and Judge of the Supreme Court of the Judicial District of Western Assiniboina, 1887. Presided at Riel trial, Aug., 1885. Mr. Justice Richardson is a Judge of great ability, honorable to all and impartial in the discharge of the duties. He is very much respected in the Territories.\n\nThe Hon. Mr. Justice MacLeod, born 1836. Served as Brigade-Major of Militia with Red River expedition (1870) and was mentioned in despatches of Sir Garnet (now Lord) Wolseley. Created C.M.G. for his services. Appointed Stipendiary Magistrate, 1880, Judge of the Supreme Court for Southern Alberta, 1887; and M. N. W. Council, 1886. Judge MacLeod is a man of sound legal judgment and fearless independence. He is one of the four ablest members of the N.W.C.\n\nThe Hon. Mr. Justice Rouleau, born at Isle Verte, County of Temiscouata, P.Q., 1840; Inspector of R. C. Schools for the counties of Ottawa and Pontiac some years; called to the bar, 1864; appointed Stipendiary Magistrate, N.W.T., 1883, and Judge of the Supreme Court of Northern Alberta, 1887.

His residence is at Calgary, where he has become very popular.\n\nThe Hon. Mr. Justice Wetmore is Judge of the Supreme Court for the Judicial District of Eastern Assiniboia, and the Hon. Mr. Justice Maguire for the Judicial District of Saskatchewan.\n\nREGINA MUNICIPAL COUNCIL.\n\nELECTED 4TH JAN., 1887.\n\nMayor, Daniel Mowat, re-elected by acclamation. Councillors\u2014Messrs. Andrew Martin, J. W. Smith, D. S. McCannel and W. C. Hamilton. John Secord, Town Clerk.

Forty members on roll. Meetings held monthly. The Brigade is the most efficient in the Territories.\n\nDOMINION CABINET MINISTERS, 1887.\n\nPresident of the Queen's Privy Council, Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs, and Prime Minister\u2014The Right Hon. Sir John A. Macdonald, G.C.B.\n\nMinister of Public Works\u2014Hon. Sir Hector L. Langevin, K.C.M.G., C.B.\nMinister of Railways and Canals\u2014Hon. John Henry Pope.\n\nMinister of Customs\u2014Hon.

Foster.\n\nNote.\u2014The salary of each Minister is fixed by statute at $7,000, the Minister holding the recognized position of Prime Minister to receive an additional $1,000. There are 73 Senators (appointed by the Crown) with a sessional allowance of $1,000 and mileage. There are 215 members in the House of Commons, with a sessional allowance of $1,000 and mileage. According to the theory of the English constitution, the House of Commons represents the whole population. The Speaker takes the chair at 3 p.m. daily. Twenty members, including the Speaker constitute a quorum.\n\nTHE GREAT NORTHWEST.\n\n\"Here the free spirit of mankind at length\nThrows its last fetters off, and who shall place\nA limit to the giant's unchained strength,\nOr curb his swiftness in the forward race?\"\n\nRegina, the \"Queen City\" of the Plains, and capital of the Canadian Northwest, is situated on the Wascana River, and the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway, 356 miles west of Winnipeg. It is in the centre of one of the largest blocks of wheat-growing land in the country, of a rich, dark, clay soil, and from its position in the heart of the great prairie region is destined to become the chief distributing point for that vast territory. Regina is the seat of government for the Territories, and contains the residence of the Lieutenant-Governor, the head-quarters of the Northwest Mounted Police, the Indian and other departmental offices, etc. Other public buildings comprise the Dominion Lands Office, Post Office, Registry and Customs Offices, etc. There are four\nhandsome Churches, viz: Roman Catholic, Church of England, Methodist and Presbyterian, two banks, public and private schools, roller and planing mills, etc. Here are also the offices of the Northwest Land Co. and the Land Corporation of Canada. The medical and legal professions are ably represented, and the citizens of Regina are inferior to none in the Dominion for society, civilization and learning.\n\nEarly, in '82 the town consisted of three large canvas tents in the open prairie beyond all railway communication and all settlement, but the advent of the steam-engine brought about a wondrous change\u2014wide streets, public buildings, splendid shops and stores, fine churches, schools, offices, etc.\n\nA branch railway runs north to Long Lake\u2014a magnificent sheet of water 65 miles long and from one to four wide, abounding in fish\u2014thence northwesterly towards Battleford, and in a northerly direction to Prince Albert, making Regina the junction point of these fertile regions of the North. Through the noble line of the Canadian Pacific we can look on one hand to the great Western Ocean, and on the other to the Mother Country. The Manitoba and South Western, opening up the Souris coal fields, will extend to a point almost due south of Regina, from whence a branch will run to connect with the Long Lake Railway. The Hudson Bay Railroad, with a line running from Grand Rapids to San Francisco, and passing through Regina will open our communication with Europe and enhance the value of Northwest products, and the great ranching interests of Southern Assiniboia and Alberta. No town on the continent has a brighter future before it than the Northwest capital.\n\nNow, as to the Canadian Northwest itself, we may join in saying with Senator Schultz's committee that nowhere has Nature showered blessings with a more bountiful hand. About 600,000 square miles of arable and pastural land seem prepared by the hand of God for the homes of civilized men. No rock or stump prevents the immediate cultivation of the soil, while beneath the surface are vast stores of fuel from former forests, side by side with extensive depos-\nits of iron ore. A region, which, situated as it is on the highest table land of the North American continent, enjoys equality of mean temperature, and freedom from many forms of epidemic and malarial disease, and immunity from cyclones, which have become from their frequency, the terror of the inhabitants of less elevated regions south of our border; navigable rivers traverse its length, and a great and growing system of railways carries its produce to the shores of the Atlantic and Pacific. It is a land of interest and profit to the tourist, the angler and the hunter. Great waterways drain it to the Pacific, to the Atlantic, to Hudson's Bay and the Arctic seas, in its bosom is found coal, gold, silver, iron, copper, salt, sulphur, petroleum and asphaltum, and most of the granites, marbles, clays, lime and sandstones which are of the constructive use, while on and near its surface, amber and some of the precious stones have been found. In fact, the great northwest region is a kingdom in extent, resources and undeveloped wealth, and fitted for the prosperous and happy homes of many millions of men of all races who will acknowledge the sway of the British Crown.\n\nAs we go to press crop reports from all parts of the Territories are of the most flattering kind;\n\n\"Hope, enchanting smiles, and waves her golden hair.\"\n\nNorthwest prospects look hopeful, the silver lining to the cloud appears, and the foundation of a great western nation is being solidly laid by the sturdy pioneers of a once Great Lone Land.\nDAWSON, BOLE & Co.\n\nWHOLESALE DRUGGISTS, ETC.\n\nPATENT MEDICINES, SUNDRIES,\nAND CIGARS,\n\nREGINA, N.W.T.\n\nCLIMAX KIDNEY CURE,\nTHE GREAT\nNorth-West Remedy!\nFOR ALL KINDS OF\nKIDNEY COMPLAINTS,\nLAME BACK, LUMBAGO, &c.\n\nREAD THE FOLLOWING:\n\nDear Sirs.\u2014The drought this summer evaporated the water of our plains, and\nthe rest got so much saturated with alkali that people of our colony, who were\nobliged to drink it, suffered with pain in the kidneys and liver.

JAMES D. CONKLING, Manager.\nDominion Lands Regulations\n\nUNDER the Dominion Lands Regulations all surveyed even-numbered sections, excepting 8 and 26, in Manitoba and the North-West Territories, which have not been homesteaded, reserved to provide wood lots for settlers, or otherwise disposed of or reserved, are to be held exclusively for homesteads and pre-omptions.\n\nHomesteads.\n\nHomesteads may be obtained upon payment of an Office Fee of Ten Dollars, subject to the following conditions as to the residence and cultivation:\n\nIn the \"Mile Belt Reserve,\" that is the even-numbered sections lying within one mile of the Main Line or Branches of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and which are not set apart for town sites or reserves made in connection with town sites, railway stations, mounted police posts, mining and other special purposes, the homesteader shall begin actual residence upon his homestead within six months from the date of entry, and shall reside upon and make the land his home for at least six months out of every twelve months for three years from the date of entry; and shall within the first year after the date of his homestead entry, break and prepare for crop ten acres of his homestead quarter-section; and shall within the second year crop the said ten acres, and break and prepare for crop fifteen acres additional, making twenty-five acres; and within the third year after the date of his homestead entry he shall crop the said twenty-five acres, and break and prepare for crop fifteen acres additional; so that within three years of the date of his homestead entry he shall have not less than twenty-five acres cropped, and fifteen acres additional broken and prepared for crop.\n\nLand, other than that included in Mile Belt, Town Site Reserves and Coal and Mineral Districts, may be homesteaded in either of the three following methods:\u2014\n1. The homesteader shall begin actual residence on his homestead and cultivation of a reasonable portion thereof within six months from date of entry, unless entry shall have been made on or after the 1st day of September. In which case residence need not commence until the 1st day of June following; and continue to live upon and cultivate the land for at least six months out of every twelve months for three years from date of homestead entry.\n\n2. The homesteader shall begin actual residence within a radius of two miles of his homestead, and continue to make his home within such radius for at least six months out of every twelve months for the three years next succeeding the date of homestead entry; and shall within the first year from date of entry break and prepare for crop ten acres of his homestead quarter-section; and shall within the second year crop the said ten acres, and break and prepare for crop fifteen acres additional, making twenty-five acres; and within the third year after the date of his homestead entry he shall crop the said twenty-five acres, and break and prepare for crop fifteen acres additional; so that within three years of the date of his homestead entry he shall have not less than twenty-five acres cropped; and shall have erected on the land a habitable house, in which he shall have lived during the three months next preceding his application for homestead patent.\n\n3. The homesteader shall commence the cultivation of his homestead within six months after the date of entry, or if the entry was obtained after the 1st day of September in any year, then before the 1st day of June following; shall within the first year break and prepare for crop not less than five acres of his homestead; shall within the second year crop the said five acres, and break and prepare for crop not less than ten acres in addition, making not less than fifteen acres in all; shall have erected a habitable house on the homestead before the expiration of the second year; and on or before the commencement of the third year shall have begun to reside in the said house; and shall have continued to reside therein and cultivate his homestead for not less than three years next prior the date of his application for patent.\n\nAt the time of making entry, the homesteader must declare to the Land Agent under which of the foregoing provisions he elects to hold his land; and on applying for patent must prove that he has made permanent improvements on his land, to the aggregate value of not less than one dollar and fifty cents per acre, (equal to about six shillings sterling.)\n\nIn the event of a homesteader desiring to secure his patent within a shorter period than the three years provided by law, he will be permitted to purchase his homestead on furnishing proof that he has resided on the land for at least twelve months subsequent to date of homestead entry.\n\nPRE-EMPTIONS.\n\nAny homesteader may at the same time as he makes his homestead entry, but not at a later date, should there be available land adjoining the homestead, enter an additional quarter-section as a pre-emption on payment of an office fee of ten dollars.\n\nThe pre-emption right entitles the homesteader to purchase the land so pre-empted, on becoming entitled to his homestead patent; but should the homesteader fail to fulfill the homestead conditions, or to pay for such pre-emption within six months after he becomes entitled to claim a patent for his homestead, he forfeits all claim to his pre-emption.\n\nThe price of pre-emptions, not included in Town Site Reserves, is two dollars and fifty cents per acre. Where land is north of the northerly limit of the land grant along the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and is not within twenty-four miles of any branch of that Railway, or twelve miles of any other railway, pre-emptions may be obtained for two dollars per acre.\n\nINFORMATION.\n\nFull information respecting the land, timber, coal and mineral laws, and copies of the Regulations, may be obtained upon application to the Secretary of the Department of the Interior, Ottawa, Ontario; the Commissioner of Dominion Lands, Winnipeg, Manitoba; or to any of the Dominion Lands Agents in Manitoba or the North-West Territories.\n\nA.
