I am greatly delighted with your query regarding the placing of the \"Red Cross Junior\" in each of the Indian schools in Canada. Some of the Indian schools in Ontario and Saskatchewan are enrolled in the Junior Red Cross, and are engaging in our scheme of inter-school correspondence with Indian schools which are enlisted under the Junior Red Cross in the United States. Some of these portfolios that have come from the United States to our Canadian Indian schools are of great interest.\n\nThe \"Red Cross Junior\" is 50\u00a2 a year or 5\u00a2 a copy. We should be greatly pleased indeed if you will place an order with us for an annual subscription to each of your schools.\n\nI am sending you a few sample copies of the \"Red Cross Junior\".\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJean E. Browne\n\nNational Director, Junior Red Cross, and Editor, \"Red Cross Junior\".\nOttawa, November 21, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant and I have noted, with satisfaction, that certain Indian schools in Ontario have already responded to the overtures of your Society.

I am preparing a list of residential and day schools, to which it is advisable to send the publication. You will be further advised.\n\nI should be grateful if you, in the meantime, would consider offering this Department a club rate. Our business would be very easily handled, considering that there would be but one letter covering the addresses, one letter relative to renewals per annum and one cheque in payment per annum.\n\nMy suggestion is that Indian schools generally each receive a copy of \"Red Cross Junior.\" You could send a list of the schools in each province to your provincial organisers. I shall send a circular letter to principals and teachers, explaining about the magazine and informing them that the Department would be glad to learn that they have enrolled with the provincial organisation. I shall also instruct our schools to requisition to the Department if additional copies of the magazine can be used to advantage.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier\n\nMiss Jean E.

The Chairman appreciates your proposal very much indeed, but asked me to point out to you that we are now selling the magazine at cost; in fact, last year we had a deficit of approximately $400.00. The best we can do, therefore, is to offer the rate of 40\u00a2 a year as a club rate for an order of 200 or more.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJean E.

As I have not requested Indian schools to inform me if they are joining the Provincial Red Cross organisation, I believe it would be better for you to get the name of a suitable Indian school from your Ontario headquarters. I know there are a few Indian schools in this province that have responded, and your Ontario organiser will be able to put you in touch with one of them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

The exhibits have been prepared entirely by members of the Junior Red Cross. It occurred to me that we should have here an exhibit of similar work, and it would be all the better if we could secure some samples, made by members of the Junior Red Cross. I think it better to send this request through you than through the provincial organizers, as you will know the schools that could be counted on to produce the best work. I should like to have the exhibit in duplicate so that one part could be sent here, and the other shipped...\nin Canada for explicit purposes.\n\nAs I shall be here until the middle of July, I shall be glad to hear from you in this connection.\n\nWith many thanks in advance,\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn E.

A Genevese citizen named Henry Dunant, who had been profoundly moved by the sufferings of the wounded whom he had seen on the battlefield of Solferino in June 1859, embarked on a campaign which led to the formation in 1863 of a Genevese Committee for the mitigation of the sufferings of wounded soldiers in time of war. This committee, which later took the name of Comit\u00e9 International de la Croix-Rouge, secured the signature by the principal States of the world to the Geneva Convention of 1864, which, revised in 1906, constitutes the basis of the code of civilized warfare to-day.\n\nThe primary purpose of the National Red Cross Societies which have arisen since 1864 in nearly all civilized countries has been, until 1919, to care for the sick, wounded and prisoners of armies and navies in times of war.\n\nThe Comit\u00e9 International de la Croix-Rouge has, since its foundation, continued to act as the custodian of the principles of the Red Cross and of the Geneva Convention. The International Red Cross Conferences, of which eleven have met in the past 60 years, are summoned by this Committee, and new Red Cross Societies receive official recognition from it.\nPeace Programme and Foundation of the League of Red Cross Societies.\n\nIn 1919, on the initiative of Mr. Henry P. Davison, Chairman of the War Council of the American Red Cross, the Red Cross Societies of the United States, France, Great Britain, Italy and Japan founded the League of Red Cross Societies. The purpose of the League, which today comprises fifty-one national Red Cross Societies, is to maintain in time of peace the enthusiasm and devotion displayed during the war by the National Red Cross Societies in the relief of human suffering, and to utilize this great force for the purposes stated as follows in Article 2 of the Articles of Association of the League:\n\n1. \"To encourage and promote in every country in the world the establishment and development of a duly authorized voluntary national Red Cross organization having as purposes the improvement of health, the prevention of disease and the mitigation of suffering throughout the world, and to secure the co-operation of such organizations for these purposes.\"\n\n2. \"To promote the welfare of mankind by furnishing a medium for bringing within the reach of all the peoples the benefits to be derived from present known facts and new contributions to science and medical knowledge and their application.\"\n\n3. \"To furnish a medium for co-ordinating relief work in case of great national or international calamities.\"\n\nThe present programme of the League.\n\nThe League had been in existence for three years, during which time experiments and investigations of every kind were pursued by its Secretariat, before the General Council, at its second meeting in March, 1922, was able to formulate a specific programme in conformity with these general purposes. The General Council then urged upon the National Red Cross Societies the development of their organization on the basis of popular membership in order to assure to the Red Cross the greatest possible influence, especially invited their attention to \"the pressing need which exists at the present time to create among all classes an intelligent demand for better health conditions and an increasing knowledge of the means of securing them\", and recommended to them \"the adoption of peacetime programmes aimed specially at meeting this need through the development, with the cooperation of the League Secretariat, of Popular Health Instruction, Public Health Nursing and Junior Red Cross Organization; the latter constituting in the judgment of the Council a specially valuable means of securing the education of the coming generation in health matters, as part of its general purpose of instilling into children at the most impressionable age the spirit of service which lies at the basis of the Red Cross ideal.\"\n\nThe resolutions adopted by the General Council at its third meeting, in April 1924, endorsed and amplified this programme, laying additional stress on the relief functions of the Red Cross, and on \"the great importance of the role which the Secretariat of the League can exercise in regard to international relief activities.\"\n\nSpecial attention was also drawn by the resolutions of this meeting to the desirability of action being undertaken by the Red Cross for the improvement of health conditions in the Merchant Marine. Red Cross Societies were also urged to continue and amplify their activities in the direction of training volunteer personnel for work in the health and social fields, and organizing the services of the personnel so trained, besides extending the facilities they offer to the public in the form of elementary courses in First Aid, Home Nursing, Personal Hygiene, etc.\n\nThe Organization of the League.\n\nThe control of the affairs of the League is vested in a General Council and a Board of Governors.\n\n*The Board of Governors, which is the competent authority to revise the Constitution of the League, elected May 1924 to defer until December 31, 1925, the coming into force of a number of amendments to the Articles of Association and By-laws, which have been approved by the Board. The general effect of these amendments is:\n(1) to place the control of the affairs of the League in the hands of the Board of Governors;\n(2) to enlarge the Board of Governors so as to comprise\nThe General Council meets at least once every two years, and consists of not more than five delegates of each National Red Cross Society belonging to the League. Each Red Cross Society's delegation has one vote at the General Council. All Red Cross Societies organized in accordance with the principles laid down by the Comit\u00e9 International de la Croix-Rouge and subscribing to the programme indicated in the League's statutes are eligible for membership in the League. The Board of Governors, which meets at least once every year, consists of representatives of each of the five founder Societies and ten nominees of Societies designated by the General Council, with the Director General and Secretary General of the League as ex-officio members. The Board elects its own Chairman. The Director General is the chief executive officer of the League, and is nominated by the Board of Governors, as is also the Secretary General. The Secretariat, of which the Director General is the head, comprises a staff of about 70 persons of various nationalities. Besides the Central Secretariat, which handles questions of information, liaison and organization, as well as the publications of the League, and the financial services and the Treasurer General, it includes specialists in Health, Nursing, Junior Red Cross and Relief. The Secretariat, which was originally established at Geneva, was transferred to Paris in 1922 by decision of the General Council, Paris affording a more convenient centre for extensive international activities.\n\nThe expenses of the activities of the Secretariat are met by contributions from National Red Cross Societies belonging to the League. Up to the present time, the greater part of these expenses has been borne by the American Red Cross, which in 1919 voted a substantial sum to constitute a guarantee fund during the first years of the League's existence. The other national Societies were first asked to contribute to the League's budget in 1922. During the year 1922-23 eighteen of these Societies voted contributions. For the year 1923-24 a total of 35 national Societies have contributed. Duly audited accounts are published annually.\n\nThe Activities of the Secretariat.\n\nThe prime function of the Secretariat lies in assisting National Red Cross Societies to develop their organization and membership, and the peacetime activities best calculated to improve health, prevent disease and mitigate suffering in their respective countries, by means not at variance with their several national traditions, and in co-operation so far as possible with governments and other agencies. As a natural corollary to the efforts made by the different National Red Crosses to further the coordination of national health and welfare activities in their respective countries, the League Secretariat seeks to secure greater co-ordination of these activities internationally. With this end in view, the Secretariat, besides constituting an instrument for facilitating joint action, when opportunity arises, on the part of the Red Cross Societies of different countries, has also established close co-operative relations with the other international organizations which are concerned with health and welfare problems. It works in close touch with the Office International d'Hygi\u00e8ne Publique in Paris, the Health Organization of the League of Nations and the Industrial Health Service of the International Labour Office, as well as with the Pan-American Sanitary Bureau and the Rockefeller Foundation. The Chairman of the International Council of Nurses is also Chairman of the Nursing Advisory Board of the League. The headquarters of the League affords accommodation and secretarial facilities to the International Unions against Tuberculosis and Venereal Disease, and to the provisional Committee of the nascent International Union against Cancer. The Secretariat is also in close touch with other organizations engaged in combating the evils of alcoholism and slum conditions, and in promoting mental hygiene.\n\nRelations with the Comit\u00e9 International de la Croix-Rouge in Geneva are maintained by the intermediary...\nof a Joint Council constituted in April, 1921*, in which members of the Committee and of the League's Secretariat meet periodically to consider questions which affect both bodies, and to ensure that any duplication of work shall be avoided. The Joint Council gives special attention to disasters the magnitude of which demands international relief measures.\n\nThe Secretariat maintains contact with National Red Cross Societies by means of correspondence and by constant visits of members of the League staff to National Societies and of officers of these Societies to the Secretariat of the League. In addition to the biennial meetings of the General Council, group conferences are periodically organized by the Secretariat to secure the exchange of views and experiences between representatives of National Societies with similar geographical, economic and social conditions and problems, and to facilitate their cooperation in meeting them.\n\nThe First Oriental Red Cross Conference brought together representatives of seven Red Cross Societies of the Far East at Bangkok in November 1922; the Eastern European Societies sent delegates to the Warsaw Conference in April 1923, and representatives of fifteen American societies met at Buenos Aires in November 1923.\n\nThe Secretariat publishes a monthly review entitled \"The World's Health\" in three editions, English, French and Spanish, with a total circulation of 15,000 copies, and also issues to member Societies and to such persons as are directly interested, a fortnightly Information Circular containing notes regarding its activities and those of member Societies, and detailed studies of specific problems based on Red Cross experience in different countries. With this circular are included popular articles on subjects connected with health and with other features of the Red Cross programme, which are available for reproduction by Red Cross Societies in their own publications or in the press. Articles published by the League Secretariat have been quoted or reproduced in other publications more than 8,000 times. The League also helps to subsidize a scientific monthly journal, entitled \"Matriaux pour l'Etude des Calamit\u00e9s,\" published by the Geographical Society of Geneva under the joint auspices of the League and the Comit\u00e9 International de la Croix-Rouge. This publication was started in the summer of 1924 with a view to stimulating interest and research in the scientific world as to the causes of natural disasters and their prevention.\n\nIn addition to its periodical publications, the Secretariat prepares and issues special pamphlets when requested to do so by any member Society, or when a specific need arises. Eight such pamphlets, some of them in nine languages, have so far appeared. It also prepares for National Red Cross Societies, whenever called upon to do so, special documentary studies regarding the organization of specific types of activities.\n\nA small library of standard works dealing with Red Cross questions, Public Health and related topics, has been collected in the offices of the Secretariat, which also maintains collections of health propaganda material of all kinds, cinematograph films (about 100), posters, pamphlets (2,200 in 17 different languages), etc.\n\nThese collections are at the disposal of National Red Cross Societies belonging to the League. From April 1922 to October 1924 the pamphlets sent out on request from these collections numbered over 7,500, in addition to 800 posters. League films have been lent for use in 26 different countries. The average number of films sent out in reply to requests is six each month. Each film comprises 5 to 10 reels.\n\nA permanent exhibition of Red Cross material has been assembled at the League headquarters for the benefit of visitors. Travelling exhibits for propaganda purposes and for loan to member Societies are prepared by the Secretariat as required.\n\nSome Results achieved by the League.\n\nThe League has been directly instrumental in securing the organization or recognition of National Red Cross Societies in twenty-two countries where no recognized independent Red Cross Societies previously existed. The membership of existing Societies has been increased and the Secretariat has been called upon at different times\n\n---\n\n* The Board of Governors decided in April 1924 to renew the 1921 agreement until December 31, 1925, and to abrogate it as from that date.\nto assist nearly all the Societies belonging to the League in formulating and launching their peacetime programme. Almost all National Red Cross Societies have now assumed responsibility for extensive activities in the Public Health field in time of peace. In almost every case these activities are of a markedly educational character, aimed at affording to the masses of the people the opportunity of appreciating the advantages of hygienic habits, at teaching them what hygiene is, and at preparing them to use the hygienic equipment already at their disposal and to demand more. The Health Division has given special attention to the question of mobile health propaganda units. One such unit, launched in Czecho-Slovakia in 1921, enabled 400 lectures to be given to a total of 160,000 persons. The demonstration led to the establishment of two such units on a permanent basis by the Czecho-Slovak Red Cross. A similar unit was set up in Poland in 1922 with no less satisfactory results. The Nursing Division of the Secretariat has organized an International Course in London for teachers of Public Health Nursing, at which 66 nurses from 34 different countries have been or are being trained in nursing and Public Health work; in at least six of these countries Public Health Nursing was previously unknown. This course, started in 1921, has been repeated every year since. A similar course in the administration of schools for nurses has been arranged to start in 1924. In three countries, Red Cross nursing schools have been organized or reorganized with the help of this Division.\n\nThe League Secretariat organized in 1921 three conferences at which experts from Eastern, Western, and Northern European countries respectively were enabled to exchange views and formulate principles of anti-venereal work. In 1923 the League was instrumental in securing the constitution of the Union Internationale contre le P\u00e9vil V\u00e9n\u00e9rien, and members of the League staff constitute the secretariat of this organization, as well as (since 1922) the secretariat of the International Union for Combating Tuberculosis. The development of Child Welfare work in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and particularly in Czecho-Slovakia and Roumania has been fostered by the League Secretariat, which has worked in close co-operation with the various agencies, both national and foreign, engaged in Child Welfare work throughout Eastern Europe.\n\nThirty-seven Red Cross Societies, with the assistance of the Junior Red Cross Division in the League's Secretariat, have organized, or are now organizing, Junior Sections for the purpose of \"inculcating in the school children of their several countries the ideal of peace and the practice of service, especially in relation to the care of their own health and that of others, the understanding and acceptance of human and civic responsibility, and the cultivation of a spirit of friendly helpfulness toward other children in all countries.\" Co-operative relations have been established with organizations interested in other children's movements.\n\nIn July 1923 the American Junior Red Cross incorporated its European office with the Junior Red Cross Division of the League Secretariat, the latter accepting responsibility for the administration of the funds allocated by American Juniors for the purpose of furthering Junior organization in European countries.\n\nIn the relief field, the League Secretariat has hitherto devoted its main efforts to assembling documentation with a view to the compilation of an international code of disaster relief problems and methods. The League played an important part in assisting the Red Cross Societies of Eastern Europe \u2014 notably the Polish, Czecho-Slovak and Serbo-Croato-Slovene Societies \u2014 to meet the epidemic crisis in 1920, when the possibility of a general extension of typhus fever throughout Europe gave rise to grave apprehensions; and, in connection with the Comit\u00e9 International de la Croix-Rouge, the League has assisted in co-ordinating the dispatch of relief to the victims of the famines in Russia in 1921 and in Germany and Albania in 1924, and of the earthquakes in Chili, Colombia, Costa-Rica, Ecuador, Japan and Persia in 1923. The Secretariat has also placed personnel at the disposal of the Mixed Commission for the exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey under the Treaty of Lausanne.\n\nThe Mobilization of the Red Cross for Peacetime Work.\n\nThe purposes of the League of Red Cross Societies are incontestably worth attaining. If the results already\nsecured appear to give reasonable promise of future success, the essential means to this end is the enrolment under the banner of the Red Cross of all those who want a healthier and a better world, and are prepared to devote time, money or service to this purpose. The power of the great educational movement, for which the League of Red Cross Societies is working, represents the sum total of the strength of National Red Cross Societies, and the strength of National Red Cross Societies depends upon the support which local Red Cross sections can command. A Red Cross Society can attain its maximum effectiveness only when every citizen is a member of the local section of his National Red Cross Society, taking an enlightened interest in the humanitarian purposes for which the Red Cross exists, and ready to give personal assistance in their realization.\n\nParis, August, 1924.\nPUBLICATIONS OF THE LEAGUE\n\nThe Secretary of the League publishes a Monthly Review in English, French and Spanish, of which The World's Health (subscription rate, 1 dollar or 5 shillings or 10 francs) is an edition.\n\nThe League of Red Cross Societies: Origin, Activities and Purpose.\n\nSecond Meeting of the General Council, April-May, 1921.

I should be glad to cooperate, if you will make suggestions as to what type of work would be suitable for the purpose. I am convinced that I can secure specimen pages from exercise books, etc., drawings, samples of knitting, embroidery work and beadwork. It may be possible to get some Indian basketry; but this is doubtful, as the children in schools are not trained to work with wood and grass. The older Indians only are proficient in this art.\n\nIf you will make definite suggestions as to the composition of the exhibit, I will take steps to collect something suitable in the early fall.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

This notice and taking in conjunction the complaints we have received from you from other schools, impelled us to make a further examination of the original list sent to this office by your Department. We notice that in all the addresses given us in your list the word \"Indian\" is left out and it may be possible that there are other day schools in the same locality as the Indian schools. We are writing to ask if the word \"Indian\" should appear in all the addresses. If so, it will be necessary for us to have new stencils cut for all of them.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDIRECTOR OF PUBLICITY & PUBLICATIONS.\n\nFD/HH\nOttawa, June 13, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to the supplying of the Red Cross Junior to Indian Schools.\n\nIt is regretted that our original list did not supply the word \"Indian\" for each school but we thought that you would infer this as this is the only class of school for which this Department is responsible.\n\nI believe it would be more satisfactory to have the word \"Indian\" appear in all the addresses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

You will remember that your Department subscribed for our junior magazine to be sent to each school. Besides this, seven of your schools have formally enrolled to \"play the health game\" as Auxiliaries of our Society. I have had reports from a number of the teachers who have had this experience. These go to show that it has been of much benefit to the pupils and community. I am enclosing these reports for your perusal. Please let us have them back before long as I wish to make further use of them.\n\nThis experience has led me to think that we might be able to help your schools in a larger way in association with our organization. If all your teachers could be induced to link their pupils with our Society (there is no charge for this whatever) we might be able to develop a sort of \"Indian School Pride\" amongst these isolated groups. Once a month for example, in connection with our News Letter which is sent with every magazine, we might have a special page dealing with the work in the Indian Schools. In addition we might be able to arrange for interchange of school portfolios and letters of friendship between the schools.\n\nShall be pleased to have your consideration of these matters and comments. There can be no doubt that the training of Indian children in good health habits would be of inestimable value.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDirector, Ontario Junior Red Cross.\nOttawa, July 17, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. McCready:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, relative to Junior Red Cross activity in Ontario Indian schools. I am delighted that there has been some response to this effort and it was with considerable interest that I examined the papers which you enclosed.\n\nA few months ago, when the Department arranged for some 70 Indian schools in Ontario to receive the \"Red Cross Junior,\" a circular letter was directed to the teachers. This letter read in part as follows:\n\n\"The Department trusts that you will make general use of the magazine and will utilize the \"Health Games\" which are promoted by the Red Cross Society through the medium of this publication.\n\n\"As beneficial results will, no doubt, follow the carrying out of the suggestions furnished monthly in this magazine, it is expected that you will give this new activity the attention it deserves. If additional copies can be used to advantage, you may forward a requisition to the Department. Further, any school that wishes may enroll with the provincial organization of the Red Cross Society.\"\n\nI feel that the incentive to organize a formal Red Cross Auxiliary in an Indian school should come from within the school itself, if we desire to have real and permanent usefulness. The movement is now in the missionary stage and I believe it would be better for it to develop as interest is awakened. Indian schools which have not formally enrolled will learn from time to time from your News Letter that other Indian schools are profiting by enrolment and, I hope, will correspond with you yourselves.\n\nI wish to thank you for your cooperation and for your interest and I trust that much good will result from your efforts. The papers which you directed to me are enclosed herewith.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nS. B. McCready, Esq., B.

Ferris,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThank you for your letter of July 17th. We cannot ascertain the reason why the magazines should not have reached their proper destination as we have checked our lists and find that the addresses are correct.\n\nWe shall be very glad to send to the teachers copies of magazines which are not out of print.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nEdith Richardson\n\nFor Major F.

JOHN\nHALIFAX\nCHARLOTTE-TOWN\n\nMr. Duncan Campbell Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Canadian Red Cross Society publishes a little magazine for children which has a subscription list of 12,000 copies monthly in Canada. There are about 95,000 Red Cross Juniors and the circulation of the magazine is wholly among these Juniors. The purpose of the magazine is to teach good health habits, ideals, consideration for others and good citizenship.\n\nOn a recent trip to British Columbia I met Mr. Graham, Deputy of Regina, of the Indian Department, and obtained quite a bit of general information about the Indians of the Plains and what progress was being made to improve their condition physically and mentally. Farther West I met Chief Buffalo Child Longlance of the Blood Indians who is now writing for the C.F.R. and who expects to write a history on the Indians of Canada. In British Columbia I met Bishop De Fencier who told me a little about some of the Coast Indians.\n\nAs a result I am anxious to have prepared an interesting article or two, for our Red Cross Junior, on the Indians of Canada and for this purpose I would like to have any reports that you have, that might contain information of value, and photographs of Indians. I would particularly like to obtain a really fine photograph, or reproduction of the painting, of one of the finest Indian Heads attainable for reproduction on the front page of the Red Cross Junior. As you know the Junior Red Cross has been organized among a number of Indian Schools and a considerable number of 'Red Cross Juniors' are being subscribed for by your department. Any material or photographs which you could let me have for this purpose would be greatly appreciated.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorge E. Haslett\nChairman of The Junior Red Cross\nOttawa, August 13, 1925.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 29th ultimo, relative to the preparation of articles on the Indians of Canada for the Red Cross Junior. I have asked the Superintendent of Indian Education to get together reports, a photograph or two and other material and to direct them to you in the near future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nGeorge C. Macmillan, Esq.,\nChairman,\nJunior Red Cross,\n410 Sherbourne St.,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, August 17, 1925.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am directed by the Deputy Superintendent General to refer further to your letter of the 29th ultimo, relative to the preparation of articles on the Indians of Canada for the Red Cross Junior. There is being directed to you, under separate cover, five annual reports of this Department. I wish to draw to your attention particularly the following articles:\n\n- The Indians and the War - page 14, 1918 report.\n- Agriculture - 8, 1919\n- The Indians and the War - 13, 1919\n- Enfranchisement - 31, 1919\n- The Indians of Canada - 7, 1920\n- Health supervision - 11, 1924\n- Census - 26, 1924\n\nI wish, also, to refer to the article on Education in the first part of each report and also to the annual summary of Indian Affairs in the various provinces. If there are any phases of our departmental activity or of Indian life that you particularly wish to feature, if you will correspond further with me I shall be glad to send you any writings that are available for your purposes.\n\nYou will find enclosed with the 1918 report two photographs, which, I hope, will be suitable for illustrations. One is that of an Indian woman and a young man, of Bella Coola, B.C. The other is a snap of the family of Chief Walking Buffalo, of the Stony Band, southern Alberta. I regret that the only photographs of Indian heads which would be suitable for a cover are framed and are hanging on our walls. It is possible that you could secure what you wish from one of the publishers of Toronto. I should be grateful if you would return to me the two photographs, as the Department has no copies and they are among the best of my collection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nGeorge G. Hamith, Esq.,\nChairman,\nJunior Red Cross,\n410 Sherbourne St.,\nToronto, Ont.\nMr. Russel T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI regret to find that I have not acknowledged your letter of August 17th, for the five annual reports of your Department on Indian Affairs. Thank you very much for your courtesy in sending me this material and also for the two photographs which I will see and returned to you when we have used them. Acting upon your suggestion I will attempt to obtain photographs of Indian Heads from the Ontario Museum in Toronto.\n\nAgain thanking you for your courtesy and for the trouble you have taken in giving me the necessary references.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorge G.

He would like you, if you would be so kind, to go over his article and verify, modify, or make additions to it in order that it may be strictly correct before appearing in our \"Red Cross Junior\".\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJean E.

On the third page the following statement is inadequate: \"The value of Indian property in Canada is $3,000,000\". Colonel Macmillan might say, if he wishes to, that the total estimated value of the real and personal property of Indians in Canada is $72,000,000, and they have on deposit with the Government, Trust Funds to the amount of $12,000,000. Their estimated total annual income is $10,300,000.\n\nThe article is quite readable and I am glad that Colonel Macmillan has gone to the trouble of preparing it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMiss Jean E. Browne,\nEditor, \"Red Cross Junior\",\nNational Office,\n410 Sherbourne St.,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, March 15, 1926.\n\nMadam:\n\nOfficial letter of December 16th, 1924, arranged with you for subscriptions to the \"Red Cross Junior\" for a number of the Indian Residential and Day Schools in Canada. This magazine has proved of great benefit to our Indian Schools and while we have not previously renewed subscriptions for the current calendar year, I trust that you have not discontinued sending them.\n\nI have revised the list of schools, which we desire to receive this magazine this year and I enclose the names and addresses of both the Indian Residential Schools and Indian Day Schools, also the number of subscriptions it is desired sent to each school. I will be pleased if you would correct your mailing list according to the enclosed list.\n\nThis list calls for a total of 386 subscriptions for the calendar year 1926. I presume that you will allow the same club rate as last year viz., 40 cents a subscription. Your account covering the cost of these subscriptions should be forwarded in duplicate to the office of The King's Printer, Ottawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Jean E. Browne,\nNational Director, Junior Red Cross,\n410 Sherbourne St.,\nToronto, Ont.\nMiss Jean E. Browne,\n410 Sherbourne St.,\nToronto 5, Ontario.\n\nDear Miss Browne:\n\nI have been intending for some time to write you with reference to the Indian Schools in New Brunswick. I understood from correspondence received from you last winter that Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Schools, was anxious to have these schools enrolled in Junior Red Cross, and that that was one of his main reasons for sending them the \"Red Cross Junior\".\n\nWith this idea in mind I wrote to each of these schools last Spring, and sent some of our New Brunswick literature. I had replies from two. The Teacher at Kingsclear, Miss Elizabeth Toner, was most interested, and wanted to start the branch at once. I sent her complete information, and as I was visiting Fredericton, my annual visit to the Normal School, at that time, I thought it worthwhile, as she seemed anxious for me to do so, to hire a taxi and drive out to her school. It cost six dollars, but I felt it was quite worthwhile as it meant the enrolling of that branch. I spent about an hour in her school, and found the children and teacher most interested. Miss Toner told me that their Parish Priest had been planning to come to the school, as he was very much interested. But he had a sick call and was unable to be present. I left with Miss Toner the Enrollment Form, and she promised to send it in the following week. It did not arrive so in June I wrote to her, and received this reply:\n\n\"I received your letter today, sorry to have put you to the inconvenience, but I will not be able to send in the Enrollment Form, until I hear from the Inspector, Reverend F.C Ryan, as he said he would take the matter up with Mr. Ferrier.\"\n\nThe other teacher who replied to my letter was Sister Mary Isidore of the Maliseet Reservation. Sister wrote me:\n\n\"Our fifty little Indian children are anxious to start a branch, and we would like to fill out the Enrollment Form as soon as possible. No doubt it will be rather difficult for them to keep all the rules, but with encouragement on our part, which we are very desirous to give, we hope to make this a success.\"\nI immediately sent her the literature and Enrollment Form, but did not hear from her again. I suppose the difficulty is the same as in the other case.\n\nThe question has been bothering me for some time, but has been neglected, as there seem to have been so many other teachers anxious to take up the work, who required immediate attention.\n\nNow that I have a chance to check up a few of these cases, I am wondering just what to do about these Indian Schools, in as much as they do not come under our Provincial School System. So I thought I would refer the matter to you.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n(sgd) Jessie I Lawson.\n\nSupervisor, Junior Red Cross.\nMarch 22nd, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nThis morning I received a letter from Miss Lawson, the Supervisor of Junior Red Cross for the Province of New Brunswick, regarding her attempts to enroll the pupils in Indian Schools in her province. There is evidently something hampering the organization of Junior Red Cross in these schools. I am therefore attaching a copy of her letter which I trust you will regard as confidential, as perhaps it may give you a clue as to why the organization has not gone ahead more rapidly in the Indian schools in the Eastern provinces.\n\nYou may notice that we are publishing something on the Indians in Canada in practically every number of the \"Red Cross Junior\".\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJean E. Browne\n\nDirector, Junior Red Cross.\nMarch 17th, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Perrier,\n\nThank you for your letter of March 16th giving me an up-to-date list of your Indian Schools to which you wish \"The Red Cross Junior\" sent for 1926. We will allow the same club rate as last year and I am asking our accountant to forward a bill in duplicate to the office of The King's Printer.\n\nYou would be interested in some of the articles sent in by members of the Junior Red Cross in Indian Schools in Alberta to make up part of a Canadian Junior Red Cross Exhibit for the Junior Red Cross Museum in Madrid, Spain. Some little time ago the Indian School at Edmonton sent in some little leather articles trimmed with bead-work, and yesterday we received a box from Alberta containing a miniature tepee, canoe, and several samples of bead-work contributed by the same Indian School. This we are also sending as part of our exhibit to Spain. Quite frequently, too, I get good reports of the Indian Juniors in Whysocomagh Indian School, Nova Scotia. In the April number of \"The Red Cross Junior\" we are having a rather special article on the Indians of Canada and as soon as it is out I shall send you a marked copy.\n\nThank you very much for your kind cooperation with the Junior Red Cross.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJean E. Brown\nDirector, Junior Red Cross.\nOttawa, March 26, 1926.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, enclosing a copy of communication from the Supervisor of the New Brunswick Junior Red Cross, concerning her efforts to enroll the pupils of Indian Schools. I am corresponding with our Inspector for the Province, and, if I am able to assist your organization in any way, I shall do so.\n\nI have been greatly delighted from time to time with the articles in your magazine concerning our wards. The Deputy Superintendent General and myself have been able to assist Mr. Heimsmith a little in connection with this activity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Jean E. Browne,\nNational Director,\nJunior Red Cross,\n410 Sherbourne St.,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, March 26, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that, for a year, the Department has supplied the Indian Day Schools in New Brunswick with the \"Red Cross Junior,\" a magazine issued monthly by the Canadian Red Cross Society. At the time we subscribed, I sent a circular letter to the teachers. A copy is enclosed. The magazine was sent, of course, to all Indian schools in Canada.\n\nI am writing now to ask if you recommend that some of our better schools enroll with the Provincial Organization. Miss Jessie I. Lawson, of St. John, is the supervisor of the Junior Red Cross for New Brunswick. I am not suggesting that the Department request each school to organize a formal Red Cross auxiliary, for I believe that the incentive to organize should come from within the school itself. The question to be decided is: should the Department encourage such linking up with a provincial organization? Please let me hear from you at your convenience.\n\nEncl.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. F. C. Ryan,\nInspector,\nIndian Schools,\nRed Bank, N. B.\n\nREQ. No. 16/126\n\nMAR 29 1926\n\nStaty. Office to Forward\nculprit, Carelessness, who alone is responsible for most of our fires? Why not bring before the bar of this court the guilty one who causes these defendants to work havoc throughout the land? Without his evil influences they would merely be servants of society.\n\nJudge: The court is of the opinion that the point is well taken. Carelessness should be the defendant here and not these prisoners. Where is Carelessness, Mr. Crown Attorney? This court is of the opinion that you have been remiss in your duty in overlooking the arch criminal who causes the majority of all fires. (Court Officer walks over and hands a note to the Crown Attorney.)\n\nCrown Attorney: Your Honor, I have just received word that he has been brought to court and is now in the ante-room.\n\nJudge: Have him brought in. (Carelessness represented by a pupil in patched, dilapidated clothing, is hustled in roughly by the court officer who leads him before the Judge, and into witness box where oath is administered.)\n\nClerk: Do you promise that the evidence you shall give the court and jury sworn under our Sovereign the King, and the prisoner at the bar, shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.\n\nCarelessness: I do.\n\nJudge: The testimony that has been given in this court in the case of The King versus Fire, has indicated that you, Carelessness, are the culprit who should have been brought before the bar of justice. You are charged with having caused the loss of thousands of lives and the destruction of millions of dollars' worth of property every year. What have you to say in defense?\n\nCarelessness: Nothing, Your Honor, except that I am an ingenuous half of the people. I begin with the youngest children and stay with them throughout their lives. I recognize danger, but I like to \"take a chance.\"\n\nJudge: That is an explanation, but not an excuse. I charge the Jury, on the evidence of all the other defendants and on his own admission, to find Carelessness guilty of the offence charged. (The Jury consult without leaving their seats; the Foreman rises.)\n\nForeman: We find you guilty, Your Honor.\n\nJudge: You heard the verdict. It is now my duty to sentence you in accordance with the dictates of justice. There can be no doubt as to your guilt. You have made it impossible for citizens and municipalities to live safely. You have killed thousands and devastated whole cities by your iniquity. You have filled the earth with misery. You have undermined character, lowered efficiency, and retarded progress. Incarceration is too good for such as you. Instead you shall be labelled so that all men shall know you and shun your presence. You shall be an exile\u2014a man without a country\u2014unless some nation is so short-sighted as to take you in and call you her own. I banish you forever. Officer, take him away. (Officer exits with prisoner.)\n\nJudge: The court is adjourned.\n\n(Curtain)\n\nNOT LIKELY\n\nStern School Inspector (demanding suddenly of timid class): \"Who wrote 'Hamlet'?\"\n\nVery Timid Boy: \"Please, sir, 'twasn't me.\"\n\n---\n\n**Winter Streams**\n\nNow the little rivers go  \nMuffled safely under snow,  \nAnd the winding meadow streams  \nMurmur in their wintry dreams,  \nWhile a tinkling music wells  \nFaintly from their icy bells,  \nTelling how their hearts are bold  \nThough the very sun be cold.\n\nAh, but wait until the rain  \nComes a-sighing once again,  \nSweeping softly from the sound  \nOver ridge and meadow ground!  \nThen the little streams will hear  \nApril smiling far and near\u2014  \nSlip their snowy bands and run  \nSparkling in the welcome sun.\n\nBy Bliss Carman.\n\n---\n\n**Grandmother Frog and the Crab**\n\nThere was once an old Frog and she had a daughter who went by the name of Cinderella Frog because she was very grey. When Spring came Mother Frog spun some green yarn, damped it and wound it up. Then she called the Crab to help her to thread the yarn on her loom in order to weave it into a coat. The Crab was in love with Cinderella, the daughter, and when it grew dark he mounted a grey horse, took a freshly baked cake under his arm and rode off. Mother Frog tried to ask the hand of her daughter. Mother Frog seized the shuttle and began to beat him with it, shrieking: \"Be off with you, he off! My daughter Cinderella is not for you. She sits the whole day beside me, threading pearls and gems for me.\" And as Mother Frog lifted up the shuttle, the yarn slipped out of her hands and got all unravelled.\n\nSo in Spring a green thread swims in the river like a weft. This is the broken loom of the Frog. And this is also why frogs are still go unclad up to this day. And the Crab, as the Frog pursued him, retired backwards defending himself till he could escape her. From that day the Crab began to go backwards and has walked that way ever since.\n\n\u2014from the Bulgarian Collection of Folklore and Literature.

This club raises enough money to support an Armenian boy in an orphanage in Jerusalem. The money is raised by selling Christmas cards. December is Golden Rule Day when they do not eat anything and give the money saved for their orphan. These Armenian boys are certainly setting an ideal of service for all Canadian Juniors.\nThe Indians of Canada\n\nAn Indian acting as guide to a fisherman. Courtesy of the Canadian Pacific Railways.\n\nWE ARE accustomed to think of the Indian as a semi-wild man roaming through the northern wilds of Canada. This is far from the truth. Of the 100,000 Indians now in Canada the majority live on Government reservations and are looked after as the children of the Government. Our Indians wear the same kind of clothing as we do, except on festive occasions, when they don the very picturesque costumes seen in the photograph of Stony Indian Chiefs of Alberta.\n\nMany of the Indians nowadays are farmers and ranchers. Their children are educated in schools just as the white children are, while orphaned Indian children are looked after in special residential schools. Last year nearly $2,000,000 was set aside by the Dominion Government for educational purposes among the Indians. Their health also is carefully safeguarded, and as a result, the Indians, who had been dying off from the ravages of tuberculosis and other diseases, are now increasing in numbers.\n\nThe Indian, as a rule, is a good citizen. He is patient, honest, and fairly industrious. During the war he showed his citizenship in a striking way. Over 35 per cent. of the male Indians of fighting age enlisted voluntarily in the Canadian army. This number is as large as it is possible to get from any population. The Indian had no obligation in this war, for, as a ward of the Government, he could not be called upon for active service. He rapidly became a smart, well disciplined, first class soldier. About 4,000 Indians volunteered for active service and a large number of these received decorations and medals for conspicuous bravery. They served mostly in fighting units, including the air force. One Indian travelled 3,000 miles to enlist, and many swamged from the shores of the Arctic Ocean to serve \"The Great White Mother.\" On their return many of them were given public receptions. Quite a number died from tuberculosis contracted as a result of service in the field.\n\nIn the Sagkeeng group of the city of Indians there were only eight able-bodied men and these all volunteered for service and went overseas. In other tribes over 50 per cent. volunteered, in some cases only two or three able-bodied men being left in each reserve. The pictures shown are Indians from one of the Plain Tribes. Most of these Plain Indians were great fighters. The Indian head...\nCanadian Order of Foresters, until he died, was a veritable business man. The Indian and others have shown that the Indian has great possibilities and capacity in all fields when he receives suitable training. J. J. Oke, an outstanding Iroquois preacher, who lives near Montreal, is a universal genius. He looks like a looking man with the dark brown eyes of his race. In truth, through civilization, the Indian is rapidly becoming very similar to the white man. As the years go by the Indian in Canada is being held in ever higher esteem by the white man.\n\nThe total estimated value of real and personal property of Indians in Canada is $72,000,000, and the Government has Trust Funds on deposit for them to the amount of $12,000,000. Their estimated total annual income is $10,300,000.\n\nThe Government is systematically improving conditions among the Indians by inducing them to build better houses and learn more about farming and raising cattle and improving their stock. Ploughing and seed competitions are held among the Indian tribes to stimulate improvements in their agricultural methods. Schools and churches are doing a great deal to steady the Indian and make him capable of competing with the white man. Though he is a ward of the Government, he can now become a regular citizen by agreeing to take his share of the prosperity that belongs to him and become independent like other citizens. Of course, it is difficult to induce some of the older Indians to give up all of their ancient customs. Many of them still act as guides and fishermen in the summer and as hunters in the winter time. But women and men are excellent at handicrafts such as bead work and basket weaving, and earn money in this way. For years it has been against the law to sell liquor to an Indian, one of the best regulations ever suggested for helping to make him a successful citizen.\n\nOn the Pacific Coast of British Columbia one often sees Indians, Japanese, and Chinese together, and it is sometimes difficult to tell which is which. Their features are so similar, one is almost forced to believe from their appearance alone that the Indians were derived from Asiatic stock which crossed the Pacific centuries ago. It has been recently proved that a large proportion of the Indians of Canada came originally from the heart of Asia and are related from the language point of view with the Tibetan Chinese races. Probably five thousand years or more ago they left the cradle of their race and came across the Behring Strait in migrant waves by way of Siberia and Alaska.\n\n\u2014G. G. Neumith.\n\nWhat Ten Juniors Can Do\n\nJuniors are energetic people. I am sure of that when Miss Lawson writes from New Brunswick that a new branch of 10 members in Aroostook Portage school starts off by selling 20 copies of the February number of the \"Red Cross Junior,\" and after selling them, send in for 20 more. This is excellent work for a small group.\nA Five Year Old Member\n\nA little Syrian girl living in Montreal has wanted to become a member of the Junior Red Cross for the last year. Recently she reached the tremendous age of five years old, and her birthday had been 99 cents out of money which had been given her for candy. This she gave to the Junior Red Cross, was made a member and received a pin. She can barely understand English, but her leader says that she has certainly grasped the idea of service for others.\n\nChristmas Carols Sung at Napadogan, N.B.\n\nWord has just reached us that the \"Sunbeams\" of Napadogan, N.B., sang the Christmas Carols, published in the \"Red Cross Junior,\" on Christmas Eve, and earned $3.50, which they sent in to the provincial office for \"The Crippled Children's Fund.\" We hope that next Christmas many Junior branches will sing Christmas Carols, and so revive this beautiful old English custom in Canada.\n\nA ROSE OF HOPE\n\nBy Ethel Blair Jordan\n\nI dug a little hole one day\nAnd put my troubles there;\nI left them all and went away,\nMy spirit free from care.\n\nLong after when I chanced to pass\nThe troubles I had doomed,\nI found that from the springing grass\nA rose of hope had bloomed.\n\n\u2014From \"American Junior Red Cross News.\"\n\"RED CROSS JUNIOR\"\n\nMAILING LIST - INDIAN SCHOOLS.\n\n| Address formerly given. | Latest address given. |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| The Teacher,            | The Teacher,          |\n| Sidney Bay Indian Day School, | Sidney Bay Ind.

Davy, Esq.,\nDirector of Publicity & Publications,\nThe Canadian Red Cross Society,\n410 Sherbourne St.,\nToronto, 5, Ont.\nRed Bank, North,ld Co.-N.B.\n\nApril 6th, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nYour letters to hand, contents well noted, I fail to see what good could come from the linking up of our Indian schools to Provincial organizations of any kind.\n\nAs for the \"Red Cross Junior,\" if I understand it rightly, it would be absurd to undertake to ask the Indian children to observe the health rules so required by this society, their living, housing, & financial condition render such impossible. Morally speaking, it would be very unwise to lay down a set of rules to INDIANS when we realize from the start that not one half of same could be respected.\n\nI feel that our Domestic Science is nothing other than the Junior Red Cross made workable for the Indians, and as we advance, we can draw nearer to perfection, year by year.\n\nOur Domestic teachers could form both a \"JUNIOR & Senior League\" with further rules workable to the INDIAN, and The Dept. could offer prizes for the ones who would better observe said regulations on each Reserve, then a general one to the Reserve that (ONLY) would in general lead, -The Dept. being the Judge.\n\nI feel I have covered the case in question in justice to both the Dept. & Indians, so I trust my letter will not be considered merely as a DIPLOMATIC ONE.\n\nI trust the boys are all well in the Dept. Do remember me to all, and in a special way to Mr. Scott. I will be in Ottawa about the 15th or 16th of June. I will be on my way to Chicago. I will visit the Indian schools a little earlier this TERM.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Schools for N.B.\nOttawa, April 9, 1926.\n\nMadam:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 22nd ultimo, concerning the linking up of the Indian Day Schools in New Brunswick with the Provincial Junior Red Cross, I have now to inform you that I believe there is some local difficulty. It is possible that the organization in New Brunswick will not show progress for the time being.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Jean E. Browne,\nNational Director,\nJunior Red Cross,\n410 Sherbourne St.,\nToronto, Ont.\nThe Indian Schools have done better Junior Red Cross work than ever before, and are intensely interested in the movement. About 75% of these schools are organized. They have elected officers and committees, and are carrying on just in the same way as the other Juniors. Their teachers report an improvement in discipline and hygiene, and a really remarkable interest in the Service part of the Programme. You may remember that at Xmas we made a special appeal for work baskets for the bigger girls at the Laurentian Sanitarium at Ste Agathe. These baskets were supplied by the Indian Juniors, who made really beautiful sweet hay baskets, some of them equipped with thimble cases etc. They also made quantities of little baskets for candles, and some extraordinarily nice scrap-books. In addition some groups sent in the dearest little birch-bark canoes, which I am holding to go with portfolios, and they have done some very nice knitting and sewing.\n\nThe following is an extract from a letter recently received from Miss M. MacNulty of St. Regis, the Director of the largest group:\n\n\"We are wondering if we can do anything for Valentine Day for you. I would be pleased to carry out suggestions, if you send us materials for...\"\nsuch. We can sell two dozen magazines for February. We are greatly interested in your Hygiene Lessons. I find this is a very easy way to teach this subject to my pupils.\"\nNATIONAL OFFICE,\n419 SHERBOURNE ST.,\nTORONTO, CANADA January 21st, 1927.\n\nWith Provincial Divisions at:\nVANCOUVER\nCALGARY\nREGINA\nWINNIPEG\nTORONTO\nMONTREAL\nST. JOHN\nHALIFAX\nCHARLOTTE TOWN\n\nMr. Ferrier,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nTo-day I had the enclosed card returned to me from Manitoba. What do you wish to have done in connection with the magazine which you ordered for this school and which apparently has been permanently closed?\n\nI am enclosing a copy of an excerpt that I received today from Mrs. Shaw our Junior Red Cross Supervisor in the Province of Quebec. I think this will be of interest to you.\n\nThank you very much for your co-operation in the past, and hoping that you will renew your subscriptions to the magazine for the present year, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJean E. Browne\n\nJEB/EC.\nEditor \"Canadian Red Cross Junior\".\nOttawa, January 27, 1927.\n\nDear Miss Browne:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant and am enclosing a list of Indian schools with the number of subscriptions for each for the current calendar year. A requisition has been forwarded to the King's Printer in this connection and he will correspond with you.\n\nThe card which you enclosed had reference to the St. Peter's North Indian Day School, and, if you will examine the list which was forwarded to you under cover of March 15th, last, you will see that it was omitted, as the school was closed in 1925. You might have your Circulation Department go through the enclosed list with some care, as there have been additions and some subtractions. We have also changed the number of subscriptions for a school in one or two cases.\n\nI was very pleased to learn that the Junior Red Cross activity in Quebec has been encouraging.\n\nEnclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSept. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Jean E.

Ferrier]\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nGeorge G. Macmillan, Esq.,\nGore, Macmillan & Storrie,\nConfederation Life Bldg.,\nToronto, Ont.\nNelson House, Man.\nMarch 14th, 1928.\n\nMrs. E.M. Speechly,\nSupt. Junior Red Cross,\nManitoba Division,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Mrs. Speechly,\n\nBoth the children and I were pleased to receive your letter of the twenty-third of February along with the roll of posters and the package of buttons. We were sworn in members of the Junior Red Cross yesterday. You may be sure the ceremony was fitting. Today the children proudly display their buttons. The wall posters attract considerable attention. I have told them of the charter to follow and they impatiently await its arrival.\n\nNo doubt you will be curious to know the attending ceremony of swearing in. I thought it would add dignity and impressiveness to the proceedings if a little ritual was introduced. We spent yesterday morning doing that.\n\nFirst, I told them that \"the lady in Winnipeg\" had answered their letter. This answer I read to them, having it interpreted by the one pupil who understands enough English to do that. The children were highly pleased.\n\nThen, I explained to them each poster, showing how it was possible for them to follow each health rule; except maybe the matter of vegetables in winter. (The Indians are too nomadic to be gardeners. Though they plant spring seed, there are but few who attend to their gardens in summer and they become choked with weeds.) When you show them results by producing yourself they say: \"Oh, but you're different! You're a white man, not an Indian!\"\n\nWith the concluding explanation of the posters the children became members of the Junior Red Cross. This was done as follows:\n\nEach child came to my desk and with his hand on the Bible said:\n\n\"I promise to keep my body clean.\"\n\"I promise to keep my mind clean.\"\n\"I promise to help others and be kind to animals.\"\n\nWith these promises he was declared a member and a button presented.\nThe remainder of the morning was spent in enlarging on the three promises, especially the latter, for they are inclined to be thoughtless of others and regard animals as if without feeling. Numerous stories and illustrations to show how more fun and benefit could be had from spying on a squirrel to learn some of his habits than shooting him with a bow and arrow; how it would be more jolly to watch a nest of eggs hatch and later feed the young, than it would be to dash the little eggs against some tree; how it would be pleasanter to build houses for the song birds, than to use them as targets.\n\nVarious penalties were decided on should any promises be broken.\n\nWe shall anticipate the arrival of the charter, for the framing of which we all send you our hearty thanks. We have already decided on the place where we shall hang it; beside the flag.\n\nFor all your trouble I am most grateful and feel sure a deal of good will come of it.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Signed) Charles Clay.\nNorth Temiskaming,\nApril 11 - 1928.\n\nMrs. Ruth B. Shaw,\n45 Belmont Park,\nMontreal, Que.\n\nDear Mrs. Shaw,\n\nThis letter will seem like an echo from the grave, it is so long since we corresponded, but, just now, I have a particular object in writing.\n\nLast winter the Minawasis undertook to send a box of home-made valentines to the Children's Hospital for Valentine Day, but, storms and bad roads prevented us from getting material from Liskeard so they abandoned the idea when their supply of material was exhausted. They intended keeping the few they made till next Valentine Day, but I am leaving in June, so we decided to forward the valentines. I think there are sufficient for a small group of sick children. I am donating the moccasins and the enclosed is for a fruit treat for the little group.\n\nWe have had an awful winter, but, the little Minawasis have been comparatively healthy. I assure you the Red Cross literature has benefitted them immensely. They knew enough now to take sanitary precautions - something they never did before.\n\nI have no idea where I shall be next year. I intend to rest till next spring and then take a Summer School if I can get one from the Indian Department.\n\nI thank you for all you have done for the Indian children that have been in my charge for the last six years and appreciate very much the weight you have taken off my shoulders. Before we established the Red Cross Club, it was nothing unusual for me to have to send the children home to wash and comb - now they understand better.\n\nWishing you every success,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours gratefully,\n\n(signed) Catherine Henan.\nSUPPLEMENTARY REPORT ON\nINDIAN SCHOOLS\nORGANIZED FOR JUNIOR RED CROSS.\n\nThere are 14 Indian Schools in Canada enrolled as Junior Red Cross branches with a membership of 350.\n\n\"The Canadian Red Cross Junior\" goes to every Indian School in Canada. It is subscribed for by Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Schools, Indian Department, Ottawa.\n\nAccording to reports received from the provincial divisions, the Indian Juniors are quite active, in selling Christmas Seals, Junior Magazines, home-made candy and sweet-hay baskets. Their contributions to the Crippled Children's fund through these activities have been considerable. A few have prepared portfolios for exchange and others have made excellent exhibit material, such as sweet-hay baskets, bead-work, miniature canoes and wigwams. These examples of native art have been much appreciated wherever they have been exhibited.\n\nUndoubtedly through Junior Red Cross good health habits have been established. The wife of one of the Principals of an Indian residential school in Alberta writes, \"Until we tried Junior Red Cross we could not get the children to see any reason why they should clean their teeth and brush their hair, etc., but now we have no more trouble for each child now feels his own responsibility in these things.\n\nThe following is a letter written by Mr. MacDonald, Principal of the Whycocomagh Indian School, Nova Scotia,\nwhich explains what Junior Red Cross has done for his school.\n\nReceived your letter of the 13th and I now gladly attempt to give you the required information. I am pleased to state that I consider the organization and existence of this branch of the Junior Red Cross, a real success, not only to my pupils; but likewise to the parents and home folks who are quick to practise the health habits of the children, when same are seen to be of advantage.\n\nAs may be generally and truthfully understood, the rules of sanitation were not strictly followed and carried out by the Indians, living as they did in wigwams and feasting on whatever the day's hunting and fishing produced. The error was partly through ignorance and partly through neglect and even to this day, some are inclined to consider the ancient manner of living superior to the present; but these ideas are rapidly diminishing and without doubt the Junior Red Cross is partly responsible.\n\nMany of our \"white people\" consider the average Indian to be dull and stupid and devoid of the intelligence of modern life. This idea is false and without foundation or proof. The Indian of today cannot be compared with the\nIndian of yesterday and to consider them inferior to the average human being is nothing short of degraded ignorance. They have their classes good and bad, like the \"white people\" and in many cases they could teach us lessons well worth learning. The noted Canadian writer, George Pearson, while describing a visit to Nova Scotia, for the Regina Leader, commented on the snow white and clean appearance of the homes of the Whyocomagh Indians.\n\nThe school children are examined by the Health Nurse of the Indian Department, quarterly, and are always found as followers of the \"Rules of the Health Game\" and from experience, I can truthfully say that the Junior Red Cross is largely responsible for the existing conditions.\n\nA visit to our school will convince anyone that the Red Cross badge is not worn for its ornamental purpose only. You may not find the pupils attired in the height of fashion and the clothing of the rich; but you will find, boys and girls with clean bodies, who had a good breakfast of porridge and milk, who walked knee-deep in snow while coming to school after sleeping last night by open windows. In\nbringing these conditions about, I give due and just credit to the Junior Red Cross and feel confident that in after school days, the health habits will not be forgotten.\"\nMay 3rd, 1928.\n\nMr. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Schools,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nIt occurred to me that you might be interested in a report which I made on the organization of Junior Red Cross in the Indian Schools of Canada. This was given at our recent National Committee Meeting of Junior Red Cross, and elicited a good deal of interest on the part of the members of the committee.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJean E. Browne\n\nDirector, Junior Red Cross.\n\nJEB/ECR.\nEnlo.\nOttawa, May 14, 1928.\n\nDear Miss Browne:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with enclosures for which I am very grateful. It is indeed gratifying to learn that 14 Indian schools have enrolled in your organization of their own volition. Many thanks for the interest you take in our wards.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Jean H.

The teachers, Miss MacNulty and Miss Morris, knew I was arriving some time during the week but owing to the fact that there are only two mails per week only had a two hours' notice of my arrival. Parents were hastily invited and quite a few men and women turned up at the meeting. I was met at the door by the teachers and six Juniors, the Guard of Honour to receive the Flag. There are 50 Juniors in the school, all in Grades 1 to 5. The meeting was presided over by the President, a small boy, who called the meeting to order, announced the various items and asked for all the different reports from each officer and committee head in a most businesslike manner. These reports were clearly and well read. The Secretary called the roll and each Junior answered promptly and distinctly. I ought to say that the meeting opened with the Juniors' Pledge, and closed with God Save the King and the presentation to me of some pretty Indian baskets. The programme, besides the above reports on magazine sale, committees, etc., consisted of my talk and presentation, a vote of thanks from Miss MacNulty, and the Tooth-Brush Song, sung with vim and action. Altogether the meeting was a great success, the Juniors...\"\nvery bright and interested, quite thrilled with the exhibit of work done by other Juniors which I took out to show them. The school was so nice too, with flowers on the window sills.\"\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJEB/JMac\n\nDirector, Junior Red Cross.\nOttawa, September 27, 1928.\n\nDear Miss Browne:\n\nI wish to acknowledge, with thanks, your letter of the 26th instant, quoting from the report of one of your workers, concerning the St. Regis Indian Bay School Red Cross meeting. The Department is very glad to learn that there is so successful an organization there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Jean E.

I could have mailed to me, free of cost, monthly copies of \"The Canadian Junior Red Cross.\"\n\nIf this is correct, will you kindly forward me monthly one dozen copies of the above magazine, this number being sufficient for the older pupils of the above school. If unable to forward me one dozen copies monthly, will you please send a single copy for my own use as I find this magazine most helpful in teaching Health lessons and in inculcating\nHealth habits in the Indian scholars under my care.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nIsabel Moore\n(teacher)\n**REQUISITION FOR SCHOOL MATERIAL**\n\n*Date: April 29th, 1929.*\n\n*For: Indian Residential & Day Schools Agency*\n\n**NOTE:** Teachers should secure from the Department of Education, of the Province in which the Indian School is located, a list of the text books authorized for use in the white schools.

No. 7865\nWA-KA-TAS-KAT JUNIORS HAVE ACTIVE YEAR\n\nThe Wa-Ka-Tas-Kat Juniors of the Indian Day School at St. Regis, Quebec, have had a very active year as their excellent annual report shows.\n\nThe teacher says that the gains in personal hygiene have been remarkable, especially in regard to cleanliness and ventilation. She reports that all the members look much healthier since they have established the habit of sleeping with open windows. Their idea of cleanliness has extended to their school and school grounds.\n\nOn Arbor Day, the Wa-Ka-Tas-Kat Juniors cleaned their school and school grounds, sprayed the wet spots with oil to keep down the mosquitoes, sowed flower seeds in garden plots and window boxes and planted 25 maple trees.\n\nThis year they have started a campaign for protecting birds' nests and nestlings.\n\nThe teacher writes that the Juniors were devoted to their sick this year. They took all sorts of dainties to the shut-ins in the village and sent boxes to hospital patients in Cornwall. They made themselves very helpful in homes where the mothers were sick by minding children, washing dishes, sweeping, carrying water and wood, making fires and other useful jobs.\n\nIn addition to all these splendid acts of service, these Indian Juniors made 30 Halloween cards, 12 Christmas cards,\n30 Easter cards, 6 scarves and 29 wash-cloths which they sent to the office of the Quebec Division to be distributed to children in hospitals.\n\nWe shall have to find out what the Indian word \"Wa-Ka-Tay-Kat\" means. I am sure it must be something very fine.\nJune 14, 1929.\n\nRussell T. Perrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Perrier:\n\nI expect you hear through your own official reports of the excellent work being done in Junior Red Cross in many of the Indian Schools in Canada.

If you are in Ottawa at present and would care to see it, I should be very glad to send it on to you and then perhaps you would be good enough to mail it to England from there within a few days after its arrival. I shall wait to hear whether you want me to send it to you or not. I have prepared a little news article about it to run in \"The Canadian Red Cross Junior,\" and I have asked Mrs. Anne Anderson Perry, a journalist here, to come in this afternoon to see it, as I know she will get a good story from it.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJean E.

Please forward it to Miss Margaret Cross, Director of British Junior Red Cross, 19 Berkeley St., London, W.l., England. I am notifying Miss Cross that it is being sent so that she will be expecting it.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJean E. Browne\n\nDirector, Junior Red Cross.\nMr. Ferrier, Superintendent,\nIndian Dept.,\nOttawa, Pnt.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nA few weeks ago I paid visits to the Indian Schools of St. Regis and was so pleased with conditions I found there. At the Day School in St. Regis itself, Miss MacNulty had arranged a public meeting at which Mr. McGibbon and some of the parents were present. I know that you would have been delighted if you had seen the President of our Junior Red Cross Group, a boy of 12, conducting the meeting, speaking English clearly and well. The other children responding easily. The children themselves were clean, attentive and I thought very alert. I feel that Miss MacNulty and Miss Morris are to be congratulated on some very good work, and thought I would like to tell you how pleased I am with the way in which they are using our Junior Red Cross programme.\n\nWishing you the compliments of the season,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupervisor, Quebec Junior Red Cross.\n\nRBS.\nJune 19th, 1930.\n\nDear Doctor O'Connor,\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant and wish to thank you for the Junior Red Cross literature and posters which have also been received.\n\nI enclose a list of Nurses, Field Matrons and Dispensers in the service of this Department, to whom the Manual for Home Nursing Classes and Junior Red Cross literature would be of value. I shall be grateful if, in the absence of Miss Browne, you will arrange through her Secretary to have this literature supplied from your various provincial offices.\n\nI may say that the Department has subscribed for the Junior Red Cross Magazine for several years, and it is sent to all the schools, but only a small percentage have organized. I think it would encourage the teachers to do so if they receive sample sets of literature early in September. A list of Indian schools was forwarded to Miss Browne, December 21st, 1929, to be used as a mailing list for the magazine. Literature should be addressed to \"The Teacher\" of each school, in accordance with this list.\n\nI should also like to have three additional sets of the publications sent to Ottawa, to be given to Nurses who are being assigned for duty in Ontario at an early date.\n\nDr. L. O'Connor,\nDirector, Junior Red Cross,\n410 Sherbourne St.,\nToronto 5, Ont.\nI wish to thank you for your offer to supply, free of charge, the Manual for Home Nursing Classes to the Nurses on the staff of this Department. As I have enclosed additional lists of about 100 Field Matrons and Dispensers, will you please submit account in duplicate covering the cost of forwarding copies of the Manual to these employees.\n\nThanking you for your interest and co-operation, I am\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.F.

PERKINS:\n\nRe encouraging organization of Junior Red Cross in Indian schools.\n\nWhen in Toronto I arranged with Miss Jean Brown, Dominion Organizer for the Red Cross Society, to have copies of the \"Teacher's Guide\", \"Teacher's Manual for Home Nursing Classes\", and organization forms re Junior Red Cross, sent early in September to teachers of Indian schools on the list provided by your Branch in December, 1927, and checked in June last.\n\nMay I suggest that a letter be sent to each of the teachers, mentioning that for some years you have provided for their use in the schools the Junior Red Cross Magazine; that you have been pleased to observe that some of the schools have organized Junior Red Cross; and that you would be glad to see more of the teachers show in this way their interest in promoting health habits and in arranging for a definite health program in the schools.\n\nKathleen Moodie\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, October 1, 1930.\n\nTo Principals and Teachers\nof Indian Schools:\n\nFor some time, the Department has supplied \"The Canadian Red Cross Junior\" for the use of your school. I am hopeful that this magazine has been of value to you in your work. Lately, copies of \"The Teacher's Guide,\" \"Teacher's Manual for Home Nursing Classes\" and organization forms in connection with Junior Red Cross work have been forwarded. Some Indian schools have found this activity both interesting and instructive, and the Department is satisfied you would find it worth while to organize a branch in your school.\n\n[Signature]\nRussell T. Ferrier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter no. 150-39 I wish to state that we have an organized branch of the junior Red Cross in our school.\n\nEvery member appreciates the \"Canadian Red Cross Junior\", so kindly supplied by the Department.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nHora H.

This year the membership roll is not as large as in former years, but the activities are more comprehensive speaking. We use the Red Cross Junior for curative work on many subjects.

Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter (No. 150-39 Oct. 3.) I would like you to know that I have found \"The Canadian Red Cross Junior\" extremely interesting and useful. I have used some of the health plays and other material a lot. You spoke of having sent copies of \"The Teacher's Guide,\" \"Teacher's Manual for Home Nursing Classes\" and organization forms in connection with Junior Red Cross work. As yet I have received none of these. Whether the fault is in the mail service or in those who sometimes bring me my mail from town I do not know.\n\nIn regard to your suggestion that a branch be organized in my school I may say I have thought about more than once but it entails a good deal extra planning and work which I am not sure that I\ncan manage. It is possible I may try it.\n\nIn the meantime I realize the need for health training & have obtained health songs & other material from the Public Health Department in Winnipeg and am trying in various ways to inculcate health habits.\n\nIn connection with this might I suggest that \"Yourself & Your House Wonderful\" by Guerber, would be a very valuable book to place in the libraries of all the Indian schools. I purchased a copy of it myself this summer & am finding it splendid for hygiene lessons.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJennie Wright.\nUnited Church School,\nBerens River,\nMan.\nOct. 21st. 1930.\n\nRussell F.

Harris, Sturgeon Valley, did not receive the Junior Red Cross material sent some time ago. On receipt of this information I sent a second supply and wrote to Miss Harris expressing regret.\n\n\"The literature has not been returned, but the letter has come to hand marked \"not called for\" and \"cannot locate.\" Sturgeon Valley is a post office out in the country, the nearest railway point being Shellbrook, and one might suppose that Miss Harris would be sufficiently well-known in the vicinity to receive the mail. I hope, however, that the literature will be more fortunate than the letter.\"\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJMac\n\nFor Director, Junior Red Cross.\nHartley Bay Indian Day School\n\nNovember 24th, 1930\n\nSecretaries, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your inquiry as to the possibility of forming a branch of the Junior Red Cross League in connection with the above school, I have come to the conclusion that it is not yet ripe enough to undertake such a movement. The children are mostly young and primitive in their knowledge of spoken English, and their parents suffer from chronic unemployment when anything but their own immediate wants are concerned. The executors are not always of a type to form leaders in a matter of this kind, whether male or female. On the whole, after much careful thought, I think it will be best just to go on promoting a deeper interest in the Junior Red Cross League till the time favours something more advanced.\n\nI myself shall be glad to give a regular donation to the funds of the league, with the hopes of actual sympathy.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJames Oliver,\nTeacher.\nNo. 1 School, French Portage\nLake of the Woods,\nKenora, Ontario\nJan. 14/31\n\nSir,\n\nUpon enrolling in the Junior Red Cross, we were incorrectly chartered as an Indian School. While all the pupils attending this school are either Indians or half-breeds, nevertheless, the school is under the Provincial Dept. of Education and is not an Indian School.\n\nI shall notify Junior Red Cross headquarters to correct our charter. Meanwhile, wished to notify your branch that it was merely an error on the part of Junior Red Cross officials, which credited the Indian Dept. with another school in this work.\n\nSincerely,\n\n(Mrs) Harriette Macpherson\nOttawa, January 20, 1931.\n\nDear Mrs. Macpherson:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, and I note the error that has been made by the Junior Red Cross, concerning the designation of your school. So you still have the odd Indian pupil. I hope you are enjoying your new work and that your mother is able to be with you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

Ferrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nEver since you first subscribed to the magazine we have been charging you less than the cost of publication and postage. The Society willingly assumed the deficit because of our desire to co-operate with you in getting the magazine into all the Indian Schools. The time has now come when we find it necessary to scrutinise every cent of our expenditures, and I am sorry to say that I have been instructed to tell you that we must charge you our regular rate of fifty cents for each annual subscription. This does no more than meet the costs of paper, printing and postage.\n\nI feel confident that, understanding the facts, this will not make any difference in your order.\n\nWith kindest wishes for a Happy New Year, I remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJean E. Brown\n\nEditor, \"The Canadian Red Cross Junior.\"\nOttawa, January 18th, 1932.\n\nDear Miss Browne,\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the subscriptions to the \"Canadian Red Cross Junior\" and it is noted that you find it necessary to change the regular rate of fifty cents (50\u00a2) for each annual subscription. A requisition for the number of copies required is going forward to the Government Stationery Office from whom you will receive payment in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Jean E. Browne,\nNational Director,\nJunior Red Cross,\n410 Sherbourne St.,\nToronto 5, Ont.\nW. J. GREENING, B.A., B.PAED.\nInspector of Separate Schools\nFort Arthur\nOntario\n\n438 Robinson Street,\nFort Arthur, Ontario.\nFebruary 21, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nDuring the past couple of months we have had with us at the Head of the Lakes a Doctor Loretto O'Connor, the Directress of the Junior Red Cross for Ontario.\n\nShe came to Fort Arthur with a letter from the Department of Education to the Public School Inspector, but, after she had been around all his schools, I took care to have her go around the separate schools also.\n\nAnd, it seemed to me, anything worth while talking about to ordinary school children in regard to health should be doubly worth while in the case of our Indian children; I therefore asked the Doctor to visit Fort William Residential School, and we would have gone to Mission Bay had it been possible to secure a conveyance capable of manoeuvring the roads.\n\nThe Doctor was due to speak to the pupils in the public school at Nipigon last Thursday. I suggested, half jokingly, that she might like to go out to Lake Helen, never supposing that she would face the long tramp through the snow. But, to my surprise, she jumped at the idea. And so we went up last Wednesday, taking Miss Leusch unexpectedly, since she would never have thought anyone would go over that trail without having to, especially with the chilling wind that was blowing. However the Doctor tramped it out, (I believe she got her ship frozen) and spoke to the children. In the afternoon the mothers came down and she spoke to them also.\n\nI had invited Dr. O'Connor to make the rounds of the schools on Manitoulin Island in the spring, something she seemed quite keen on doing, but, before taking her around, I thought I had better find out what your views were on the matter.\n\nIf, as I suspect, you would be only too glad to have her interest herself in the Indian Schools as well as in the Provincial ones, I thought of making this suggestion. She visits all the Normal schools regularly, and will soon be visiting Ottawa Normal. Would you like to drop her a line inviting her to call upon you when she is in Ottawa? I have sounded her out, and I feel confident that there are few things that she would appreciate more. And, as all her expenses are borne by the Red Cross, there will be no expense incurred by your Department.\n\nThe Doctor's address is: c/o Junior Red Cross,\nOntario Division.\n410 Sherbourne Street.\nToronto, 5.\n\nWith kindest regards & Yours sincerely,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq., M.A.\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 24, 1932.\n\nDear Miss Browne:\n\nSeparate School Inspector Greening, who visits the Roman Catholic Indian Day Schools in Ontario, writes that Dr. Lorette O'Connor has been good enough to take an interest in some of the schools in the Fort William district. He has invited her to visit our rather interesting work on Manitoulin Island. I have written him, asking that he express this Department's appreciation for her help, and I thought that I should write to you, thanking you again for your cooperation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Jean E. Browne,\nNational Director,\nJunior Red Cross,\n410 Sherbourne St.,\nToronto 5, Ont.\nOttawa, February 24, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Greening:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to Dr. L. O'Connor, Ontario Director of the Junior Red Cross. You may inform her that the Department is very grateful for her interest and that we will be glad to have her visit the schools on Manitoulin Island in the spring.\n\nI am writing to Miss Jean E. Browne, National Director, thanking her for the cooperation of Dr. O'Connor. This, of course, will reach Dr. O'Connor's desk. I may say that we cooperate with the Junior Red Cross generally, and, as you know, we have the magazine in all our schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. J. Greening, Esq., B.A., B.Ped.,\nInspector of Separate Schools,\n456 Robinson Street,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nFebruary 25, 1932.\n\nRussell T.

As I think you know, I have asked all our provincial divisions to take a special interest in the Indian schools, and I am glad that Dr. O'Connor's co-operation in the Fort William district meets with your approval.\n\nIf it ever occurs to you that our organization may be of service to you in other ways or in other places, please do not hesitate to let me know.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJean E. Browne\n\nNational Director, Junior Red Cross.\nMay 6, 1932.\n\nMr. R.T.

Our records show that you have already been paid for the subscriptions for 1935, and I believe there was a mistake made in issuing the account as it should have read for the year 1936.\n\nWe have revised our mailing list for this magazine, and it is found that we will require only 395 subscriptions for the current year. I enclose a new mailing list, which should supersede previous mailing lists.\n\nWhen you have prepared a new account for 395 subscriptions for the year 1936, in triplicate, you should forward it direct to the Department of Public Printing and Stationery, stating on your account that authority for the subscriptions has been given by this Department and quoting Acquisition No. 16547.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

Mr. Milson, international Director of the Junior Red Cross, asked him if it would be possible to get an exhibit of Indian Juniors' work that could be shown at the League offices in Paris, and, perhaps, in other European countries. The end of next March has been suggested as the date when the exhibit material should be ready.\n\nI should like very much to have your opinion on this matter, and to receive any suggestions you may have to make.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJean E. Browne\n\nNational Director, Junior Red Cross.\nOttawa,\nDecember 12, 1938.\n\nDear Miss Browne:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant with reference to arranging for an exhibit of Indian Juniors' work at the Paris office of the Canadian Red Cross League.\n\nAs you will easily understand it is difficult to insist on preparing special work due to the fact that all our schools have a very heavy programme and besides many of them are required to prepare exhibits for local exhibitions.\n\nThere is the additional difficulty of collecting the exhibits and forwarding them to Paris.\n\nAs you are aware practically all Indian schools are supplied with the Canadian Red Cross Junior magazine and, therefore, are aware of the excellent work that your Society is doing. I would suggest that you communicate with the following schools requesting them to prepare art exhibits and forward them to your office:\n\nCoqualeetza Indian Residential School\nPrincipal -- Rev. R.

Cleophas, Caughnawaga, Que.\n\nIn writing to the above you can mention to each of them that I suggested your communicating with them.\n\nWhen you have selected the best specimens from those submitted it would be appreciated if you would forward them to this office for review. You can understand our desire to be certain that the art work is a credit to those engaged in Indian work before forwarding it overseas.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Jane, a native born daughter of this very district, is a graduate of Kamloops General Hospital. Her uniform is the chaps and spurs and revolver of the cowboy. Mounted on her horse, with her medicine and other needs on a pack horse, this courageous young nurse rides the range tending to the needs of the sick Indians. Her work is dangerous, difficult and full of hardships. On the Indian reserves she has to accept what shelter and food they offer her. On the trail she may be forced to spend the night underneath the shelter of a tree. In the winter she has to face deep snow and very cold weather. Only recently she battled a blinding blizzard for many hours in order to bring a sick man to the hospital. Once her life was threatened when she was pursued by a pack of hungry timber wolves. It was only the threat of her revolver that kept these savage killers from attacking her and her horse. Working up here in the very outposts of civilization, Jane has to do without many of the medical aids and helps that are to be had in great city hospitals. Despite this handicap, this young nurse has shown a great presence of mind and ability to meet any occasion. A few years ago a young man, in jumping from a mowing machine when the horses bolted, had his leg completely cut off by the blade of the machine, just above the ankle. Jane was sent for, while a call was sent out for the doctor some 100 miles away. The doctor on getting the call immediately set out on saddle horse over the mountain to the scene of the accident. In the meantime, Jane, equipped with only a pair of pliers, some old wire, and a few horse hairs, patched up the wounded leg as well as possible. The doctor arrived some twelve hours later. Today the young man, despite the loss of his leg, is alive and well, due to the quick thinking of this brave young nurse. Truly Jane Bryant, for her courage and zeal and devotedness, deserves the title of \"The Florence Nightingale of the Anahim Lake District.\"\n\nJ. Hennebery\nCatholic Indian Residential School\n150 Mile House, B.C.\nFeb 24th 39\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI received your letter of the 13th inst.\n\nMiss Janet Bryant of the Hudson Lake District.

Hennessy's article regarding the work of Miss Janet Bryant.\n\nI shall write to Father Hennessy, asking him if he can get a photograph of Miss Bryant for me in her uniform.\n\nThe first of the Canadian Indian exhibit has come in. It is from St. Mary's School at Cardston, Alberta, and is very good indeed. When I get the whole consignment gathered together, I shall send it to Ottawa for you to see, before it is despatched to Paris.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nJean E.

I hope that you will find it possible to send these here at an early date. We are very desirous of seeing them before they are sent overseas.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have just received your letter of May 13th.\n\nThe Indian exhibit is waiting to be photographed, and as soon as that is done, it will be despatched to you. I shall give you the forwarding address in Paris, and perhaps you will be good enough to send it there. The French Junior Red Cross is waiting to put it on exhibit in the month of June.\n\nThis is by far the best exhibit that the Junior Red Cross has ever sent out of Canada, and it is the only completely Indian one. Indian Juniors have contributed very generously to exhibits that we have sent to Tokyo, Paris, Sweden, England and elsewhere, and usually their material has been the best in the exhibit. But this one surpasses any other Canadian Junior Red Cross exhibit that we have ever had.\n\nI am sure that you must be proud of the work of the Indian Schools and the way in which native talent is being developed.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJean E. Browne\nNational Director, Junior Red Cross.\nMay 26, 1939.\n\nMr. N.A.

There is, of course, no commercial value to any of these articles, but if you must have a price because of regulations, I would suggest that they be valued at twenty-five cents each, with the exception of the large tray and the hooked mat, which might be priced at $5.00 each.\n\nDuty has never had to be paid on Junior Red Cross exhibits, since it has been pointed out that they are not for sale and that they are for educational purposes only.\n\nTrusting that this will clear this matter for you, I remain\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJEB/\nJMac\nNational Director, Junior Red Cross.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES & RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nOttawa, June 1, 1936\n\nMr. George Wilson,\nDirector of Junior Red Cross, League of Red Cross Societies,\n18 Rue Bourbon, Paris (XIVe), F.R.A.F.G.S.\n\nIn account with Defence & Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOTTAWA Canada\n\n| Cat.

Q.\n\nDear Sister Mary of the Holy Eucharist,\n\nWe were very touched at the kind offer made by you on behalf of the Indian girls of your Convent and certainly hope that something can be arranged. In order to help and to obtain materials from us it will be necessary for you to enroll as a Junior Red Cross Branch. Over 50,000 boys and girls attending schools throughout the Province are already enrolled. They have however first obtained the permission to do so from their educational authorities. If the Provincial Department of Education and the Church give permission we will be so glad to have your help.\n\nWe have supplies ready to send to our members and as you say in your letter such things are desperately needed for the people of the bombed areas of England.\n\nWe certainly hope that we will hear from you soon again and with sincere thanks for a most thoughtful and kindly offer,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupervisor.\nRestigouche Indian Day School,\nBonaventure County, P. Q.\nFebruary 14, 1941.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey Supt of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nBy the Junior Red Cross magazine which is forwarded to the Restigouche Indian Day School monthly, the pupils and their teachers admired the work performed by the boys and girls of the Junior Red Cross Society. To satisfy our zeal on behalf of the homeless children of England, the principal of the Restigouche Indian Day School wrote to the Supervisor of the said Society, and inquired if the Indian girls of the Restigouche School would not be allowed to do something for the needy children still exposed in the war section. She explained however that the twenty Indian girls of our Senior Class were penniless but ready to busy their hands in sewing, knitting, or loom-weaving, on behalf of their Society.\n\nEnclosed you will find the answer to my inquiry. By it you will see kind Mr. Hoey, that your approval is necessary before enrolling the said pupils in the Red Cross Society. I humbly ask the honourable Staff to kindly tell me your opinion on the matter, and I am ever ready to sanction your final decision.\nThis would not prevent us to provide for the needy ones of our Reservation first, as all the heavy winter coats for girls, windbreakers for boys, stockings, bonnets, mittens, have been cleverly confectioned by our girls with the material forwarded.\n\nAbout 25 yards of heavy material for dresses are still to be made. The members of the Senior Class could consecrate many hours weekly for the welfare work of the homeless children of England.\n\nLeaving this subject to your kind consideration, I remain\n\nTruly yours,\n\nSister M. of the Holy Eucharist, etc.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 18, 1941.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant this Branch has no objection to your enrolling the pupils of the Restigouche Indian Day School in the Red Cross Society. It is noted that the pupils and staff intend to do sewing, knitting and weaving on behalf of the Red Cross Society. This is very patriotic and praiseworthy work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

White, showing the conditions in Britain arising from the war and particularly the effect on the children.\n\nOur Canadian Junior Red Cross, as you know, is maintaining 14 War Nurseries in Britain at the present time. This picture depicts in a very wonderful and tender way, what these nurseries mean to children tragically deprived of fathers and mothers, often bomb-shocked, requiring deep human understanding of mind and spirit wounds as well as physical needs.\n\nThis is no propaganda picture but if it has the same reaction on you as it had on us, you will want to place it among your treasured memories and you will find it of help to you in better realization of the present and post-war problems facing the Red Cross.\n\nH.J.

But notwithstanding anything in this section it shall be competent for any employee of the Indian Department, or any constable to arrest without a warrant any child found in the act of escaping from any industrial or boarding school, and to convey such child to the school from which it escaped.\n\n13. Any person authorized by warrant under these regulations to search for and take any child to an industrial or boarding school may enter (if need be by force) any house, building or other place specified in the warrant, and may remove the child therefrom.

McGEE,\nClerk, Privy Council.\n\nAT THE GOVERNMENT HOUSE AT OTTAWA.\n\nMONDAY, 1ST DAY OF APRIL, 1895.\n\nPRESENT:\n\nHIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL.\n\nHis Excellency, in virtue of the powers conferred upon him by sections 137 and 138, which are added to the Indian Act by section eleven of chapter 32 of the Acts 57 & 58 Victoria, laid by and with the advice of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, is pleased to order that Section 12 of the Regulations established by the Order in Council of the 10th November, 1894, shall be and the same is hereby repealed, and the following section substituted therefor:\u2014\n\n\"12. If any child in an industrial or boarding school should leave such school without permission of the Superintendent General, the Assistant Indian Commissioner, or of the Principal of the school, or should any child who has been allowed out fail to return at the stipulated time, an Indian Agent or Justice of the Peace shall, on information made to that effect by any officer...\"\nof such school, issue a warrant authorizing\nthe person named therein to search for and\ntake such child back to and again place it\nin the school in which it has been previ-\nously placed as aforesaid. But notwith-\nstanding anything in this section, it shall\nbe competent for any employee of the\nIndian Department, or any constable, to\narrest without a warrant any child found in\nthe act of escaping from any industrial or\nboarding school, and to convey such child\nto the school from which it escaped.\n\nJOHN J. McGEE.\nClerk of the Privy Council.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to request that I may be furnished with say 3 copies of the \"Regulations relating to the education of Indian children\" for the use of the various boarding & other schools in this agency.\n\nI have been interpreting the rules in the sense that rules 5,6,7 refer to the day schools mentioned in rule 1 and that Indians can not be compelled by the truant officer to send their children unless there is a day school on the reserve or within 3 miles.\n\nRule 9 provides for an Indian Agent after giving the parent 4 days notice, committing a child to an industrial or Boarding school but I take it that this power is only to be exercised by the Agent with discretion and is permissive & not obligatory & can not be put in force by any missionary who likes to instruct a truant officer under rules 1 and 6?\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour Obedient Servant,\n(sgd) A.W. Neill,\n\nA.W.Vowell, Esq.,\nVictoria,\nB.C.\nIndian Office Victoria B.C.\n\nJ-4. 537 Jan. 13th 1904.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to inclose herewith copy of a letter received from Mr. Indian Agent Neill, of West Coast Agency, asking for three copies of the \"Regulations Relating to the Education of Indian children.\"\n\nIn this connection I would ask the Department to be good enough to supply him, and also to forward to this office for general use one dozen of the \"Regulations.\"\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Superintendent B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, 21st January, 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nMr Supt. Vowell forwards a copy of a letter from Mr Agent Neill asking for three copies of the Regulations relating to the education of Indian children. The Agent states that he has been interpreting Sections 5, 6 and 7 as referring to day schools and that Indians cannot be compelled by the truant officer to send their children unless there is a day school within two miles from their home. I consider that he is correct in his views as regards these clauses in the Regulations but I am not aware that any instructions have been issued to put these Regulations in force in British Columbia. He also refers to Section 9 of the Regulations, which provides for the committing of a child to an Industrial or Boarding school and says that he takes it that the power conferred by this clause is only to be exercised by the Agent with discretion and is permissive and not obligatory, and cannot be put in force by any missionary who likes to instruct the truant officer under rules 1 and 6. I think he has grasped the intention of the Act under which the Regulations were passed, although Section 9 confers powers on a Justice of the Peace which are too great and are liable to cause serious trouble. If a Principal of a boarding school should get him to act without the authority of\nthe Department.\n\nThe printed supply of the Regulations is about exhausted and before any more are issued it would be well to have them amended. The question of this amendment has been under the Department's consideration for nearly three years.\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, 26th January, 1904\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant forwarding a copy of a communication from Mr Agent Neill in which he asks for three copies of the Regulations relating to the education of Indian children, and in reply I beg to say that the three copies asked for are enclosed herewith.\n\nThe Department is unable to comply with your request to be furnished with twelve copies for your office as it has no more on hand at present.\n\nCertain needed amendments to these Regulations will be embodied in a new edition shortly to be printed, on receipt of which your requisition will be filled.\n\nThe Department concurs in the interpretation placed on the Regulations by Mr Agent Neill.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.\nIndian Supt.\nVictoria, B.C.\nTOUCHWOOD AGENCY\n\nRutawa: P.O., Assa:\n\n23rd April, 1904.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to request that you will be pleased to put in force the following regulations, relating to the Education of Indian children, passed in accordance with Section II Chapter 32 of 57-58 Victoria, in my Agency.\n\nMy Indians are ready for same -\n\nFor example, Gordon's Boarding School is short of (6) pupils. The Principal and myself have used all persuasion with the parents, but without avail. The parents have on several occasions promised to send their children to School, but up to date have failed to do so, and are not likely to do so now, unless compelled.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, 9th May, 1904:\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nMr Agent Martineau writes under date the 22nd ultimo, asking the Department to enforce the Regulations relating to the education of Indian children. He states that the boarding school on Gordon's reserve is short of six pupils and that the Principal and he have used all their powers of persuasion to induce the parents to send their children, but without avail.\n\nIt is a question to my mind whether under Sections 137 and 138, 57-58 Vic. Cap. 32, under which the Regulations were passed, the Department has the power to comply with his request. Section 1 of the Regulations provides that all Indian children between the ages of 7 and 16 shall attend a day school on the reserve on which they reside for the full term during which the school is open each year, unless excused for the reasons thereafter mentioned. There is no day school on this reserve and parents can hardly be said to prevent their children from attending a school which does not exist, and I do not consider that the Act ever contemplated removing the children from their parents, save when they prevent them from attending a day school.\n\nIf the education of certain children on this reserve is not being attended to, where a boarding school is established, the only way I see to overcome\nthe difficulty is to establish a day school in connection with the boarding school and pay a tuition grant for day pupils. Then, if the parents refuse to send their children to a day school, the regulations could be enforced.\n\n[Signature]\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, ___________________________190\n\nState the facts & communicate\nand have if he has had any com-\nmunications in this matter, or if\nhe wrote back him some if not what\n& communication.\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, 13th May, 1904:\n\nSir,\n\nMr Agent Hartin has asked that the regulations for the compulsory education of Indian children be put in force in his Agency, and he refers particularly to Geo. Gordon's boarding school, which he says has vacancies for more pupils and states that he and the Principal have endeavored to persuade the parents to send their children, but without avail.\n\nThe Department would like to know whether you have had any communications in this matter, and if so, what has been done, and if not, what you would recommend.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

However, short of retaining the Indian annuity money, you may withhold from unwilling parents all help that you may have at your disposal, provisions, tea, tobacco, etc. You are, as a matter of course, expected to use your personal influence and explain the advantages to be derived from attendance to school.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) D. Laird,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nIndian Agent,\nTouchwood Hills Agency.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 13th instant re using compulsion regarding the recruiting of pupils for the Gordon Boarding School, and to enclose a copy of a letter written to the Indian Agent on the subject, dated the 29th of April last. For the present I do not think it advisable to use any forcible measures.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept.

Archdeacon Mackay W.W., Seconded by Revd. H.D. Macdonald, and Carried:\n\n\"That this Synod do authorize the Bishop and the Secretary of Synod to frame a resolution urging the Indian Department to try some wise method of Compulsory Attendance at the various Indian Schools and that a Copy of this resolution be sent to the Indian Department - Ottawa.\n\nThe Resolution authorized above is as follows:\n\n\"Whereas the Indian Department is expending a large sum annually on the maintenance of day schools on the Indian Reserves;\n\n\"And Whereas, the reports show a very small attendance at these schools compared to the money expended;\n\n\"And Whereas, the teachers complain that there are many children who might attend, but that they cannot persuade the parents to send them at all regularly; and that they believe the attendance might be much increased.\"\n\"If the Indian Agents and Farm Instructors would use their influence and the power they have in this direction.\n\nIt is therefore hereby resolved:\n\nThat the Said Synod of Saskatchewan do request the Indian Department to consider what method they can best adopt to compel, or at least strongly influence, the parents to send all their children of school age to School, and to send them regularly.\n\nAnd that this Synod desires to record its firm opinion:\n\n1. That the Agents and Farm Instructors have much more power and influence over the parents, in this respect, than the teachers, and that they be instructed by the Indian Department, to be sure to use this power.\n\n2. That the Agents and Instructors be directed by the Indian Department to support the authority of the teachers.\n\n3.

D. McLEAN\nSecretary.\n\nRev. James Taylor,\nPrincipal,\nEmmanuel College,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa, June 10, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nAs directed by you I have prepared a draft set of regulations relating to the education of Indian children to replace the regulations made by His Excellency in Council on November 10, 1894. These draft regulations, if approved, will be operative in virtue of the powers conferred by Sections 9, 10 and 11 the Indian Act, Chap. 81 of the Revised Statutes 1906.\n\nI have embodied the amended regulations in a Memorandum to Council. It might be well to refer the same to the Department of Justice for revision before being submitted to the Minister for signature.\n\nIt should be noted that all regulations made by the Governor General in Council are, under sec. 170 of the Act above quoted, to be published in the Canada Gazette and laid before both Houses of Parliament within the first fifteen days of the session first after the date thereof.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nOttawa, June 28, 1906.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nI have the request that you will be good enough to examine the enclosed draft set of regulations relating to the education of Indian children, which have been prepared in virtue of the powers conferred by Sections 9, 10 and 11 of the Indian Act, Chap. 84 of the Revised Statutes 1905 and are designed to replace the regulations made by His Excellency the Governor in Council on November 10, 1894, and amendment thereto of April 1, 1895, under Sections 137 and 138, Chap. 83, of 57 and 58 Victoria.\n\nBefore submitting these regulations to Council the Department would like to have your assurance that they are in proper form. I would be pleased if you would have this revision made at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nE. L. Newcombe, M.P., K.C.,\nDeputy Minister of Justice,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 1908.\n\nHis Excellency\nthe Governor General in Council,\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to recommend that the Regulations relating to the Education of Indian Children made by Your Excellency in Council on the 10th day of November, 1894, and the amendment thereto of the 1st day of April, 1895, be repealed and the following substituted therefor in virtue of the powers conferred upon Your Excellency by Sections 9, 10 and 11 of the Indian Act Chap. 81 of the Revised Statutes 1906:\n\n1. All Indian children between the ages of six and fifteen shall attend a day school on the reserve on which they reside for the full term during which the school is open each year, unless excused for the reasons hereinafter mentioned.\n\n2. Any person who receives into his house a child between the ages mentioned, and which child is resident with him, or in his care or employment, shall be deemed thereby to be subject to the same duty with respect to the education of such child during such residence as a Parent, and shall be liable to be proceeded against as in the case of a parent, if he should fail to cause such child to be educated to the extent required of a Parent under these regulations;\nbut the duty of the parent under these regulations shall not thereby be affected or diminished, and shall continue in full force.\n\n3. No parent, guardian or other person shall be liable to any of the penalties of these regulations in respect of any child\u2014\n\n(a) If the child is under efficient instruction;\n\n(b) If the child is unable to attend school by reason of sickness or other unavoidable cause;\n\n(c) If there is no school within two miles, measured by the nearest road from such child's residence, if such child is under ten years of age, or within three miles, if over this age;\n\n(d) If the child has been excused, as hereinafter provided, from attending school;\n\n(e) If the child has passed the entrance examination for high schools.\n\n4. Where, in the opinion of any Indian Agent or of any teacher authorized by such agent to issue such certificate as is hereinafter referred to, the services of such child are required in husbandry or in urgent and necessary household duties, or for the necessary maintenance of such child, or of some Indian dependent upon such child, such Indian Agent or teacher may, by certificate setting forth the reasons therefor, relieve such child from attendance at school for any period not exceeding\ntwo weeks during each of the four school terms or quarters.\n\n5. Indian Agents may appoint one or more persons or Indians to act as truant officers on each reserve for the enforcement of these regulations, and such truant officers shall, for the purposes of these regulations, be vested with police powers, and shall perform such services as shall be deemed necessary by the Indian Agents by whom they are appointed for the enforcement of these regulations.\n\n6. It shall be the duty of truant officers appointed under these regulations to examine into all cases of non-attendance at school which may be brought to their notice, to notify the parent, guardian or other person having the charge or control of any child between six and fifteen years of age when such child is not attending school, and to require such parent, guardian or other person or Indian to cause the child to attend some school within three days.\n\n7. If the parent, guardian or other person having the legal charge or control of any child, shall neglect or refuse to cause such child to attend some school after being notified as herein required (unless such child has been excused from such attendance as provided by these regulations) the truant officer shall make an entry in his book, and cause to be made, a complaint against such parent, guardian or other person or Indian before any Justice of the Peace having jurisdiction in the county or district in which the offence occurred, or before the Indian Agent for the locality; and upon conviction of such\nrefusal or neglect, such parent, guardian or other person\nor Indian shall be liable to a fine of not more than\ntwo dollars, or imprisonment for a period not exceeding\nten days, or both.\n\n8. For the purposes of section 10 of chapter\n61 of the act above quoted all industrial and boarding\nschools receiving a per capita grant or other grant from\nthe Government for the education of Indian children are\ndeclared to be industrial and boarding schools for the\npurposes of section 9 of the Act.\n\n9. An Indian Agent or Justice of the Peace on\nrequest from the Department of Indian Affairs or one\nof its authorized officers on being satisfied that any\nIndian child between six and fifteen years of age is not\nbeing properly cared for or educated, and that the parent,\nguardian or other person having the charge or\ncontrol of such child, is unfit or unwilling to provide\nfor the child's education, may issue a warrant authorizing\nthe person named therein to search for and take such\nchild and place it in an industrial or boarding school,\nin which there may be a vacancy for such child, and a\nchild so placed in an industrial or boarding school may\nbe retained until the age of eighteen years is reached,\nprovided that the Superintendent General of Indian Af-\nfairs may for special reasons permit a pupil to be re-\ntained until the age of twenty years; but no child shall\nbe committed to any industrial or boarding school before\nthe parent, guardian or other person having the\ncharge or control of such child, is notified orally, or in writing, by a Justice of the Peace, Indian Agent or Truant Officer, of the intention to commit the child, and four days shall be allowed to elapse between the giving of such notice and the committal of the child.\n\n10. If any such parent, guardian, or other person or Indian who has been notified as aforesaid, objects within the aforesaid four days to the placing of the child in an industrial or boarding school, the Indian Agent or Justice of the Peace who issued the warrant shall appoint a day for a formal enquiry into the case, and may take evidence under oath as to the manner in which the child is being cared for and educated; and, if it be shown that adequate provision is being made or will be made for the child's care and education, the child shall be left in the custody of such parent, guardian or other person or Indian.\n\n11. The share of annuity or interest money, or other band revenue, belonging to a child committed to an industrial or boarding school, may be retained by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, and may be expended by the Superintendent General for the maintenance and education of such child or funded for its benefit.\n\n12. If any child in an industrial or boarding school should leave such school without permission of the Superintendent General or other authorized officer of the Department of Indian Affairs, or of the Principal of the school, or should any child who has been allowed out, fail to return at the stipulated time, any Indian Agent or Justice of the Peace shall, on information made to that effect by any authorized officer of the Department, issue a warrant authorizing the person named therein\nto search for and take such child back to the school in which it had been previously placed as aforesaid. But notwithstanding anything in this section it shall be competent for any employee of the school or of the Indian Department or any constable, to arrest without a warrant any child found in the act of escaping from such school and to convey such child to the school from which it escaped.\n\n13. Any person authorized by warrant under these regulations to search for and take any child to an industrial or boarding school may enter (if need be by force) any house, building or other place specified in the warrant, and may remove the child therefrom.\n\n(2) The warrant may be addressed to any policeman or constable, or to any truant officer appointed under these regulations, or to any employee of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\n14. Notwithstanding anything in these regulations contained, no Protestant child shall be committed to a Roman Catholic school or to a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices; and no Roman Catholic child shall be committed to a Protestant school or to a school conducted under Protestant auspices.\n\n15. The Superintendent General of Indian Affairs shall have the right, notwithstanding anything in these regulations contained, to return to the custody of its parents, guardian or other person having the charge or control thereof, any child placed in an industrial or boarding school under these regulations.\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nIn reply to your letter of the 18th inst. No. 112220 submitting proposed regulations relating to the education of Indian children, I have the honour to state that I have made some suggested alterations in the proposed regulations, and in addition to that, I would point out that the Statute fixes the age at which children may be kept in the schools at eighteen, and I do not think that the proposed portion of regulation No. 9 which allows them to be kept as pupils under special circumstances to twenty-one years of age can legally be made. In Regulation No. 5 there is a provision that truant officers shall be vested with police powers. This I notice is a repetition of an old regulation. It appears to me however that the provision is very indefinite and probably ultra vires. If it is desirable that the truant officers should have the powers of a constable they should I think be appointed constables under the Dominion Police Act.

It shall also be the duty of the truant officers to make every effort to see that the children attend school regularly and to arrest and convey to school any child not sick or otherwise lawfully excused from attending school that they may find absent from school during school hours.\n\n7. If the parent, guardian or other person having charge or control of any child shall neglect or refuse to cause such child to attend some school after being notified as herein required (unless such child has been excused from such attendance as provided by these regulations) the truant officer shall make, or cause to be made, a complaint against such parent, guardian or other person before any Justice of the Peace having jurisdiction in the county or district in which the offence occurred, or before the Indian Agent for the locality; and upon conviction such parent, guardian or other person shall be liable to a fine of not more than two dollars or imprisonment for a period not exceeding ten days, or both.\n6.

Frank Oliver.\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge your letter of the 7th inst. No. 112396 and beg to return the regulations relating to the education of Indian children. I would suggest the elimination of the words \"the legal\" in regulation No. 7 as they may possibly occasion difficulty in administering the regulations.\n\nPapers returned.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy Minister.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 20, 1908.\n\nMemorandum\n\nfor Mr. Oliver\n\nThe memorandum to council herewith relating to the education of Indian children has been prepared for the following reasons.\n\nThe printed supply of the regulations now in force is exhausted and the regulations need amendment in the following sections:\n\n(1) Where it is stated that all Indian children between the ages of 7 and 16 shall attend a day school is changed to 6 and 15 to agree with the ages fixed in sub-section F of sections 98 and 104 of the Indian Act.\n\n(2) The words \"Indian or other\" and \"an Indian\" have been inserted in the first and second lines for the sake of clearness.\n\n(3) This section relates to the appointment of truant officers. In the old regulations there is provision that truant officers should be invested with police powers. This provision is very indefinite and probably ultra vires. For this reason the duties of the truant officer have been clearly defined in the amended regulations.\n\n(4) Age limit changed from 7 to 16 to 6 to 15, the reason given in section 1.\n\n(5) The word \"illegal\" has been struck out before the words \"charge or control\" as it would possibly occasion difficulty in administering the regulations.\n(8) In this section all boarding and industrial schools in operation in 1894 were mentioned seriatim. As constant changes were taking place in the schools, new ones being established and old ones closed, the section has been changed to read \"all industrial and boarding schools receiving a per capita or other grant from the Government for the education of Indian children are declared to be industrial and boarding schools for the purposes of Sections 10 and 11 of the said Act.\"\n\n(9) After the words \"Justice of the Peace\" in the first line of this section the following has been inserted \"on requisition from the Department of Indian Affairs or from one of its authorized officers\" and the age 7 to 16 has been changed to 8 to 15 to correspond with the other sections. The statute fixes the age at which children may be kept in these schools at 16 and this age limit can not legally be extended.\n\n(10) The words \"Assistant Indian Commissioner\" have been struck out and the words \"or other authorized officer of the Department of Indian Affairs\" inserted and the words \"officer of such school\" are changed to read \"authorized officer of the Department.\" After \"employee\" the words \"of the school or\" are placed for the purpose intercepting deserters.\n\n(13) The words \"or to the principal of any industrial or boarding school\" in sub-section 2 have been eliminated as they place too much power in the principal's hands.\n\n(14) The words \"placed in\" before a Roman Catholic school have been changed to \"committed to\" as Section 11 of the Act provides for the committal not the placing of Indian children in industrial and boarding schools. The word \"in\" has been changed to \"to\" and \"committed to\" is\nagain inserted before a Protestant school instead of \"placed in\".\n\nThese amended regulations were sent to the Department of Justice for examination and revision and have been passed on by that Department as being in proper form for submission to His Excellency the Governor General in Council.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nAt the Government House at Ottawa\n\nThursday, the 6th day of August, 1908.\n\nPRESENT:\n\nHis Excellency\nThe Governor General\n\nIn Council:\n\nHis Excellency the Governor General in Council\nin pursuance of the powers conferred upon him by Sections\n9, 10 and 11 of The Indian Act, Chapter 31 of the Revised\nStatutes of Canada, 1906, is pleased to Order that the\nRegulations relating to the Education of Indian Children\nestablished by the Order in Council of the 10th November,\n1904, and the amendment thereto of the 1st April 1895,\nshall be and the same are hereby repealed and the follow-\ning Regulations substituted therefor:\n\n1...

S. H. Blake a copy of the School Regulations in force prior to those which have just been issued.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\n\nThe last copy of the old regulations in the Dept has been sent to Mr. Blake today.\n\n6/10/08\nSir;-\n\nI have the honour to draw the attention of the Dept. to the fact that there are about 75 children of school age on the reserves of this agency who don't go to any school. On my last visit to the reserves I have tried to induce the parents and guardians of those children to send them to school, but could not convince one of them. Some of the destitutes, drawing ration, have some of those children who also are getting fed out of the ration house. I really have pity on those poor beings growing up in the ignorance of everything except of vices. It would be a great service to render to those children if there was a way of separate them from their parents without raising too much antipathy of their parents or guardians toward us. It looks to me that forcing those children to school against the will of their parents would be a bad politic or tactic and might lead them to rebel against us. I would like to be advised on the way of handling those children to school without coercion, or should I leave the matter as it is?\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInd. Agt.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Ind. Affairs,\nOttawa.\nTo Hon. Frank Oliver,\nHon. David Laird,\nMr. Wm. Verreau,\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nI am sending you all the same letter.\n\nI have been given to understand that Hon. Frank Oliver is in favor of making attendance at the Industrial Schools of the Indians compulsory for all Indians between the ages of 5 and 18. This letter is written to urge the wisdom of this action. I am most intimately acquainted with the Red Deer Industrial School. It is doing good work and I think that the future of the Indian is wrapped up in such a school. But it is so hard to get the children. The children want to go and in some cases the parents want to send them but the grandmothers refuse to let them go. On this reserve, at least there are 40 children, 20 within school age. But we can only get 4 children. The rest are half-clad, half-starved, half-sick, running around in the snow ill-clad and the majority die before reaching maturity. If we are to keep the race alive it must be through the schools. The children are growing up ignorant, and will all their lives be added weight on the government. They are begging from their Missionary till he has to use severe means. If every child were sent to school the full age limit we may hope to solve the Indian problem some time in the future.\n\nI sincerely hope this is enacted.\n\nSincerely,\n\nW.E.S. James,\nMissionary Paul's Reserve,\nWabamun Alta.\nOttawa, March 18, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ult., addressed to the Superintendent General, with reference to the attendance of Indian children at industrial schools, and in reply I beg to say that you have been misinformed, as it is not the intention of the Department to compel Indian parents to send their children to boarding or industrial schools, with the exception of cases specially provided for in the regulations.\n\nWhere schools of these classes are producing good results no difficulty is experienced in filling vacancies.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. W.B.S. James,\nMissionary,\nWabamun, Alta.\nOttawa, April 5, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of February 20, last, calling the Department's attention to the fact that there are about seventy-five Indian children of school age in your agency who are not attending any school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is not the policy of the Department to use compulsion for the purpose of placing children in industrial or boarding schools, except in cases provided for in the Regulations relating to the Education of Indian Children, a copy of which is sent you herewith.\n\nThe Department relies on the efforts of its officers, the missionaries and others to persuade the Indians to avail themselves of the opportunities offered by these schools for educating their children. There is ample accommodation in the boarding and industrial schools for them, and the Department is of opinion that, if greater efforts were made, the apathy of the Indians might be overcome.\n\nThe Department fully appreciates the situation of these Indians and is most anxious to take steps to place educational\n\nU.

If nomadic, you should state how long and at what seasons they are absent from the reserve and whether on these occasions they are accompanied by their families. It should also show the number of children of school age in each band and whether they are so located that a day school could be established which would be within reasonable distance for all the children to attend.\n\nThe Department is pleased to note the interest you take in the educational needs of the Indians under your charge and it trusts that your report, which should deal fully with every phase of the question, will justify it in establishing on one or more of the reserves in the agency day schools of a type that will appeal to the Indians. It would be well for you to discuss this question with the Chiefs and leading men of the different bands and explain to them the interest the Department takes in the education of its wards.\n\nThe Department would like you to give this matter your early and careful attention.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of compulsory education No. I have received a copy of THE COMPULSORY EDUCATION ACT from some source not known.\n\nI would request instructions as to what extent THE DEPARTMENT desires this act enforced under conditions such as exist in this AGENCY.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSIR\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nAgent\n\nTHE INDIAN COMMISSIONER\n\nWINNIPEG\nOttawa, April 18, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 15th ult., I beg to say that the copy of the school regulations received by you was sent from the Indian Commissioner's Office, Winnipeg.\n\nUnless specially instructed, the Department does not wish you to put these regulations in force in any instance. It might be well, however, to acquaint the Indians with their nature and point out to them what is expected in respect to the education of their children.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nC.C. Calverly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House,\nKeewatin.\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your letter of above date and No. re the education of Indian children of this Agency, I am pleased to report that since I wrote you on the matter I have had the good fortune to induce the parents of some 25 children to send their little ones to school and these said children are now happily domiciled in the St. Albert and Red Deer Schools. It is possible that during the treaty payments I may be further successful in persuading the members of Joseph's Band to send some of their children to school.\n\nSo far as day schools are concerned it would be useless to have one on each Reserve as there are not enough children of school age on each reserve now to warrant it; and one for the whole Agency is not practicable as the Reserves are so very far one from the other.\n\nWith persuasion and the help of the statute applying to the case, I hope to have all those of good health and sound mental condition in one or other of Industrial or boarding schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, June 4, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ult., reporting in regard to the education of the Indian children in your Agency, and in reply I beg to say that the Department agrees with you that it would be expedient to open any day school there at present.\n\nIt is pleased to learn that you have been successful in inducing some parents to send their children to the St. Albert and Red Deer schools. The Department is satisfied that an energetic Agent would have great influence in overcoming the prejudices of Indians to sending their children to residential schools, and it trusts that you will not relax your efforts to secure more pupils for these schools.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nU. Verreau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to inform the Dept. during my last visit on Paul's Reserve, I notified the Band that members who had children of school age had to make up their mind to send their children to school after the summer vacation, either willingly or forcefully. Then Chief Bird got up and said that he would write to the Dept. to inquire if such was the order given. They have about 15 sound children of school age, who depend mostly on the ration house for their living, and would like to see those children in the school, consequently I would like the Dept. to order me to see that the school age children of this agency be sent to school after summer vacation. So I think with such an order it would be an easy matter for me to send those children to school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInd.

Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 9, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ult., and in reply I beg to say that the Department's letter of the 4th ult. did not contemplate the committal of children of school age in your agency to industrial or boarding schools, as the Department considers that it would be unwise to take such drastic measures.\n\nIf you will read carefully the concluding paragraph of letter of the 4th ult., you will see that stress was laid on your using your efforts to overcome the prejudices of the Indians by persuasion, not by compulsion, and the Department would like you to follow this course in dealing with the educational question.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nUrbain Verreau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nSecretary.\nA Council Meeting of the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve held the 30th day of January 1914, presided by Mr. Lorenzo Letourneau, Asst.

The Councilors are strongly desirous to have graded schools on the reserve, which is of an absolute necessity. Hoping the Department will look into this matter fully, and grant us this important matter with as little delay as possible.\n\nAdopted unanimously.\n\nLorenzo Letourneau,\nAsst. Indian Agent.\nOttawa, February 13, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a minute of a meeting of the Caughnawaga Council held on the 30th ultimo in reference to the duties of the truant officer.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department agrees with you that once a week would be sufficient for the truant officer to obtain from the teacher the names of pupils who do not attend regularly and you should see that he furnishes you with a list showing the parents, if any, who neglect to send their children to school regularly without valid excuses. If there are any such cases you are authorized to proceed against them under the Regulations.\n\nThe question of having graded schools on the reserve will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nI would like to get some definite information from the Department regarding the time a teacher has to teach school or to keep her school open. Most of the teachers in my Agency think that after they have taught 200 days, that they are at liberty to close up their schools, and go off for their holidays. I do not look at it that way. The way I read the school regulations, and which I believe is meant to be the way, is, that a teacher must keep her school open from the 1st of September until the 30th of June, whether she has taught her 200 days or over that amount.\n\nThe clause in the regulations stating that schools must be kept open for not less than 200 days, lends them to believe that when they have 200 days to their credit, that they can leave for their holidays any time after. I have explained to them, that owing to drawbacks in this country, such as bad weather, sickness, etc., a teacher may lose a certain amount of days in the year, and that an average of 200 days has been made so that a teacher can have that many teaching days to her credit at least, otherwise the full term for the school from the 1st of September to the 30th of June must be strictly adhered to, even if they teach over the 200 days. I trust that I have not put a wrong construction on that clause, as I fully believe that the full term should be adhered to, irrespective of how many extra days they may teach over and above the 200 days mentioned in the 1st clause.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.G. Stewart\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 16th, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th ultimo, with reference to the number of days on which the day schools should be kept open each year.\n\nThe regulations prescribe that day schools shall be opened after the summer holidays on September 1st unless this date should be Labour Day, and shall close for the Christmas holidays on December 22nd. The winter term will commence on January 3rd and end on June 30th.\n\nWith the exception of the prescribed holidays, teachers should adhere strictly to the above regulation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Gibbon\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nEDUCATION NEED AMONG INDIANS\n\nSARNIA, March 26.\u2014The Indians, to preserve their identity and to promote their welfare, should be educated. This is the statement made by Lieut. Loftus, chief of the Mohawks. During the time Lieut. Loftus was engaged in the recruiting campaign he laid bare facts which have been hidden from view for many years.\n\nThe Indians inhabiting the Sarnia Reserve and the surrounding district are the Wyandotte, the Potawatomies, all that remains of the ancient Iroquois, and the Mississaugas. They are very attached to their ancient habits, and, although they have been told many times that they must show more interest in education, they have not listened to the appeals, the old methods have been tried out without putting forth an effort to get it still.\n\nIt has been brought to the attention of the Indians by the government, that they are keeping their offspring in ignorance. Lieut. Loftus visited the Indians, and although he was met with hostility, he went on with his work. He explained to them that if they are to keep up with the times, they must send their children to school. A letter from the Government agent states that if the Indians do not send their children to school, the Government will hold back the money due them. This, however, is a drastic measure. The average annual income of the Indian is between $150 and $200. In very hard times it may fall as low as $50 to $75. This means there is no other source of income except the land, and it is very often the case, his year's rent is paid before the end of the year. If the family has a large number of members, the amount paid to every member of the family is less than it should be.\n\nWhen the first announcement of this new system was made, the Indians were hostile and sullen, but after it had been explained to them, they became more understanding. The government also made laws to bring past to him, and that he is required to pay taxes, and that he is required to pay school fees. The Indians have now more reasonable view of the question. Lieut. Loftus has been very generous in his efforts to help the Indians. He has been thanked for what he had done, and the Indians have said that betterment of this system would be greatly appreciated. The question has been more fully solved in the council house.\nSir:-\n\nI am enclosing herein a copy of an application made by Andrew McKay for the admission of his nine year old daughter to the Crosby Girls' Home Industrial School at Fort Simpson, B.C. In addition to children entering our industrial or boarding schools on such applications of their parents, Indian children between 6 and 15 years of age not being properly cared for or educated may be committed to these schools according to the \"Regulations Relating to the Education of Indian Children\", a copy of which is enclosed.\n\nMr. McKay's daughter, named in the enclosed application, on being allowed to leave the school for holidays failed to return at the stipulated time, and the Agent has asked the Department to take proceedings to have this child returned, under Section 12 of the enclosed regulations.\n\nA question has, however, been raised as to whether children who have been admitted on application can properly be returned to the school under Section 12 of these Regulations just the same as children who have been committed, and I would be glad to have your views as to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Justice,\nOttawa,\nDepartment of Justice,\nOttawa, Feb. 4th, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 24th of November last - 119600-1A - upon the subject of your enquiry as to whether children admitted on application to industrial Indian schools can properly be returned to these schools under the provisions of section 12 of the regulations you submit, just the same as children who have been committed to such schools, I have the honour to state that in my opinion, although the matter is not free from doubt, regulation 12 applies only to children committed to such schools under the provisions of clause 9. It would appear from the application for the admission of Salina McKay that she was required to remain in the industrial home for such term as your Department might deem proper. Notwithstanding this condition in the application I am inclined to think, as before mentioned, that regulation 12 relates only to children committed by justices or Indian Agents. In matter of fact the Indian Act, section 11, professedly empowers the Governor in Council to make regulations only for the commitment by justices or Indian Agents of children of Indian blood under the age of 16 years to such industrial or boarding schools, and consequently it may be forcibly urged that the children referred to in clause 12 of the regulations are those only so committed to the schools.\n\nI agree that there should be no need of the procedure outlined by Nos. 9 and 10 of the regulations when the conditions therein described exist and the parent or guardian voluntarily surrender the child to the industrial school but the regulations make no express provision for such cases and therefore I do not think it would be advisable to exercise the compulsory powers of the regulations. I suggest that you have the regulations amended to provide for admission on application and that the child shall then be held in all respects as if committed.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

I always do my best to have these things settled outside of the law, & there don't seem to be much in the Indian Act that a Justice can be guided by, regarding these schools; therefore I will be pleased if you will send me the above mentioned regulations, or any thing else that you may consider would be a help to a Justice in handling these little troubles for the schools.\n\nI Remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs - School Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6032, File 150-40A, part 1)\nOttawa, October 15, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, in which you ask the Department to send you a copy of the rules and regulations regarding boarding schools, as there is no Indian Agent at Wabasca and, therefore, as you are a Justice of the Peace, many little troubles that crop up between the parents of the children and the schools are brought to you to settle.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that I am sending you herewith copies of the Regulations Relating to the Education of Indian Children and the Correspondence and Agreement relating to the Maintenance and Management of Indian Boarding Schools.\n\nI may say, however, that any disputes which arise between the parents and the schools at Wabasca should be referred to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

In a number of instances in British Columbia truant officers have been appointed to see that the children attend the day schools regularly. The main difficulty is to overcome the indifference of the parents regarding the education of their children. Our Agents have been instructed on each occasion on which they visit & receive to impress on the parents the benefits their children will acquire by regular attendance and to endeavour by every persuasion in their power, to induce the parents to see that their children attend the day schools on the reserves regularly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAest.

That the average daily attendance of these is only about 75 per cent. The committee of the Indian Department to see that the school laws in regard to compulsory attendance are more widely enforced.\n\nThe board decided to establish a superannuation fund for lay missionaries. The money necessary appointed to be foreign field after the year 1916 shall be a number of years before that time may become members by the following assessments: The fund will be administered by the colonial Board appointed annually. The board of assessment required by the ordained ministers by third parties. The amount of the annuities will be on the same basis.\n\nFurlough for Missionaries\n\nThe board considered the subject of furloughs for missionaries and while approving the efforts of the Federal Government to prevent the immigration of such immigrants, it requested that provision be made for representatives of the Churches upon the council which deals with the question.\n\nThe board voted $7,500, the probable amount of the expenses of the United States connected to the proposed Medico-Dental College in Chicago.\n\nIn regard to the subject of furloughs for missionary wives among the Indians the board decided that the only recommendation it could make would be to urge the missionary workers to take an extended furlough at such times as would least interfere with their work.\n\nA grant of $440 each was recommended to provide a new Chinese Mission for the Okanagan, the proposed new Chinese Mission for Vancouver, the proposed new Chinese mission for Toronto.\n\nThe board approved the principle of a time limit of ten years for Indian missionaries except in special cases.\n\nAn annuity of $250 was granted Mrs. H. E. Goodwin in consideration of her long and efficient services as school teacher and interpreter.\n\nThe officers of the Woman's Missionary Society were presented with certificates. For many years the honored President of the society has been doing an inspiring story to tell of progress in all departments.\n\nMr. One of the Japanese Conference briefly addressed the committee, submitting account of the progress of the work in the field and the need brought to his attention to its staff.\n\nRev.

He had a brilliant career in the West, and is now engaged in missionary work and enthusiastic worker.\nToronto, October 6, 1919.\n\nThe General Board of Missions at its meeting this morning adopted the following Resolution:\n\nItem #46 - Compulsory Education - Your committee recommends that whereas there are about 18,000 Indian children of school age in Canada of which only 12,000 are enrolled in the day, boarding and industrial schools, leaving 6,000 who are not attending any school and the average attendance is only about 6,000; and whereas, there are only few Government officials who are endeavouring to compel attendance, but in each case with good results; we request the Indian Department to enforce the existing law on compulsory education.\n\nS.

Sir -\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of copy of resolution No. 46, passed by the General Board of Missions of the Methodist Church at its meeting on October 6th, having reference to the question of compulsory education among the Indians of Canada.\n\nI wish first to refer to the figures quoted in the resolution with respect to enrolment and attendance. Leaving out of consideration the most remote portions of the Provinces of Quebec, Manitoba, Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia, as well as the North West Territories, inhabited only by the Indians who follow the hunt exclusively for a livelihood, our last statistics (1915) show a population of school age, 6 to 15 years of age, of approximately 16,547; of these 11,804 pupils are enrolled either at day or residential schools, and the average attendance for the past fiscal year was 7,474. This constitutes 65.32% of the enrolment, which is a better showing than the average attendance in the rural schools of the Province of Ontario as shown by their returns for the year 1916. Of course, I am aware that the steady attendance at the residential schools is a factor in effecting this very favourable comparison. We have provision for the enforced attendance of Indian children at our day schools and an honest effort is made by the Department, through its officials, to make these regulations effective. There are reserves, however, where, owing to the scattered location of the\n\nRev. G. W. Barker,\nSecretary of the General Board of Missions of the Methodist Church,\nToronto, Ont.\nIndians, it is almost impossible to enforce anything like regular attendance at schools, especially during the winter months. Where, however, conditions are at all favourable, the Department is anxious and willing to make a special endeavour to produce better results.\n\nSo far as the residential schools are concerned, the statutes give us no power to enforce the compulsory enrolment of Indian children; even if the system were considered to be in the best interests of the Indian children, it is doubtful whether Parliament would grant to the Department the absolute power of taking children from their parents without their consent. As you are aware, the Department now has the power to place in industrial or boarding schools children living in an unwholesome environment, or those whose parents neglect to send them to school when such facilities are in existence.\n\nI also think this an opportune time to make reference to the teacher himself as a factor of the greatest importance in attaining the end your committee has in view. So far as day schools are concerned, I have observed that the best attendance and ultimate results are secured only by those teachers who are competent to arouse and retain the interests of parents and pupils. I realize the difficulty of obtaining the service of persons of the required temperament and adaptability to take charge of schools in districts so isolated as our reserves in many cases unfortunately are. It will be admitted, however, that the efforts of officials of this Department would be of little avail unless the teachers are able to hold the interest of the children. Any system which depends solely upon the enforcement of stringent legislation for results must of necessity eventually fail.\nI have in mind individual schools in the Province of Ontario which are second to no white schools in their respective districts, and in each instance I attribute the success of these schools primarily to the personality of the teachers. This type of teacher is unfortunately very rare.\n\nAt the same time I appreciate the necessity of the co-operation of our Indian Agents and other officials, and will be pleased to do what I can to increase their interest in the education of the children under their immediate care.\n\nWith this end in view I shall be pleased if you will furnish me with the information apparently placed before your committee with reference to Agencies in which our officials are not making such effort as they should to enforce the attendance of Indian pupils. I am seeking for this information with a view to taking the matter up with these delinquents.\n\nI may add that this information will be treated as confidential.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) D.A. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nCircular.\n\nOttawa, December 16, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nIt has been brought to the attention of the Department that there is great room for improvement with regard to school attendance of Indian children. It would appear that in many cases Indian parents neglect to send their children to school, and that in some cases they even wilfully detain them at home. Such conduct constitutes an offence under the regulations relating to the education of Indian children, and I would refer you to section 7 of these regulations, which reads as follows:\n\n\"7. If the parent, guardian or other person having charge or control of any child shall neglect or refuse to cause such child to attend some school after being notified as herein required (unless such child has been excused from such attendance as provided by these regulations) the school officer shall make, or cause to be made, a complaint against such parent, guardian or other person before any Justice of the Peace having jurisdiction in the county or district in which the offence occurred, or before the Indian Agent for the locality; and upon conviction, such parent, guardian or other person shall be liable to a fine of not more than two dollars or imprisonment for a period not exceeding ten days, or both.\"\n\nThe Department takes a very serious view of the failure on the part of the Indians to comply with the regulations in these respects, and it has accordingly been decided that henceforward Indians whose conduct is remiss in this matter shall not be regarded as being eligible for relief or other assistance from the Department.\n\nI would ask you, therefore, to kindly bring the attitude of the Department in connection with the subject to the attention of the Indians of your agency and to endeavour to make them fully understand the inevitable consequence of failure on their part to comply with the ruling of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTo all Indian Agents in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and P.E.I.\n\nSupt. Boyd, River Bourgeois, N.S.\nRev. P.O. Ryan, Insp. of R.C.Schools, Maliseet, N.B.\nMEMORANDUM:-\n\nHon. Mr. Meighen:-\n\nMemorandum of conversation between the Hon. the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, Rt. Rev. Bishop McNally and the undersigned on Wednesday morning, December 10th.\n\nThe possibility for carrying out the scheme for Indian education in southern Alberta for the Blood and Peigan Indians outlined below is contingent upon Parliament making the education of Indians at residential schools compulsory. If the statutory authority be not given it would not be possible to successfully conduct the system of schools outlined below.\n\nAt present the educational establishment for these Indians consists of the following schools:\n\nRoman Catholic Church of England.\n\nBoarding school, Blood Reserve. Boarding school, Blood Reserve. This property belongs to the Church.\n\nBoarding school, Peigan Reserve. Boarding school, Peigan Reserve. Buildings belong to the Church.\n\nIndustrial school, High River.\n\nIt is proposed to close the High River school and to dispose of the property; to erect a new industrial school for the Roman Catholic Indians in a locality where agriculture and stock-raising can be properly carried on. When this building is provided it is proposed to close the Peigan boarding school. The boarding school on the Blood reserve shall be maintained for the present as the building, with small expenditure, can be kept in a good state of repair. It is desired as soon as possible to erect for the Church of England children an industrial school where agriculture and stock-raising can be taught, and to then close the two boarding schools.\nThe reasons underlying these recommendations are as follows. The Department considers it good policy to endeavour to arrange amalgamation between the Blood and Peigan Indians to sell the reserve of the latter band and remove them to the Blood reserve. A school cannot be successfully operated on the Peigan reserve owing to the nature of the soil, the same applies to the Blood reserve. As the number of schools will be diminished advantage will accrue to the Church, as at present they find it difficult to provide a competent staff, and large schools can be run more economically than small ones.\n\nAs for compulsory education we find it is difficult to recruit for the schools under the present voluntary system. There is no lack of children of school age, but the apathy or hostility of the Indians defeat the object of the Department. The compulsory system needs some defense, but as the sanitary standard of our school buildings improves, and the health of the children is carefully safeguarded, the strong arguments which might arise from that source disappear. It is proposed by legislation to provide for adequate holidays throughout the year, in order that the parents may not be entirely separated from their children.\n\nDuncan. C.

Nelson  \nDate: June 1920\nSection 9 of the Indian Act, Chapter 61 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, Section 10 of the said Act as enacted by Section 1, Chap. 35, 4-5 George V, 1914, and Section II of the said Act and any regulations made in pursuance of the said sections, are hereby repealed and the following sections substituted therefor:\n\n\"(2). The Governor in Council may establish day schools on an Indian reserve for the children of such reserve or in lieu of day schools may establish industrial schools or boarding schools for the attendance, maintenance and education of the children of such reserve, reserves, or parts of reserves as may be designated by the Superintendent General.\n\n(3). All pupils shall be provided by the Superintendent General with transportation to and from the industrial or boarding schools to which they have been assigned including transportation from such schools to their respective homes for the regular summer vacation and their return to such schools after such vacation.\n\n(4). All schools shall comply with the standards established by the Department in respect of buildings, equipment, teaching and discipline and shall be regularly inspected by qualified officers, and shall be open to inspection by the Chief and Council of a band at such reasonable times as may be agreed upon by the Agent and Principal of the school.\n\n(5). The Superintendent General may apply the annuities and interest moneys of children attending an industrial or boarding school to the maintenance of such schools or to the maintenance of the children themselves.\n\n10. Every Indian child over the age of seven and under the age of fifteen who is physically able shall attend such day school on a reserve or such industrial school or boarding school as may be designated by the Superintendent General, for the full term during which such day school, industrial school or boarding school is open each year.\n\n(2). No Protestant child shall attend a Roman Catholic school or a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices; and\nno Roman Catholic child shall attend a Protestant school or a school conducted under Protestant auspices.\n\n11. The Superintendent General may appoint a truant officer for the enforcement of attendance of children at school and such officer shall, for the purpose of such enforcement, have the powers of a peace officer and shall examine into all cases of truancy within his knowledge or when requested to do so by the Indian Agent, a teacher or a chief of the band, and shall warn the truants and their parents or guardians of the consequences of truancy; and shall notify the parent or guardian in writing to cause the child to attend school forthwith.\n\nAny parent or person with whom any Indian child is resident on a reserve who fails to cause his or her child, as such child between the ages aforesaid, to attend school as required by this section after having received three days' notice so to do by a truant officer, shall, on the complaint of the truant officer, be liable on summary conviction before a justice of the peace or Indian Agent to a fine of not more than two dollars and costs or imprisonment for a period not exceeding ten days or both, and such child may be arrested without warrant and conveyed to school by the truant officer; provided that no parent or other person shall be liable to such penalties if such child is unable to attend school by reason of sickness or other unavoidable cause, has passed the entrance examination for high schools or has been excused by the Indian Agent or Teacher for temporary absence to assist in husbandry or urgent and necessary household duties.\"\nThe amendment provides for the repeal of Sections 9, 10 and 11 of the Act, and of the Regulations made in pursuance of the Sections. I have extracted the clauses which we propose to repeal, and send a copy of the Regulations which were passed by His Excellency in Council on the 6th day of August, 1908. These clauses empower the Governor in Council to make regulations to secure the compulsory education of children at day schools, and their commitment to residential schools in certain circumstances.\n\nA short time ago I attempted to re-draft the Regulations for the purpose of carrying out the purpose of the new amendment, namely, a true system of compulsory education for every Indian child at both classes of schools, day and residential, but it was found that, under the Act, the Governor in Council would not have the power to pass them. I would, therefore, propose to cancel the clauses of the Act and of the Regulations, and to obtain legislative authority for a true system of compulsory education, affecting every Indian child, and both classes of schools.\n\nYou may not think it necessary or advisable to cancel the Regulations by statute, as they may quite as effectively be cancelled by Order in Council. The Justice Department say that the proposed course is unusual, but not improper. I am inclined to favour the omission of any reference to the Regulations in the Bill, and to cancel them by Order in Council when the statute becomes operative.\nIt is self-evident that there is little use in having schools without pupils, and, except in so far as the Regulations provide otherwise, it rests, at present, with the Indians whether their children shall be sent to school or not. Indian educators and the officials of the Department have been under the necessity of securing attendance by various methods, by moral suasion, by veiled compulsion, which has no force back of it, even by special inducements, which were in the nature of payments or favours shown to the parents.\n\nEach Indian child who is new in residence at a boarding or industrial school is placed there with the consent of the parents, given in writing, and, after having once obtained a child, it has been a constant struggle to retain it for the required term, as the parents are largely governed by whim, and attempt, for all sorts of specious reasons, to withdraw their children, and interrupt the course of their education. There is a continuous effort to keep our schools full, but they are not now filled, and there is at present no way of overcoming the indifference of the parents.\n\nWhile the proposed legislation is drastic, it gives the Department control, removes from the Indian parent the responsibility for the care and education of his child, and the best interests of the Indians are promoted and fully protected. The clauses apply to every Indian child over the age of 7 and under the age of 15.\n\nIf a day school is in effective operation, as is the case on many of the reserves in the Eastern provinces, there will be no interruption of such parental sway as exists. Where a day school cannot be properly operated, the child must be taken to an industrial or boarding school. All such schools are open to inspection.\nand must be conducted according to a standard already in existence; they must be conducted under contract. A regular summer vacation is provided for, and the transportation expenses of the children are paid by the Department, which latter clause will, I think, go far to remove the present objection to education at residential schools. It has always been advanced as a hardship that parents and children are separated for years without the possibility of any reunion, and that the child grows away from the life of the reserve, and the observation and affection of the parent, and that, when he is discharged from the school, he is an alien in his own home.\n\nThere are objections to an annual summer vacation from our point of view, but, with the power given us by the proposed amendment to control the movements of pupils, it will be relatively easy to provide for their return, and I think the proposal will do much to popularize education at residential schools.\n\nConsideration is shown by the proposed changes, and, I think, rightly so, to the various religious denominations, who have, since the earliest days, devoted themselves to the cause of Indian education. All our residential schools are conducted by these denominations, and the evangelization and education of the Indian are carried on side by side.\n\nA fair proportion of the expenditure on the maintenance of these schools is provided by the Churches, and, in the past, the greater share of the responsibility for recruiting pupils has fallen upon their shoulders; it is found to be enormous. Their zealous co-operation with the Department, and the generosity which is shown in the provision of funds, entitle them to the support and assistance which a compulsory system of education will provide.\nAs our Indian boarding schools in the province of Ontario are well filled, and, for the most part, have waiting lists, we shall not require to invoke the clauses frequently in these parts. In the three Western provinces, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, day schools are a failure, and it is proposed to close them, and to substitute education at residential schools. This will involve the establishment of some new institutions, but it is proposed to use the Trust Funds of the Indians, as far as possible, for Capital expenditure, as we are enabled to do under the present statute without the consent of the Indians. These remarks apply to British Columbia. The Indians of this province are not in possession of large Trust Funds, and cannot, therefore, contribute, but the obligation to provide buildings is not heavy, and can be gradually assumed and discharged.\n\nAs an answer to an argument which might be raised against the invasion of the rights of the parents over the children, it should be pointed out that All Indians are wards of the Crown, and the western treaties all provide for education as part of the compensation for the cession of the Indian title. As this proviso was inserted at the request of the Indians, and altogether in their interests, it follows that they have certain responsibilities, and must produce their children to be educated.\nBefore the war broke out we had a most progressive policy with reference to the re-building of schools which had become dilapidated and the building of new schools throughout the country. Unfortunately we were stopped in that because we could not get the money. We are limited in every way and are confined within the limit set by Parliament to the appropriation for Indian Affairs. If we have a little more interest in the House of Commons, I am not criticizing it at all, because it has a lot of work to do, but if we could have a standing committee or some committee so that we would have a body of men in the House who would become better acquainted with Indian affairs it would be of advantage.\n\nMR LABOINTRE: Are you in favour of a special committee?\n\nMR SCOTT: I am very much in favour of it. I said to the Minister yesterday, \"Had you done nothing except to get the committee you have appointed you have done a great deal\".\n\nTHE ACTING CHAIRMAN: Mr. Lepoint suggests a standing committee. I understand, would you favour that?\n\nMR SCOTT: Yes, I would. Of course it would have to be very carefully guarded in regard to the summoning of witness and everything of that kind, because every standing committee has standing regulations for its guidance. This is by way of preamble and I hope you will not consider it out of place. As I said I have had to contend in my official life with difficulties, because a civil servant never gets away from obstacles. Our obstacle in regard to Indian education is the lack of a compulsory system, the same as the white people have under the present Act the Governor in Council is\nempowered to pass regulations, and he has passed regulations and we are now conducting our Indian Schools under a regulation passed in 1908, and under the Act these regulations permit us to commit to an industrial school the child who will not or who is not attending the day school on the reserve. That is as far as it permits us to go. Not having any other powers to commit except the child who is not attending the school on the reserve the object of this Bill is to give us power not only to compel children to attend day school on the reserve, but we can take the child, place it in the industrial school without the parents consent. That, of course seems going very far, but I may say that the Bill hardly applies to Eastern Canada at all in any of its provisions, although it extends to all parts of Canada, to Eastern Canada, as well as in the West. But our residential schools in the East are practically full, we have waiting lists, none of them can accommodate any more pupils, and the compulsory clause almost entirely affects the Western part of the Dominion, although it may affect certain cases in the East when at least we have an Indian abusing or neglecting his child.\n\nIn the West we have a great deal of difficulty in getting children to school. I may say that our school system is somewhat peculiar in that the churches cooperate with us in the work of education, and I have always been in favour of that because of the success which has attended the work and which is due in a great measure to the cooperation of the churches. In 1910, when Mr. Oliver was Minister, he took a very enlightened view of education and he called all heads of different denominations the Anglicans, the Roman Catholic, the Methodist and the Presbyterians, to Ottawa, and they had a conference and there has been a decided improvement as a result. The churches are conducting boarding schools, under a\nContract system, the Government consenting to an increase in the per capita grant which I may say is not now sufficient; the cost of living has so increased, but the churches loyally made up the deficiency out of their own pockets. That is the church is a partner to a very great extent, and I should say that about one third of the funds for required for Indian education are provided by the churches. At that time Mr. Oliver agreed to spend a certain amount every year in the erection of new buildings, as well as increasing the per capita grant, and this policy was continued by the Borden Government and Parliament was very generous in its appropriations until the war broke out. The difficulty in the West is with the almost savage people we have there, to get them to realize the benefit of education and to send their children voluntarily. Now the educators who are conducting these schools have resorted to all sorts of means to get these children to attend. I will not say that they have resorted to bribery, that is not the proper term to use, but they have really paid to have the children brought to school, and the difficulty is to keep them there/they get there, because just as soon as the child enters the school the parents want to take it out for some reason or other, either because of supposed sickness or somebody has died, and they want to get the children out of school. The Bill is to give us control of that and we have endeavoured to take the sting out of the separation of the child from its parents and the breaking up of the home life; the Indians' parents are very fond of their children. There has always been every effort made and opportunity taken to study their character - I am speaking of the Tribes in the West now, not of those in the East, because they deal with their children the same as we do. I have\nendeavoured to mitigate the separation as much as possible by providing that there shall be a holiday every year, and that the Department shall pay the expenses of sending their children home and bringing them back so that the Indian parents will be assured of seeing their children running around the Tepee for a month or six weeks every summer at least. I am very doubtful whether that is a benefit to the children because if we take the children from the vermin ridden shack with lice, bed-bugs and vermin of all kinds, and bring them to the schools, clean them and clothe them, and give them the benefit of nourishing food and then sent them back to the place whence they came - that does not apply or course to all cases - it does not tend to improve them in regard to the education of the children. To point to the benefit of the policy of the Department I may say that not more than 25 years ago we were practically feeding the Indians of the West, after the disappearance of the buffalo. Canada took up the obligation of feeding these people and keeping them alive. To-day we see hardly one-tenth of the gratuitous feeding in the Northwest Territories, the Indians are practically self-supporting on account of our policy. I have brought pictures here of schools. When I took charge of the schools I made up my mind that they would be considered only from the point of view of the public interest and not from the standpoint that anything was good enough for the Indians. That was the trouble in the old days, the Department put up cheap places which very soon became dilapidated and filled with tuberculosis germs so that they were unfit for the purposes for which they were erected. The institutions we have erected in recent years have been such that any member of the community can go into them and be proud of them, and the plans we have drawn and the schools we have\nput up since that time for the Indian children are such as we have put up in Portage La Prairie. I have brought these pictures for your inspection in order to let you understand that we are not taking these people and putting them into institutions that we cannot be proud of.\n\n(Pictures distributed and examined by the Committee)\n\nThese schools are conducted under control of the Government, the Government have a contract, a copy of which I have here, and I will leave it for the information of the Committee. The contract is with the Bishop of the Diocese or with the Head of the Presbyterian or Methodist churches conducting the schools and they are expected to keep the schools up to a certain standard, the schools are under inspection of our own officers, by our agents and inspectors, and in some cases also, particularly day schools, they are inspected by the provincial inspectors. I do not think that I can say very much more about the educational clauses. The purpose of the Bill is to give us control over the attendance at the day schools.\n\nTHE ACTING CHAIRMAN: Under the present regulations you have simply control of the schools on the reserve?\n\nMR. SCOTT: Yes.\n\nTHE ACTING CHAIRMAN: Now you extend it to the other schools?\n\nMR. SCOTT: Yes, where the Indian pupil fails to attend we can issue a warrant and take him to the Industrial school. In the West we have found that the reserve day schools are an absolute failure, we have tried to stimulate attendance in every way, by a warm mid-day meal, sometimes by conveying the children to the school, the distance over which the Indians are\nscattered in the West renders it almost impossible to get any effectual education at the Indian day schools.\n\nAll the Indian educators, I may say, are in favour of this Bill; If I had wished to issue a circular and asked them for their opinions in order to bombard the Committee I could have got replies from all of them, but I did not do that. I have several letters here from ecclesiastics and others, as follows:\n\nExhibit No 18.\n\nBishop's Court,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nCanada.\n\n3rd April, 1920.\n\nMr. dear Mr. Scott:\n\nI thank you for sending me a copy of the Bill No 14, the Act to amend the Indian Act.\n\nIt is very gratifying to me to observe that provision is being made for what I have so strongly urged for many years, namely, compulsory education at school of the children of Indian parents. As you know from conversation with me at various times, I have always felt that the absence of such a provision was the chief weakness of our Indian School system.\n\nIn the case of our white settlers, with, presumably, their greater intelligence we find it necessary to call in the aid of compulsion in the matter of school attendance, surely we need it all the more for our Indian schools, from their long past history, cannot be expected to place the same value on education.\n\nOn behalf of the church which I represent, therefore, I hail with great satisfaction the prospect of having some compulsory measure incorporated into the new Act. It is not quite clear to me that the clause will apply to day school as well as.\nboarding schools, Surely it will, for I am a great believer in well conducted day schools and I see much less difficulty in enforcing attendance at these than at the boarding schools.\n\nTrusting that the legislation may be carried through and promising in our missions to do all in my power to make it effective, if it does go through\n\nI am, most sincerely,\n\nYours,\n\n(Sgd.) Rupert Land.\n\nExhibit No 19.\n\nEdmonton, Canada.\nApril 9th, 1920.\n\nMr. Duncan G. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nThe future hope of our Indian race is in the education of their children. This conviction is based upon over twenty years experience in our Indian educational work. During most of the twenty years I have been in charge of the Educational work of the Indians under the care of the Methodist Church, and I am strongly of the conviction that the Indian Act should make education compulsory.\n\nI have discussed the question with teachers, principals of schools, government officials, officials of our Missionary Societies and officials of other churches, and the conviction of all concerned is strongly in favour of a compulsory law for the education of the Indian children.\n\nHoping that your measure providing compulsion will be sanctioned by Parliament.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools.\nNew Westminster B.C. April 9, 1920.\n\nDuncan C Scott, Esq.\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nWith regard to the measure now before Parliament which has for its object to make Indian attendance at Residential Schools compulsory, I respectfully beg to inform you that it has my hearty support.\n\nOn the main land in British Columbia, I have for a number of years been in close touch with our Residential Indian Schools, and therefore I am in a position to speak of them from personal knowledge. Now the knowledge I have gained is, that they are doing a grand work for the moral, intellectual and physical training of the Indians. The parents of the children in nearly all cases realize this full well, and consequently we have little difficulty here, in filling all our Boarding and Industrial Schools to their utmost capacity. The strong arm of the law to enforce attendance will I confidently assert be seldom needed in the schools under my jurisdiction. Cases of course will arise where parents or guardians may be too indolent to exercise their obligations; in these cases I quite believe that discretionary power should be vested in the Government to compel such parents or guardians to give every child the advantages of the education and training such as our schools afford.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Sgd) J.Walsh, C.M.I.\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.\nDeputy Supt. General Ind. Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI most sincerely hope that the proposed Amendment to the Act will prevail. The Indian is capable and in most cases worthy but he will not move without some compulsion. As I write an Indian makes admission for two boys about twelve years of age, neither one can speak a word of English although within easy distance of a good school. Lack of food is now forcing him to action, but it is almost too late for the boys. Ten years intimate association with the Indian has fully convinced me that compulsory education and a steady process of enfranchisement is absolutely necessary in the best interests of the Indian people. Some of them seem afraid, or unwilling to take the step, but it should not be delayed on that account. A child who can walk, but is afraid to try, must be urged or lost.\n\nI am, Dear Mr. Scott,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Sgd) S.R.

Since being in this school have had quite a number of pupils from the reserve, and have found them excellent pupils in every respect. The trouble seems to be that so many of the children do not attend school regularly enough to enable them to pass the High School Entrance examination, and thus we never get them.\n\nIn conversation with many Indians they tell me that the Chief are the ones who are opposing the Bill to grant the Indians the Franchise, as that would mean the loss of some of their power.\n\nI believe that you are doing the Indians a real service in the stand you are taking, and I wish you every success with your measure.\n\nYours most truly,\n\n(sgd) T. J. Hicks\n\nThe letter from O. E. Mathieu, Archbishop of Regina, reads as follows:\nRegina, Sask., 3 April, 1920.\n\nTo Mr. D. C. Scott,\nSuperintendent of the Indians,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI arrived from the East only this week. I was willing to go to Lebret and study this law with the priests who for years have lived with the Indians. I think better to write you immediately and tell you, as it is your wish, what I think of this law. I know that you are only willing the good of these poor Indians so worthy of our sympathy.\n\nIt is sure that they must be obliged to send their children to schools. God only knows what good your industrial schools have done to these poor children, we have only to see what are these children when they enter these schools and what they are when they leave them.\n\nAnd for me, they should be obliged to send their children to industrial schools and not, at least now, allow them to have day schools in their reserve. Now they are still unable to give their children a real good formation which will be lacking if they can send their children to day schools. And what trouble will have the Government to have that law followed? I do not think that that change in the law would be to the advantage of the Indians and it would probably endanger the existence of our industrial schools which are doing so much good.\n\nDo you not think that the Article 5 in the first page is a dangerous one? I would be afraid to give such power to the chief and to the children's parents. This, I think, would cause much trouble.\n\nWould it not be better also to oblige these children to stay a little longer in the Industrial schools? On account of their nature, they require more\ntime than the others to be formed. To allow them to\nbe free at fifteen years is it not too soon? Difference, yes.\n\nYours sincerely devoted,\n\n(sgd) O. B. Mathieu\n\nArch. of Regina\n\nMr. Harold: This Bill does not really affect\nthe Six Nation Indians as far as their education is concerned,\nexcept forcing the attendance at the day schools.\n\nMr. Scott: Yes, they have a good system, if they\nwould carry it out, of enforcing attendance at day school.\nThey have their truant officers.\n\nMr. Harold: There is a school at Brantford.\n\nMr. Scott: Yes, and there is a waiting list of\nover sixty pupils trying to get into that school.\n\nMr. Harold: It would be advisable to have any\nenlargement?\n\nMr. Scott: Yes, it would.\n\nThe Acting Chairman: It is not compulsory there.\n\nMr. Scott: No.\n\nThe Acting Chairman: It would be better if it were.\n\nMr. Scott: It would give this advantage: That if\nthere were a case of a Six Nations Indian abusing his child,\nwe could step in and take the child under this Bill.\n\nMr. Harold: That is not any more drastic than\nour other laws in that regard.\n\nMr. Scott: No.\n\nMr. Lapointe: Are there Industrial Schools in all\nthe Provinces?\n\nMr. Scott: None in the Provinces of Quebec, Nova\nScotia or any of the Maritime Provinces. We accommodate some\nof the pupils from Quebec in the Ontario schools. There is a very\nlarge school up in the County of Algoma, near Spanish River.\n\nMr. Harold: Is there not this difference in the\ntreatment of the Indians under this Act: That we can separate\nthe children from the parents and send them to the Industrial\nSchools, you cannot do that with the white children.\n\nMr. Scott: There is that essential difference, you cannot do it in the case of a white child unless it has been abused by the parent that provision we take, it is in the interest of the child and also of the parents. The pressure that came on our Indian schools when the war broke out and the high cost of living became general, was very great because the Indian would unload his children on us, for the reason that it immediately became evident to him that it would cost him more to support the child at that period than before the war so that it was purely a matter of self interest. Before that he did not think of it at all. After that he began to think \"Well I had better put my children in the schools\".\n\nMr. Delisle: I want to know, in Caughnawaga what would be the outcome if the parents refused to comply with the regulations as to attendance in the day school? How would you take the child?\n\nMr. Scott: We can go into the home and take the child.\n\nMr. Delisle: I will have the privilege of exercising the Habeas Corpus and taking that child back.\n\nThe Acting Chairman: Sub-section 2 of section 10 vests the truant officer with this power to take the child in case of truancy.\n\nMr. Hill: I wish to ask Mr. Scott a question regarding Industrial Schools. The children from seven to fifteen are taken. After they are fifteen years of age, what becomes of them? They are let go from the schools.\n\nMr. Scott: No, we keep them until they are eighteen. I think that it is too high and that we keep them too long. That is a matter the Indian educators are not unanimous about.\n\nMr. Hill: It seems to me the Indians should be given more advantage on the lines of education.\nSo it seems to me that the Indians should be given more education. In the Mohawk Institute at Brantford where our people are graduated they receive regular training, and after they have become graduates, they are simply allowed to drift, but if they were given proper education they would become an asset to the people. It seems to me that if they were given more commercialized education it would be better.\n\nThe Acting Chairman: Do you mean to say you object to the age? There has been no objection.\n\nMr. Hill: The clause provides between the age of 7 and 15 they leave at 15 and that is the age at which they should be taken care of.\n\nMr. Scott: There is no difficulty about that at all. It is reasonable the change will be made.\n\nMr. Reid: Would you be in favour? I am speaking now of the Province of Saskatchewan, of having the Government school inspectors.\n\nMr. Scott: Yes, I am quite agreeable to that.\n\nMr. Reid: I think it would be wise to have an arrangement made between the Department of Provincial Government to secure that inspection.\n\nMr. Scott: I would recommend that to the Minister. In the East all the Inspectors inspect the day schools, but in British Columbia and in the West we have not yet taken that step. I suppose the development of the Provinces up to a certain time has been slow and the Inspectors have been very much overworked. I discussed this question with the Minister of Education of Saskatchewan and he thought it was putting a great burden upon the Inspectors, but they might be prepared to do it now. We pay the fee for the inspection by the Provincial Inspectors. I am in\nMr. Hill: This subsection 4 of section 9, dealing with compulsory education, it seems to me that all the way through this Bill the powers given to the Superintendent General are too great. There is no consulting the Indian in any way, he is given power to make regulations with regard to the inspection of the schools. It seems to me that it ought to be inserted there that the Indians should be consulted.\n\nMr. Scott: That is all folly. Of course the Indians know what the regulations are, and if they want to have them changed they can ask for it, and if it is reasonable the change will be made, but by restricting the Department to consulting the Indians as to what should be done, in that case we will never get anything done at all. The Indians have absolute freedom, there is no restriction placed upon them at all. Now, with reference to the contentious clause dealing with the enfranchisement.\n\nThe Acting Chairman: I might say that this regulation is very similar to that dealing with the education of the white people. The superintendents of education in the various provinces have the same powers as are given to the Superintendent General in this clause without consulting the people.\n\nMr. Wilson: I might say after 27 or 28 years' experience in western Canada, I went when that country was almost entirely peopled by Indians and I have lived with them almost continually ever since, and our experience has been that the system of education of the Indians has been a failure.\nDue to the fact that the people are living on the reserves are scattered and it has been almost impossible to get the children to school. There have been a number of attempts made to get the children at the ordinary day schools, and now they are turning to the industrial schools as a remedy. There are, as I understand it, different conditions in the West to those which exist in the East. The Indians there have not had the privileges and the opportunities for advancement which you have had in the East and it has been found by experience that there must be some method of compelling them to send their children to school. It would be useless to attempt to get the parents in the West to send their children to the industrial school. You might talk to them for an hour trying to persuade them without success, and what are you going to do about it? You must have some compulsory law.\n\nMr. Hill: Our people are an advanced people, and they are dissatisfied with the system of education we have on the reserve, and it seems to me that if this committee would make such provisions that we could be given an opportunity under the law to run our own schools in such a way as will meet the desires of the people.\n\nThe Acting Chairman: Will you take a note of that suggestion, Mr. Scott?\n\nMr. J. M. Barnhart: I was a school trustee where I live, now we are handicapped right here in our own school because we have no control of the school. We are handicapped with not having anything to say in regard to the schoolmaster, we found out he was no good, but we could not remove him because the Indian Agent was with him and he had the law.

Taken from file 136862-6\nToronto, Ontario, April 16th 1920.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., C.B.,\nDeputy Inspector General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been absent on a visit to the Pacific Coast, or I should have written to you at an earlier date on a matter which I consider of vital importance to the future of the Indian wards of the Dominion Government.\n\nI have followed with the greatest interest the proposed amendments to the Indian Act now before Parliament, and have noticed with great regret various reports in the daily press which seem to indicate the development of considerable opposition to the same.\n\nThis opposition I believe to be largely \"manufactured\" and to be of a nature which, if allowed to prevail, will hamper or frustrate the most far-reaching and promising scheme of reform for the benefit of the Indians which has ever been presented for the consideration of Parliament.\nI refer, especially, to the proposal to make compulsory the education of Indian children, and to secure the same through the agencies of boarding schools.\n\nAs you are aware I have been carrying on, personally, for some years a series of wide investigations into the whole subject. In these investigations I have gone as far North as Fort MacPherson, Peel River, Mackenzie River Delta.\n\nI began those investigations as a doubter in, if not an opponent of, the boarding school system. The facts I have encountered have converted me into an earnest adherent of that system, as the only system which holds within it the possibility of a solution, within reasonable limits of time, of the whole problem of Indian education and, therefore, of the solution of the ultimate problem of Indian enfranchisement and citizenship.\n\nI may mention one fact as indicative of the type of evidence which has weighed with me in producing in my mind the change from the position of a \"doubter\" to that of a convinced supporter of the boarding school system: everywhere I went I found a consensus of opinion to the effect that the children of ex-pupils, taken as a whole, were of a distinctly higher type in mental and moral receptivity and capacities, than were the children of Indian parents who had not received the benefits of such education.\n\nThe boarding school system, I repeat, presents in my judgement the only satisfactory solution of the problem.\nCoupled with compulsory education that system should be, and can be I believe, made the efficient instrument for the bringing about of the great end which every well-wisher of the Indian wards of the nation must have at heart, i.e., the progressive raising of the whole Indian people from the depressed position of wards, to the higher position of self-respecting, self-supporting, intelligent, well-educated citizens of the Dominion.\n\nPlease pardon this free expression of my convictions on the subject,\n\nAnd believe me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nP.S. I am forwarding a copy of this letter to Mr. B. Nicholson, M.P., a member of our Indian Committee.\n\nS.F.\nReasons which led the Department to recommend Amendments to the Statutes with reference to Indian Education, and objects to be attained by the Amendments.\n\nThe present educational clauses of the Indian Act provide that the Governor General in Council may pass regulations for compulsory attendance at schools, and regulations were passed by the Governor General in Council in 1908 which now govern. The powers conferred by the Act have been held by the law officers to deal simply with day schools, and it is held that there is no power to provide for the compulsory attendance of Indians at boarding or industrial schools. The regulations provide for the commitment of an Indian child to an industrial or boarding school when the child is not attending the local day school.\n\nThe provisions of the amendment give the Superintendent General power to compel the attendance of Indian children at day schools and at residential schools, and their residence at the latter for definite periods. The provisions for compulsory attendance at day schools will be operative generally throughout the Dominion wherever day schools are conducted. The provisions with reference to compulsory attendance at residential schools will be almost wholly confined to the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. The clauses may occasionally be invoked in Ontario and the eastern provinces for the protection of neglected children or children who require restraint.\n\nThe experience of the Department and those interested in Indian education, extending over a period of thirty years, has convinced them that in the prairie provinces and British Columbia day schools have failed to be a successful factor in educating and civilising the Indians. The causes contributory to this failure are the difficulties of securing a constant attendance of the pupils. The reserves in the west\nare usually large, and the Indian habitations are scattered far and wide within the boundaries of the reserves. The Indians are not collected into village communities. The children, therefore, have to come fairly long distances to school. In many of the localities, the Indians are still hunting Indians, and when they leave for the hunting grounds in the late summer, they have of necessity to take with them their families. The Department endeavoured for a time to overcome these difficulties by providing conveyance to and from the school, and attempted also to increase the attendance by providing a warm mid-day meal for the pupils. The result of these efforts was merely to increase the cost of the schools without materially increasing their efficiency.\n\nThe attached statement will give some idea of the unsatisfactory nature of the service at Indian day schools.\n\nThe difficulties of maintaining a constant number of pupils in residence in boarding and industrial schools has been equally great. The difficulty has arisen from different causes, but has been in our experience equal to the obstacles described in dealing with the day school attendance. Owing to the apathy of Indians who have not progressed very far from the aboriginal state, it has been difficult to get their support for this class of school, and the Principals of the schools and the Indian Agents, without any compulsory power, find it difficult to maintain constant attendance. Uniform and constant attendance is the very life-blood of the school, because the financial aid conferred by the Government depends on the number of pupils in residence. We are subject to the expense of the Indian parents.\n\nIt has been proved conclusively after thirty years' experience that the only real progress is made by the Indians who have been educated in residential schools, where they have the benefit of agricultural training and training in domestic\nemployments.\n\nIt is, therefore, proposed to consider the class of residential schools as the best system for the prairie provinces and British Columbia, and to develop that system as far as possible consistent with the funds from time to time placed at the disposal of the Department by Parliament. It is proposed also to use the available funds of the Indians for their own education. It is proposed to close day schools whose usefulness is nil, and to gradually establish a residential school system which will accommodate the healthy children of school age throughout these provinces.\nChristian Island, June 25, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nCompulsory school attendance is agreed upon providing only a qualified teacher is employed and subject to the approval of the Chief and Council.\n\nYour humble servant,\nHenry Jackson,\nPresident.\nResolved that we the Grand General Indian Council of Ontario in Session at Wikwemikong, Manitoulin Island, June 15th, 1920, strongly recommend and request The Committee in charge of Bill 14 respecting Indian Schools, that a clause be inserted in the proposed Legislation that only qualified teachers shall be employed to teach in Indian Schools subject to the approval of the Chief and Council.\n\nSigned on behalf of the Grand General Indian Council of Ontario.\n\nJoseph Wabegijig,\n2nd Vice President.\n\nJ.

It is not intended, however, to allow this privilege to be used indiscriminately, but only in the case of non-pupils whose admission is approved, and pupils who are allowed home on annual holidays. All transportation expenses should be kept down to the lowest possible point and proper vouchers should be forwarded, with receipts for the expenditure incurred attached. This will only apply in the case of transportation expenses of children from October 1st, last.

It is considered that the chiefs of the various bands should perform the duties of truant officers. This is being done by the chiefs of the various bands in the Crooked Lakes Agency, without any charge for the service. The chiefs should have sufficient interest and influence to see that all the children of school age attend regularly. You might consult them regarding the matter.\n\nSix copies of the Amendment to the Indian Act, assented to first of July, last, are enclosed herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst.

His reply was that he was not fit for the position and claimed that the pupils were worked too hard in the school, and that the older girls were made to work in the laundry and handle cold water, during their monthly periods, and for these reasons to, he did not want to act as a truant officer. After threshing this matter out for an hour or so, Counsellor Hugh McKay suggested that a vote of the band be taken, this was done 14 voted for and 13 against. Our members were then nominated for the position of truant officers as follows: Counsellor Hugh McKay, John Black, Charley Singoose and Frank Seaton. The result was as follows.\n\nHugh McKay, 9 votes, John Black, 4, Frank Seaton, 3 and Charley Singoose, 6. Five present would not vote. Counsellor McKay being elected and will act, but the matter of taking the children to school, will he be entitled to payment for their transport as the distance over 20 miles at his expense would not be just to him.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 30, 1926\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th instant, in which you report that Councillor Hugh McKay has been elected tenant officer on the Weyapu-secanape Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that his appointment as tenant officer is approved.\n\nWith regard to the transport of pupils, I beg to say that transport will be paid for new pupils entering the school and for pupils returning home after their discharge, also, in the case of pupils going and returning on annual leave. It is not intended, however, to allow this privilege to be used indiscriminately but only in the case of new pupils whose admission is approved and those pupils whose discharge has been approved and pupils who are allowed home on annual holidays.\n\nWith reference to the latter, I may say that in the case of pupils whose homes are at a considerable distance from the school and the cost of whose transportation would be heavy, authority must first be obtained before the Department will be responsible for the expenditure incurred in allowing them to go to their homes for their annual holidays. All transportation expenses should be kept down to the lowest possible point and proper vouchers should be forwarded, with the receipts for the expenditure incurred, attached.\n\nThe above provisions will only apply in the case of transportation of children from January 1, 1927. The Department will rely on the principal and yourself to see that no undue expense is occasioned in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

You will note that the section reads in part as follows: \"The Superintendent General may appoint any officer or person to be a truant officer to enforce the attendance of Indian children at school.\"\n\nI am enclosing an official writing, so appointing the members of the R. C. M. P. This action will remove certain legal difficulties if the Police encounter resistance on the part of Indian parents. If, at any time, a truant officer wishes to proceed against an Indian parent under this section, copies of the necessary written warning to truants can be secured from the various Indian agents.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

I cannot understand how the Magistrate allowed the technical objection of Mr. Woodward, the Barrister who defended the Indians. Section 10-2 specifically states the truant officer shall notify in writing. I may say that the truant officer, when signing the warning notice to truants, does not designate the school, but indicates which one has already been designated as the school for the child in question to attend.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

BALL, INDIAN AGENT, VERNON, B. C.\ndated June 30, 1927.\n\nOriginal on 164-10-1\n\nIn reply I have to say that the word \"designated\"\nmust be construed in keeping with the general sense of the\nSection. The narrow construction that has been placed upon\nthis word by the accused would imply that the Superintendent\nGeneral to comply with the Act would have to write a personal\nletter to the parents of all the Indian children in the\nDominion of Canada. Surely no one would seriously uphold\nsuch a contention. The word \"designated\" in the Section has\na general and a particular significance. Where a school is\nequipped and maintained on a reserve by the Superintendent\nGeneral for the education of the children residing on such\nreserve, as in the case of the Penticton school, that is a\ngeneral designation by the Superintendent General of that\nschool for the attendance of such children. If a child is\ntaken away from its home and sent to some other school, on\nthe instructions of the Superintendent General, that would be\na particular designation of the school which such child would\nbe obliged to attend. That is the intention of the Act and\nthe interpretation which has always been placed upon it.\n\"G\" Division.\n\nGreat Slave Lake Subdistrict.\n\nG.162-8.\n\nFort Smith.

Fletcher, of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, dated at Fort Smith, June 7th, 1927, which has been forwarded to me by the Officer Commanding the Mounted Police at Edmonton.\n\nWill you please let me know if the Mission Schools referred to by Inspector Fletcher have been designated by Order-in-Council, as required by Section 9 of the Indian Act.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCortlandt Starnes,\nCommissioner.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA,\nOntario.\nJuly 26, 1927.\n\nDear Colonel Starnes:\n\nI have your C. 148-9 of the 15th instant, with enclosures, and in reply I wish to point out that Section 9 of the Indian Act has to do with the establishment of Indian schools. Section 10 refers to the compulsory attendance of Indian children at whatever school is designated by the Superintendent General. The Mission Schools at Chipewyan and Vermilion in northern Alberta and at Providence, Hay River and Resolution in the N.W.T. are all Indian residential schools and are maintained by Parliamentary Appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nI take it that the word \"designated\" as used in Section 10 of the Act must be construed in keeping with the general meaning of the section. Where a school is maintained in any locality by the Superintendent General, such maintenance is a general designation by him of the school for the attendance of the Indian children in the vicinity. If a child is placed in a residential school by instruction of the Superintendent General or his representative, then there is a particular designation of the school.\n\nThe foregoing is the intention of the Act and is the interpretation which has always been placed upon it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nColonel Cortlandt Starnes,\nCommissioner, R.C.M.P.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 20, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 100 of the 11th instant concerning the advisability of appointing the Mounted Police at Wascana truant officer for the Assiniboine Indian agency.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police were appointed truant officers to enforce the attendance of the Indian children of Canada at school, on the 7th day of February, 1927. Under the provisions of Subsection 2, Section 10, of the Indian Act, they have been vested with the powers and have the authority conferred on truant officers by the said section. The detachment at Wascana can get the official appointment in writing from the Commissioner of the R. C. M. P.\n\nMay I point out that, if a truant officer at any time wishes to proceed against an Indian parent under this section, the written warning to truants, as prepared by the Department should be used. In case you have not a supply of this form, I am enclosing a few copies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. D. McLean,\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. J. Hamilton, Esq.,\nAssiniboine Indian Agency,\nSintaluta, Sask.\nNovember 5, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Letts:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, concerning the recruiting problem at St. George's Indian Residential School. The Department also wishes the school to be filled, in order that it will give maximum service to the Indian community. I am writing to Mr. Graham and to Mr. Barber, indicating their duties in connection with recruiting and giving instructions to cooperate freely with you until the school has a full complement of pupils.\n\nThe general duty of recruiting for a residential school is divided between the school management and the Indian agent. An institution cannot hope to fill its vacancies of the Indian community which it serves, unless the principal or his representative has personal contact with the more populous reserves. The school management's recruiting activity should be aided by Indian agents and the Department's other field officers. Whenever the principal's best efforts fail, in the case of children who are eligible and should be in school, the Indian agent should then take the initiative and, if necessary - other methods having failed - should ask the Department for authority to compel under Section 10 of the Indian Act. In cases of compulsion, department officers only should appear, if the services of the police are necessary. I expect agents to make full reports before recommending authority to commit to school under Section 10.\n\nI may say that in certain sections of Canada, the Department has not yet enforced the compulsory clause of the Act. No notice to this end has been taken in the Nicola agency, and the Department will make a decision after reviewing Mr. Barber's report. As far as the Lytton agency is concerned, I am satisfied that compulsion should be exercised where necessary, and Mr. Graham is being so informed.\n\nIf the results of the present action are not satisfactory, do not hesitate to write the Department, indicating where there are children who should be in St. George's. Instructions will then be given to the proper officers.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. A. E. Letts,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Res. School,\nLytton, B.C.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nOn File 124862 - No. 6 (Closed) (Amendments to the Indian Act) dated May, 1920, there is a brief concerning the amendments to the Indian Act, which has to do with the compulsory clauses. It was the intention to make it possible to place children in the residential schools, particularly in western Canada, as the day schools there have been more or less unsuccessful. There is a statement, showing the cost of day schools in the prairies. The average attendance was about 40% of the enrolment and the per capita cost, \u00a771. There is also on this file correspondence from church officers, principals of schools and departmental officers, with reference to the advisability of having compulsory education.\n\n[Signature]\nFebruary 16, 1929.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDR. SCOTT,\n\nWith reference to the proposed changes in the educational sections of the Indian Act, I wish to recommend that\n\n1. Section 10 (1) be amended to include children in their 15th year, i.e., compulsion from the 7th to the 16th birthday.\n\n2. Section 98 (1) (F) be amended to conform.\n\n3. Section 104 (2) (F) be amended to conform.\n\n4. A subsection (4) be added to Section 10, so that the provisions of the section may apply to the 15th birthday in the case of any particular Indian child who, in the opinion of the Superintendent General, would be granted a decided disservice if discharged from industrial or boarding school at an earlier age.\n\nIn explanation of my 4th recommendation, I wish to state that, in a few cases, the Department has found it advisable to bend every energy towards keeping in a residential school a pupil who should not be placed in the custody of the parent or parents at the ages of 14 or 15. I might mention two instances as examples. The Department refused to discharge Kathleen Clancey from the Chapleau School, even after repeated requests from the father. The mother was dead and the father was a Six Nation Indian, who eked out an existence, begging, etc., in the streets of Hamilton. In another case, the Department refused to send Aggie and Christie Olson, two attractive and accomplished 14-year-old pupils at Brandon, to the mother, a Brokenhead woman, who wanted her daughters to join her in a life of prostitution. In these cases, the Department and the churches managing the schools had a moral obligation to thwart the efforts of an irresponsible parent. The proposed section would give power to keep such children in school until they had reached their 15th birthday. At this age, they would be better able to choose wisely for themselves.\n\n5. The words \"to the maintenance of such school or\" be deleted from Section 9 (6).\n\nRussell V. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, April 15, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 108-13 of the 27th ultimo, and in reply I have to authorize you to enforce Section 10 of the Indian Act whenever you consider such action really advisable. The Department suggests that moral suasion be used as far as possible; but, when it is wise to make an example, you should commit the child to school, using the services of the R. C. M. P., if necessary. Only in extremities should a parent be proceeded against under this Section of the Act. The Department considers that the arresting of the child, after due warning, is all that is usually required.\n\nI am enclosing copies of the formal notice to parents in connection with failure to have a child attend school regularly. These should be used before arresting a child. For the purposes of this section of the Act, the Indian agent and Indian constables may be considered truant officers. Further, any officer of the R. C. M. P. who applies to his headquarters can secure an appointment as truant officer, under Section 10 of the Indian Act. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police have been appointed truant officers and have been vested with the powers and have the authority conferred on truant officers by Section 10 of the Indian Act.\n\nBefore arresting a child, you should be sure that the child is physically fit and of school age. Whenever there is doubt regarding the religion, care should be taken that the child is committed to the proper school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nThere is a small matter which often comes up in the North country, a matter on which I would like an authoritative decision. It has not until now concerned me particularly, but now that I am interested I cannot get a clear definition of the law.\n\nIn Pelican Narrows, for example, the Catholic Indians are told it is compulsory they send their children to the Indian Boarding School at Sturgeon Landing, about a hundred miles distant. The Indians would send their children by command of their priests, for reasons of religious obedience, but they are also told that it is a matter of law, and that they have no choice in the matter in any event. We all know that school attendance is compulsory, but also know that a white person in an isolated district cannot (or at least is not) be forced to send his children a hundred miles away from home to attend school. We also know that there are certain laws respecting Indians which differ from laws governing other individuals.\n\nBut on the other hand, the protestant preachers tell the protestant Indians at Pelican Narrows that sending their children to Lac La Ronge, Indian Boarding School for Protestants, also a hundred miles removed, is not compulsory, either by law nor by religious compulsion. As a result, only three or four, to my knowledge, attend, the balance of the children being without any schooling. (And better off)\n\nI should be very pleased to get this matter straight: IS IT COMPULSORY INDIANS SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOLS A HUNDRED MILES REMOVED FROM THEIR HOMES AND SOMETIMES THREE HUNDRED MILES, and if not, can the parents, once informed of this, call at these schools at will and bring their children home?\n\nI want you to understand that I am determined to find out about this; that in appealing to you direct I am saving expense and trouble in making a test case, and that is the reason I do not want to commit myself until I am sure of my ground. Common sense would argue that a couple, whether Indian or what as long as they are classified as human, could hardly be expected to surrender their children between ages of eight and eighteen except in clear cases where neglect, non-support, or any other delinquency on their part was properly proved. But laws are not always dictated by common sense.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAxel Nielsen\nBox 21\nCranberry Portage Man.\nCranberry Portage Manitoba.\nSept. 8, 1930\nOttawa, September 20, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to the compulsory education of Indian children. I may say the Statute reads that every Indian child between the full ages of 7 and 16 years, who is physically able, shall attend such day, industrial or boarding school as may be designated by the Superintendent General. Whenever the Department is satisfied that it is in the best interests of the particular child to enforce the Act, such action is taken. With particular reference to the Indian children living at or near Cranberry Portage, the Department relies on recruiting officers for the respective residential schools to select the children that require residential school training. I know of no case where a Cranberry Portage Indian child has been forced to school under the provisions of the Indian Act.\n\nI may add that the Guy Indian Residential School at Sturgeon Landing and the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School have been established and are maintained by the Department for the education of Roman Catholic and Anglican Indian children, respectively. This provision has been made because day schools cannot be conducted successfully among the bush or hunting Indians. I trust that you and others interested will give every assistance to the recruiting officers from these schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nAlex. Nielsen, Esq.,\nBox 21,\nCranberry Portage,\nMan.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Principal of our Lesser Slave Lake School informs me in a letter recently to hand that he was shown in the Police office at Grouard, a copy of \"a new Indian Act\", passed in April of this year, wherein it is stated that Treaty Indian children are admitted to the Residential Schools at the age of seven years and are permitted to remain until the age of sixteen years. If any change has been made in the Indian Act as indicated above, or in any other way affecting the age limit of pupils in the Residential Schools, I shall be obliged if you will kindly advise me of the same.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, October 28, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to changes in the compulsory education clauses of the Indian Act. Subsection 1 of Section 10 was repealed in April last, and the following substituted therefor:\n\n\"Every Indian child between the full ages of seven and sixteen years who is physically able shall attend such day, industrial or boarding school as may be designated by the Superintendent General for the full periods during which such school is open each year; provided that where it has been made to appear to the satisfaction of the Superintendent General that it would be detrimental to any particular Indian child to have it discharged from school on attaining the full age of sixteen years, the Superintendent General may direct that such child be retained at school for such further period as may seem to be advisable, but not beyond the full age of eighteen years, and in such case the provisions of this section with respect to truancy shall apply to such child and its parents, guardians or persons with whom such child resides during such further period of school attendance\".\n\nYou will note that the Statute is now quite clear that Indian children may be compelled to attend until their 16th birthday. In certain instances, the Department can also compel attendance to the 18th birthday. It is not intended that compulsion to the 18th birthday be applied to all Indian children or even to a large number. This clause was added to the section so that the Department could postpone discharge for an added two years, when home conditions strongly suggested such action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. T. B. H. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. G.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to report that I am having a little difficulty in getting certain pupils of the Ashcroft Band to return to St. George's Indian Residential School at Lytton. Some claim that they are over age.\n\nUpon looking up the Indian Act, Section 10, 1927, I find that children from seven to fifteen years of age are to attend school. Rev. A.R. Lett, Principal of the above mentioned school, writes as follows:\n\n\"When in the East, I took up the question of age of children leaving school, and they revised the Act to read \"...at the discretion of the Agent....\" They made this very clear to me, and you need not hesitate in returning those children whom you feel should be in school, or where, except in extreme cases they are needed at home, up to the age of eighteen years old. You can, without hesitancy, compel children to attend school until their eighteenth birthday according to the Act as it now reads.\"\n\nI have no authority of this nature. If there have been any amendments made to the Act or Regulations passed, a copy of such has not been forwarded to me, and the Department will realize that, unless Agents are supplied with information on any changes that may be made in the Act, it cannot be properly administered. If there have been any changes, please advise at the earliest possible date.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEwen MacLeod\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs - School Files,\n(OIC 10, Volume 6032, File 150-40A, part 1)\nOttawa, September 16th, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your 8-24 of the 24th instant, with reference to changes in the compulsory education clause of the Indian Act.\n\nA copy of the amendments is enclosed and, from a careful reading of Section 10 (1), you will note that the statute is now quite clear in providing that Indian children may be compelled to attend until their sixteenth birthday. In certain instances, the Department can, also, compel attendance to the eighteenth birthday. It is not intended that compulsion to the eighteenth birthday be applied to all Indian children or even to a large number. This clause was added to the section so that the Department could postpone discharge for an added two years when home conditions may suggest such action.

You will note from the above that Indian children may be compelled to attend until their sixteenth birthday.

This clause was added to the Section so that the Department could postpone discharge for an added two years when home conditions may suggest such action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. Francis Campou,\nDriftpilet,\nAlta.\nEXTRACT from Separate School Inspector Greening's Report regarding his visit to the LAKE HELEN INDIAN DAY SCHOOL on November 10, 1931.\n\nOriginal on File 9-4-6.\n\nAfter having thought over the situation carefully and discussed it with other inspectors visiting Indian schools, it is my considered opinion that there can be little hope of Indian day schools ever being anything like as efficient and useful as the expenditure and care lavished upon them by the Department would seem to merit, unless there is a complete change in policy in regard to the enforcing of attendance.\n\nIt was something of a shock to me to be told by a missionary (one who had done much for Indian schools) that, in his experience, Indian children or young people getting into trouble were almost invariably the product of the Indian school. Since then I have spoken to many different kinds of people, trappers, teachers of experience, railway men, store-keepers and missionaries (both priests and nuns) and find it a generally prevalent opinion that there is a growing disregard for law on the part of the Indian, very much like the contempt for law said to have arisen in the United States from non-enforcing of the liquor laws, and that this disregard for the law has much the same kind of foundation, viz., the ability of the Indian to \"get away\" with things.\n\nOne of these things, undoubtedly, is the keeping of children from school. The Indian parent knows that he is expected to send his child to school, but he keeps him at home or takes him away fishing -------- and nothing happens. The child knows that he should be at school, but he stays away, with the same result. One Indian Agent told me that a parent had told him that his boy did not want to go to school and that he was not going to send him, and that the agent could do just whatever he felt good and pleased to do. I asked the agent what he had done about it and was told... NOTHING. The child was not at school when I visited it and occupied his time in coaxing other boys to play truant.\n\nWhat he needed in the worst way was a sound whipping in order to show him that the law was not to be trifled with. (I hope that I shall not be asked for further particulars re this case. The Inspector would not want to be a spy and even less an informer. Moreover the incident is by no means an isolated one.) It cannot be denied, I think, that education increases one's potentialities either for good or bad and that the educated \"crook\" is the one concerning whom the police are most apprehensive. If we are going to increase the Indians' scope of action without seeing that he has a wholesome respect for authority, are we doing him a kindness or are we doing more harm than good? May I also repeat what I have said often before, that the use of double-seats in Indian schools is tending to make of the Indian child an accomplished cheat. There are many obstacles to be met with in the administration of Indian schools that are really difficult to overcome, but surely these two are not in that category.\nThe Compulsory Education Act was introduced in 1936. The government was concerned about the welfare of the children and the future of the community. The Act required all children between the ages of 7 and 14 to attend school. This was seen as a way to improve the education system and provide better opportunities for the children.\n\nThe Act was met with resistance from some parents who believed that their children should be allowed to work and earn a living. However, the government argued that education was essential for the children's future.\n\nIn response to the Act, the government established a number of schools across the country. These schools were designed to provide a quality education to all children, regardless of their background or circumstances.\n\nThe Compulsory Education Act was a significant step forward in the education system. It ensured that all children had access to a quality education and provided them with the tools they needed to succeed in life.\nTherefore, to be fair with us, you should get after such reserves as Belle Lake, Little Long Lake, all and Beaver Lake etc., all these reserves have numerous children of school age.\n\nAnother important question is do you think you could find time to come up with the coming summer and meet with some of the Indians in the two Western provinces, Saskatchewan and Alberta, and try to bring this whole question could be brought thoroughly with you personally and then we could arrive at some decision that would be satisfactory to all concerned.\n\n(Mark E. Steinhauser)\nOttawa, April 25, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 20th instant, I may say that the Department intends to compel attendance at Indian schools whenever such action is considered in the best interests of the Indians themselves. The Department expects the leaders on each reserve to heartily endorse the efforts to educate the people, and I know that, if compulsion is necessary on the Saddle Lake reserve, you and others will give support.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. Mark E. Steinhauer,\nSaddle Lake,\nAlta.\nSir:\n\nIn reference to placing indian children in the Boarding schools here. Although we manage to get most of the children of school age in, yet it sometimes takes a lot of persuasion and time lost before we can prevail on the parent to sign the children in.\n\nI had always regarded Clause IO of the Indian Act as relating to Truant children, that is children who had been admitted to school and were delinquent either in running away or not returning after vacation but Inspector Christianen informs me that if the parent refuses to put an eligible child in school I have the authority to force the child in.\n\nI would be glad to have your ruling on the matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.C. Lancaster\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 2, 1932\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to the compulsory education clause of the Indian Act. If there are any eligible children who should be in school, the Department has full authority to place them there. Any children that you consider should be compelled should form the subject of a special communication to the Department, and our answering letter, specifically naming the children and the school, will give you authority for taking action.\n\nWhen the Department has authorized compulsion, when you have given written notice to a parent and the child in question has not been placed in school within three days, he or she may be arrested without warrant and conveyed to the school by the Indian agent or truant officer or any member of the R. C. M. P. In addition\u2014see Section 10 (4)\u2014the parent or guardian may be proceeded against.\n\nMost Indian agents have found, however, that if they tell the parents that they are prepared to compel, the formal notice or subsequent arrests are unnecessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

The status of Indian Children resident on reservations in respect to the school laws of this province.\n\n2. The status of Indian Children not resident on reservations.\n\nThe measures recently taken in this province to enforce the law in regard to compulsory school attendance make it necessary that the position of the Indian children be clearly defined.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nG.G.

Of course to your schools there is a discount off this of 20%. All of the above work books list at 32\u00a2, and sell for class use at 25\u00a2 per copy ex Vancouver.\n\nYour Inspector, Captain Gerald H. Barry has strongly recommended the use of the above work books in the Indian Schools of British Columbia and it is at his request that I am sending you the above samples.\n\nWe stock all of our supplementary texts and work books at our Vancouver office at 1300 Robson Street. You will save time in the matter of delivery and cost in forwarding all orders for your schools in this Province directly to our Vancouver office.\n\nTrusting that you will be interested in the samples which we are sending you, and thanking you for your courtesies in the past, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.M.DENT & SONS LTD.\n\nPublishers of EVERYMAN'S LIBRARY, \"The Old Man's Favour,\" etc.\nMr. Russell Ferrier,\n\n28th Sept. 1931.\n\nP.S. - You are already familiar with our CANADIAN GEOGRAPHY EXERCISES and NATURE AND LANGUAGE WORK BOOKS but we wish to draw your attention to the fact that the former are now issued in two volumes instead of one, the first for use in Grade 5 covers North and South America, the second for use in Grade 6 covering the rest of the world. They now list at 30\u00a2 per copy and sell at 25\u00a2 per copy for class use, ex Vancouver.\n\nW.G.S.\nAs this is the beginning of the school year, the teachers of your inspectorate will be considering suitable books to buy for their school library.\n\nIn order to meet this difficulty we are submitting to you two suggested lists of school library books published by us.\n\nIn the one list the books are all grouped according to grades and would therefore be very suitable for your city school teachers or for those of your rural schools who wish to provide library books for one complete grade only.\n\nThe other list contains books for all grades. It is useful for all schools and particularly for the rural school teacher in the one- and two-room school.\n\nWe allow 20% discount on all totals. That is to say, each of these suggestive library lists will amount to about $10.00 after the discount has been taken off the total amount. Carriage is, as usual, extra.\n\nWe would be very glad to supply you with any stated number of these lists for distribution amongst your teachers on hearing from you to this effect. We particularly recommend these lists for distribution at your Fall convention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. M. DENT & SONS LIMITED.\nJ. M. DENT & SONS LIMITED suggest the following LIBRARIES amounting to about $10.00 of books for all Public School Grades.\n\nN.B. 1- 20% discount is given on all totals. Carriage is extra.\n2- Items of the same price can be interchanged, as the following lists are suggestive only:\n\nNo. 1\n\n| Title                                      | Price |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Fairy Gold Series (8 books)                | 20\u00a2 each | $1.60 |\n| Canadian Geography Readers                  |       | 2.55 |\n| Silent Study Readers, Books 1 -

I am also making inquiry to see if there is a standard Canadian list. I very much doubt if there is.\n\nAlso, what do you think of writing to the Canadian...\nPublishing Houses\u2014Telling them as much as you please of the work in hand\u2014and asking them who can to submit a graded list of their books as soon as possible? There is such a wealth of material available that I am sure to omit titles which should be included. Being human, my memory is not infallible and the mere sight of the name of a book may recall to mind a whole new series. I am really anxious to do this as thoroughly as possible\u2014and as creditably. I do wish I had a larger school\u2014especially a Residential\u2014you might help me in mind if there is anything special.

I have returned them to town and asked for the back volume edition - explaining why I want them.\n\nI am sorry if I am holding you up. I'm continuous thought on the matter I need a whole day and will do it over next Saturday? Sunday - If the books are back as they should be.\n\nYrs,\nG.H.C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nLittle Current, Ont.\n10-29-32\n\nDear Mr. Philam,\n\nHaving got the matter of prescribed and supplementary reading well in hand, I am turning my attention to the library titles\u2014in an effort to have the whole thing ready for you by Christmas.\n\nFully half the titles on the tentative list which Mr. Bennett knew were, in his opinion, fairly graded. The same may, and likely does, apply to those he did not know. I am, and never have been, satisfied with the grading and, the list was but tentative. Something must be done. I have thought of the following:\n\nI enclose a list of all the library titles on the tentative list\u2014on regular acquisition forms. If you will order these for me I shall read them all and grade them. I shall then turn my children loose on them, watch them carefully, and listen to their comments. With this information in hand, I shall revise the list. In the case of any book which they do not appear to like, and which I think they should, I shall enlist the aid of other teachers and so on until I am satisfied. I shall then submit\nthe list is an authority on children's reading (I think at the moment of Dr. Wain, president of Teachers College, University of B.C. \u2014 who has a reputation for this work). While I shall not be able to give you the complete list by January I shall be able to give you a tentative one and the church authorities will be so much concerned with grading as with titles. The list, will, however, be ready by Easter I hope. I have checked the titles which you have in the office. These could come direct; the others will have to be ordered.\n\nAll will be returned as your copies to be kept in Ottawa. This will be most desirable in the end and so no extra expense will be involved. In many cases these books are handled by several publishers, that is, kindness can be called for your quotations.\n\nI am not at all satisfied with the number of books for Catholic schools. I suggest that you write me a list Catholic firms and ask them to submit say ten books which they consider suitable for each grade. Then I can carefully go through and they can have them back if necessary.\n\nIf there is anything you can do expeditiously, it will be an enormous help. It has taken just a month for my last acquisition to through and in the case of the library books it is a month wasted.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nAlso, SHUBNACADIE was to try out the complete course of the Sheffield and Brown \"New Canadian Arithmetic\". We should have a detailed report on this.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nLittle Current, Ont.,\nNovember 21st, 1932.\n\nDear Phil:\n\nThe Christmas vacation will give me ten clear days to get the standardization of texts off to you. I think it was understood that if you had them by the New Year it would be soon enough. However, before that, I do want the criticisms of the various books that were sent out for testing purposes. It is on these, largely, that my final decisions will be based. I append a list of the schools which should send in reports, and if they have not been received by the first of December, for instance, I would appreciate if you would drop them a line and jog them along.\n\nI should also like to know exactly what you want me to do in connection with the Library titles. As I told you at the time I did them, and as Mr. Scott's comments show, they are poorly graded. I also proposed later that you should let me have the books, that I would go through them carefully and decide them. After that I had planned to turn my children loose on them, model their readings, listen to their comments\u2014and then re-grade them. In the case of doubtful selections I had thought that they might be tried in other schools around me so I knew all the teachers, including those at Spanish. Then, when I was satisfied I thought it might be wise to turn the list over to a grading critic for approval. There are any number of them both in the East and the West, and I know several of them personally.\n\nObviously, this could not be finished before Christmas, as in the ordinary course of events I would not receive them from the Bureau for at least three weeks from the time a requisition was put through. I had thought that on the list sent out to the Church authorities the titles could be given without any reference to grading. It would be titles that would require their approval rather than grading. I should have the grading ready to send to you by Easter.\n\nAlso, there are a number of titles not on the requisition which I sent to you that I should like to have a look at. While this may appear to be the expenditure of a large sum, I have pointed out that they could be returned to the Department and could be used to fill a requisition for Library books to one of the Schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPoveshell\nOttawa, August 5th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has been working on a prescription of texts for Indian schools and J.

On their other two there may be the same, although I have nothing in writing to that effect. I should send the order directly to Mr. Button to make certain that you get the full discount.\n\nThe following is an extract from a letter from Mr. Watson & Thos. Nelson & Sons. \"The prices listed in the books (those above) are the retail list price subject to the usual trade discounts. The Government would be able to buy them less 25% in the case of school books, and about 35% in the case of trade books.\" I imagine that the majority of those on my list are Trade books.\n\nThe Blackie quotations are the ones marked in the books sent to me by Mr. Morgan.\n\nThe Macmillan books are subject to the usual discount of 20% and no more for quantity.\n\nI have included some Bible stories, for I feel that they are necessary. Until you have the opinion of some Catholic authority I should confine their use to Protestant schools. While there is nothing doctrinally wrong with them, they are by Protestant authors.\n\nI have re-read everything which I have recommended, and have not relied upon my memory of prior readings. Also, where possible, I have checked the grading of the books with some standard list. Unfortunately these are all American, but I have let my own experience guide me largely.\n\nWhile they are not all inexpensive books, yet I think that everyone which I have recommended is worth the\nI think that you share my opinion that one good book is worth several inferior ones. I also feel that a well bound book is much better in the long run than a poorly bound one.\n\nYou will see, also, that, acting on my oft repeated statement, I have picked Blackie books for the higher grades, choosing the ones for the lower grades from more modern ones. This is essential enough for any beginner, but still more so when they have as limited a background as the average Indian child.\n\nDepending on your finances, I should buy fifty of each of these. That should solve your supplementary reading problem for the ensuing year, and you are assured of having material which is of the best, and most satisfactory for your needs.\n\nThe only thing which I have not considered is the required supplementary reading for Grades VIII and IX. Each province has a definite list, and to list them all would extend this list beyond the bounds you wished.\n\nI have asked you in a prior letter if I may tell those publishers who have given me specimen copies which of their books I have recommended to you. May I? I think it is but common courtesy. They are unlikely to see orders going through.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeorge [Last Name]\nLittle Current, Ont.,\nJuly 24th, 1933.\n\nDear Phil,\n\nRe: THE MARYWOOD READERS - MacMillan\nPre-Primer\nPrimer\nReaders I - VI\n\nI can truthfully say that this is the best series of Catholic Readers that I have seen. I really didn't know that such a set was on the market. While they are of American origin, they are handled by the MacMillan Co. of Canada.\n\nThe books are well graded. The material is well within the experience of children of the different grades. The vocabulary is well chosen, or at least as well chosen as possible considering the amount of religious knowledge and training concerned. In so far as they are used by Catholic children I imagine the vocabulary difficulties would be of no consequence.\n\nA valuable part of the work is the amount of activity suggested. Rousseau aptly said, \"Reflect that the student will learn more by one hour of manual labour than he will retain by a whole day's verbal instruction.\" While I believe that such things as comprehension tests, and correlated work belong to the sphere of the Work Book, yet in the case of supplementary readers it is well that such things be included.\n\nI have no hesitation in recommending these as suitable Readers for the Catholic schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, May 25th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nEnclosed is a list of books which the Department considers suitable for supplementary reading purposes for Indian schools.\n\n\"The Shining Ship\" can be obtained at a special reduced price of $32.50 per 100; \"The Christopher Robin Reader\" at $25.00 per 100; and \"Jimmie Gold Coast\" at 35 cents a copy.

Phelan,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI am so sorry, regarding your order for 25 copies of THE GOLDEN FOREST at 25 cents per copy. We disposed of our Canadian stock of this book at this low price, and I am afraid that we cannot import any new stock from London except at the regular price of \u00a31.75 per copy, less our usual Educational discount of 10%. I assume, therefore, that you will not want us to supply the book at this price. If, however, you require them, please let us know when we shall be glad to send a cable to our London Office.\n\nIt is just possible that London may be out of stock, or the book itself out of print by this time, but we shall be glad to get in touch with them in this connection, at your request.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. M. DENT & SONS Limited.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, February 12, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to official letter of the 29th ultimo, enclosing a list of books which the Department wishes you to place in stock for supplementary reading purposes, I beg to say that a letter has just been received from J. M. Dent & Sons, Ltd., with reference to the 25 copies of \"The Golden Forest\".\n\nWhen I requested you to order this book, I was under the impression that a cheap edition could be secured. It now appears that the edition that is available costs $1.75 a copy, less 20%. This is a more expensive book than the Department usually supplies, and, if you have not already placed the order, I would appreciate your cancelling same.\n\nIn the event of your cancelling the order for the above book, I would appreciate if you would substitute the following:\n\n25 copies \"Child's Garden of Verses\", (Stevenson) - Everyman Edition.\n\n25 copies \"Book of Nonsense\" (Lear) - Everyman Edition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nThe King's Printer,\nOTTAWA.\nOTTAWA, February 12, 1934.\n\nMr. J.D. Sutherland,\nA/Supt., Indian Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of January 29th with reference to new books to be stocked, I am advised by the J.M. Dent Co. that the \"Golden Forest\" is no longer available in Canada, and it would be necessary to import same from England. In this event they would have to sell it at the usual price of approximately $1.40 each.\n\nKindly let me know what action you wish taken.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.W. Driscoll\nSUPERINTENDENT OF STATIONERY\n\nJD/E.\nForest, Ont.,\nMarch 6th, 1934.\n\nDear Phil,\n\nYou will likely have heard of CRY HAVOC by Beverley Nichols, even if you have not had the opportunity to read it. I read it sometime ago with considerable interest and respect. It is, as far as I am concerned, the correct approach to the subject of future wars.\n\nThe book appealed so much to the Ontario Department of Education that they have had a special edition printed\u2014revised to suit the needs of children\u2014and have had copies placed in all the schools in the Province. I have just had an opportunity to go through this new edition, and can thoroughly recommend it for use in our schools.\n\nI think that it might be placed\u2014to great advantage\u2014in the residential schools, and in such schools as have first year high school pupils, or a strong entrance class.\n\nThe book sells for .75\u00a2, and may be obtained from the publishers, George Doubleday, Toronto and Company, University Ave., Toronto. If you wished to review it, I am certain that they would be glad to send you a copy for that purpose. There would be no use in my offering you my copy, as mine is the adult one.\n\nIf you are at all interested, I should advise you to act promptly, as the edition is not large. Personally, I cannot recommend it too highly for your consideration.\n\nYours,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, March 8th, 1934.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nWe are considering placing some copies of \"Cry Havoc\" in some of the Indian schools.\n\nI understand that you now have available a special edition, revised to suit the needs of children and that it sells for, approximately, seventy-five cents (75\u00a2). I should appreciate if you would forward me a copy for review purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nMessrs. Doubleday, Doran & Gundy,\nUniversity Ave.,\nToronto, Ont.\nMr. J.D. Sutherland,\nA/Supt., Indian Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am today advised by Blackie & Son that \"Nannie's Big Story Book\" is out of print and cannot be supplied. Same will, therefore, not be carried in stock.\n\nRegarding \"Chris in Canada\", I am advised that this is out of print, but a cheaper edition will be ready some time in April.\n\nKindly note,\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.W.

It is important that we should be able to make our decision on reprinting at an early date, and whatever you can do to facilitate this decision will be greatly appreciated.

It was stupid of me not to send them at the time as I realize now that the only way in which you can estimate their worth is by seeing them.\n\nYou will note from Captain Barry's letter that he hopes that this Ms. may be considered as a junior Reader for the Indian Schools. Before deciding whether we shall publish it or not, we shall be very grateful for your information.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. M. DENT & SONS Limited.\n\n[Signature]\n\nCJF/HE\nOttawa, August 14, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Bustase:\n\nWith reference to your letters of the 31st ultimo and 13th instant, I note that you are forwarding, under separate cover, the \"Indian Fairy Tales\", by Captain Barry. On receipt of this manuscript, I will read it carefully and let you know our opinion, as soon as possible.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC. J. Bustase, Esq.,\nJ. M. Dent & Sons,\n224 Bloor St. West,\nToronto 5, Ont.\nMr. Phelan,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nWhen in New York a few days ago, I called on Messrs. Scribners in reference to some business as we are publishing several of their school text books, and I was much interested in a book entitled \"Komoki of the Cliffs\". I thought it might appeal to your people and wonder if you would examine it with this in view. If you decide that it would make a satisfactory book, either for supplementary or basic readers, please let me know as we would be interested in bringing out either a Canadian edition or supplying you with the American edition; in other words I have not concluded any definite arrangement with Messrs. Scribners until I hear from you about the book. Will you therefore have it examined by the proper parties and advise us if the book makes any appeal to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPresident\nOttawa, September 28, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Love:\n\nI regret that I have previously overlooked answering your letter of the 10th instant.\n\nThe book entitled \"Kowoki of the Cliffs\" has been received and I found it extremely interesting. I think, however, that it would only be useful for supplementary reading in our schools, and, consequently, the number that we could use would be comparatively small. You might let me know later if you decide to either publish or handle this book.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. H. Love, Esq.,\nPresident,\nW. J. Gage & Co. Ltd.,\n52-94 Spadina Ave.,\nToronto, Ont.\nMr. Phelan,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nThe price of \"Komoki of the Cliffs\" is $1.20 in the United States. We will be handling the book and will sell it to you at the same price as it would cost you wholesale in importing it direct. It would be necessary, however, for customs purposes, that you give us an affidavit to the effect that it will be distributed in the Schools.\n\nTrusting to receive your order for a few or many of these books, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. J. GAGE & CO., Limited,\n\n[Signature]\nPresident\nSir:\n\nI would appreciate if you would place in stock the following books for supplementary reading purposes:\n\n- Raggedy Ann\n- Raggedy Andy\n- Raggedy Ann in Cookie Land\n- Raggedy Ann in the Deep, Deep Woods\n- Raggedy Ann's Lucky Pennies\n- Raggedy Ann's Wicked Witch\n- The Lost Hunters\n- Men of the North\n- Eileen, The Long Guide\n- Mother Goose\n- Travelling with the Birds\n- Homes and Habits of Wild Animals.\n\nThe above books should be secured from,\n\nMcLean Merchandise Sales,\n29 Melinda St.,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nPlease let me know when you receive the above in order that I can forward requisitions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This dictionary costs a few cents more than the one we are using at present but is a much more comprehensive dictionary and will be better for our schools. These, of course, should also be secured from Blackie & Son, who intend to keep about 500 in stock and will be ready to supply them whenever required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

I have marked the quantities that we have of each series and thought probably your department might like an opportunity of securing these books rather than have us job them off to some Departmental Store.\n\nI would like to draw your particular attention to the fine quality of the books. They are all made in England by some of the very best publishers of this type of publications.\n\nIt struck me particularly, one or two of these series would be very adaptable for the use to which you put the books, such as, \"Home Made Toys\" \"Jolly Good Company\" \"Painting & Tracing series\" \"The Oxford Annual for Scouts\" and \"Thrillers for Boys\". As a matter of fact they are all very fine books and are a mighty good buy at these prices.\n\nWould it be possible for you to let me know if you can use any of these before we offer them to anyone else. You could take all, or part, of what stock we have.\n\nThanking you, I beg to remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMCLEAN MERCHANDISE SALES.\n\nMJM/MM.\n\nP.S.

You will, no doubt, give us a call when you come to Ottawa again and we will be pleased to look over your samples. The books which you forwarded are being returned.\n\nRegarding the books which we stated we would purchase from you when you were here, I thought you understood that shipment was not to be made until the order was received from the Government Stationery Office. As we explained to you, all our orders go through that office. It appears, however, from the enclosed account, that certain of the books are being forwarded direct to Ottawa. We have not received them as yet and, if it was a mistake on the part of the M. A. Donohue & Company in billing us while the books were sent to you, your proper procedure is to retain the books until you receive the order from the Government Stationery Office and then ship the books to them.\n\nThey will first send you a slip requesting a quotation and, when you answer this, you will receive the order with the order number to which you should refer when corresponding with them in connection with your account. This may appear to be a rather involved way of doing business but it is the method that we are obliged to adopt.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nM. J.

Obviously they are in error.\n\nBy today's mail, we received tender form from the Dept. of Public Printing and Stationery, and we are sending them our quotations today.\n\nWill you be good enough to sign the enclosed forms for us so we may clear these books through the Customs duty free; this is really necessary as Mr. McLean quoted you a special price.\n\nRegarding the Donohue shipment now in Ottawa - if you have the Freight advice, will you kindly forward it to us so we may clear it through our broker, and will hold in Ottawa until we have had official advice for delivery of these books. Please endorse Freight advice in order that the Railway Co. will be enabled to deliver to our order.\n\nRegretting any inconvenience that may have been caused you, we are\n\nYours very truly\n\nOP\nMcLean Merchandise Sales\n\n[Signature]\n\nWe thank you for returning the other samples promptly.\nOttawa, November 12, 1934.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nOwing to my absence from the city there has been some delay in answering your letter of the first instant.

I hope that you will like the book, and we shall look forward to hearing the cheering news that you may be able to use some of them in your Catholic schools. We are having printed a small notice to insert regarding the illustrations which are of an original nature.\n\nWhile I am on the subject of books, I am wondering if you were able to use any more of the Work Books to accompany PAGES FROM CANADA'S STORY by Mrs. Gowan. We have had a very irate letter from this lady this morning in which she expresses her hopes that the Department of Indian Affairs will be able to use some copies, and I assured her that we should at least write to you about them.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. M. DENT & SONS LTD.\n\n[Signature]\n\nGJE/IM\nOttawa, November 22, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Bustace:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant and have also received the copy of Saints for Home and School. I suppose you did mention at some time the price at which you are prepared to supply these books to us, but I do not remember exactly what figure you stated. I believe that within the next month or so we will be in a position to place an order for 100 copies. You might let me know the cost per copy.\n\nIf my memory serves me correctly, I believe the cost of Mrs. Downie's Work Books is ten cents each. Is this correct? While it might be of advantage to have a set of these books in each of the Indian schools where they use \"Pages for Canada's Story,\" at the same time I hesitate to supply a set for every pupil in our schools. I gave the matter considerable thought last spring, but was not able to convince myself that these Work Books were absolutely necessary; and, consequently, neglected to place an order in time to send the books out at the beginning of September. As the school year is now advanced, I doubt the advisability of sending them at present. However, when I receive your reply stating definitely the cost, I will give the matter further consideration.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. J. Bustace, Esq.,\nJ. H.

I would appreciate your communication with the Canadian National Railways and explaining to them that you will handle the accounts, and, as intimated above, if refund is due you, you should take up the matter with the Department of Public Printing and Stationery.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMcLean Merchandise Sales,\n29 Melinda Street,\nToronto 5,\nOntario.\nOttawa, December 10th, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. McLean,\n\nThe enclosed has reached our office this morning. In view of my previous letter, I cannot understand why Donohue & Company persist in writing to us. As you are aware, the accounts for the books purchased from you should come from your office to the Department of Public Printing & Stationery and the accounts of Donohue & Company should be paid by you.\n\nI sincerely hope that you will get this matter straightened out immediately as this order has caused us more trouble than any other order that we have placed in years. If Donohue & Company follow out their intention of sending a draft on us, they will just be out the cost of the draft as it will be returned.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nM. J.

It should also have a supply of interesting books new to him. The courses of study require that the subject of supplementary reading receive attention in class, and at seats in all the grades. \"The material in the School Readers should be supplemented in each Form by a wide range of good books which will meet the interests and capacities of the pupils. Such books, sufficient in number for class use should, if possible, be provided in the school library,\"\u2014Courses of Study, 1924, page 5.\n\nA test of many of our libraries in rural schools indicates that many of the books are not suitable for pupils of elementary grades, and few of the libraries contain an adequate supply of good reading material for Primer, First Reader, and Second Reader classes. Since the most elementary books may be easily read with interest by senior pupils, it is true that a library should have a larger supply for the junior classes than that which the material should be for seniors only.\n\nTeachers and boards are urged to see to it that the library is made a very important part of the school equipment, and that it is fully used by the pupils for seat work and for home reading.\n\nThe pupils of the lowest classes should have good stories read to them in school and at home, so that their curiosity and interest in books should be aroused sufficiently to urge them to read for pleasure. Then their own reading, with proper guidance, will develop a reader for whom is good, and they will, without much direction, become very excellent readers. This wider reading will result in improving the pupils in composition, both oral and written.\n\nFor the beginners, nursery rhyme and other picture books with a small amount of text are the best. Those which are best liked by the children in the school should be selected. For example, Old Mother Hubbard, with a picture for each stanza, is a fine book for children before they are able to read very well. Illustrated books should be chosen wherever possible.\n\nEach school library should receive an annual addition in order that it may contain copies of the more recent good books. A careful inventory should be made by the teacher and inspector each year, so that worn out and useless material may be discarded. One copy of this list should be filed in each school.\n\nThe following are the names and addresses of the publishers listed in this circular:\n\nAllen, Thomas, 386 Adelaide Street West, Toronto\nBell, Geo., & Sons, Ltd., Montague House, Portland Street, London, W.C., England\nBlackwood, Basil, 418 Bloor Street West, Toronto\nBlackwood, Basil, Oxford, England\nBoard of Education\u2014pub. by H.

I refer to:\n\n(a) HAPPY HOURS IN GARDEN FIELD AND WOODLAND By De Wolf, Dent's.\n\n(b) JOURNEYS NEAR AND FAR - by De Wolfe, Dent's.\n\nThese books would appear to me to be very suitable for our schools, and I wonder if one copy might not be requisitioned for by each school having Grades 5 and 6.\n\nI should be glad to hear from the Department in this matter; as while some schools would not want the above books for Geography and Nature Work, I should be glad to show a specimen of each to teachers in certain schools, if the Department has approved of them.\nOttawa, March 28, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease place in stock the following:\n\n30 copies \"Happy Hours in Garden, Field & Woodland,\" -\n30 \"Journeys Near and Far.\"\n\nThe above books can be secured from J. M. Dent &\nSons, Toronto.\n\nAs you will probably remember, we had these\nbooks in stock previously, but the supply is now ex-\nhausted. We intend to supply these books to certain\nschools, and we, therefore, desire to have them in the\nStationery Office.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D.

C. Goldring, B. Ed.,\n\nSuperintendent of Toronto Schools\n\nFor Grades 7, 8 and 9\n\nWE ARE CANADIAN CITIZENS is a Civics Reader designed for the use of pupils of ages thirteen and fourteen years. The subject is treated from the community standpoint, and the aim is to explain some of the basic principles of community life.\n\nIn the first few chapters, common experiences within the range of comprehension of the pupils are used to explain some of these principles. Then, following a chapter on \"Home and Home Life\", several chapters are devoted to definite features of community life, such as police, fire protection, public libraries, health, recreation, safety, and provision for the handicapped and unfortunate. After a chapter on \"Rural Life\", the next few chapters deal particularly with matters of interest to the individual, such as preparation for work and a healthy personality. Formal government is explained in the last half dozen chapters; municipal government, the government of a province, of our country and of the British Empire, and the League of Nations being taken up in that order. The final chapter emphasizes the importance of democracy, and is entitled \"Citizenship in a Democracy\".\nJ. H.

DENT & SONS (CANADA) LIMITED\nPUBLISHERS\n224 Bloor Street West\nTORONTO, CANADA\n\nDept. B.\n\nFebruary 1, 1937.\n\nMr. P. Phelan,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nAs it is possible that you may have an appropriation for Supplementary Reading for your schools, we are taking this opportunity of bringing to your attention some books which have been considerably reduced in price, and which we are able to offer to you at this time for your appraisal. We attach herewith three lists of books, which we have sent to a number of other Superintendents of Education in various provinces in the hope that they may be able to avail themselves of some of the opportunities offered.\n\nI have placed a star opposite the prices that have already been reduced from the original published price and from which a discount of 20% is now allowable on quantity orders of 100 copies or more. This makes the prices of these books extremely low, we believe. We shall be pleased to allow a discount of 25% off the other list prices.\n\nList No. 2 contains a similar number of books suitable for Grades 2 to 8. All these have been reduced in price, so that the discount of 20% which we shall be pleased to allow off these prices make them very inexpensive. I should like to draw to your attention that we have considerable quantities of WHEN CANADA WAS NEW FRANCE and FAMILIAR FIELDS both in the KINGS TREASURIES SERIES. We are prepared to quote you a special price on quantity orders of either of these two titles.\n\nList No. 3 contains some odd books which might be suitable for prizes and gifts and which we are offering at \"job\" prices.\n\nWe are also attaching an announcement of the publication of a Civics Reader for Grades 7, 8 and 9. Although we imagine that the number of pupils in your schools in these grades is very small, we trust you will be interested in learning of the publication of this book. A complimentary copy will be sent to you as soon as it is off the press.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. M. DENT & SONS (CANADA) LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nJ. M. DENT & SONS (CANADA) LIMITED\nPUBLISHERS\n224 Bloor Street West\nTORONTO, CANADA\n\nDept. B. April 5, 1937.\n\nMr. P. Phelan,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nIt struck me after I left you the other day, that you might not have had a copy of the KINGSWAY SOCIAL GEOGRAPHIES and TRACING HISTORY BACKWARDS, titles for which we have acquired the Canadian rights from Messrs. Evans Brothers. I am, therefore, sending to you, under separate cover, complimentary copies of these books, which have proved very popular everywhere. The prices are marked in each book.\n\nAlso with reference to the PAT AND PATSY PRE-PRIMER - this is an excellent little pre-primer, but between ourselves we over-printed it in quantities, and we are therefore in a position to make you a very low price on a quantity order if you care to place a little book like this as a supplementary reader to the TWO LITTLE INDIANS.\n\nOn any quantity over one thousand copies, we could make you a price of 10\u00a2 net, per copy, in the paper board edition. I mention this as you may think it worthwhile to supply some of your schools with copies of this book.\n\nWe shall look forward with pleasure to hearing from you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. M. DENT & SONS (CANADA) LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nCJE/NW\n| Quantity | DESCRIPTION                                      | NET | Amount |\n|----------|--------------------------------------------------|-----|--------|\n| 30       | Hans Andersen Fairy Tales                        | 65% | 100    |\n|          |                                                  |     | 3000   |\n| 30       | The Arabian Nights                                | 7%  | 100    |\n|          |                                                  |     | 3000   |\n| 30       | Murrayberg - Highland Learns                     | 7%  | 100    |\n|          |                                                  |     | 3000   |\n| 30       | Macdonald - Capt Black                           | 7%  | 120    |\n|          |                                                  |     | 3600   |\n| 30       | Macdonald - Felicity's Fortune                    | 7%  | 100    |\n|          |                                                  |     | 3000   |\n| 30       | Christian - The Way to Make Good                  | 7%  | 70     |\n|          |                                                  |     | 2100   |\n| 30       | Brazil - Jelle's School                          | 7%  | 70     |\n|          |                                                  |     | 2100   |\n| 30       | Misses - The Trouble of Lattigo                   | 7%  | 50     |\n|          |                                                  |     | 1500   |\n| 30       | Herbertson - Anna Edmond Gordon Ey               | 7%  | 50     |\n|          |                                                  |     | 1500   |\n| 30       | Hartington - Lucy Mary                            | 7%  | 50     |\n|          |                                                  |     | 1500   |\n| 30       | Eden - Barbara at School                         | 7%  | 50     |\n|          |                                                  |     | 1500   |\n| 30       | Scott - Little Man                                | 7%  | 40     |\n|          |                                                  |     | 1200   |\n| 30       | Dunn - Two Years Before the Mass                 | 7%  | 40     |\n|          |                                                  |     | 1200   |\n| 30       | Cooper - The Particular                           | 7%  | 40     |\n|          |                                                  |     | 1200   |\n| 30       | Cooper - The Land of the Mohicans                | 7%  | 40     |\n|          |                                                  |     | 1200   |\n| 30       | The Big Book                                     | 7%  | 53     |\n|          |                                                  |     | 1590   |\n| 30       | The Big Book for Children                        | 7%  | 53     |\n|          |                                                  |     | 1590   |\n| 30       | Maclean's Girls Story Book                       | 7%  | 70     |\n|          |                                                  |     | 2100   |\n| 30       | Maclean's Boys Story Book                        | 7%  | 70     |\n|          |                                                  |     | 2100   |\n| 30       | Illustrated                                     | 7%  | 70     |\n|          |                                                  |     | 2100   |\n| 30       | Josephine Daily Book                              | 7%  | 70     |\n|          |                                                  |     | 2100   |\n| 30       | Fairy Tales from Newfoundland                    | 7%  | 70     |\n|          |                                                  |     | 2100   |\n| 30       | My Annual Story Book                             | 7%  | 70     |\n|          |                                                  |     | 2100   |\n| 30       | My Very Own Book                                  | 7%  | 70     |\n|          |                                                  |     | 2100   |\n\nTotal: $1484.80\n| Quantity | DESCRIPTION                  | NET | Amount |\n|----------|------------------------------|-----|--------|\n| 3        | Storytime Books              | 40  | 1200   |\n| 3        | The Handless Fairy - Toddlers| \"   | 30     | 900    |\n| 30       | Cracker - Peggy and Jean     | \"   | 30     | 900    |\n| 50       | Jumbo Series - Little Red     | \"6\" | 10     | 500    |\n| 50       | John Macnee - Little Boy Blue | \"6\" | 10     | 500    |\n|          |                              |     |        |\n| 50       | The Van Soldier               | \"6\" | 10     | 500    |\n| 50       | The Travelling Musicians      | \"6\" | 10     | 500    |\n| 50       | A Book of Native Stories      | \"7\" | 45     | 2250   |\n| 50       | Combined L.J.

They have been selected from a treasury of Golden Days among the best authors. Each book has six coloured illustrations. The regular net price of these books are $1.00 each. We are willing to sacrifice the balance for $.65. The following are the titles and quantities we have left:\n\n- 22 Adventures of Tom Sawyer\n- 16 Black Beauty\n- 13 Grimm's Fairy Tales\n- 15 Hans Brinker\n- 19 Heidi\n- 7 Helen's Babies\n- 20 Jack & Jill\n\n- 18 Old Old Fairy Tales\n- 11 Pinocchio\n- 12 Swiss Family Robinson\n- 17 Treasure Island\n- 19 Uncle Tom's Cabin\n- 10 Under the Lilacs\nThis title \"Dwellers of the Marshes\" is a new publication published especially for the very young children. It is written by a Canadian author \"Archie P. McKishnie\" who is one of our best known Canadian Naturalists. It has also 12 full page plates illustrated by Franz Johnston, who is one of our leading Canadian artists. This book will form a very important part in Canadian Juvenile Literature and is recommended very highly by librarians and educationalists all over Canada.\n\nTo our knowledge this is the first book in any language that has ever been published on our Canadian Marsh Animals and Birds; it is made intensely interesting to the child owing to the fact that each Animal and Bird is given a character name, for instance, the old turtle is named \"Amber-Orbs\", etc.\n\nIt is extremely interesting from the standpoint that it is very entertaining and quite juvenile. Published at $1.75 - unlimited quantity $1.05 nett.\nMcLean Merchandise Sales\nBooks \u2022 Stationery \u2022 Greeting Cards \u2022 Things Unusual\n\nMEL. J.

As I am rather anxious to clean up this stock as I mentioned to you while in Ottawa I would indeed be greatly obliged to you if you would let me know about these as soon as possible. Kindly keep these quantities before you for after we receive the quotation forms from the printing bureau it will be necessary for you to give us these quantities only, for this is all we have.\n\nIn the meantime, I am setting these aside awaiting your requisitions so that in the event of some of the titles that you cannot use, we may be in a position to offer them to someone else as per our conversation while in Ottawa. May we have your request for quotations through the bureau as soon as possible, as we are taking inventory and we wish to dispose of these odds and ends as soon as possible.\n\nI am at the present time preparing for you a catalogue together with prices of the Built-Rite toys which you requested and I will send this to you in the course of the next few days.\n\nThanking you and with very kind regards and best wishes, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. I would like to draw your particular attention to the titles of \"King - Story of a St. Bernard Dog\" - \"Billy Berk - Story of a Berkshire Pig\" - Spotty - Story of a Holstein Cow\" - \"Sunshine Rose - Story of a\nShetland Pony - \"Glu Abe\" - Story of a Lincoln Sheep - \"Shenshoo - Story of a Moose. These stories have been written in the same style as the famous \"Black Beauty\", these various animals tell their own story of their life and habits in their various environments. They are extremely interesting to the young children.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, School Files (RG 10, Volume 6032, File 150-41, part 1)\nOttawa, September 24, 1937.\n\nDear Jim:\n\nEnclosed is a list of the supplementary reading books which you had in stock previous to ordering those requested in my letters of June 30th, last. Please mark on the attached the number of copies of each of them that you still have in stock and return the list to me.\n\nAs soon as we have this information, we intend to prepare new lists, including both those you have in stock and those requested in my letters of June 30th, and we will then be in a position to forward you requisitions.\n\nI also enclose a list of additional supplementary books which I would request you to order from McLean Merchandise Sales, 29 Melinda Street, Toronto 2, Ont. These also will be included in our new lists and requisitions will go forward in the near future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nJ. W. Driscoll, Esq.,\nSupt. of Stationery,\nDept. of Public Printing & Stationery,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 24, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. McLean:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant, I find on checking our stock that I am unable to handle as many books as you probably thought I could. However, I enclose a list showing those which we are prepared to order at the present time.\n\nI also received the sets which you kindly sent, and a little later on I will endeavour to place a number of these in our schools.\n\nI believe you will also receive an order from the Government Stationery Office for an additional quantity of the Canadian Pictorial Atlas.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nREO.\n\nM.

Sister Mary Cleophas, Caughnawaga R. C. School, Adirondack Junction, P.Q.\n\nI suppose the Stationery Office will ask you to quote a price, which you could do and later you will get the order, at which time you could send the account. This is a special order and I am anxious to have the books reach Adirondack Junction by the 20th as stated above.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEnc.\n\nMol. J. McLean, Esq.,\nMcLean Merchandising Sales,\n26 Melinda Street,\nToronto, S., Ont.\nOttawa, June 15, 1936.\n\nDear Sister Cleophas,\n\nI do not know just how it happened, but I was under the impression that you would not require any books this year, although I should have known better. However, I am placing an order for the books which I feel will be quite suitable for the purpose. I regret that it is not possible to authorize you to buy books, but we are required by Act of Parliament to purchase all books through the Government Stationery Office.\n\nI note that the closing exercises will be held on the 23rd instant. You might let me know the hour and whether you are on standard or daylight saving time. If you are having the closing exercises in the morning, I will go down to Montreal the night before, but if you are holding them in the afternoon I will not go down until the morning train on the 23rd.\n\nI am arranging for the books on the attached list to be shipped by express so that they will reach Adirondack Junction by the 20th instant.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nP.

We will do our best to have the books reach Adirondack Junction by the 20th.\n\nSome of the titles which you ordered are out of stock here but we have wired for them and hope to have them here by June 15th for shipment.\n\nIn the event that they do not reach us in time or if it should happen that the publishers are sold out of any of the titles, what is your advise in the matter? Will it be all right to substitute on any of the items?

They should, of course, be shipped that evening in order to make certain that they will be in Caughnawaga for the 22nd.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMcLean Merchandise Sales,\n29 Melinda Street,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nJ. M. DENT & SONS (CANADA) LIMITED\nPUBLISHERS\n224 Bloor Street West\nTORONTO, CANADA\n\nJuly 21st, 1936.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Phil:\n\nWe have received an order from the Department of Public Printing for 50 copies of *Net* and *Patay* at 10 cents each. I don't know how they got the price, except through you. Did we ever quote 10 cents per copy? There was a time - two or three years ago - when we would have been glad to have cleared the 50,000 old copies that we had at that time at ten cents each, but that time has passed and in the interim it has taken on a new lease of life. As you know, we reduced the list price from 25 cents to 15 cents a copy, so that even at the net price as it has appeared in our catalogue for two or three years, it is a bargain.\n\nHowever naturally, if you have any record of us having quoted your Department 10 cents each in any quantity, we shall stand by that quotation, without hesitation. Otherwise, what would you say if we invoiced them at the catalogue net price of 15 cents per copy, less 20%, carriage extra? As you know, the word \"net\" means that such books are not subject to discount. However, your Department has been so kind to us that we feel that every possible consideration should be given to it.\n\nI would have written direct to the Department of Public Printing but for the belief that you possibly provided them with the price and if so, our letter would seem rather strange to them. In other words, we shall continue to \"play cricket\" under any or all circumstances.\n\nWith kindest regards, I am\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nHB/LB\n\n[Signature]\nDear Henry:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant in connection with the order which you recently received from the Department of Public Printing and Stationery for 500 copies of Pat and Patsy at 10\u00a2 each.\n\nWe certainly received an offer from you of 10\u00a2 for these books (see letter from Mr. Eustace dated April 3, 1937). However, there was a saving clause in that letter to the effect that if we purchased 1000 copies the 10\u00a2 price would prevail. I believe we did purchase 1000 at that time.\n\nI have phoned the stationery office today and if you write to them and tell them that for various reasons you cannot see your way clear to supply the books at 10\u00a2 each but that you are willing to supply them at 15\u00a2 less 20% they will approve the order at the latter price. I think this will meet your wishes.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nHenry Button, Esq.,\ns/o J. M.

I really cannot explain how much I enjoyed this work, and those I have numbered on the list are the different kinds of work I enjoyed most.\n\nIt was a pleasure to study about those old settlers and early pioneers, their methods of working, etc. I am quite sure, History is one subject all boys and girls surely enjoy to study.\n\nI sincerely hope all Canadian boys and girls will get as much enjoyment out of these books as I have.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) Anson L. Wolfe.\nPupil of the Correspondence Study Division.\nMarch 1st, 1922\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of January 4th, last, and your reply to the same on the 12th, last, No. 150-41, regarding the Work Books to accompany \"Pages from Canada's Story,\" I beg to enclose herewith a letter from Miss Armitage, a teacher on the staff at our Onion lake Indian Residential School, in which she sets forth her opinion of the Work Books in question.\n\nAs Miss Armitage is a graduate in Arts of the University of Saskatchewan, and has taken a special course in pedagogy, the favourable opinion she has expressed on the Work Books is deserving of careful consideration by your Department, and I trust that it may be found possible to have a liberal supply of these books forwarded to each of our Society's Indian Residential Schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"T.

I should have liked to have more of painting and drawing and pictures.\n\nYour books had such lovely things in them that there is nothing more left to give boys and girls for interest.\n\nI live in a very lonesome place, and you shall be very interested to hear that my favourite subjects are Arithmetic and History, and always make high marks on them.\n\nWell I hope you shall be able to make more books, also for Grade VI, for next year I shall not have any.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned \u2014 \"Patricia Ryan\"\n\nPlaster Mines\nVic.

Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have pleasure in enclosing copy of a letter from Dr. T. R. R. Westgate of the Indian Residential School Commission, Manitoba, which speaks for itself. I enclose also copies of some of the letters received from young students using them, which I think constitutes the best kind of advertising.\n\nThe History Work Books referred to have now been in use for several years, and have certainly proved themselves. They have received very high praise from inspectors and principals. I send under separate cover complete sample copies, together with sample copies of others of our publications which are also steadily making their way into favour.\n\nThese books may all be obtained from the Renouf Publishing Company, Montreal, or direct from ourselves in Winnipeg, prices on application. (Part I History Work Books alone are also obtainable from J. M. Dent and Sons.)\n\nAs your examination will show, these books are the fruition of a lifetime of experience, and of a very deep sense of our responsibility towards children.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nM. L. Gowan\n\nMIG/M\nENCL.\nOttawa, August 8, 1939.\n\nDear Mrs. Gowan:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 21st ultimo and also copy of a letter received by you from Dr. Westgate, enclosed therewith.\n\nI shall be glad to keep these communications on file, for reference, when the matter to which they relate comes up for consideration from time to time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMrs. M. L. Gowan,\n109 Kingsway Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nNine Mile River,\nHants County, N.S.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nDuring the summer and autumn months I have had an agency for books. These books are indeed educational, and I have had a great many orders for Public Schools; the said orders to be delivered about the last of September.\n\nI visited the Indian Residential School in Shubenacadie this afternoon, but Father Mackie was away. However, I talked with the sister in charge and she suggested that I write to this Department and ask for an order. She told me that all books were supplied by your Department.\n\nMy first book is Winston's Dictionary and Reference Library. This is a dictionary, plus sections of Signs & Symbols, Tables of Weights Measure and Standards, Words & Phrases, Names of Persons and Places, Christian Names of Men & Women, Chronological Table (1000 B.C. to 1937 A.D.), Gazetteer,\nand Atlas of the World. The complete volume contains more than 1350 pages, including 300 illustrations. The complete book is 9\u00bd inches long, 7 inches wide, and more than 2 inches thick. It is attractively bound in waterproof cloth that will not finger mark, that is vermin proof, stamped in gold and ink with Patent Thumb Index\u2014Price $4.50.\n\nThe second book I have suitable for schools is \"The New Wonder Book of Knowledge\" and it is one volume complete in itself. This book is 7\u00bd x 9 inches containing 624 pages with 72 illustrations to describe the text and impress upon the mind the world's wonders in nature and history. This book is intended for the large class of men women and children who wish to gain some fair idea about the subjects that arise either in ordinary conversation or in reading, and about which they desire some definite information. Every chapter is \"The Story of \u2014\u2014\" For instance: Salt Making, Pair of Shoes Making, Teaspoon, the Big Redwood Tree, in a Watch, in a Fire Extinguisher in a Case of Chewing Gum Telephone, Newspapers, Submarine, Oil Well, Suit of Clothes, Bridges and dozens of others. Price $1.98\nThe last book I'd like to mention is \"The House of Windsor\" by Eric Roland, Canadian author. It includes the life of George V, founding the House of Windsor and is certainly a permanent record of the Empire and the Crown including the Coronation of George VI and special sections of the Royal Tour. The book measures 6 x 8 1/2 in., comprises nearly 500 pages lavishly illustrated with 64 photographs, 34 of which are on the Royal Tour. It is bound in durable rich cloth, maroon with gold stamping for only $2.00.\n\nI do feel that these books would be of great value in the Indian Residential School in Shubenacadie. I sell all kinds of books but the 3 I've described are the ones I've sold to a great many School Boards, and many teachers.\n\nI believe there are 8 grades in the School. Could I hope to have an order for several of these books? I do not hesitate in recommending them. I am a teacher of 12 years experience, and feel that the books are all that I've described them to be.\nMay I have a favorable reply as soon as possible, so that I may include an order with the one I'm delivering Sept. 31st. The payments may be divided - part when ordering and the remainder on delivery - or full payment on delivery.\n\nThanking you, and awaiting your reply,\n\nI am,\nRespectfully,\nHazel R. MacPhee.\n\nFor reference regarding my character & honesty:\nRev Mr MacLean Elmsdale N.B.\nDr MacInnes Shediac N.B.\nMiss Minnie Goodwin Stewiacke Colchester N.S.\nMr Dyson Gower\n\nand others if you wish them.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 8, 1939.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI am in receipt of your recent letter with reference to supplying books to the Shubenacadie Indian residential school.\n\nWe are required by law to secure all books for Indian schools through the Government Stationery Office. I understand that they purchase all books direct from the publishers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss Hazel R.

Public Printing & Stationery,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 9, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Rogers:\n\nI am anxious to secure, if I can, a catalogue and price list of the books available for sale and distribution at the Manitoba Book Bureau.\n\nI would have written to Mr. Brown but I am not sure that he is still in charge.\n\nAll textbooks for use in Indian day and residential schools and all school supplies are provided through the Government Stationery Office, a branch of the Public Service which comes directly under the King's Printer. This year, however, owing to the war conditions and the additional work for which the Stationery Office is now responsible, we have experienced difficulty in securing delivery of our textbooks and school supplies on time. It has been the practice in the past to make a distribution of these books and supplies annually.\n\nI should like to know what proportion of the textbooks for use in Manitoba schools are sent out during the holiday period (July and August). It is just possible that I may have to work out a system whereby residential school books will be provided one season of the year and Indian day school books at another. I am thinking of this in order to avoid the congestion that usually takes place toward the end of the holiday period.\n\nDoes the Book Bureau send out printed requisition forms to Secretaries of School Boards in\n\nC. K. Rogers, Esq., M.A.,\nDepartment of Education,\nLegislative Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nthe province? If so, I should like to have sample copies. I hesitate to trouble you in respect to this matter, knowing how fully occupied you are with your regular duties from day to day. If Mr. Brown is still in charge of the Book Bureau, you might simply pass on this letter to him and have him reply direct.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.

H. WHITE, M.S.\nHELEN G. CAMPBELL\n\nDOMINION OF CANADA\nDEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\nPAMPHLET NO. 49\u2014NEW SERIES\n\nDAIRY AND COLD STORAGE BRANCH\nJ. A. RUDDICK, Commissioner.\n\nPublished by direction of the Hon. W. R. Matherwell, Minister of Agriculture.\nOttawa, 1927\nHOME-MADE FROZEN DESSERTS\n\nWhat is more appetizing on a warm summer day than a dish of good ice cream? More and more of this dairy product is now being used and it has virtually passed out of the luxury class of foods, being served as a dessert at hotels, restaurants and homes at all seasons of the year. Like all dairy products, ice cream is a well-balanced, easily digested, palatable food containing all the nutritive elements essential to body building and good health\u2014fat, protein, carbohydrates and vitamins, especially Fat Soluble A. When made from fresh, clean-flavoured cream, it has a delicacy of flavour which appeals to young and old. Ice cream is altogether an ideal food.\n\nThe attractiveness of ice cream is one of the reasons for its popularity, though it has many other advantages which place it among the more important foods. It is a general favourite, even among those who do not relish milk and cream in the fluid state and it contains all the nourishment of these foods, as the milk constituents are not evaporated in the freezing process. Ice cream is a valuable source of fat, the lack of which may be serious in fever in the ordinary diet, protein of excellent quality for growth and the maintenance of health, fat in one of its most easily digested forms, sugar and all three vitamins. The comparatively high proportion of sugar and the low temperature make ice cream less desirable than milk for children, but it has much to recommend it as an article of diet.\n\nDr. McCollum, an eminent authority on nutrition, calls attention to at least one point in favour of the custom of selling ice cream in cones. In this way, many children are induced to buy ice cream instead of candy and thus supplement a diet sometimes seriously lacking in milk and other dairy products. Undoubtedly, an increase in the daily milk order would be a wiser and more economical method, but in homes where the value of milk is not fully understood, this \"casual purchase\" or \"treat\" by poor children is a matter of much greater importance than it might at first thought appear to be.\n\nIce cream is of particular importance in the sick room, as it provides nourishment in an easily digested form. It is usually allowed even when the patient's diet is limited to liquids and is often especially valuable in cases of fever.\n\nCARE OF THE CREAM\n\nCream which is about 24 hours old is more satisfactory for ice cream making than fresh cream. It should, however, be perfectly sweet and it is necessary, therefore, that the cream be kept in a cool place. If cream is aged (24 hours) and kept cool before freezing, the texture of the ice cream will be smooth and free from ice crystals which are so objectionable.\n\nEQUIPMENT NECESSARY\n\nIt is possible to make frozen desserts with utensils to be found in any kitchen. Good ice cream may be made according to the following directions by using some vessel such as a small tin or granite pail and another vessel similar in shape, but several sizes larger.\n\nAfter pouring the ice cream mixture into the smaller pail, cover tightly and place in the larger one, leaving the handle erect. Pack with ice and salt, or with snow and salt, then, using the handle of the pail, turn back and forth to keep the contents in motion. After 5 or 10 minutes, remove the cover, being careful to prevent any salt getting into the mixture and, with a broad bladed knife, scrape the frozen portion from the inside edge into the centre. Cover tightly and repeat until the mixture is frozen, scraping from the inside edge frequently.\nIce cream for a small family, or individual amounts for an invalid, may be made in this way by using a small vessel such as a baking powder can and a bowl or small pail. This is not so convenient a method of making ice cream as when a freezer is used. A longer time is required but a delicious dessert can be made in this way.\n\nVarious sizes of ice cream freezers are on the market. For the average home, a quarter-size is suitable and can be purchased at almost any hardware store for $5.00, or less. A freezer is a convenient addition to the kitchen equipment and, when properly cared for, will last a long time.\n\nIce can be secured at all seasons of the year in towns and cities, while the modern dairy farm usually has a well-filled ice house. Snow can be used, when available, as a substitute for ice with very satisfactory results. Salt is also necessary for the freezing process. Crushed rock salt is preferable, but ordinary coarse salt or even table salt will serve the purpose.\n\n**Classification of Ice Cream**\n\n**Plain Ice Creams.**\n\nThe plain ice creams are made from table cream (12 to 18 per cent butterfat), sugar and flavouring material. Vanilla is the most common flavouring, but other flavours such as chocolate, maple, coffee or caramel, are suitable and appetizing.\n\n**Fruit Ice Creams.**\n\nThe fruit ice creams consist of cream, sugar and fresh fruits. Almost any kind of fresh fruit such as strawberries, raspberries, cranberries, peaches, cherries, grapes or currants can be used. The fruit should be fresh and well ripened.\n\n**Nut Ice Creams.**\n\nNut ice creams consist of cream, sugar and nuts. Any of the common nuts\u2014walnuts, filberts, etc., can be used. Vanilla, chocolate or caramel are suitable flavourings for nut ice creams.\n\n**Bisque Ice Creams.**\n\nBisque ice creams are made of cream, sugar and bread products such as macaroons, grapenuts, marshmallows, etc.\n\n**Parfaits.**\n\nParfaits belong to the richer and fancier ice creams. They consist of cream of about 25 or 30 per cent butterfat, sugar, yolks of eggs and flavouring material. Nuts or fresh fruit may be added.\n\n**Mousses.**\n\nMousse is probably the richest and fanciest of the ice creams and consists of frozen whipped cream to which sugar and natural flavouring have been added. Fresh fruits are necessary for mousse and a small amount of lemon juice should be added to bring out the fresh fruit flavour.\n\n**Puddings.**\n\nIce cream puddings are made from the parfait mixture with the addition of candied fruits and nuts. They are generally highly seasoned. These puddings are suitable for Thanksgiving, Christmas and other holiday festivities.\n\n**Ices.**\n\nThe most common ices are the water and milk sherbets which consist of milk, skimmilk, or water, sugar, flavouring and the whites of eggs, if desired. Sherbets are characterized by their tart flavour, as lemon juice is usually added in addition to any other flavouring used.\n\nFrappes consist of the same materials as sherbets, but are frozen only to a soft, semi-frozen consistency.\n\nSouffles differ from sherbets in that they contain the whole egg.\n\nAny of the above ice creams can be made easily in the home. The cost and richness of the plain ice creams will depend on the richness of the cream used. Ordinary table cream (about 18 per cent butterfat) will make a very smooth and tasty ice cream, but this cream may be thinned with milk in equal proportions, which will reduce the cost and still make an acceptable product. Parfaits, puddings, mousses and bisques are fancy products which are more expensive, but are suitable for special occasions. In the country and small towns and even in large cities fancy ice creams cannot be purchased readily. They can be made in the home, however, at any season of the year, as all the materials necessary can be obtained separately at any time.\n\n**Some Recipes for Ice Cream.**\n\nOnly a few recipes are given as illustrations of the different types of frozen dishes, but a great variety of frozen desserts can be made by the use of different flavouring materials. In the making of ice creams, much scope is given for the imagination and ingenuity of the housekeeper in attractive and palatable combinations of food materials.\n\nThe cream in each of the following recipes, except for that of the mousse, is table cream (16 to 18 per cent butterfat), but the cost of the ice cream can be reduced considerably by using half cream and half milk; or about two-thirds cream and one-third milk. Thinner cream, however, will not give as smooth an ice cream and it will probably require a longer time to freeze.\n\nThe amounts given in these recipes are for one quart of ice cream.\n\n| TABLE OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES |\n|--------------------------------|\n| 2 cups .................................. 1 pint |\n| 4 cups .................................. 1 quart |\n| 2 cups granulated sugar ............. 1 pound |\n| 1 tablespoon (tbsp.) .................. 1 ounce |\n| 3 teaspoons (tep.) .................... 1 tablespoon |\n\n**Vanilla Ice Cream, No. 1.**\n\n- 1 pint table cream\n- 2 tsp. vanilla\n- 1 cup sugar\n\nMix the ingredients, stir to dissolve the sugar, and freeze.\n\n**Vanilla Ice Cream, No. 2.**\n\n- 1 cup scalded milk\n- 1 egg yolk\n- 1 tsp. flour\n- \u00bd cup sugar\n- 1 tsp. vanilla\n- 1 cup cream\n\nMix the flour and sugar together, add the slightly beaten egg yolk and stir in the milk gradually. Cook over hot water about 15 minutes, strain and cool. Add the cream and flavouring. Freeze and serve.\n\n**Chocolate Ice Cream.**\n\n- 1 pint cream\n- \u00bc cup sugar\n- \u00bc cup chocolate or cocoa\n- 1 tsp. vanilla\n- few grains salt\n\nPut the chocolate or cocoa, half the sugar and a little water or milk in a pan. Heat over hot water and stir until a smooth syrup is formed. Cool the syrup and add with the remaining sugar to the cream. Add flavouring and freeze.\n\n**Oatmeal Ice Cream.**\n\n- \u00bd cup rolled oats\n- 1 cup milk\n- \u00bc tsp. vanilla\n- \u00bc cup sugar\n- 1 cup cream\n\nSoak the rolled oats in the milk one hour. Strain. Cook the strained liquid in a double boiler about 45 minutes, stirring frequently. When cool, add cream and flavouring. Freeze.\nFROZEN RICE PUDDING.\n\n2 cups rice\n1 cup sugar\n1 cup cream\n1 tsp. vanilla\n\nWash the rice thoroughly in boiling, salted water until tender. Drain; then add the milk and cook in double boiler about 30 minutes. Press through a sieve and pour over the egg yolks and sugar beaten together. Return to the double boiler and stir until it thickens. Remove from the fire, cool, add the flavouring and freeze. Whip the cream and add when the ice cream is nearly frozen. Leftover cooked rice may be used (about 6 tbsp.).\n\nSTRAWBERRY ICE CREAM.\n\n1 pint cream\n1 tsp. vanilla\n1 cup sugar\n1 cup crushed strawberries\n\nCrush the fruit and sprinkle with the 1/4 cup sugar. Mix the remaining ingredients and freeze. Add the crushed fruit when the mixture is nearly frozen.\n\nAny fruit may be used in the same way, the amount of sugar being varied according to the sweetness of the fruit. Before adding the sugar to seedy fruits such as raspberries, crush through a sieve to remove the seeds.\n\nNUT ICE CREAM.\n\n1 pint cream\n2 tsp. vanilla\n1 cup sugar\n1 cup chopped nuts\n\nAdd the vanilla and sugar to the cream. Freeze. When nearly frozen, add the chopped nuts. Nuts used in chocolate or maple ice cream make a very palatable frozen product.\n\nMACAROON BISQUE.\n\n1 pint cream\n2 tsp. vanilla\n1 cup sugar\n1 cup ground macaroons\n\nDry the macaroons in a hot oven. Roll or grind in a meat grinder and add to the ice cream when nearly frozen. Grapefruit ice cream can be made by substituting grapefruit for macaroons.\n\nLEMON MILK SHERBET.\n\n1 pint whole milk or skimmilk\n1 cup sugar\n2 cups lemon juice\n2 egg whites (if desired)\n\nWhip the egg whites and mix with other ingredients; freeze. If fresh fruit flavours are desired, add only one-third the amount of lemon juice and less sugar with sweeter fruits. Egg whites may be omitted, but the sherbet will not be as smooth in texture.\n\nMilk, eggs and sugar will be the same in other sherbets, only the flavouring material will change.\n\nThe following recipes are for the richer ice creams and are more expensive. The cream used should not be thinned and to get the best results should contain about 25 to 30 per cent butterfat. Table cream, however, will suffice.\n\nGOLDEN PARFAIT.\n\n1 pint cream\n2 egg yolks\n1/2 cup sugar\n2 tsp. vanilla\n\nAdd one-quarter of the cream to the egg yolks and beat a few moments over hot water, stirring constantly. Remove from the fire, cool, add the other ingredients and freeze.\n\nA nut parfait can be made by adding one-half cup of chopped nuts to this recipe. For fruit parfait, add three-quarters of a cup of crushed fruit.\n\nNESSERODE PUDDING.\n\n1 pint cream\n2 tsp. vanilla\n1 cup maraschino cherries\n1/4 oz. candied fruits\n1 cup sugar\n2 egg yolks\n1 cup chopped walnuts\n1 slice chopped pineapple\n\nAdd one-quarter of the cream to the egg yolks and heat a few moments over hot water, stirring constantly. Add sugar, remove from fire, cool and add vanilla. Grind and mix the fruit and nuts and add when the cream is nearly frozen. All puddings are made from the golden parfait mixture with fruits and nuts added.\n\nMOUSSE.\n\n1 pint whipping cream\n1/2 cup crushed fruit (strawberries, peaches, etc.)\n1/2 cup sugar\nJuice of one lemon\n\nWhip the cream. Then add sugar, lemon juice and crushed fruit and freeze. Turn the freezer very slowly and just enough to insure even freezing of the whole mixture. Although not necessary, the cream may be coloured to correspond with the colour of the fruit.\n\nSAUCES FOR PLAIN ICE CREAMS\n\nMARSHMALLOW SAUCE.\n\n1/2 lb. marshmallows\n1 cup boiling water\n1 cup pulverized sugar\n\nCut marshmallows in pieces and melt in double boiler. Dissolve sugar in the boiling water. Add to marshmallows and stir until thoroughly blended. Turn into bowl and cool before serving.\n\nCHOCOLATE SAUCE.\n\n1 square chocolate (unsweetened)\n2 tsp. butter\n1/2 tsp. vanilla\n1 cup sugar\n1/2 cup boiling water\n\nMelt chocolate, add the butter, then the water, gradually. Add the sugar and boil about 5 minutes. Then add vanilla.\n\nCOFFEE SAUCE.\n\n1/2 cups milk\n1/2 cup sugar\n1/2 cup ground coffee\n1 tsp. cornstarch\nfew grains of salt\n\nScald the milk with the coffee and let stand about 20 minutes. Then strain. Mix the sugar, cornstarch and salt together, and into this stir the hot coffee infusion. Cook 5 minutes and serve hot.\n\nThis sauce may be made using one cup of milk and 1/2 cup of left-over coffee.\n\nFREEZING THE ICE CREAM MIXTURE\n\nIt is a common impression that it takes a great deal of time and hard work to make ice cream. Such is not the case. It is a simple matter to mix the ingredients and, if the cream is at least 24 hours old, and if ice and salt is used in proper proportions, it is a matter of only 15 or 20 minutes before the freezing process is completed. The freezing process, however, is important to give the ice cream the proper body and texture as this has a great effect on the palatability.\n\nPOINTS TO REMEMBER WHEN FREEZING ICE CREAM.\n\n1. Cream when frozen increases considerably in volume and, on this account, the freezer should never be filled more than half full. The increase in volume is due to the incorporation of air during the freezing process and the more evenly this is incorporated in the ice cream mixture, the smoother the ice cream will be.\n\n2. The can containing the ice cream mixture should be adjusted in the freezer, then packed with alternate layers of finely crushed ice and salt. About eight to twelve parts of ice to one part of salt will give an efficient freezing mixture. As the freezer is turned, the salt will gradually work down and come in contact with all the ice.\n\n3. Snow may be used instead of ice. If the ice or snow does not melt quickly enough, a small amount of water poured over it will help in the formation of the brine and hasten the freezing process.\n\n4. If the cream has been previously cooled to a low temperature, the handle of the freezer may be turned fairly quickly from the start; if the mixture in the can is at ordinary room temperature, the handle should be turned slowly for a few minutes to cool the cream to about freezing point. Too rapid turning of the can before the cream is quite cold tends to churn the cream and will result in the ice cream containing particles of butterfat which are objectionable.\n5. After the cream has started to freeze, the handle may be turned more quickly until the freezing process is complete. This should require from fifteen to twenty minutes.\n\n6. When the ice cream is frozen to a semi-solid condition and will hold its shape, remove the dasher from the freezer and, with a spoon, pack the ice cream solidly in the can.\n\n7. Cover the can, placing a cork in the opening in the cover.\n\n8. Draw off the brine and repack the freezer with alternate layers of ice and salt, using about eight measures of ice to one of salt. If only a short time can be allowed for the ice cream to stand use a higher proportion of salt.\n\n9. Cover the freezer with a damp sack or piece of carpet and allow to stand at least one hour for the ice cream to harden. Large quantities require several hours.\n\n10. After about an hour, draw off the brine and add more ice and salt. Repeat whenever necessary until the ice cream is used.\nAN ARGUMENT IN THE KITCHEN\n\nA PLAYLET FOR CHILDREN IN ONE ACT\n\nBY\n\nHELEN G.

Susie Smith who sits behind me in school drinks coffee every day. She said this morning that only babies drink milk.\n\nMOTHER\u2014But you remember how I told me last week that Susie is one of those little girls who are so much underweight. I want my little girl to be well and strong and that's why I want you to drink milk and follow all those health rules teacher tells you about.\n\nBETTY\u2014But could I have coffee just this once?\n\nMOTHER\u2014No, Betty. Coffee's not good for children\u2014not even a taste. Now you've finished your lunch, you have time for a rest before starting back to school.\nBetty\u2014All right, Mother. I'll sit in the big chair in the kitchen.\n\n(Betty comes into kitchen and sits in chair\u2014settles comfortably.)\n\nBetty\u2014(Drowsily) My! It's so nice and warm here\u2014I'm sleepy as can be.\n\nMother\u2014Well, take a little nap, dear. Sweet dreams!\n\nMr. Kitchen Clock (peeking out from behind clock)\u2014Well, Betty is asleep already. I hope she dreams of the Kitchen People for a change. I wonder if these Human Beings ever realize how interested we are in them?\n\nMr. Pickle Jar\u2014Are they indeed, Mr. Kitchen Clock? You see, my name is Mr. Pickle Jar and I do not visit in the kitchen very often so I do not know the kitchen people very well.\n\nMr. Kitchen Clock\u2014Why, yes, we are all very fond of the family and we all try very hard to please them. Some of us are very jealous of what Betty's Mother thinks of us, and Mrs. Milk Bottle and Mrs. Coffee Pot are forever arguing as to which one does the most good.\n\nMr. Pickle Jar\u2014Mrs. Milk Bottle and Mrs. Coffee Pot! I don't know those ladies. They have not come in yet? Perhaps they are together somewhere.\n\nMr. Kitchen Clock\u2014Oh, dear me, no! Mrs. Milk Bottle and Mrs. Coffee Pot are not very good friends. They do not meet very often for they live in different localities. Mrs. Milk Bottle lives on Refrigerator Street. She prefers that neighbourhood to any other for the climate suits her better. Mrs. Milk Bottle says it is very bad for her to live anywhere but the coldest spot she can find.\n\nMr. Pickle Jar\u2014Who is this Mrs. Milk Bottle?\n\nMr. Kitchen Clock\u2014Mrs. Milk Bottle is quite an important personage here. I am very fond of her, but like everybody else she has her peculiarities. For one thing, she always wears a hat in the house. If she has her way, she changes her travelling hat of cardboard as soon as she comes into the house and puts on one of those glass or aluminium ones. She takes a lot of pride in her appearance.\n\nMr. Pickle Jar\u2014And what about Mrs. Coffee Pot? Where does she live?\n\nMr. Kitchen Clock\u2014Mrs. Coffee Pot is particular about her looks, too. She lives on Pantry Row, near her neighbours Miss Salt and Mr. Pepper, who Mrs. Matchbox says are seen together a good deal.\n\n(Mrs. Milk Bottle and Mrs. Coffee Pot enter from opposite sides.)\n\nMrs. Porridge Pot\u2014Here's Mrs. Coffee Pot now\u2014and here's Mrs. Milk Bottle.\n\nMrs. Coffee Pot\u2014Good morning, Kitchen People. My, this is a cold place.\n\nMrs. Milk Bottle\u2014Oh, you are so particular! You always like such a warm place.\n\nMrs. Coffee Pot\u2014Well, I'm not like you, turn sour when I'm left in a warm place for a little while. Warmth improves my disposition. You always talk about being kept \"Clean, cold and covered.\"\n\nMrs. Milk Bottle\u2014You are rather particular yourself about being kept clean and shiny.\n\nMrs. Coffee Pot\u2014Well, anyway, I am satisfied with that. You like to be dressed up with a glass or aluminium head-dress; I suppose you think the cardboard one is not becoming to you.\n\nMrs. Milk Bottle\u2014Well, I've very important work to do and I can do my work better when people keep me clean and cold, and\u2014\n\nMrs. Steam Bowl (interrupting)\u2014Yes, but sometimes Betty seems to like Mrs. Coffee Pot best. Do you remember this morning, she asked for coffee instead of milk?\n\nMrs. Milk Bottle\u2014But her mother said coffee was not good for children.\n\nMrs. Coffee Pot (angry at what Betty's mother said about her)\u2014I am just as good as some other folks I know here.\n\nMrs. Milk Bottle\u2014Oh, you are, are you? Well, perhaps you will tell what good you do.\n\nMrs. Coffee Pot\u2014I am very fond of the family.\n\nMrs. Milk Bottle\u2014Oh, yes, you pretend to be fond of the family. Dear knows, you should be, for you are kept shiny and clean and are well looked after, but I don't believe you repay the kindness shown you except by giving to grown-up people a drink of good flavour.\n\nMrs. Coffee Pot\u2014I suppose you have been listening to that cousin of yours, Mrs. Cream Jug. She always thinks she is so necessary. It's true she is a great help to me, but many people prefer not to have her accompany me.\n\nMr. Kitchen Clock (stepping out from behind clock)\u2014Now, now, my friends, do not let us squabble. Let us hold a Court and decide this question once and for all. Lend your ear, good people, and let us hear the statements of the parties to the suit. We will now see which of them gives most to little Betty.\n\nMr. Kitchen Clock (continuing)\u2014Now, Mrs. Milk Bottle, what have you to say?\nMrs. Milk Bottle\u2014Judge Kitchen Clock, I claim I am the best friend of babies, boys and girls and even grown-up people, too; especially when they are sick. I put roses in children's cheeks and make them healthy and happy. The Good Health Fairies have blessed what I have to give them.\n\nMr. Kitchen Clock\u2014We will hear what the Good Health Fairies have to say.\n\n(Enter Butterfat Fairy, who takes Mrs. Milk Bottle by the hand.)\n\nButterfat Fairy\u2014I am Fairy Butterfat of the Tribe of Good Health Fairies and I help Mrs. Milk Bottle.\n\nMr. Kitchen Clock\u2014Oh yes\u2014I have heard of you. They say you are Mrs. Milk Bottle's favourite fairy.\n\nButterfat Fairy\u2014Why no! She is just as fond of the other fairies. Folks always see me first, though, because I am so hard to keep down.\n\nMr. Kitchen Clock\u2014Do you bless the milk which Mrs. Milk Bottle gives boys and girls?\n\nButterfat Fairy\u2014Why, of course. I make milk taste better, and more than that, I keep boys and girls warm and make them grow.\n\nMr. Kitchen Clock\u2014Have you any little sisters or brothers who help Mrs. Milk Bottle?\n\nButterfat Fairy\u2014Oh, yes, little Sugar Fairy helps Mrs. Milk Bottle and she loves little children. She is so sweet almost everybody loves her.\n\nMr. Kitchen Clock\u2014Call Sugar Fairy.\n\n(Butterfat calls Sugar Fairy.)\n\nSugar Fairy (entering)\u2014I'm not very big but I love little children. They love me, too. I help folks keep warm; and milk, which Mrs. Milk Bottle gives, is a food I have blessed.\n\nMr. Kitchen Clock\u2014And what else do you do, little maid?\n\nSugar Fairy\u2014I also bless Mrs. Sugar Bowl and Mrs. Candy Box, too (pointing to each in turn); but if I could write, I'd hang a sign on both\u2014\"Take in Small Doses.\"\n\nMrs. Sugar Bowl and Mrs. Candy Box (both together)\u2014Oh, that would not be nice. Little children just love us and always want us.\n\nMr. Kitchen Clock\u2014Order! Sugar Fairy is giving evidence.\n\nSugar Fairy\u2014You know, Judge Kitchen Clock, when little children want too much of my company, I begin to spoil their teeth and sometimes even make them sick. I don't do it to be mean, I just can't help it.\n\n(Sugar Fairy takes signs and hangs them on Mrs. Sugar Bowl and Mrs. Candy Box. Mrs. Sugar Bowl and Mrs. Candy Box hang heads and look rather ashamed.)\n\nMr. Kitchen Clock\u2014Is there any other little fairy wishing to speak?\n\nProtein Fairy (entering)\u2014Yes, I'm Protein Fairy. I build muscle to make people strong. Boys who eat what I bless can play football\u2014and baseball\u2014and hockey.\n\nMr. Kitchen Clock\u2014And little girls\u2014what can they do when they eat the food you bless?\n\nProtein Fairy\u2014Little girls can run fast and jump far. They can also do a great deal to help Mother. I can work best when boys and girls drink about three glasses of milk every day.\n\nMr. Kitchen Clock\u2014Call the next witness.\n\nMrs. Milk Bottle\u2014Come, Lime Fairy.\n\nLime Fairy (entering)\u2014I help Mrs. Milk Bottle, too. I make teeth\u2014good, white, firm teeth\u2014and children can have the teeth I make \"for keeps\" if they take good care of them. I build bones, too.\n\nMr. Kitchen Clock\u2014And what foods have you blessed, little builder?\n\nLime Fairy\u2014Milk is my favourite. I put into milk more of the material to build teeth and bones than I put in any other food. Children who drink it can depend on me.\n\nMr. Kitchen Clock\u2014Are there any more witnesses?\n\nVitamin Fairies (entering all together, hands clasped)\u2014We are called Vitamins. We always go along with milk which Mrs. Milk Bottle gives and we love it best of all the foods because we're not all together in any other. We love Mrs. Milk Bottle. We are not very well known but we do a great deal of good and no boy or girl could grow or be well and strong without us.\n\n(All the fairies join hands and dance in ring, singing to the tune of \"London Bridge is Falling down\":)\n\nWe're the Good Health Fairies, Fairies, Fairies,\nWe're the Good Health Fairies, we work for children.\nWe make good food for boys and girls, boys and girls, boys and girls.\nWe make good food for boys and girls and make them happy.\n\nWe love one food the best of all, best of all, best of all,\nWe won't tell you that food's name, we'll spell it for you.\n\n(Fairies form the word M-I-L-K.) See footnotes 1 and 2; also illustration on page 16.\n\nKitchen People (all together)\u2014Milk!\n\nMr. Kitchen Clock\u2014Has anyone else here anything to say in favour of Mrs. Milk Bottle? Have you, Mrs. Porridge Pot?\n\nMrs. Porridge Pot\u2014Yes, indeed, Judge. I have something especially good for children but I always have to depend on my friend, Mrs. Milk Bottle, to help me.\n\nMr. Kitchen Clock\u2014And you, Mr. Soup Kettle\u2014what have you to say?\n\nMr. Soup Kettle\u2014I give something good too, and I always know that if Mrs. Milk Bottle helps me with a soup for the family, it is a food I can be proud to give.\n\nMr. Kitchen Clock\u2014Yes, I guess Mrs. Milk Bottle does give a good deal to little Betty. All these witnesses are great friends of mine. Now, Mrs. Coffee Pot, let us hear what you have to say. Please tell the kitchen folk here what you can do for boys and girls.\n\n(Mrs. Coffee Pot hangs head, looking ashamed\u2014sulks.)\n\nMr. Kitchen Clock\u2014Come, come! Haven't you any fairies to speak for you?\n\nCaffeine (coming from behind Mrs. Coffee Pot)\u2014I'm not a fairy. I'm a mischievous sprite called Caffeine. I make coffee harmful for children. None of the Good Health Fairies will have anything to do with me. My best friend is Cousin Tannin who does the same to tea as I do to coffee.\n\n(Tannin peers from behind Mrs. Teapot on hearing his name mentioned by Caffeine.)\n\nMr. Kitchen Clock\u2014Has anyone something to say in favour of Mrs. Coffee Pot? (Deep silence.) Now what is the decision?\n\n(All kitchen people with exception of Mr. Kitchen Clock, Mrs. Coffee Pot and Mrs. Milk Bottle consult together.)\n\nMr. Pickle Jar\u2014Well, I guess this is no place for me. What I give isn't good for children.\n\n(Mr. Pickle Jar tiptoes around the group and when he gets near the door makes a dash through it and away.)\n\nMrs. Porridge Pot (announcing verdict to Mr. Kitchen Clock)\u2014The decision of this assembly is that Mrs. Milk Bottle is by far the more valuable of the two parties to the suit.\n\nMr. Kitchen Clock\u2014You have heard the verdict. (Pointing to Mrs. Coffee Pot)\u2014For punishment, I am going to forbid you to have anything to do with Miss Betty and all other growing girls and boys.\n\n(Fairies clap their hands. Mrs. Porridge Pot and Mr. Soup Kettle say \"hear, hear,\" and nod approvingly.)\n\n(Mrs. Coffee Pot stamps her foot and cries in anger.)\n\n(Mr. Kitchen Clock returns to place behind clock, points one hand of clock to one, the other to twelve and beats once on small drum or pan.)\n\nMother (coming into kitchen)\u2014One o'clock! (Wakens Betty.) Time to go back to school, dear.\n\nBetty (Stretches and yawns, then wakes up suddenly)\u2014Oh, Mother, I had the funniest dream. All the pots and pans were people. They talked. Mother! And Mrs. Milk Bottle and Mrs. Coffee Pot were quarrelling about what they did for me. . . . And they had a Court and there were fairies. . . . And Mrs. Milk Bottle was so nice and so kind and all the fairies belonged to her. . . . Mrs. Coffee Pot didn't have any fairies\u2014just a horrid sprite who makes coffee bad for girls and boys. I'm not going to taste coffee\u2014or tea\u2014till I'm grown up anyway. I'm going to drink Milk every day.\n\nMother\u2014I'm glad of that, Betty. We're going to have hot milk soup for supper.\n\nBetty\u2014Oh, goody, goody! Make a lot, please, Mother\u2014I'll have a good appetite.\n\n(Betty dances out of kitchen to go to school.)\n\nMother (laughs and says to herself)\u2014It's fortunate Betty had that dream. There's nothing like Milk for growing children.\n\n(Curtain falls.)\nCostumes\n\nBetty\u2014Little girl dressed in school clothes.\n\nMrs. Milk Bottle\u2014White cardboard shaped like a milk bottle.\n\nMrs. Coffee Pot\u2014Cardboard shaped as a coffee pot and painted with aluminum paint.\n\nMr. Kitchen Clock\u2014Black sateen costume, similar to Father Time or Judge.\n\nMrs. Pantry Pot\u2014Cardboard shaped and painted to resemble double boiler (light blue stippled with white).\n\nMr. Soup Kettle\u2014Cardboard shaped and painted to resemble large saucepan (light blue stippled with white).\n\nMiss Salt and Mr. Pepper\u2014Cardboard shaped and painted to resemble salt and pepper shakers, flat cardboard hats with black dots to resemble openings for salt and pepper.\n\nMr. Pickle Jar\u2014Cardboard shaped and painted to resemble pickle jar, cap of lead-foil to resemble cover of pickle jar.\n\nMrs. Teapot\u2014Cardboard shaped and painted brown to resemble Brown Betty teapot.\n\nMrs. Sugar Bowl\u2014Cardboard shaped as sugar bowl and painted white\u2014with or without decoration.\n\nMrs. Candy Box\u2014Cardboard shaped and painted to resemble a candy box.\n\nFairies\n\nButterfat\u2014Yellow tights extending over feet; yellow sateen coat gathered in at waist, wired at bottom to flare well; hat of yellow cardboard or sateen in shape of pound of butter. (Yellow crepe paper may be used for this costume.)\n\nSugar\u2014White book muslin dress with flary skirt (brushed with starch and sprinkled with \"snow\"), white stockings, no hat, white gauze wings trimmed with tinsel.\n\nProtein\u2014Long black stockings, red sateen suit with very short, full pants, short red coat, red hat. (Football togs may be used.)\n\nLime\u2014Long, dark trousers and white coat (to look like a dentist).\n\nVitamins\u2014Three green crepe paper dresses. Bandeau of tinsel may be worn on hair.\n\nSprites\n\nCaffeine\u2014Brown cotton or sateen suit, big ears.\n\nTannin\u2014Brown or black sateen suit similar to that of Caffeine.\n\nStage Settings\n\nReal furniture\u2014stove, refrigerator, table, clock,\n\nor\n\nBeaverboard painted to resemble kitchen and kitchen furniture.\n\nReal chair.\n\nArrangement\n\nThe playlet may be staged with a background similar to the one used by the Dairy Branch, shown in the photograph. This allows for an easy and natural grouping of the characters. In this case, Betty and her Mother are not seen in the opening dialogue. Another arrangement is to make use of two curtains, the usual one at the front, behind which Betty and her Mother sit at the table, and a second curtain which hides the other characters until after Betty falls asleep. The playlet, however, can be put on in a schoolroom or elsewhere by arranging real furniture conveniently and placing an ordinary kitchen clock on a shelf from which a curtain is suspended to hide the character \"Kitchen Clock.\"\n\nWhile the costumes and setting are of very great importance in the effective staging of this play, it can be put on in the schoolroom very interestingly for children, by dressing the characters in plain white aprons such as are used in Home Economics classes and using cardboard labels with the names of the characters. One teacher made use of it in this way, even improvising furniture\u2014a large black cloth covered a small table and did duty as a kitchen stove. As has been said, however, the costumes add a great deal to the attractiveness of the play and they can be made at home or in the classroom without much trouble and with little expense.\n\nIt is sometimes possible to secure the equipment used by the Dairy Branch, Department of Agriculture, Ottawa. Anyone wishing particulars, or further suggestions as to staging the playlet, may write to this office.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nThe photographs of the stage settings and characters were taken at the Borden School, Ottawa, through the courtesy of the Principal, Miss McKerracher. The children are pupils of that school.\n\nAcknowledgment is due the Principal, teachers and pupils of the Borden School in trying out the playlet as first drafted. This was a great help in suggesting improvements in dialogue and stage arrangements and in ascertaining how children would like it.\nMrs. Mouse Entertains\n\nA CHOCOLATE STORY\n\nBy\n\nHelen G. Campbell,\n\nDAIRY AND GOLD STORAGE BRANCH,\nDEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, OTTAWA.\n\nThe mice were giving a party\u2014a wonderful party. It was Father Mouse's birthday and most of the relations were invited.\n\nAll day long Mrs. Mouse had scurried here and scurried there putting things \"to rights\" and getting ready for company. There was such a lot to be done\u2014the house to be \"tidied up\", spoons and forks and knives to polish, frocks to wash for all the Missy Mice, suits to press for all the Easter Bunnies\u2014and all without letting Father Mouse know; it was to be a surprise.\n\nAlways everybody else knew about it. Barker the dog knew, too\u2014ow the cat was pretty certain and even the lady-butterfly suspected it. Scratchily-scratch, scratchily-scratch, Mrs. Mouse ran hither and thither\u2014to market and home again, to market and home again, with all the supplies for a wonderful supper.\n\nShe hadn't very far to go; Father Mouse had been to this when they built their house. \"Dear me!\" It made Mrs. Mouse tired just to think what a time they'd had choosing a site for their new home. She used to tell how she and Father Mouse tramped miles and only decided to build there after they'd taken a good look at Mo-Cow the cat and had seen that he ate too much over to run fast. \"We'll be quite safe here,\" Father Mouse had said, \"will Mo-Cow start reducing exercises.\"\nBut even though they were near the market, it took a long time for Mother Mouse and the Missy Mice, coming home with their aprons filled, to bring everything, for Mrs. Mouse was to have something special for supper \u2014 she wanted the relations to see what a good cook she was.\n\nWhat a time she'd had to decide! She and all the Missy Mice had talked and talked about it. They knew Father Mouse would want his cheese. He was particular about having it every day; he thought there was nothing like it to make mousie. He no did it, he said, to make him strong to provide for his family. \"Let's have bread and cheese,\" said the Missy Mice, who never tired of it. But Mrs. Mouse wanted something \"extraordinary.\"\n\nAll of a sudden, she squeaked delightedly, \"I know, I'll have a cheese soup.\"\n\n\"A cheese soup, Mother?\" said the Missy Mice. \"How could you make cheese soup?\"\n\n\"I can\" said Mother Mouse, \"I know all about it; only last week when I went out for my afternoon walk I overheard Mrs. Neighbour-Next-Door tell The-Lady-Upstairs exactly how it was done. 'It was delicious,' she said 'and good for the children too \u2014 when well made.'\"\n\nMrs. Mouse went on to say she had been just walking through, not paying the slightest attention to the ladies' talk when she heard someone mention cheese. She stopped right away, of course; she was always interested in that subject, but she'd never heard of a cheese soup before. \"You take some milk,\" Mrs. Neighbour-Next-Door was saying, \"you heat it just so \u2014 in a double boiler, of course.\"\n\nMrs. Mouse had run for pencil and paper \u2014 she'd had an \"awful\" job to keep the paper from rattling but she'd managed to write down most of the directions and to make a special note not to let the cheese get too hot or cook too long.\n\n\"If you do\" Mrs. Neighbour-Next-Door had said, \"it will be tough and the children can't digest it properly.\"\n\nYou see, Mrs. Mouse liked to walk around the rooms occasionally though she wasn't on speaking terms with The-Lady-Upstairs \u2014 in fact, she wasn't even sure they'd like each other.\nSometimes she overlooked the funniest things \u2014 about HEALTH \u2014 and FOOD \u2014 and SUNSHINE \u2014 and FRESH AIR. It seems that Mrs. Neighbour-Next-Door was very particular about her children's health. She tucked them in bed very early and Mrs. House had heard her say she opened the windows wide every night.\n\nAnd their food was just so \u2014 about a quart of milk every day for each of the children, some fresh fruit and some green vegetables, lots of butter and brown bread and glasses and glasses of water.\n\nMrs. House knew, of course, that everybody should have plenty of sleep, eat plain nourishing food, drink lots of milk, wash their faces, comb their hair, brush their teeth, and make themselves tidy. But Mrs. Neighbour-Next-Door seemed to know all this and just why too; she often talked about it with Th-Lady-Upstairs.\n\nMrs. House stopped her work to talk of all these Health Rules and the little pigs thought it so interesting you could have heard a pin drop till the clock struck. \"Gnats!\" said Mrs. House, \"there is just time to go for the cheese before I should begin to make the soup.\" It would take a big piece and how could they get it home without Father House to help them? You see, he'd gone down to the City Hall to attend a meeting of the House's Improvement Society.\n\nIt was quite a job but the Missy Pigs and the Master Pig pushed and tugged and puffed and there it was at last, as fine a piece of cheese as Mrs. House had ever laid her eyes on.\n\nThen, such a sorry for pan! The milk was put to heat just like Mrs. Neighbour-Next-Door had said. Mrs. House measured the flour very carefully \u2014 while the butter melted in a saucepan. Then she stirred it in \u2014 just so \u2014 for she'd heard it must be smooth, creamy pasto. She didn't forget the salt and pepper either \u2014 not too much, she didn't believe in highly-spiced, highly-seasoned foods, especially for the children.\n\nThen she must add the milk and stir and stir.\n\n\"Poor dear, what if it should be lumpy!\" Mrs. House thought she'd die if it wasn't smooth, particularly when she expected Mrs. Farm House who set such a good table and Mrs. Grocery House who was trained to put on airs and Mrs. Church House who lived in such an aristocratic community.\nBut the soup didn't get lumpy; it was smooth as smooth. There was nothing to do now but wait till the company came and at the last minute put in the cheese which the Missy Mice were having such a time to grate. The grater was big, even Eldest-Hasty-Mouse could hardly reach the handle, and Youngest-Hasty-Mouse would be up to mischief and pull the tails of his brothers and sisters.\n\nThen the egg\u2014how were they going to break it? Mrs. Mouse thought she'd leave it out\u2014you can't have cheese soup\u2014let Eldest-Hasty-Mouse hold the prettiest hand. She put it near the edge of the table and hid Mother Mouse behind a curtain away down near the floor, then the Missy Mice gave a quick little shove. Snack! went the egg in Mother Mouse's curtsy.\n\nThere was just a minute to change their dresses, just a minute for Mother Mouse to put on a clean apron and polish her nose. Everything was ready! Mrs. Mouse had just made sure all the little mice's finger nails were clean and that they'd washed behind their ears, when the doorbell \"ding-a-ling!\"\n\n\"There!\" exclaimed Mrs. Mouse. \"Oh-ee\" said the little mice.\n\nIn scampered the visitors and everybody had presents for Father Mouse\u2014apples and carrots and lettuce and cabbage, and all the things he liked.\n\nCan you imagine when Father Mouse came home? Such a surprise! Such a sensation! \"Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday!\" squealed all the relations and Mrs. Mouse left him shaking hands with everybody when she went out to finish the soup.\nIn went the cheese! In a minute it was melted; then in went the yolk of the egg! One last minute to beat it \u2014 now it was ready to serve. Everybody helped to carry it to the table and Mother Mouse was so proud of her big surprise. The relations smacked their lips and said \"delicious\" and \"scrumptious\" and \"tasty\" and other words which meant the soup was over so good.\n\n\"How did you make it, Mother Mouse?\" And Mrs. Mouse told them how she had learned it from Mrs. Neighbour-Next-Door, how she'd said it was so good and so economical \u2014 and fine for the children, too, if properly prepared.\n\nYou can imagine the chatter at the table, the clatter of dishwashing afterwards, the games next, the laughing and running and sliding down the banisters. There was such a noise that Nee-Cry the cat awakened and said \"My, my, if I hadn't eaten too much for dinner, I'd chase those mice here.\" Nobody else heard and the mice had such fun it seemed no time till they heard the alarm clock call The-Lady-Upstairs it was time to get up. \"We must be going\" the visitors said, \"we've had a lovely time.\"\n\nWhen the last guest had said \"Good-bye\" Mrs. Mouse sighed happily, \"Well the party was a great success and everybody liked my cheese soup.\"\n\nIllustrated by Blanche Guthrie\n\nThe End\nOttawa, January 11, 1929.\n\nDr. Duncan Campbell Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nAs I promised when speaking with you yesterday, I have sent the publications dealing with the food value of dairy products which are issued by this Branch.

W. R. Macdonald, Minister of Agriculture, Ottawa, 1932.\nBookcovers issued by the Dairy and Cold Storage Branch, Department of Agriculture, Ottawa, Canada, are available to teachers and nurses for classroom use. These can be adjusted to fit school readers of the various provinces.\n\nAs the supply is not sufficient to allow indiscriminate distribution, it is suggested that they be given to those children who make an earnest effort to attain or maintain health. If each month, or each term, more children are entitled to this reward through improved health habits, additional copies are obtainable to supply each of these children. Teachers are asked to co-operate in preventing waste, and it is expected that a child will not receive more than one copy during the term at least.\n\nIt is hoped that in this way the bookcovers will help to impress Canadian boys and girls with the importance of proper food and that they will prove a stimulus to the development of good health habits.\n\n[Signature]\n\nHelen G.

The Department gratefully accepts your offer to send these covers to the teachers of Indian schools. I think the results of your efforts are very attractive.\n\nWith warm personal regards.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nMiss Helen G. Campbell,\nDemonstrator and Lecturer,\nDairy and Cold Storage Branch,\nDepartment of Agriculture,\nOttawa.\nCost of Food Primary Factor.\n\nThe committee appointed consisted of Dr. E. Bianche Smith of the Public Health Service, Dr. Frances Rother of the Children's Bureau and Dr. Edith Hawley of the Bureau of Home Economics. All three women are nutrition experts. Dr. Sterling, who served as chairman, also was an authority in hygiene, and Dr. Rother in infant hygiene and Dr. Hawley is a food economist.\n\nThe committee, after doing by scientific methods the food values which must be represented in an ideal minimum diet, arranged the menu on the basis of economy as possible. Indian children need and should have about the same foods, but the new ration has been proven to be the best for any child food, in view of the tendency to tuberculosis and other communicable diseases among the Indians. Cost was a primary factor in the problem.\n\nThe suggestions were submitted to Dr. Henry W. Sherman of the Bureau of Chemistry, Dr. J. McCollum of Johns Hopkins. Both men approved the plan with a few suggestions and Dr. McCollum added a few recommendations. In this form they were returned to the committee whose report was approved by Dr. Marshall C. Guthrie, chief medical director of the agency.\n\nThese modifications came from the recommendation that the standard to be achieved, where and when possible, should be to provide for a quart of milk per pupil daily, two ounces of meat or fish, five eggs, which may be used as an alternative to meat, and a small quantity of sugar and small quantities of jam.\n\nCost of New Ration.\n\nThe cost of the new ration is 39 cents per day as against 34, the estimated cost of the old ration. But officials of the Indian Bureau say it is impossible to provide even the present approved ration in all schools at all times. The actual ration program must keep within cost limits of 20 cents, usually within from 16 to 18 cents. The cost of the army ration is about 50 cents.\n\n\"We have estimated an average expenditure of $250 per pupil per year in the large schools, $200 for the medium schools and $175 for the smaller schools,\" states H. B. Peairs. \"The average school year is 270 days, and the cost of the new ration would be 25 cents a day to $67.50. That is more, sometimes than we have.\"\n\nThe committee estimates that it would bring the cost to $100.30. And we could only be pleased to see it provided. But the present standard is not provided for under any circumstances. No Indian child goes hungry. They may not have the best food, but they have as good fare as we would like to give them.\n\nEmphasis is being placed on improving the food served in our schools and on the substitution of either fresh canned or dried products whenever it is impossible to provide an adequate supply of fresh milk.\"\nDiocese of Saskatchewan\n\nVen.

NOD OFFICE\nPRINCE ALBERT,\nSASKATCHEWAN\n\nSeptember 2nd, 1936.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAt a Conference of Missionaries and Teachers engaged in the Indian work in the Diocese of Saskatchewan on August 21st and 22nd, the following resolution was passed:\n\n\"That in the interest of the health of the Indians, the Department of Indian Affairs be asked (1) to restore the full midday meal for children attending Day Schools, and (2) to restore the Field Matrons on Reserves where this has not already been done.\"\n\nIt was felt that during last winter, when many of the Indians were in want and short of food, that the children were lowered in strength and stamina owing to insufficient nutrition.\n\nIf they were to have one good hot meal a day at the school, this would greatly help to build up their strength, and give them some resisting power in case of illness.\n\nIn some cases the Department has made some provision for this meal; and in some cases the Teachers have done it at their own expense. But all the Teachers are not in a position to do this, and we think that all the pupils should be treated alike.\n\nWe believe that there would be less sickness, less Doctors' bills, and better attendance at school, if such a meal were provided at all Day Schools; and we therefore hope that this request will receive favourable consideration.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. E. J. Paul.\nOttawa, September 10, 1936.\n\nVenerable Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant, you will be advised under separate cover regarding the resolution passed at your recent Conference in connection with field matrons on certain Indian reserves.\n\nRegarding the serving of midday meals, you do not mention the Indian day schools at which you consider increased allowances should be made and, therefore, the Department is unable to reply definitely. However, as you are aware, biscuits are supplied and, in many cases, an additional grant is made for midday meal purposes. Owing to lack of funds, it is not possible to consider increasing these allowances this year.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nVen. Archdeacon W.E.J.

I understand that copies of the resolution have also been forwarded to the several provincial governments.\n\nI am in accord with the view that institutions maintained out of public funds should include reasonable quantities of Canadian fish in the food supplies which they require, and I feel sure that you will agree with me. I do not know that your Department actually conducts any residential institutions itself, but it occurs to me that Indian schools which receive federal grants might perhaps be asked to see to it that their food purchases include a reasonable proportion of fish. If you approve of such a step, perhaps you will have the appropriate officer of your Department communicate with those in charge of these schools, bringing the matter to their attention.\n\nI should appreciate it if you will let me know, at your convenience, as to any action which your Department may take in this regard.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd.)

The native people usually bring any surplus they may have and sell it here to me. Sometimes the amounts are quite small, but whatever I can buy I do so. Hence you will see we are doing our best to carry out the instructions contained in your letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nNorway House Indian Residential School\n\nREV. R. T.

In reply I would like to assure you that in this institution fish constitutes a large part of the diet, and we find it very healthful, particularly for the children.\n\nAs our School is for Treaty children and situated upon their reserve I buy our supply of fish from the Indian people. Last year I bought about 2000 fish.\n\nBut because of the serious situation here we feel that Commercial fishing ought to be curtailed in this part instead of encouraged. Because of the number of fishing companies who were allowed to fish in the northern end of Lake Winnipeg of late the supply is being depleted. The Indians are not able to get them, and fish is the mainstay of their living. This winter instead of 2000 I have only been able to get 300. The waters are drained of fish by the commercial companies so there is nothing there for the Indian.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.T.

In all boarding schools that I know of, lard is supplied to all the children in place of butter. As a matter of fact, the children receive absolutely no butter. Lard, as you know, has nothing but calories. I think it would be well worth the Department's while to instruct their boarding school principals to stop this practice. In place of lard I would recommend the use of peanut-butter which not only contains a certain amount of vitamins but is very rich in vegetable oil, and is very cheap. I have started this practice in the Norway House school and at the end of a year perhaps I can give you my impressions in a little more detail.\n\nCameron Corrigan M.D.\n\nDoctor P.E.

JOHN'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, CHAPLEAU, ONTARIO\n\nOCTOBER 1-8, 1944\n\nEarly last year the National Nutrition Committee of the Canadian Red Cross Society learned of the bad malnutrition conditions which had been found among Indians by Group Captain P. F. Tisdall when he made a survey. Group Captain Tisdall suggested that the Red Cross could render assistance and that the Society might offer its cooperation to the Department of Indian Affairs. This was done, and at the request of the Department a survey at St. John's Indian Residential School at Chapleau was undertaken. Canon Vale, principal of the school readily gave his consent and was most helpful in furnishing information to the National Director of Nutrition during the time the survey was being conducted. Mention should be made, as well, of the excellent cooperation given by the matron and all members of the staff.\n\nIn the following report we would like to emphasize that any criticisms are made with the knowledge that the existing conditions are not due to lack of interest in the children's welfare, but rather to (a) lack of facilities, (b) lack of money, (c) insufficient knowledge of the nutritional needs of children, (d) insufficient training of the staff who are in charge of the meals.\n\n1. Procedure for Sampling of Food.\n\nThe first step was to establish what could be considered a representative or average serving, since the ages of the children varied and since the servings of food usually were not uniform. A preliminary study of amounts of food served was made, and a series of weighings done to determine the average.\nA chart of the dining tables was made, and the age of each child entered. It was found that the most representative amounts were those given to the boys and girls 11 to 18, so samples were based on amounts served to this group. At each meal it was necessary to make a number of weighings of the bread as it was not cut in uniform slices.\n\nServings of all foods on the daily menu were placed in bottle I with 15 cc. glacial acetic acid. This food was used for assaying the thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, calcium, iron and phosphorus.\n\nIn bottle II were placed average servings of all raw, preserved or cooked fruits and vegetables, jams, fruit sauces, ketchup, pickles, dishes such as stew containing vegetables or fruit, fruit pies, etc., except tomatoes, grapefruit or grapefruit juice, orange or orange juice or fortified apple juice. This food was used for the assay of ascorbic acid from sources other than those rich in ascorbic acid and commonly used as supplements. An equal volume of 5% metaphosphoric acid was added to the food in this bottle.\n\nTomatoes, citrus fruits and citrus fruit juices were placed in bottle III for the assay of excellent sources of ascorbic acid. An equal volume of 5% metaphosphoric acid was also added to the food in this bottle.\n\nArrangements were made with the railway, so that the food reached the laboratory on a schedule which permitted the determination of the ascorbic acid content within 24 hours from completion of the collections.\n\n2. Observations on Preparation of Food in the School.\n\nThe kitchen was visited daily and some of the following observations will be of interest in comparing the calculated value of the diet with the results of the assays.\n1. The turnips were peeled and cut at 9 o'clock in the morning and left lying exposed on the kitchen table until they were put on the tables at noon.\n\n2. Cabbage which was used in the vegetable soup at night was on cooking before 9 A.M.\n\n3. The cooking of most of the vegetables, including potatoes was started early in the morning and they were then left standing on the back of the stove until served.\n\n4. The standard of all food preparation was very low and the meals were distinctly unpalatable. Since the girls resident in the school are supposedly being trained to act as domestics, and to set up a better standard in their own future homes, it is doubly important that they acquire the highest possible standards for the preparation of simple every-day foods. The best illustration of the need for this is the bread made in the school. This is heavy, solid, tough and tasteless except for an unpleasant flavour, which will be mentioned later. The kitchen matron mentioned difficulty in using Canada Approved flour, so the Director of Nutrition sent to the Department of Agriculture for special recipes for the use of this flour in bread-making. The Director and Miss Hinton then tried one of these recipes and taught one of the Indian girls to make the bread according to these directions. The resulting product was excellent and the staff expressed the wish that they could have bread like that all the time. It is interesting to note that careful washing and rinsing of all the utensils before starting, resulted in bread free from any of the unpleasant flavour which had previously characterized all the bread made at the school.\nSpecial short courses in the handling and preparation of food and in simple nutrition are necessary for all members of kitchen staffs in the schools if the Indian girls in turn are to receive adequate instruction to fit them for the work they will do later.\n\n3. Cleanliness\n\nOne of the noticeable features was the lack of cleanliness and sanitary care in the handling of the food, the washing of dishes and in the care of the kitchen and dining rooms. There was no adequate protection from flies and it was not uncommon to see the food on the tables practically black with them. One day about 40 or 50 flies were counted on one slice of bread. Cockroaches were everywhere in large numbers\u2014particularly in the kitchen and dining rooms.\n\nAs nearly as could be determined, the unpleasant flavour which permeated all the food came from improperly washed dishes and utensils.\n\n4.

It is important to note that this survey was done at the peak of the year when the supply of vegetables was most plentiful and their vitamin content at a high level. For example potatoes, which are one of the chief sources of ascorbic acid in the school dietary, average 50-55 mg per cent in September, but by April they average below 10 mg per cent. The matron also reported that by January the amount of other vegetables in the menus would be much less since the quantity grown does not last throughout the winter.\n\nTherefore the value of the diet shown by the assays in Table II is higher than it would be during a large part of the year, and this is a factor to be considered in comparing the assay values with the recommended allowances.\n\nThe diets were assayed for calories, calcium, phosphorus, iron, thiamine, riboflavin and niacin on a composite sample for a week. Daily determinations of ascorbic acid were made to avoid error due to possible destruction. The diet has also been calculated for calories, protein, calcium, iron, vitamin A, thiamine and ascorbic acid. The results as indicated by both procedures are shown in Table II. Calculations in detail are shown in Tables IV-I.\nTable II\n\nComparison of Calculated with Determined Results\nand Recommended Allowances\n\n| Protein | Ca. | Phos. | Fe | Vit.A | Thiamine | Ascorbic Acid | Ribo. Flavin |\n|---------|-----|-------|----|------|----------|--------------|-------------|\n| Calculated Values (Daily Average) | 2416 | 87.6 | 1.562 | (not calc.) | 10 | 2977 | 1.56 | 30 | 2.78 | (not calc.) |\n| Analysis on Composite Sample (Daily AV.) | 2850 | (Not determined) | 1.02 | 1.29 | 22.5 | (not determined) | 1.04 | 19.4 | 2.84 | 11.5 |\n| Recommended Allowance for Child 10-12 yrs. (11 yrs.) | 2500 | 70 | 1.2 | - | 18 | 4500 | 1.2 | 75 | 1.8 | 18 |\n| Recommended Allowance for Girl 13-15 | 2500 | 80 | 1.3 | - | 18 | 5000 | 1.4 | 80 | 2.0 | 14 |\n| Recommended Allowance for Boy 13-15 | 2500 | 85 | 1.4 | - | 18 | 5000 | 1.6 | 90 | 2.4 | 16 |\n\nIt will be noted that there are some differences between the assay results and the calculated values. From observations made during the survey, it seems likely that in the case of ascorbic acid, thiamine and riboflavin there were losses due to (a) method of storage of food, (b) methods of preliminary preparation and (c) cooking of food. Differences may also be due to (a) the recipes used for calculation and (b) the composition of the food itself. The latter factors would be true also for the caloric values, and the minerals. The high iron content shown by the assay indicates...\nThe calculated value for vitamin A is probably higher than an assay would reveal, for the recipes used in the school contained very few eggs and no butter.\n\nBefore making a comparison of the value of the diet as indicated by the assays and the calculations attention is drawn to the age grouping of the children as shown in Table III.\n\nTable III\n\nDistribution of Children in Age Groups\n\n| Boys 15-18 | Girls 16-20 | Girls 15-15 | Children 10-12 | Children 7-9 | Children 4-6 |\n|------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|\n| No. of Children | 15 | 2 | 11 | 5 | 9 | 6 |\n\nThe dietary may be compared with the allowances for all the different age groups, but for the purpose of this discussion only three of the latter have been included in Table II.\n\nThe calorie content of the diet is satisfactory for a large proportion of the children, but is 25% below the requirement of the 15 older boys. The calcium content is also low for the adolescent boys and girls. The assays show a high iron content and the riboflavin may also be considered satisfactory for all the children. However special attention should be drawn to the low thiamine level in relation to the recommendations for adolescence. But most serious of all is the deficiency of vitamin A and ascorbic acid. At the peak of the season, with the ascorbic acid content of the foods at a high level, the amount of ascorbic acid in the diet did not meet the suggested level for the youngest child, and was only 31-35% of the recommended allowance for children 10 years of age or over. This group of children represents 8% of the school.\nThe calculated value for vitamin A is probably high because no butter and very few eggs were used in the school cooking, and the figures used in calculating were for recipes which probably contained these foods. However even the calculated value shows a deficiency of this vitamin for all the children over 6 years of age\u2014in other words practically the whole school, as Table III reveals. The niacin content is also low for the adolescent group 15-16 years of age.\n\nIn general it may be noted that during the period of stress when the demand of the body for these nutrients is greatest, the school dietary is startlingly low in ascorbic acid and vitamin A, and to a lesser degree is deficient in thiamine, calcium and niacin, and in calories for the boys 15-16 years of age.\n\nBy midwinter the value of the dietary will drop still lower because (a) the supply of home-grown vegetables other than potatoes will be nearly exhausted, (b) the commission lists from which all other food is ordered does not include any canned vegetables or tomatoes, (c) the ascorbic acid (vitamin C) content of potatoes or other vegetables on hand will be much lower.\n\nMilk Supply\n\nSome mention should be made of the handling of the milk. No apparent effort was made to keep the milk in properly cleansed containers, since it also had the predominantly bad flavour of all food prepared in the school. Also, sufficient care was not taken to keep the milk at the proper temperature, with the result that it was frequently served when showing signs of sourness. Since the milk came from a tested\nLord the staff seemed to consider that it was safe and the need for adequate sanitary precautions in its handling had not occurred to them. In addition, the danger of undulant fever from any raw milk supply is one factor of which many people are in complete ignorance.\n\nSuggested Remedial Measures\n\nThe above situation calls for a careful study of ways and means to improve the nutrition of the children in the school. It is realised that any nutrition program for Indian residential schools must be practical in nature, and adaptable to the individual school. Accordingly the following tentative suggestions in brief form are put before the Department for their consideration:\n\n1. Increased Supply of Food Sources of Vitamins and Minerals.\n\nThe first and perhaps most important step in the nutrition program is to see that an adequate supply of the essential food nutrients is made available. This can be accomplished by the following measures:\n\n(a) An increased production of vegetables and eggs, and in those districts where it is economically sound, also of milk. This production program could be developed with the assistance and advice of the Department of Agriculture through their local representatives. A preliminary study of the nutritional needs of the children could then be translated into the number of bushels of vegetables or quantities of other foods required for the school.\n\n(b) Revision of the School Commission Food List would be desirable. The present lists, from which all food other than that produced by the school is ordered, include no canned vegetables or tomato juice. Additions to the list would be made with careful consideration of food values in relation to\nExpenditure. Tomato juice or canned tomatoes is a much-needed addition at the present time.\n\nII. Education of Staff\n\nAs was pointed out earlier in this report, the survey revealed the necessity of short courses in simple nutrition for all members of kitchen staffs in the schools if the Indian girls in turn are to receive adequate instruction to fit them for the work they are to do later. Under present conditions it is not practical to suggest centralized courses, but a start could be made by having trained Home Economics graduates spend a period of time in each school developing with the staff the best possible methods of food preparation. Constant follow-up work would be necessary in connection with this undertaking.\n\nIII. Education in the Schools\n\nPeriodic short courses in food preparation, nutrition and household management held in the schools for the Indian girls would do much to stimulate their interest and would offer an opportunity to present homemaking as an interesting and worthwhile vocation.\n\nSummary\n\nIn respectfully submitting this report the Nutrition Service of the Canadian Red Cross Society extends its appreciation to all those who cooperated in the survey, and wishes to offer its continued cooperation to the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nRosamond Stevenson\n(Mrs. Allan Stevenson)\nNational Director,\nNutrition Services,\nCanadian Red Cross Society.\nFebruary 16th, 1945.\n\nDr. P. E. Moore,\nActing Superintendent of Medical Services,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Moore:\n\nEnclosed is the report on the survey at St. John's Indian Residential School at Chapleau. I understand from Dr. Tisdall that he discussed this report with you when he was in Ottawa last week. We trust that it contains the information you desire, but if any question arises in connection with it please write us for further details.\n\nWhen Dr. Young and the Indian Agent held an interview with me at the school they both asked if it would be possible to come back and give some help and instruction over a two weeks' period. I agreed to do this if it were feasible and met with the approval of your Department. I am convinced that it would be welcomed by the staff and would create a better impression in view of their excellent cooperation in the survey. If Dr. Hoey and I considered it feasible this could be arranged a little later on in the spring. It would also give the staff there the feeling that we were following up our work and had a real interest in the school. Two weeks would give us a foundation for supplying continuous information suited to their needs.\n\nYou mentioned the possibility of undertaking another survey in a Roman Catholic school. Our Committee has given its consent that I should undertake any further work that you may wish done. If you could give us an approximate date for such a survey it would be of tremendous help to us in planning the rest of our spring program. At the present time there is work to be done in the New Brunswick Division and we would like to lay definite plans in the near future.\n\nWith kindest regards, and assuring you of our interest and cooperation,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Mrs. Allan Stevenson)\nNational Director, Nutrition Service\nCanadian Red Cross Society.\n\nEnc.\nREPORT ON FOOD SURVEY\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, SPANISH, ONTARIO\n\nMarch 11 - 15, 1946\n\nThe National Nutrition Committee of the Canadian Red Cross, in cooperation with the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, undertook a second food survey at the Indian Residential School at Spanish, Ontario, during the five-day period from March 11th to 15th, 1946.\n\nThe Principal and all members of staff extended the fullest possible cooperation, and were appreciative of any suggestions made regarding methods for conserving food value during the preparation of meals, and in connection with the menus.\n\nWe would like to emphasize that any suggestions in the following report are made with the knowledge that existing conditions are due primarily to (a) lack of money, (b) lack of facilities, (c) the unavailability of certain foods, and (d) insufficient knowledge of the nutritional needs of children.\n\nOn arrival at Spanish we discovered that the boys and girls were in separate schools, with completely separate management of the commissariat. Because it was impossible to have the food in both schools assayed, we decided to collect the food samples in the Girls' School only. The rest of this report will therefore be presented under two headings - (1) Survey in St. Joseph's Girls School, and (2) Survey in St. Peter's Boys School.\n\nSurvey in St. Joseph's Girls School\n\n1. Procedure for Sampling Food\n\nRepresentative servings of all foods served were collected at the three meals each day, weighed and placed in bottles with 15 c.c. glacial acetic acid. This food was used for assaying the thiamine, riboflavin, niacin,\ncalcium, iron and phosphorus. The results of this assay will be forwarded in a supplementary report. The diet was calculated and the details of these calculations are shown in Tables VI - XII, attached to this report.\n\n2. Observations on Preparation of Food in the School\n\nThe kitchen was visited nearly every day and the methods of food preparation noted.\n\n(a) Vegetables were prepared some time ahead and left soaking, sometimes overnight.\n\n(b) Potatoes were never cooked in their jackets.\n\n(c) All food was handled and prepared in a very cleanly manner.\n\n(d) The food was appetising, and carefully served.\n\n(e) The girls all receive instruction in methods of food preparation, but it was not determined whether these methods are in accord with the more recent scientific findings. However they were all taught standard procedures in following recipes, with the result that the food tasted good when served and the quality was always the same.\n\n3. Cleanliness\n\nAmong the most noticeable features in the school were the immaculate conditions maintained in every part of the building - particularly in the food cupboards, storerooms and dining rooms.\n\nThe children's tables had attractive serviceable coverings and these were carefully set before each meal with the necessary cutlery and table napkins. We considered this was an important factor in the training of girls for domestic work as well as for their own homes. It was also conducive to the well-ordered, happy meal hours observed in the school.\n### Table I\n\n**Menus and Representative Amounts of Food Served March 11-15**\n\n#### Sunday, March 11\n\n| Breakfast | Dinner | Supper |\n|-----------|--------|--------|\n| Rolled Oats | 200 g | Bologna | 120 g | Potato | 132 g |\n| Milk | 144 | Potato | 148 | Gravy | 198 |\n| Sugar | 8 | Turnip | 156 | Bread | 108 |\n| Bread | 156 | Bread | 106 | Preserved | |\n| Butter | 19 | Pickle | 60 | Fruit | (Citron) 100 |\n| Barley Coffee | 240 | Snack - 1 cookie |\n\n#### Monday, March 12\n\n| Breakfast | Dinner | Supper |\n|-----------|--------|--------|\n| Rolled Oats | 210 | Boiled Potato | 110 | Barley Soup | 256 |\n| Milk | 144 | Meat | 50 | Molasses | 90 |\n| Sugar | 8 | Gravy | 80 | Bread | 140 |\n| Bread | 107 | Raw Cabbage | 45 | |\n| Butter | 18 | Bread | 118 | |\n| Coffee | 254 | Snack - 1 slice Bread | 50 |\n\n#### Tuesday, March 13\n\n| Breakfast | Dinner | Supper |\n|-----------|--------|--------|\n| Rolled Oats | 150 | Meat | 98 | Farina | 187 |\n| Milk | 140 | Gravy | 128 | Bread | 108 |\n| Sugar | 8 | Corn | 56 | Applesauce | 180 |\n| Bread | 118 | Potato | 137 | Brown Sugar | 20 |\n| Butter | 22 | Raw Carrot | 100 | |\n| Coffee | 257 | Bread | 90 | |\n| Sugar in Coffee | Snack - 1 slice Bread | 50 |\n\n#### Wednesday, March 14\n\n| Breakfast | Dinner | Supper |\n|-----------|--------|--------|\n| Rolled Oats | 257 | Boiled Potato | 118 | Bread | 150 |\n| Milk | 150 | Beans | 240 | Tomato Pickle | 155 |\n| Bread | 115 | Bread | 118 | Rice Pudding | 200 |\n| Sugar | 8 | Egg | 56 | |\n| Butter | 28 | Snack - 1 slice Bread | 55 |\n| Barley Coffee | 240 | |\n| Sugar in Coffee | |\n\n#### Thursday, March 15\n\n| Breakfast | Dinner | Supper |\n|-----------|--------|--------|\n| Rolled Oats | 210 | Pork | 45 | Soup | 300 |\n| Milk | 165 | Potatoes | 110 | (Spaghetti) |\n| Sugar | 8 | Beets | 56 | Bread | 108 |\n| Bread | 128 | Bread | 108 | Rhubarb | 135 |\n| Butter | 18 | Milk | 140 |\n| Barley Coffee | 222 | Snack - 1 slice Bread | 50 |\nThe value of the daily dietary was averaged and results are shown in Table III. However, before making a comparison of the value of the diet as calculated, attention is drawn to the age grouping of the children as shown in Table II.\n\nTable II\n\nDistribution of Children in Age Groups\n\n| Girls 4-6 | Girls 7-9 | Girls 10-12 | Girls 13-15 | Girls 16-20 |\n|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| No. of Children | 1         | 21          | 48          | 58          | 14          |\n\nThe dietary may be compared with the allowances for all age groups, but for the purpose of this discussion only two of these groups have been included in Table III, since 75% of the children are between 10 and 15 years of age.\n\nIt will be noted that the survey was done at the time of year when the vitamin content of the vegetables would be nearing the lowest level. Therefore it could be expected that the value of the diet which will be shown in Table III is lower than it would be during the summer and fall.\n\nTable III\n\nComparison of Calculated Results With Recommended Allowances of the National Research Council of United States\n\n| Cals. | Prot. | Ca | Fe | Vit.A | Thiamine | Ascorbic Acid | Riboflavin |\n|-------|-------|----|----|-------|----------|--------------|------------|\n| Calculated Values (Daily Average) | 2190 | 72 | 0.56 | 14 | 2867 | 1.05 | 50 | 1.1 |\n| Recommended Allowance, Girl 10-11 (11 yrs.) | 2500 | 70 | 1.2 | 12 | 4500 | 1.2 | 75 | 1.8 |\n| Recommended Allowance, Girl 13-15 | 2600 | 80 | 1.5 | 15 | 5000 | 1.4 | 80 | 2.0 |\nThe caloric content is fairly satisfactory for a large proportion of the children, but is low for the girls 15-18 years of age. It should be noted that the calcium content is only 46% of the requirement for the girls 10-12 years. The other marked deficiencies are ascorbic acid, which is only 37% to 40% of the recommended allowance, and riboflavin, which is only a little over half the amount recommended for the adolescent girl. Attention should be drawn to the low thiamine level in relation to the recommendations for adolescence. The calculations show the iron to be satisfactory in relation to all age groups. The vitamin A content of the diet is very low.\n\nA comparison of the school dietary with Canada's Official Food Rules was made. From the information available an estimate of the additions necessary to conform to these rules is presented in Table IV. Approximate daily cost of these additions is also included. The total cost might be reduced considerably if the additional fruits and vegetables could be produced on the school farm. It is doubtful if this would be possible at the present time with the facilities available. However it should be emphasized that the expenditures suggested in Table IV might vary with prevailing price levels, increased facilities and availability of the protective foods.\n\nTable IV\n\nComparison of Daily Protective Foods Consumption With Canada's Food Rules (150 Girls)\n\n| Present Approx.

This would cost $5.50 at wholesale rate.\nIn order to determine to what extent the major deficiencies could be remedied by the suggested additions of foods in Table IV the value of these was calculated and the results are shown in Table V.\n\nTable V\n\nEffect of Additions Suggested in Table IV on Calcium, Vitamin A, Ascorbic Acid and Riboflavin Content of Child's Average Daily Diet\n\n| Food                  | Suggested Increase | Ca (I.U.) | Vitamin A | Ascorbic Acid mg | Riboflavin mg |\n|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------|-----------|------------------|---------------|\n| Milk                  | 10 oz.             | .350      | 564       | 8                | .697          |\n| Cheese                | \u00bd oz.              | .066      | 210       | -                | .057          |\n| Eggs 1/5              | (1/5)              | .008      | 120       | -                | .035          |\n| Tomato Juice          | 4 oz.              | .008      | 968       | 26               | .056          |\n| Vegetables other than potato | 5 oz.

Because of the quantity of bread which must be used in any low-cost dietary, the greater use of whole wheat bread cannot be emphasized too much as an inexpensive source of thiamine and minerals. Experience in group feeding has shown that the exclusive use of whole wheat bread is possible with children, who will eat it day after day and enjoy it.\n\nDuring our stay we had the opportunity to speak to the staff and students. There was genuine interest shown and it has been gratifying to receive letters from the girls themselves, indicating that some of the suggestions, such as cooking potatoes in their skins, are being followed.\n\nPART II - SURVEY IN ST. PETER'S BOYS SCHOOL\n\nThe food preparation in the Boys School was under the direction of a paid chef. Although the food was not assayed, it was possible to obtain fairly accurate information regarding the quantities of food prepared and used in the school.\n\nValue of School Dietary\n\nIn Table I-A the menus with amounts of food served are outlined. The dietary was calculated and results are shown in Table III-A. Details of calculations are shown in Tables VI-A - XII-A, attached to this report.\nTable I-A\n\nMenus and Representative Amounts of Food Served March 11-15\n\n| Breakfast | Dinner | Supper |\n|-----------|--------|--------|\n| Beans     | Barley Soup | B.

The vitamin A content is only 25% of the recommended allowance for boys 10-12 years, and 17% of that for the group 13-15 years. Similarly the ascorbic acid is 75% below the allowance for boys 10-12 years and 80% below the amount needed for the older age groups. The total calories\nare sufficient for the younger boys, but not for the older ones. The calcium is below the recommended level, and the riboflavin does not meet the recommended allowance for the 15-16 age group. In respect to thiamine, iron and protein the diet is adequate.\n\nIt is interesting to note the great contribution of iron, protein, thiamine, riboflavin and calcium made to the boys' diet by the unusually large quantities of beans which they consumed every other day. We should report that a careful check was made on the dry weight of the beans used, and we corroborated the figures by repeated weighings of the beans served at table.\n\nIn order to discuss the nutritional needs in terms of food a comparison of the dietary with Canada's Official Food Rules is shown in Table IV-A, along with suggested additions necessary for conformity with these rules.\n\n**Table IV-A**\n\nComparison of Dietary With Canada's Official Food Rules\n\n| Food                        | Present Approx.

(edible portion) to have the diet conform to Canada's Food Rules.\n\nDuring the summer a much larger supply of fresh vegetables would be available from the garden and the suggested increases in Table IV-A would not need to be as great.\n\nAt this point it seemed advisable to determine the effect of the suggested additions on the food value of the existing dietary, particularly in respect to Vitamin A, ascorbic acid and riboflavin. The result is outlined in Table V-A.\n\nTable V-A\n\nEffect of Additions Suggested in Table IV-A on Vitamin A, Ascorbic Acid and Riboflavin Content of Child's Average Daily Diet\n\n| Food          | Suggested Increase | (I.U.) | Vitamin A | Ascorbic Acid mg | Riboflavin mg |\n|---------------|--------------------|--------|-----------|------------------|---------------|\n| Milk          | 1\u00bd oz.             | 710    | 8         | .014             |\n| Cheese        | \u00bd oz.              | 210    | -         | .057             |\n| Eggs (\u00bd)      | (3-4 weekly)       | 360    | -         | .064             |\n| Vegetables   | 4\u00bd oz.             | 999    | 18        | .186             |\n| Tomato Juice | 4 oz.              | 969    | 26        | .056             |\n| Butter        | 10 g               | 425    | -         | -                |\n| Totals        |                    | 3670   | 47        | 1.117            |\n| Present Diet  |                    | 1071   | 18        | 1.737            |\n| Total Value   |                    | 4741   | 65        | 2.914            |\n\n* Average of seven common vegetables\nIt is important to note, in studying Table V-A, how in this particular case greater improvement in the all-round value of the dietary may be gained by some modifications in the additions suggested in Table IV-A.\n\n(1) The addition of cheese and butter to the diet may be omitted and the money used instead to increase the tomatoes or tomato juice from 4 oz. to 6 oz. daily. This would increase the vitamin A to a greater extent and would raise the level of the ascorbic acid to cover the needs of the boys 15-15 years of age.\n\n(2) If the tomato juice were increased to 8 oz. daily, the additional eggs would not be necessary because the iron and protein in the diet is already adequate, due to the large quantities of navy beans in the diet. This is an important consideration from the standpoint of cost.\n\nThe conclusions reached in (1) and (2) indicate that any general recommendations for changes in the Indian school dietsaries might result in unnecessary expense and at the same time there might not be the maximum return in food value for the expenditure involved. Therefore a careful analysis of the dietary in each school should form the basis for suggested nutrition program.\n\nGeneral Observations\n\nThe sympathetic and understanding approach of the staff to the children was a striking feature of the schools. As a result there was an unusually happy atmosphere during both work and play.\n\nRecreation for the children, such as skating parties, swimming and boating, was carefully planned and supervised and it was apparent that every effort was being made to promote normal healthy relationships.\nThe genuine desire of all members of staff to co-operate in making any possible improvements made this survey both pleasant and profitable to all concerned.\n\nWhile doing the survey we had the opportunity to speak to the staff and to the students of the Girls School and to three groups of boys in St. Peter's School. These talks were informal and from them we were able to gain valuable information regarding the food likes and dislikes of the children.\n\nSuggested Remedial Measures\n\nThe outline of the two dietaries and the additions necessary to bring them to a level of adequacy, calls for a careful study of ways and means by which any improvements may be made. It is realized that any nutrition program must be practical in nature and adapted to the individual Indian school. Accordingly the following tentative suggestions are submitted to the Department for their consideration.\n\n1. Increased Supply of Protective Foods\n\nThe first and most important step is to see that an adequate supply of the essential food nutrients is made available. This could be accomplished by an increased production of milk, vegetables and eggs. Plans for the increases might be developed with the assistance of the Department of Agriculture through their local representatives. Prior to this a study of the nutritional needs of the children should be made, and these needs translated into terms of food would form the basis of the production program.\n\nII. Staff Education\n\nCourses in basic nutrition for all members of staff would create an awareness of the importance of adequate nutrition for children and would\nlead to greater interest and co-operation in any nutrition program which might be undertaken. In addition, courses in food preparation and home management are necessary for all kitchen staffs.\n\nIII. Nutrition in the Schools\n\nPeriodic short courses in nutrition would do much to stimulate the interest of the Indian girls in their present course in food preparation.\n\nSummary\n\nThe Nutrition Service of the Canadian Red Cross Society extends its appreciation to all those who assisted in the survey, and wishes to express its continued interest in a nutrition program for the Indian schools. The Society hereby offers its support to the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Mrs. Allan Stevenson)\nNational Director, Nutrition Services,\nThe Canadian Red Cross Society.\nSeptember 10th, 1945.\n\nMr. B. Hoey,\nActing Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nEnclosed is the report on the survey at the Roman Catholic Indian School in Spanish, Ontario. We trust that after reading it you will send us your comments or criticisms and also that you will write us for further details if you so desire.\n\nMy plans for my western trip were changed and that is the reason you have not heard from me before this. I am just beginning to work out my itinerary for the fall, and believe it will be possible to undertake one of the surveys in Ontario the last week of September or the first week of October. You did mention that you would like to have surveys done at Brantford, Caradoc and Sault Ste. Marie. Have you any preference as to which one we should do first? If not it might be more advisable to undertake Brantford as a beginning and perhaps the first week in October would be more suitable than the last week of September. That would give us time to make arrangements for the assays to be done in some laboratory not too far distant.\n\nWhen plans for my western trip are completed I will notify you, for I will be most interested in visiting the schools mentioned in our last conversation in Ottawa.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Mrs. Allan Stevenson)\nNational Director, Nutrition Services,\nCanadian Red Cross Society.\n\nRS/S\nEnc.\nOttawa, September 15, 1945.\n\nDear Mrs. Stevenson:\n\nPlease accept my sincere thanks for your letter of September 10th and for the report on the survey undertaken by you at the Spanish Residential School sent forward therewith. This report will, I feel sure, prove interesting and helpful.\n\nI note with interest your reference to an additional survey that might be undertaken at Brantford, Caradoc and Sault Ste. Marie. In view of the fact that a survey has already been taken at an Anglican school and one at a Roman Catholic school, it might be well to arrange for the survey to be undertaken at a school administered under the auspices of the United Church. I am of the opinion, therefore, that if it is convenient for you, the survey to which you refer might be undertaken at the Mount Elgin Institute at Nussey (Caradoc Reserve) early in October. I shall be glad to ask the Chief of the Training Division to communicate with the Principal of the school with respect to the matter.\n\nI shall be glad to communicate with you again just as soon as you have completed arrangements for your western trip.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMrs. Allan Stevenson,\nNational Director, Nutrition Services,\nCanadian Red Cross Society,\n98 Wellesley Street,\nToronto, Ontario.\nOttawa, September 18, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Soper:\n\nSome months ago the Canadian Red Cross Society very kindly offered to make a nutritional survey at some of our residential schools.\n\nThey have already visited two or three schools and are now prepared to visit another; consequently, we have advised them to visit the Mount Elgin School during the early part of October. The survey will be made by Mrs. Allan Stevenson, National Director, Nutritional Services, Canadian Red Cross Society.\n\nI feel certain that the staff at the Mt. Elgin School will co-operate fully with Mrs. Stevenson, as I know from past experience that her comments and suggestions on the food being served in a residential school will not only be helpful to you but will be conducive to good results for the pupils.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. S. H. Soper, M.A.,\nPrincipal,\nMt. Elgin Indian Residential School,\nNunney, Ont.\nOttawa, September 21, 1945.\n\nDear Father Oliver:\n\nI have a very interesting report from Mrs. Allan Stevenson, National Director, Nutrition Services, Canadian Red Cross Society, with reference to her food survey at the Spanish Residential School during the five day period March 11 to 15, inclusive. At the outset of her report she states that the Principal and all members of the staff extended the fullest possible co-operation and were appreciative of any suggestions made regarding methods for conserving food value during the preparation of meals and in connection with the menus.\n\nWith special reference to the Girls' School Mrs. Stevenson writes:-\n\n\"Since the calcium is still low, it is suggested that a further increase in cheese and milk would most efficiently raise the level of this mineral.

Prior to this a study of the nutritional needs of the children should be made, and these needs translated into terms of food would form the basis of the production program.\n\nII. \"Staff Education.\"\n\n\"Courses in basic nutrition for all members of staff would create an awareness of the importance of adequate nutrition for children and would lead to greater interest and co-operation in any nutrition program which might be undertaken. In addition, courses in food preparation and home management are necessary for all kitchen staffs.\n\nIII. \"Education in the Schools\"\n\n\"Periodic short courses in nutrition would do much to stimulate the interest of the Indian girls in their present course in food preparation.\n\n\"Summary\n\n\"The Nutrition Service of the Canadian Red Cross Society extends its appreciation to all those who assisted in the survey, and wishes to express its continued interest in a nutrition program for the Indian schools. The Society hereby offers its support to the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources.\"\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J. R. Oliver, S.J.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSpanish, Ont.\nThe Mount Elgin Indian Residential School\nMuncey, Ontario\n\nSept. 21st 1945\n\nThe Secretary The Department of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nA letter from Mr. Philip Phelan of Sept 18th intimates that Mrs. Allan Stevenson, National Director, Nutritional Services, Canadian Red Cross Society will visit this school early in October.\n\nI shall be very pleased to make her visit helpful both to her and to the school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nS.H.S.\n\nMay I suggest that this visit be not on Oct. 10th as the District Convention for Teachers of Indian Schools is on that date.\n\nS.H.S.\nSeptember 2nd, 1945.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIn reply to your letter of September 15th may I say that we will be glad to undertake a survey at the Mount Elgin Institute at Bancroft, from October 6th to 18th, and will make definite plans accordingly if you will be kind enough to communicate with the Principal of the school. We would appreciate hearing from him regarding the best means of transportation to the school, and also if you would make arrangements for accommodation for myself and an assistant.\n\nOn Thursday Dr. Alderwood came to see me and we had a long talk about the Indian schools which I found very valuable. Dr. Alderwood seems genuinely interested in improving conditions and is particularly interested in the possibility of training courses for the staffs. He is anxious that the five people who are at present taking their training for the Home Mission field receive courses in nutrition, food preparation and household and institutional management, because most of their trainees enter Indian work and he hopes that some of the present ones will go to Indian residential schools.\n\nI suggested to Dr. Alderwood that he write to you, making the request for such training and that you in turn might be able to relay the request to Red Cross, since we had offered our co-operation.\n\nSince there are several training schools in Toronto it is possible that the United Church Training School would be able to combine with the Church of England if the above-mentioned courses were offered by Red Cross. This would be at least a start toward the goal which we are all interested in reaching, namely, better preparation and service of foods in the schools, with resulting improvement in nutrition.\n\nIf you consider that it would be valuable to start this work I believe our Executive would be more inclined to grant permission if the matter was presented as an independent request from your Department.\nI was talking to Dr. Tisdall and he suggested that since the nutritional deficiencies are so marked in these Indian schools it does not seem necessary to do any further assays. We will simply weigh the food and calculate the values. Dr. Tisdall said their wide experience with the Air Force has shown that their calculations are always higher anyway than the actual values as revealed by the assays, so we will be on the safe side in regard to any statements we make.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Mrs. Allan Stevenson)\nNational Director, Nutrition Services,\nCanadian Red Cross Society.\nOttawa, September 26, 1945.\n\nDear Mrs. Stevenson:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd instant, regarding the survey at the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School, Muncey, Ont., I am advising Rev. S. H. Soper that it will be held from October 8th to 15th. I am writing to Mr. Soper, requesting him to communicate with you immediately regarding your transportation. I think it is likely that he will arrange to have someone meet you in London and take you to the school by car. There will be accommodation for you and your assistant at the school.\n\nOur Director, Mr. Hoey, is confined to the hospital at the present time, owing to an operation, but we hope that he will be back in the office before very long. I will keep a record of the kind offer contained in the latter part of your letter of the 22nd instant and will bring the matter to his attention as soon as he returns.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMrs. Allan Stevenson,\nNational Director, Nutrition Services,\nCanadian Red Cross Society,\n95 Wellesley Street,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, September 26, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Soper:\n\nWith further reference to my recent letter, I am advised by Mrs. Stevenson that the survey at the Mount Elgin Residential School will be from October 8 to 15. I realize that owing to the Teachers' Convention at Kettle Point on October 12 the teachers at the school will be away, but it is not possible for us to dictate to the Red Cross regarding the dates on which these surveys are made, as they are doing them of their own free will and they have to fit in a survey at our school in connection with their regular duties.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would communicate with Mrs. Allan Stevenson, Canadian Red Cross Society, 95 Wellesley Street, Toronto, Canada, with reference to going to the school. Possibly you could arrange to have someone meet them in London and bring them out. Please give this particular matter your immediate attention.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend S. H.

We would like to have some-\nthing concrete to present to the Central Council Meeting this\nfall.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRosamond Stevenson\n(Mrs. Allan Stevenson)\nNational Director, Nutrition Services,\nCanadian Red Cross Society.\n\nRS/T\nSeptember 28, 1945\n\nMr. Philip Phalen  \nChief, Training Division  \nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Phalen:\n\nI have your letter of September 26, with reference to the visit of Mrs. Allan Stevenson.

Asst., Indian Health Services.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to:\n\nMrs. Allan Stevenson,\nThe Canadian Red Cross Society,\n95 Wallerley Street,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nOttawa, March 9, 1964.\n\nDIRECT THE VICTOR RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL RIGHT OFF MAIN STREET\nSCHOOL AT BRADFORD CONSIDERED INADVISABLE AT THIS TIME\n\nCharge - Indian Affairs Branch\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs.\nMarch 6th, 1946.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI sometimes regret very much that I am just one person in the Department and therefore cannot accomplish work as rapidly as I would like to do. We are now completing the report on the survey at the Indian School at Duncan, and I may say that I consider the health conditions in this school simply appalling. Apparently, from my observations, no one on the staff had even elementary knowledge of sanitation and hygiene. Since there was no matron many phases of the school activities were not being handled efficiently or adequately. I have gone into this in slightly more detail in the report, but thought you would like to have this information right now.\n\nMiss Macleod, Nutritionist of the British Columbia Division, and I spent a very interesting two days at the school in Kamloops in December. I can assure you that it was a pleasure from beginning to end. The authorities were extremely cooperative and Dr. Tennant was very kind in taking us out to the school and back to our hotel. Our impression was that the children were very well cared for and that every effort was being made to give them the best food available. We were particularly interested in the broad viewpoint of Father O'Grady regarding the necessity of providing the students with some means of carrying out the things they had learned, after they left the school.\n\nRecently, through our Red Cross worker at Brantford, I heard that there was some difficulty raised by the Local Council of Women in connection with the food at the Indian School. In the opinion of the Red Cross worker the interference was ill-timed, since she understood the new principal had just taken over his new duties recently. As you know, both the Sault Ste. Marie and the\nBrantford schools were on the list of those you wished me to visit. It would be possible to visit one of these schools for a five-day period beginning March 50th. For many reasons it would be more convenient to go to Brantford at this time, since I could take one of the Community Nutrition students as an assistant on the survey. I realize that there might be two sides to the question of going to Brantford at this time. It has occurred to me that if we did a survey now we would have some effectual information for your Department if the Local Council of Women are not satisfied. Also, we might be able to give the new principal some assistance in planning food supplies for the school, and that would put him in a position to say that he had had professional advice.\n\nOn the other hand I can realize that since this difficulty has arisen the principal might fear that this was more interference. However, if you could assure him that we were going in with a sympathetic approach and with the object of helping in mind, would it be possible to arrange this survey for the date mentioned above? I would appreciate very much hearing from you in regard to this matter by return air mail if possible.\n\nI only wish that circumstances permitted me to plan further ahead in this work in the Indian schools. However we have to take advantage of the opportunities when we see a spare moment immediately ahead of us.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n(Mrs. Allan Stevenson)\nNational Director, Nutrition Services,\nCanadian Red Cross Society.\n\nRS/T\nMarch 15th, 1946.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThank you for your wire in reply to my letter of March 8th.\n\nUnless unforeseen circumstances arise we can arrange to leave Toronto the night of March 19th and arrive in Sault Ste. Marie the following day. We will leave Sault Ste. Marie on the afternoon of March 24th, since I have to be back in Toronto on the morning of the 25th. However I think this period should be sufficient to give us a picture of the school.\n\nWould you kindly communicate with the Principal in order to determine if this time will be convenient. It would be possible to go March 26th if the date mentioned is not suitable for the school.\n\nHave there been any further developments regarding a nutrition program in your Department? The last time I was talking to Dr. Moore in Toronto he said that things were more or less at a standstill and he did not know whether the Medical Services would continue their own nutrition plans or whether National Health and Welfare would be directing such a program.\n\nI think the Anglican Church is very anxious to have some work done in connection with training their people, but we would hesitate to go ahead until we knew more of the policy to be followed under the transfer of your Medical Services to National Health and Welfare.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Mrs. Allan Stevenson)\nNational Director, Nutrition Services,\nCanadian Red Cross Society.\nReverend A E MIRKIN  \nPrincipal Shingwauk Indian Residential School  \nSault Ste Marie Ontario\n\nTo assist you and your staff along nutritional lines Canadian Red Cross Society prepared to send qualified nutritionist to Shingwauk Home -step- she will arrive on March twenty -step- Doctor Allenwood extremely interested in this phase of residential school program -step- expect to receive immediate reply that you are prepared to cooperate\n\nPhilip Phelan\n\nCharge Indian Affairs\nMines and Resources\nCANADIAN PACIFIC TELEGRAPHS\nWorld Wide Communications\n\nRMA5 TO GET REPLY\n\nSS MARIE ONT 14 1010A\n\nPHILIP PHILAN INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\nDEPT MINES AND RESOURCES OTTAWA ONT\n\nGLAD TO HAVE NUTRITIONIST MARCH TWENTIETH PLEASE WIRE WHEN ARRIVING\n\nARTHUR E MINCHIN SHINGWAK\nOTTAWA MARCH 14 1966\n\nMr Allan Stevenson\nCanadian Red Cross Society\n73 Wellington Street\nTORONTO Ontario\n\nREVERSE YOUR LETTER TWELFTH INSTANT TO MR HOSY -stop-\nPRINCIPAL REVERED A E MICHIN PLEASED TO ACCEPT YOUR OFFER TO ARRIVE\nSHIROMAK HOME MARCH THIRTY -stop- IF YOU ADVISE HIM EXACT TIME HE WILL MEET YOU\nAT STATION\n\nPhilip Phelan\n\nCharge Indian Affairs\nMinistries and Resources\nOttawa, March 14, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Minchin:\n\nWith reference to my telegram of the 13th instant and your reply of today, you can expect Mrs. Allan Stevenson to arrive at Sault Ste.

Mr. Phelan who is in charge of Training Division, is out of the city but after I discuss this matter with him, I will get in touch with you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP.E. Moore, M.D., D.P.H.,\nActg.

Pett regarding nutrition in the Indian Residential Schools. I feel that it would be very valuable to let Dr. Pett's Division indicate the type of assistance that he proposes. If this project is proceeded with, the schools that have recently been visited by the Red Cross should not be included in the immediate programme.\n\nP.S. Moore, M.D., D.P.H.,\nActg. Supt., Indian Health Services.\nAs a result of our meeting with you and Colonel Neary last Friday, I feel that a satisfactory decision has been reached whereby this Division can now proceed to ascertain the feeding problems of Indian Residential Schools and develop a continuous dietary Service for them designed to aid their health and education.\n\nThe nutritional status of the Indian School children is of concern since it constitutes a part of the Canadian health problem. And, with regard to remedial action I would like to review the main considerations.\n\n1. Suggested menus, adapted to circumstances\n2. Shopping Lists adapted to these menus and therefore to the possibilities of the locality\n3. Recipes for cooking and instruction of cooks\n4. Assistance with budgeting and cost accounting so as to give maximum health benefit for the money spent\n5. Assistance in coordinating health education (including nutrition) with the actual menus, such as by providing explanatory posters in simple terms\n\nIn order to offer direct assistance to individual schools and to evolve a standardized service it will be necessary for one or two of my Nutritionists to visit most of these schools. It is understood that you will explain such visits to the church authorities concerned, and that the actual visits will be arranged with the Provincial Inspector or Commissioner concerned. I understand that it will be easiest to begin in Ontario and this will suit us very well. We would like to begin as soon after opening on September 9th, as can be arranged. Miss A.M. McCready, local phone 3103 will be ready to proceed at that time assisted by Miss D. Tripp.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the inspection report form which we propose to use. Any comments or additions you wish to make will be welcome. I might mention that only rarely do we get information on all these points, but it is almost essential as a reminder if inspections are to be uniform. Also, I am sending along copies of a weekly Food Record and a Daily Menu Form which are basically suitable to record the kind and amount of food served and eaten during a week.\n\nL.B.

Hoey,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Dietary Service for Residential Schools\n\nI have your letter of August 19th, which I have read carefully.\n\nI cannot give you much help for the obvious reason that I am not competent to pass on such matters.\n\nYour letter refers to the \"survey of the feeding problems of our schools\" carried on by the Red Cross. I was quite interested in that, desiring to know what opinion the Red Cross had of the efficiency of the schools. We have not been afforded the privilege of any information either as to whether the feeding of the children was satisfactorily carried out nor whether improvements were suggested or criticisms made.\n\nI had almost come to the conclusion that this survey had not been made, in view of the fact that the contract for operating the schools is between the Department and the Church. One would imagine that any report on the way in which that part of the contract relating to the feeding of the pupils is carried out by the Principal, who is the agent of the Church, would eventually come to this office.\n\nHowever, it does seem to me that the service which is contemplated is desirable and even necessary. We shall do what we can to secure the co-operation of the Principals. We should appreciate hearing how this offer is received by the Principals and what comments they make.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSeptember 3rd, 1946.\nOttawa, September 10, 1946.\n\nDietary Service for Residential Schools\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have for answer your letter of September 3, addressed to the Director.\n\nI regret that you did not receive a copy of the Red Cross survey report made on the Mount Elgin Residential School. Insofar as I can ascertain from a search of the files, this was the only United Church school surveyed by the Red Cross. Apparently it was decided at that time, in view of the closing of this school, not to send a copy of the report to you.\n\nI can assure you that you will receive a copy of each report made on a United Church residential school by the Nutrition Division of the Department of National Health and Welfare. We will advise each of your Principals of this service and the approximate time of arrival of Miss McCready.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

M. McCready, is an official of the Nutrition Division of the Department of National Health and Welfare. Under an arrangement between the Department of Mines and Resources and her own Department, she has been detailed to conduct a series of dietary surveys at the Indian Residential Schools throughout Canada.\n\nThis letter is to serve as an introduction for her to our various Indian Inspectors, Indian Agents, Residential School Principals and Denominational Authorities. It would be very much appreciated if you would extend to her all possible co-operation and courtesy to assist her in this task. It is felt that much can be accomplished by this dietary service to assist the general improvement in the health and welfare of the Indians of Canada.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

The engine used until now was very inadequate because during the colder days of winter it would freeze and result in numerous useless trips.\n\nTo sum up, this truck would answer the need provided that the Dept. assumes the additional cost of batteries, spare tire, tank and mechanism for the pump; these would be required anyway with any kind of truck.\n\n3.

This is in reply to your 15-44-(W.T.), Oct. 22.\n\nMy activities in respect to school diets has not passed the stage of early thought. I did not know about your dietitians and had it in mind to ask school principals to let me have the weights of the various foods used in their schools in one week, later on in the year when their pupils should all be in and the schools on a routine running basis. From this point I had hoped to set on to some assistance to them.\n\nNow that you have more expert advice available I shall not follow up my idea, at least until one of the dietitians reaches this Province.\n\nOver the 20 years I have been visiting residential schools I have seen a great improvement in diet. I think many schools now feed their pupils better than children in white families are fed on the average and probably better than the pupils in white boarding schools. I have inquired of several Principals whether they could keep up their present dietary standards in the face of increasing food costs. They have assured me that they could, but I think they will find it hard to do so.\n\nIn the circumstances, I would like to have the dietitian come here before visiting any schools in Alberta. It so happens that in this Province there are several schools in remote areas where much local produce, fish, game, etc., form part of the diets. I think schools of this kind in Alberta may be more accessible than similar schools in some other Provinces and I should be very pleased to help the dietitian see some of them.\n\nPlease be assured that I shall welcome the dietitian.

This will be sent out Monday or Tuesday of next week. I regret that I did not have your request of November 26 for 110 copies of this letter to send to agents in time to secure this quantity. I should therefore appreciate your giving this information through the Indian School Bulletin.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL. B. Pett, Ph.D., M.D.,\nChief, Nutrition Division.\n\nLBP/AJS\nFOR THE TEACHER\n\nIt is earnestly requested that teachers do not influence the ideas of the children. But it will be necessary to assist and encourage them and to offer suggestions for each of the three pictures that they have to draw. These suggestions will serve to explain what is wanted rather than constituting directions on what they should draw:\n\n1. The Foods I like to Eat in a Day - milk, fruit, vegetables, cereals, bread, meat, fish, eggs, cheese, etc., may all be expected to appear in this picture and should preferably be detailed as to the kind rather than the group (e.g., grapes, pickerel, deer, potatoes, etc.)\n\n2. The ways I like to get the food - from the store, hunting, fishing, picking off bushes, Family Allowance grants, etc. (e.g., draw a store and show a man fishing or hunting, etc.)\n\n3. How I like to eat the food - raw, cooked, whole, cut in pieces, smoked, pickled, canned, etc.\n\nYou will find other suggestions in the textbooks provided for health teaching in Indian Schools, namely the \"Safe and Healthy Living Series\".\n\nIt is intended that each child should decide on the type and kind of foods, how they are to be obtained and eaten, and then should receive help in depicting it on the poster. In this way a national picture of what Indian children think about foods, as well as some indication of food habits on the reserves, should be obtained. The school name and the name of the principal and teachers participating will be inscribed on the Certificate of Merit for each school entering the contest.\nDEPARTMENT OF\nNATIONAL HEALTH AND WELFARE\n\nOttawa, 2nd December, 1946.\n\nTo Principals and Teachers of Indian Day and Residential Schools\n\nRe: Food Contest\n\nIn an attempt to improve the health of the Indians a dietary service for Residential and Day Schools has been commenced by the Nutrition Division, Department of National Health and Welfare.\n\nNutrition education for Indians must be based on approaches acceptable to them, even though the facts taught are similar to those of the rest of Canada. Experience in ordinary schools leads us to believe that the most useful approaches may be found by encouraging self-expression, such as in a drawing project. By doing this on foods it is also possible to suggest to the participants the importance attached to this subject.\n\nAs a means for Indian children to depict their ideas on food, the Nutrition Division is sponsoring a food contest. Three copies of the rules, together with suggestions for teachers, are enclosed. The prizes should serve as an incentive and create interest in food for health. All children from 9 years up should be encouraged to enter this contest regardless of artistic ability and training. The co-operation and interest of all teachers will be appreciated.\n\nThe prizes will be provided by the Nutrition Division and each school that participates will receive a Certificate of Merit. Through the efforts of all concerned an insight into the Indian children's impressions of food should be gained, to serve as part of the measures for improving the situation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nP. E. Moore, M.D.,\nDirector of Indian Health Services.\nFOOD CONTEST\n\nFor pupils 9 years and over\n\nPRIZES\n\nAt each School\n\nDominion Grand Awards\nResidential Schools Day Schools\n\n1st prize - $5.00\n2nd prize - $3.00\n3rd prize - $2.00\n\n$50.00\n$25.00\n$10.00\n\n$50.00\n$25.00\n$10.00\n\nRULES\n\n1. Contest is open to all Indian children 9 years and over attending Indian Residential and Day Schools in Canada.\n\n2. The Food Drawing Contest is to be in the form of one Poster in three parts illustrating all three of the following points:\n   (1) The Foods I like to Eat in a Day\n   (2) The Ways I like to Get the Food\n   (3) How I like to Eat the Food.\n\n3. The Poster may be of any material, type or colour but must be of sufficient size to depict each illustration (18\" x 10\" is a reasonable size.)\n\n4. The illustrations may be of any type, i.e., cutouts, drawings, sketches, animated cartoons, graphs, etc., and may be done by any suitable means, e.g., crayon, pencil, paints, etc.\n\n5. Full name, reserve address, grade, age and school should be printed plainly on back of poster, and the teacher's name included.\n\n6. Competition opens beginning of December, 1946, and closes January 31st, 1947. These dates apply to most schools but any school which is too remote to enter within those dates should not hesitate to send entries whenever available, and special recognition will be given to them.\nJUDGING\n\n1. Judging will be on the following basis (a) Originality 50%\n   (b) Portrayal of ideas specified 30% (c) Art 20%\n\n2. There are two ways suggested for deciding the three prize\n   winners in each school:\n   (a) A Board of three judges should be arranged by the\n       teacher to include, where possible, some of the following:\n       The Indian Agent, Missionary, Inspector of Schools, Agency\n       Doctor or Nurse, Chief or Councillors of Indian Band.\n   (b) Where it is not possible to arrange judges as\n       suggested in (a) then the teacher can decide the winners.\n\n3. The three prize winning posters should then be carefully\n   wrapped and forwarded to the Nutrition Division, Department\n   of National Health and Welfare, Ottawa, for entry for the\n   Grand Prize Awards. All posters will then become the\n   property of this Division.\n\nPRIZE POSTERS MUST BE IN OTTAWA NOT LATER THAN FEBRUARY 20, 1947.\nColonel R.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Building, Ottawa.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI have sent to you sample copies of all the literature published to date by the Nutrition Division, which would be relatively suitable for nutrition education in Indian Residential and Day Schools.\n\nWe have attached a brief explanation to the publications to indicate the particular suitability and use of each one.\n\nThe camp feeding outline (plus recipes for 50), which was forwarded to the Residential schools already visited, has not been included. We are compiling menu patterns for a two week period and recipes (100 servings) based on these menus, to send to Residential schools in the near future.\n\nWith regard to posters, I would like to mention that the educational value is greater if the posters are displayed individually over a fairly short period (i.e., a week) and repeat displays periodically. They should also be pointed out to the pupils, and discussed.\n\nThe listing of our available material in your monthly magazine should establish a relationship between the Nutrition Division and all of the schools. It should help to familiarize the principals and teachers with the fact that we can offer them assistance on food service and nutrition education.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL.B.

I would suggest that she could visit the Mohawk Institute at Brantford early in the new year, for example the week of January 6th. I would suggest that she could then leave for Edmonton about January 20 and visit Chapleau or Kenora on the way out, probably Chapleau. The other one would be visited on the way back. She would then discuss matters with Colonel Stone in Edmonton and any of the other officials whom you would designate. I don't think that she could visit all the schools in Alberta at that time of the year, nor would it be advisable if it were possible, because visiting more than 10 schools becomes too difficult and delays the reports too long. During this time it would be possible for her to discuss arrangements for a Cooks Course and other features. This trip would last until approximately the end of February when she would return to Ottawa for preparation of reports before planning the next trip.\n\nI hope that this general suggestion meets with your approval and would be glad to pursue the details further at your convenience.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL.

This will be a continuous dietary service, designed to assist kitchen staffs and principals. They will be able to write in at any time for further information. The main forms this service will take are as follows:\n\n1. Suggested menus, adapted to circumstances,\n2.

She does about ten schools in a group, and it would be appreciated if you could advise this office of the schools in Alberta which she can conveniently visit at this time of the year without too many travelling delays.\n\nI have arranged with Miss McCready to report directly to Col.

L. Stone, Regional Superintendent, Indian Health Services, Alberta, has suggested that Miss McCready might possibly be able to work in the schools in the Lesser Slave Agency. In a letter to the Chief, Nutrition Division, Dept. National Health & Welfare, Ottawa, Dr. Stone has suggested that Miss McCready visit one or more of the schools in the Lesser Slave Lake Agency, which is accessible by train. I concur in this suggestion of Dr. Stone's, as this service would prove invaluable to the schools in that Agency.\n\nOtherwise, the itinerary as shown in your letter, meets entirely with my approval. The schools should be advised as soon as a definite itinerary is decided upon, so that they will know when to expect Miss McCready.\n\nG. H.

It is not my intention to write to the other schools informing them of her visit as it is possible that Colonel Stone and yourself may wish her to go north from Edmonton after her first two inspections. This would of course throw her proposed itinerary out of schedule. Therefore I will leave this notification to Edmonton, Macleod, Old Sun and Crooked up to you since you have decided on the plans for Miss McCready's visits to these schools.\n\nMiss McCready should arrive in Calgary on January 24th.\n\nBernard F. Neely,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nCopy sent to Col. Stone and Miss McCready\nHEALTH ASPECTS IN RELATION TO FOOD SERVICE\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS\n\nNutrition Division, Dept. of National Health and Welfare, November, 1946.\n\nIndian Residential Schools located at Kenora, Fort Frances, Sioux Lookout and McIntosh, Ontario, Portage la Prairie, Brandon and Elkhorn, Manitoba and Lebret, Saskatchewan were visited. Reports on inspection of Food Service at each school are attached (and copies have been forwarded to Indian Affairs Branch). From a health standpoint, there are certain aspects which deserve additional consideration.\n\n1. Staff:\n\nIn each of the schools operated by the Protestant churches, the kitchen staff constituted a problem. The Principals could not compete with the local salaries offered by industry, hotels, restaurants, etc., to obtain an efficient staff. Consequently, unqualified staff (often elderly) were paid a mediocre salary to carry out the work in a careless and uninterested fashion. The result was that the food quality was not good, cleanliness was neglected, the Indian girls were not receiving proper training and there was lack of coordination of efforts.\n\nIn each of the schools operated by the Roman Catholic church, nuns comprised the kitchen staff. They had received training and gained experience through their respective orders. Their salaries were of no consequence and therefore they were genuinely interested in their work. The result was that the food quality was good, cleanliness was evident, the Indian girls were receiving training and there was coordination of efforts. And, they were receptive to further assistance.\n\nIn the case of the schools operated by the Protestant churches, salaries and sources of suitable and flexible cooks are primary concerns. As long as unqualified and disinterested staff are employed the introduction of assistance (i.e., menus, recipes, etc.) will not greatly improve the situation.\n\n2. Facilities:\n\nDishwashing: The use of several small dishpans is a most inadequate method of dishwashing in any institution. This is particularly true in the case of Indian Residential Schools since the Indian children are highly susceptible to tuberculosis. The most effective method observed was the use of a double compartment galvanized metal sink for washing and rinsing. It seemed evident that most schools strictly curtailed the use of soap, for dishwashing, as an economical factor. These schools must be made to realize that sufficient soap is a necessity and not a luxury. If necessary, the extra cost should be provided in some way by the Dominion Government.\n\nA satisfactory sink method requires the use of a three compartment sink for washing, rinsing and chlorinating the dishes. From the standpoint of durability stainless steel sinks are preferable to galvanized metal sinks; the end cost is actually less.\n\nThe installation of dishwashing machines would be feasible at any of these schools and would constitute a labour saving device. Consideration might be given to providing schools with such machines, although this might interfere with training in cookery since they are not likely to encounter them later in life.\n\nPotato Peeling: The girls, as part of their training, should know how to peel potatoes by hand. But to do this, it is not necessary to peel potatoes for 100 or more each day. In fact, other phases of training are thus neglected.\n\nPotato Peelers were observed at St. Mary's School, Kenora and Qu'Appelle School, Lebret. The installation of a potato peeler at the\nother schools would be advisable.\n\nVentilation and Lighting: The presence of stale cooking odours and a dark, dingy appearance are contributing factors to poor and unhealthy working conditions in any kitchen. A hood with installed fan over the range would increase the ventilation in the kitchens at Fort Frances and Sioux Lookout Schools. Additional electric light facilities would be an advantage in the kitchens at Fort Frances, Sioux Lookout and Cecilia Jeffrey (Kenora) Schools.\n\nRefrigeration:\n\nAdequate refrigeration is a requisite in an institution for the proper storage of current supplies of meat, dairy products, other perishables and daily left-overs. Otherwise, food spoilage and loss are very likely to occur. At Sioux Lookout and Portage la Prairie, the family-sized icebox and refrigerator, respectively, were very inadequate and inconvenient. A walk-in refrigerator, in each case, seems necessary.\n\nCooking Utensils and Dishes: Many old and worn cooking utensils and chipped and cracked dishes were observed in use at Cecilia Jeffrey, Sioux Lookout, Brandon and Elkhorn schools. Many of these items were unfit for use and should be condemned.\n\nIt has been difficult to replace them and, in many cases, the utensils were worn beyond a state of additional repair. As the present situation constitutes a health menace some arrangement should be made for these schools to be able to obtain immediate replacements.\n\nStorage: It is essential to store dry staple supplies in bins or covered containers rather than opened bags, from the standpoint of cleanliness and insect control. At Sioux Lookout school, the bins were insufficient and in a neglected state of repair.\n\nThe hot water pipes passed through the storerooms at Fort Frances and Brandon Schools, and the temperature was too high for the storage of food supplies.\n\n3. Pasteurization of Milk:\n\nAs an initial precautionary measure against Tuberculosis to which Indians appear highly susceptible the cattle should be tested often and regularly. At McIntosh school it was stated that it was difficult to get an inspector to test the cattle. At Fort Frances School the cattle were only tested every two years. There is little assurance of a herd being free from tuberculosis by such irregular tests.\n\nSince milk is a medium for the transmission of Tuberculosis, undulant fever, a system for the pasteurization of all milk for consumption should be in effect at these schools.\n\n4. Nutritional Aspects:\n\nThe nutritional inadequacy of the children's diet can be attributed to the following reasons:\n\n(1) Financial Limitations -\n\nThe food cost per child per day ranged from twenty to thirty cents according to our calculations which were based on the average monthly figures for the value of farm produce and other food expenditures. These figures were obtained from available data at the schools and should be a good estimate.\n\nExtensive work had been done at the Nutrition Division on inexpensive diets. An expenditure of thirty-six cents per person per day under different circumstances, is a likely amount to spend to provide adequate food for children 6 to 15 years old.\n\nTherefore, none of the schools was spending enough on food.\n(2) School Farms:\n\nThe kind and amounts of supplies realized from the school farms varied according to climate, soil, cultivated acreage, organization and management. Due to rock, bush and swamps at Cecilia Jeffrey, St. Mary's McIntosh and Sioux Lookout Schools it was necessary to purchase a large percentage of the feed for cattle. Consequently sufficient cattle were not kept to provide enough milk and beef. Similarly sufficient potatoes and vegetables for a full year's supply were not grown.\n\nThe organization and management of the different school farms indicated individual preferences for raising certain animals or growing certain vegetables to the exclusion of other important products (e.g., eggs). The more of all foods needed that can be produced locally, the more adequate can be the diet at low cost.\n\n(3) Food Purchasing -\n\nThe important nutritive value of certain foods were not fully appreciated by the food purchasers at each school. Canada Approved Vitamin B flour or bread was used only at Sioux Lookout and Qu'Appelle Schools. Refined prepared cereals (e.g., puffed wheat) were used once or twice a week and rolled oats the rest of the week. Where prepared cereals are used, the puffed cereals and corn flakes should be avoided since other flakes etc. provide more nutrients. Iodized salt was not always purchased for cooking purposes.\n\n(4) Nutritional Losses in Cooking:\n\nIn some cases, the antiquated cooking facilities necessitated prolonged cooking periods which would result in considerable nutritive losses. Also most of the cooks were not acutely aware of the retention or loss of nutrients in relation to food preparation and cookery. Potatoes, cabbage and turnips, properly prepared, cooked and served are economical sources of Vitamin C. But, by slow or prolonged cooking and long standing periods after cooking the Vitamin C content of these is mostly destroyed.\n\nSince the children far from realize the recommended daily servings of citrus fruit or tomatoes, they are most dependent on such sources as potatoes etc. for some Vitamin C and therefore, cooking methods employed are extremely important. Actual and potential cooks can usually be educated in this phase of their responsibilities. But the inefficient and careless type of substitute cook will disregard such measures.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. Milk: The children (except at Qu'Appelle and Fort Frances Schools) receive \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) to 1 pint per day whereas \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) pints to 1 quart is recommended. Whenever it is possible, sufficient cows should be kept to provide at least \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) pints of milk per child per day. If the required number of cows cannot be kept, then it would be advisable to supplement the possible supply with whole milk powder.\n\n2. Citrus Fruit or Tomatoes: The children receive none to 2 servings per week (except St. Mary's School - 4 servings) whereas 1 serving per day is recommended. The present budget could not possibly provide the recommended servings. Although some of the children buy oranges this procedure is no assurance for all of the children. An annual shipment of canned tomatoes, tomato juice, vitaminized apple juice or citrus fruit juice by the Dominion Department concerned would be a help. Greater expenditure on food, made possible by financial grant might also serve this need.\n3. Other Fruit: One serving of other fruit, (Fresh, canned or dried) is recommended per day and received by the children (except at Elkhorn and Qu'Appelle Schools). However, the size of serving is seldom average. This is, again, the reflection of budget restrictions.\n\n4. Potatoes: The children receive 1 to 2 servings of potatoes per day, (except at Sioux Lookout School-3 servings per week). Since potatoes are an economical source of calories, Vitamin C and other nutrients it is important to provide at least one adequate serving per day. Therefore, if sufficient potatoes cannot be grown at Sioux Lookout, additional requirements should be purchased.\n\n5. Other Vegetables: At least two servings of other vegetables, preferably leafy, green or yellow, served frequently raw are recommended per day. The children seldom receive two servings per day, since they do not like and will not eat most vegetables. However, every attempt should be made to serve the vegetables they will eat in the most acceptable ways. And they should be gradually educated to the importance of the other vegetables.\n\n6. Whole Grain Breakfast Cereals & Bread: One Serving of a whole grain breakfast cereal and at least four slices of Canada Approved Vitamin B Bread (whole wheat, brown or white) with butter are recommended per day. The children receive 5 to 7 servings of whole grain breakfast cereal (i.e., rolled oats) per week. In most schools they serve a refined prepared cereal 1 or 2 times a week. It is recommended that whole grain cooked or prepared (occasionally) cereal should be served every day. Canada Approved Vitamin B bread or flour wherever it is obtainable, should be used as it is a real contribution to the diet.\n\nAt the most, butter was served to the children once a day or 2 to 3 times a week. In some cases it was not served at all, because of the expense. Butter is a good daily source of Vitamin A.\n\n7. Meat: One serving of meat, fish, poultry or meat alternates such as beans, peas, nuts, eggs, or cheese should be served daily. Eggs and cheese should be served at least three times a week and liver frequently. The children receive one serving of meat daily, but often in the case of stew the serving is very small.\n\nEggs are served \"none\" to 2 times a week. Cheese (when available) is served \"none\" to once a week. It should be possible to keep enough hens to have a good supply of eggs.\n\nFor growth the children should obtain the number of recommended servings per week of meat or alternate, eggs and cheese.\n\nLiver is seldom served as the children do not like it. However, it can be cooked, ground and mixed with apple, fat and spice and they will accept it as a spread. This was done at McIntosh and Qu'Appelle schools.\n\n8. Iodized Salt: Should be used for cooking as well as tables.\n\n9. Cod Liver Oil is provided by the Department and should be used.\n5. Nutrition Education:\n\nAn effective nutrition education programme cannot be directed to the Indians without relation to certain influencing factors. Nutrition cannot be isolated from other health aspects i.e., medical services, proper housing and sanitation.\n\nIt is known that the basic diet of the Indians consists primarily of meat, lard, sugar, flour and tea, subject to certain tribal and environmental influences, distinct likes and dislikes, etc. The children from 6 to 16 years who attend the Residential Schools, learn about and accept other foods. But at the age of 16 years they return to the reserves and revert to their original eating habits, many of which indicate that their diet is nutritionally inadequate.\n\nThe school is the most suitable medium for the introduction of nutrition education because it can and would have to be coordinated with the food served, cleanliness and meal-time atmosphere, etc. If the children are to be taught to eat certain foods for health, this should be reflected in the school meals. Otherwise, the teaching is in vain. For example: at McIntosh and Elkhorn Schools it would seem futile to teach the children to care for their teeth since they have not obtained dental services for three years.\n\nSome incentive can be promoted at the schools but is lacking on the reserves. Continued interest, organization of groups and practical approach in the homes, seem necessary to stimulate desire to apply certain knowledge. Perhaps a system could be worked out to select and pay Indian girls showing an aptitude to carry out educational work amongst the women on the reserves.\nDEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL HEALTH AND WELFARE\nNutrition Division\n\nOttawa, 29 November, 1946.\n\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nFood Survey of Eight Residential School\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nAccording to our agreement a visit has been paid to the Indian Residential Schools, as a prelude to establishing a continuing advisory service for better feeding. I should like to emphasize again the importance of the personal contact for several days at each school before attempting to introduce any advisory service. These visits proved to be of great value in creating some interest in the schools and in giving us a clearer idea of how to approach the problems involved. As rapidly as we can, therefore, it is proposed that we continue visiting Indian Residential Schools across Canada.\n\nThis letter and enclosures are being sent simultaneously to you and to Dr. Moore. The main report is entitled \"Health Aspects in Relation to Food Service\". This is a detailed summary of the results. Attached to this are two copies of a report on each school (one for you and one for you to send to the schools if you wish). These individual reports carry a summary on the last page of the action that we recommend. This action is aside from the help on menus etc., which we are already preparing to send to each school directly. The action may need to be taken by the school, by your Branch or by Dr. Moore's Service, or by some joint action\u2014I am not sufficiently familiar with the system to know which.\n\nMr. Bailey of the Welfare Branch of this Department has asked for a copy of all these reports. He has, of course, access to the\n\ncc: Dr. P.E. Moore\nOttawa, December 5, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\n\nFood Survey of Nine Indian Residential Schools.\n\nI attach for your study copies of reports made upon nine Indian residential schools by dietitians of the Nutrition Division of the Department of National Health and Welfare.\n\nOn the whole these are fairly satisfactory with one exception - that of Sioux Lookout Residential School.\n\nIn this instance, the former Principal as you know, was not satisfactory and was removed from his duties in the middle of September. He was replaced by the Reverend Mr. Fisher, former Principal of Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. At the time Miss McCready visited this school, Mr. Fisher had only been there a fortnight. He has since visited the office and I feel certain that he will do everything possible to improve conditions at this school. I have suggested to Miss McCready that she visit this school again in the near future.\n\nIt is my intention to do as follows with these reports:\n\n(a) To send one copy to the Religious denomination concerned with the request that they be passed to the Principals of the schools inspected.\n\n(b) After the Head Office has seen copies of these reports, then I would like to send them to the\nIndian Agents concerned for whatever action on their part is indicated. Then I would have them returned to this office for file.\n\nYou will note that the main problems in providing adequate food in our Residential Schools fall into the following categories:\n\n1. The use of better equipment, especially potato peelers, stainless steel dishwashing sinks, and a better quality of dishes.\n2. Care in food purchasing.\n3. The avoidance of nutritional losses in cooking.\n4. Staff problems in the kitchen.\n\nBernard F.

The reports which were submitted on the nutritional aspects of the care of Indian children in our residential schools by the Canadian Red Cross Society have been passed to the various denominations for consideration and action has been taken upon many of the items raised therein.\n\nAt the present time the Nutrition Division of the Department of National Health and Welfare has a dietitian employed full time and one part time in providing a complete dietary service for our residential schools.\n\nMiss A. M. McGrady, who is fully engaged in such duties, will be in Edmonton to see Colonel Stone, Regional Superintendent of Indian Medical Health Services at the Charles Cassell Hospital, in early February.\n\nTherefore, if Miss Hutchison requires further information for her post-graduate work in public health nursing at the University of Alberta, she could possibly arrange to see Miss McGrady while she is in Edmonton.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDepartment of National Health & Welfare,\n\nCalgary, Alberta,\nMarch 3rd, 1947.\n\nThe Director,\nIndian Health Services,\nDepartment of National Health & Welfare,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMiss Alice McCready of the Nutrition Branch,\nDepartment of National Health and Welfare, was in Alberta\nfrom January 24th, to the end of February, 1947. During\nthis time she visited six Indian Residential Schools, viz:\nEdmonton, Mt. Albert, Wabasca (2), Ermineskin (Hobbema),\nand Stony.\n\nIt will be noted that her original plan to visit\nthe Blackfoot Schools was changed to permit her to go to\nthe two northern bush schools at Wabasca instead. This was\ndone at my suggestion.\n\nMiss McCready recommended herself to everyone.\nWhile a first visit of three or four days cannot be expected\nto bring about any very great improvements, her knowledge and\ninterest made a very desirable impression. The general\nimpressions gained from her visit are:\n\n(1) That at the better schools, the pupils are reasonably\nadequately nourished, so far as quantity of food goes.\n\n(2) That at no school does the variety of diet meet the\nrequirements in respect to Vitamin content, and that\nno school principal has sufficient revenue to enable\nhim to provide a wholly satisfactory diet, especially\nin fresh fruit or fruit juices.\n\n(3) That some schools could do better than they are doing\nwith their current resources.\n\n(4) That the goodness or badness of feeding corresponds\nto the quality of management of the several schools\nin other respects.\n\nLeaving the revenue consideration aside, there\nwas no difference as regards location.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nL. B. Pett, Esq., Ph.D., M.D.,\nChief, Nutrition Division,\nDepartment of National Health & Welfare,\nJackson Building, Ottawa, Ontario.\nReport on Inspection of Food Service\n\nMorley Indian Residential School, Morley, Alberta\n\nFebruary 24 to 28th, 1947.\n\nI. Staffs\n\n(1) Cook - 5 years at school - fairly good.\n\nThe kitchen was not completely supervised by anyone. The assistant matron assisted the cook sometimes and relieved her on off-duty days. The cook was 55 years old. She was a disorderly worker and very temperamental. As a result it would be difficult for the present matron or anyone to assume the supervision of the food service or institute changes. Since cooks have been non-available good attempts have been made to make the best of the present situation.\n\n(2) The school girls assisted with food preparation, dishwashing, table service and cleaning duties. They carried out mostly routine jobs connected with cookery, since the present cook was unsuitable to supervise them. They work on the half-day system and rotate monthly.\n\nII. Facilities:\n\nThe kitchen, diningroom and storeroom were located on the main floor. Working conditions were awkward and congested because the kitchen was too narrow. It is recommended that the kitchen be extended on the North side and the new kitchen plans be referred to the Nutrition Division for approval.\n\nThe diningroom space was adequate. It had been painted recently and was very attractive.\n\nIII. Storage:\n\nThe bulk food supplies storeroom was adequate. There were no facilities in or near the kitchen for proper storage of current food supplies or utensils. The refrigeration consisted merely of a 4-door reach-in refrigerator, located in a pantry adjacent to the kitchen. Due to lack of space in the kitchen, this pantry was also used (in a makeshift fashion) for vegetable preparation, utensils and improper storage of perishable goods. This space could be suitably used for the installation of a walk-in refrigerator. There were no cupboards for bread which was improperly stored in cardboard boxes.\n\nAs the structure of the root house was poor it was difficult to keep root vegetables. Suitable specifications for construction of root houses are available from the Provincial Department of Agriculture.\n(2) Ventilation and Lighting:\n\nThere was no means of ventilation outside of opening windows in the kitchen. A hood with exhaust fan over the stove would remove excess heat and cooking odours. The lighting facilities were adequate.\n\n(3) Equipment:\n\nFlooring\u2014 Battleship linoleum in kitchen and diningroom (newly laid) - good condition.\nWooden in storeroom - good condition.\n\nMeat Grinder\u2014 old and worn;\nHand Slicer\u2014 both should be replaced.\n\nKitchen Work Tables (wooden top)\u2014 small and badly warped; should be replaced.\n\nCooking Kettles and other Utensils\u2014 Lack of some; many worn out.\nEnamel Dishes\u2014 Some replaced; many chipped.\n\nSink\u2014 1 only single unit galvanized metal (in kitchen) with one small drainboard.\n\nIt would seem that, for efficient operation, a scale of equipment (large and small) should be established for the different sized schools.\n\nIII. Sanitation and Hygienic Conditions:\n\nThe kitchen and adjacent pantry were not clean and tidy due to the overcrowded conditions and the careless working habits of the cook. These conditions were made even worse by the dishes being washed in the kitchen. The diningroom and storeroom were clean and tidy.\n\nThe dishes were washed and rinsed in several dishpans. Soap was used, the dishwater was fairly hot but the method employed was unsatisfactory for 100 people. A jacket heater would be necessary to provide sufficient hot water for a proper dishwashing set-up.\n\nThe cook wore a hairnet and a coloured apron. The girls wore blue aprons but no caps or hairnets. White aprons would improve the appearance of the food handlers but this seems to be part of the clothing problem. There were no facilities in the kitchen for hand-washing. Food handling habits should be improved here.\nGarbage disposal was satisfactory but wet garbage containers in the kitchen were uncovered. The water supply is not chlorinated or tested. The cattle have not been T.B. tested for approximately eight years. The milk utensils were washed in the kitchen, where there were no facilities for adequate washing and sterilizing.\n\nIV. Food Supplies:\n\nThe produce from the school farm included milk, butter, cream and vegetables. The school farm (300 acres) is mostly rock and bush (approximately 50 acres cultivated, chiefly for garden). Since frost occurs practically every month in the year the school has found it impossible to grow potatoes, tomatoes and some seasonal vegetables. It is suggested that the school contact the Provincial Department of Agriculture or one of the Agricultural schools in the province for information on varieties suitable to the climate and soil conditions. Pigs and range cattle were sold and the full meat supply was purchased. There was no suitable hen house (hens killed by stray Indian dogs). All of the feed for the dairy herd was purchased. No fruits and vegetables were canned except small quantities for the staff due to lack of help.\n\nBread is purchased from Calgary. Other supplies are purchased by the Principal from wholesalers in Calgary. The freight charge is approximately 40\u00a2/cwt, and the supplies are trucked from Morley by the school.\n\nDuring the past months it has been impossible to obtain lard, cheese and dried fruits (other than prunes). It would be advisable to serve some 'standard' quality canned fruits, which are cheaper than most dried fruits.\n\nOn the basis of the average monthly food expenditure and value of farm produce the approximate food cost per person per day is thirty cents, according to our calculations.\n\nV. Menus:\n\nThe menus were planned a week ahead of time by the cook. The children's and staff menus differed and extras were allowed for the staff. The children's menu offered fair variety and suitable attempts were made to serve foods acceptable to their likes.\n\nVI. Nutritional Aspects:\n\nThe nutritional adequacy of the children's diet was evaluated by comparison with the number of daily and weekly servings of each important food group as recommended by Canada's Food Rules. The servings fall short in respect to milk, citrus fruit and tomatoes, other vegetables.\nthe use of whole wheat or Canada Approved Vitamin B bread, eggs, cheese, and liver. This will reduce the intake of protein, iron and Vitamins A, B and C.\n\nThe present fresh milk supply is too low and if fresh milk supplies are unavailable powdered whole or skimmed milk should be supplemented. This was the only school visited to date where any citrus fruit was actually served as a part of the regular menu. The children in this area were very reluctant to eat vegetables or whole wheat bread. Improved hen housing facilities would be necessary to provide eggs.\n\n| FOOD GROUPS | AMOUNTS RECOMMENDED BY CANADA'S FOOD RULES | AMOUNTS SERVED TO CHILDREN |\n|-------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Milk        | 1/2 pints to 1 quart daily                 | 1/2 to 1/3 pint daily     |\n| Fruit; Citrus fruit or tomatoes | 1 serving daily | 2 to 3 servings weekly |\n| Other fruit | 1 serving daily                           | 6 servings weekly         |\n| Vegetables; Potatoes | 1 serving daily | 10 servings weekly |\n| Other Vegetables | At least 8 servings daily | 1 serving daily (and raw 1 to 3 times weekly) |\n| Cereals and Bread; Whole Grain Cereal | 1 serving daily | 6 servings weekly |\n| Whole Wheat or Canada Approved Vitamin B Bread (Brown or White) with Butter | At least 4 slices daily | At least 6 slices daily. (Not Canada Approved or whole wheat). Small serving of butter once daily. |\n| Meat and Fish | 1 serving of meat or alternates daily | 2 servings daily (one of which is small serving) |\n| Also\u2014Eggs | At least 3 times weekly | Once weekly |\n| Cheese | At least 3 times weekly | None |\n| Liver | Frequently | None |\n| Iodized Salt | Recommended | Used occasionally for tables but not for cooking |\n| Fish Liver Oil | Recommended | Given from October to April (inclusive) |\n\nDuring the visit sample copies of materials, suitable for the food service and nutrition classes were discussed with the Principal and other staff concerned. Adequate quantities of the above publications have already been purchased by the schools.\nAfter school plain bread (one slice) is served to the children. It was suggested that a piece of raw vegetable could be given too. The children frequently visit the local store at this time and purchase large quantities of refined foods (i.e., cake, cookies, etc.). An education programme to encourage the purchase of fruit would be worthwhile.\n\nVII. Food Preparation, Cookery and Service:\n\nThe kitchen matron possessed a fair knowledge of food standards and the food quality was fairly good. Recipes were not used consistently. The working techniques were unsatisfactory.\n\nThe food was served on plates prior to the meal hour, consequently it was cold. Family service at each table would be advisable. The tables were neatly set and the food was carefully arranged on the plates. The diningroom was supervised at mealtime by a staff member. The diningroom was attractive and offered a suitable mealtime atmosphere.\n\nCookery and Nutrition Education:\n\nOnce a week an organized cookery class is conducted by the cook (for a few girls). But due to the lack of proper supervision the present training which the girls are receiving in cookery is of little value. A suitable cook, capable of teaching the girls, day by day, as necessary.\n\nNutrition education was not in effect in the classrooms.\n\nIX. Interest:\n\nThe Principal and matron expressed interest in obtaining assistance for the food service and nutrition education.\n\nIt is known that prior to the visit at this school, the Indians complained severely about the food. From the standpoint of nutritional adequacy and the quality of the food served, the diet at this school was comparable to most and superior to some schools visited. It was evident that the newly appointed staff members were interested in the welfare of the children and have made some improvements.\n\nX. Assistance:\n\nDuring the visit sample copies of material, published by the Nutrition Division, suitable for the food service and Nutrition education were discussed with the Principal and other staff concerned. Appropriate quantities of the above publications have already been forwarded to the school.\nThis division is planning to send additional assistance as follows:\n\n1. Menu Patterns (plus variations and substitutions) based on Canada's Food Rules.\n2. Food Purchasing Lists adapted to menu patterns.\n3. Work Schedules based on daily menus.\n4. Nutrition education material suitably designed for the Indians - i.e., posters, illustrated pamphlets, and literature.\n\nVegetables, other than potatoes, should be included in the menus.\n\nUse of cheese, eggs, and milk.\n\nUse of iodized salt for cooking.\n\nNeed for food preparation and storage equipment:\n\n(a) Refrigeration of kitchens.\n(b) Installation of a dispensary with ice and refrigerator units.\n(c) Installation of a milk-cooling system.\n(d) Pantry for current food supplies (except for vitamin).\n(e) Equipment for bread storage.\n(f) Cupboards for storage of utensils.\n(g) Storage of old and worn equipment, dishes, and eating utensils.\n(h) Careful dress and hygiene of food handlers, thus insuring that food served is clean.\n(i) Pasteurization of milk.\n\nNeed for better use of facilities, better training of pupils:\n\n(a) Equipment - a potato peeler is needed to replace the box cutter.\n(b) Ventilation - a hood with fan over the stove.\nSUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. Needed for Health:\n   (a) Food - 1 pint more milk per child per day.\n   Tomatoes or Citrus Fruit - 4 to 5 more servings weekly.\n   Other Fruit - 1 more serving weekly.\n   Vegetables, other than potatoes - at least 2 servings daily.\n   Use of cheese, eggs and liver.\n   Use of iodized salt for cooking and tables.\n\n2. Needed for Food Preparation and Improved Sanitation:\n   (b) Enlargement of kitchen.\n   (c) Installation of a dishwashing unit (2 or 3 compartment sinks).\n   (d) Installation of a walk-in refrigerator.\n   (e) Pantry for current food supplies (adjacent to kitchen).\n   (f) Cupboard for bread storage.\n   (g) Cupboards for storage of utensils (kitchen).\n   (h) Replacement of old and worn equipment, cooking and eating utensils.\n   (i) Careful dress and hygiene of food handlers. (See booklet \"If You Served Food\").\n   (j) Pasteurization of milk.\n\n3. Needed for better use of facilities, better training of pupils:\n   (k) Equipment - a potato peeler is needed to release time for better training and other duties.\n   (l) Ventilation - A hood with fan over the stove.\nDEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL HEALTH AND WELFARE \"Nutrition Division\"\n\nOttawa, March 13, 1947.\n\nDr. P.

After she visited the Edmonton and St. Albert Indian Residential Schools, I took the liberty of arranging that she should go to Wabasca, where there are two remote bush schools of a kind which she had not hitherto seen and might not easily see again. Wabasca has been, generally speaking, a much overlooked place, and you will have observed my interest in it in other directions.\n\nI do not want to anticipate Miss McCready's report to her own Branch. She has been very well received at all schools so far visited, and in a day or two I shall send you very brief reports on each school, sufficient to indicate that while the diets might be improved, the pupils are being fairly well fed, the staffs are doing reasonably well according to their dietary lights and would appreciate instruction. The nutritional defects are chiefly in citrus fruits or tomatoes and other fruit fresh dried or preserved. These are items in which the cost is a determining factor. Ordinary white bread is generally used. Meat diets are reasonably adequate. Milk varies widely and will be further discussed in Miss McCready's official reports.\n\nMiss McCready will next go to the Ermineskin Indian Residential School at Hobbema and from there to the Stony School at Morley. You will recall recent complaints by the Indians about feeding at the latter school, and I am anxious that a very thorough inquiry be made there.\n\nE.H.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nIn connection with Miss McCready's recent visit to Residential Schools in Alberta I am enclosing the reports on the following six schools:\n\nWabasca Roman Catholic Indian Residential School, Wabasca, Alta.\nSt. John's Indian Residential School, Wabasca, Alta.\nYouville Indian Residential School, St. Albert, Alta.\nChapleau Indian Residential School, Chapleau, Ont.\nEdmonton Indian Residential School, Edmonton, Alta.\nErmineskin Indian Residential School, Hobema, Alta.\n\nMiss McCready reports a most interesting trip and I would judge a very useful one. As mentioned in some of the reports, the literature and other help that we can send in regard to menus and recipes will be of very limited use in Canadian Residential Schools unless we can find a remedy for the limitations imposed by a lack of proper staff, by the poor facilities frequently encountered and by the insufficient money allotment for food.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF.W. Hanley\n\nL.B. Pett, Ph.D., M.D.,\nChief, Nutrition Division.\n\ncc: Dr. P.E. Moore\nDepartment of National Health & Welfare,\n\nCalgary, Alberta,\nMarch 3rd, 1947.\n\nThe Director,\nIndian Health Services,\nDepartment of National Health & Welfare,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMiss Alice McCready of the Nutrition Branch,\nDepartment of National Health and Welfare, was in Alberta\nfrom January 24th, to the end of February, 1947. During\nthis time she visited six Indian Residential Schools, viz:\nEdmonton, St. Albert, Wabasca (2), Erminskin (Robbema),\nand Stony.\n\nIt will be noted that her original plan to visit\nthe Blackfoot Schools was changed to permit her to go to\nthe two northern bush schools at Wabasca instead. This was\ndone at my suggestion.\n\nMiss McCready recommended herself to everyone.\nWhile a first visit of three or four days cannot be expected\nto bring about any very great improvements, her knowledge and\ninterest made a very desirable impression. The general\nimpressions gained from her visit are:\n\n(1) That at the better schools, the pupils are reasonably\nadequately nourished, so far as quantity of food goes.\n\n(2) That at no school does the variety of diet meet the\nrequirements in respect to Vitamin content, and that\nno school principal has sufficient revenue to enable\nhim to provide a wholly satisfactory diet, especially\nin fresh fruit or fruit juices.\n\n(3) That some schools could do better than they are doing\nwith their current resources.\n\n(4) That the goodness or badness of feeding corresponds\nto the quality of management of the several schools\nin other respects.\n\nLeaving the revenue consideration aside, there\nwas no difference as regards location. The schools at\nWabasca were better fed than some in more favoured and\nless costly places.\n\nDetailed comment would only anticipate Miss\nMcCready's reports to her own Branch.\nI agree with her recommendation that a school for cooks be organized in summer, suggest Libret as a suitably central place for the Prairie Provinces, and hope strongly that some senior Indian School pupils be included among the students.\n\nThe only way I can think of by which residential school feeding can be made really satisfactory is by the department laying down scales of food issues, providing the schools with menus, carrying out effective inspection, and paying the cost of the food. This, I believe, would be welcomed by every school principal.\n\nE. L. Stone\n\nE. L. Stone, M.B.,\nRegional Superintendent,\nIndian Health Services,\nAlberta.\nReport on Inspection of Food Service\n\nErmineskin Indian Residential School, Hobbema, Alberta.\n\nFebruary 19 to 23, 1947.\n\nI. Staff:\n\n(1) Kitchen Matron (cook) - Experienced (12 years), self-trained; middle-aged.\n\n(2) Cook's Assistant - Experience received during past 3 years; training required; interested in cooking.\n\nThe kitchen was fully supervised by the kitchen matron. Efficient organization was impossible due to the poorly planned (old) food service set-up and inadequate facilities. The kitchen matron and cook's assistant were hard-working.\n\n(3) The school girls assisted with food preparation and cookery, dishwashing and cleaning duties. Some of the senior girls indicated interest and ability. They might be considered for a cook's course at a later date. They work on the half-day system and rotate every month.\n\nII. Facilities:\n\nThe kitchen was large enough but facilities were definitely inadequate. The boys' diningrooms (2) were dark, dingy, damp and unhealthy rooms in the basement. The root house was unsuitably located in the basement; other food supplies were improperly stored in one corner of root house. The walk-in refrigerator was too small and awkwardly remote from the kitchen.\n\nThe building was very old (over 50 years), antiquated and over-crowded (166 children). In view of these factors, an attempt to remodel the food service set-up would be difficult and the expense would be unjustified. Replacement of the school was indicated (this has been mentioned since the visit to Col. R. P. Neary, Superintendent of Welfare and Training, Indian Affairs Branch). The Nutrition Division would be glad to advise upon and approve plans for the food service units in a new building.\n\nEquipment:\n\nCoal and wood stove - good condition; inadequate (one firebox plus 3 ovens) to cook for over 200 people.\n\nMeat Grinder - old model; satisfactory condition.\n\nBread Slicer - old and worn; should be replaced.\nHand Slicer\u2014Old and worn; should be replaced.\n\nKitchen work tables\u2014Metal top; very old, worn and small; should be replaced by suitable metal or wooden top tables for food preparation.\n\nDiningroom tables and benches\u2014Old and worn; should be replaced.\n\nSink\u20141 only single porcelain (in kitchen) with small drainboards.\n\nEating utensils\u2014Enamel; many were badly chipped; should be replaced.\n\nProvision should be made for sufficient large and small equipment in a new setup.\n\nAttempts have been made to keep the equipment and units maintained and repaired as well as possible.\n\nIII. Sanitation and Hygiene Conditions:\n\nThe kitchen, diningroom, storage and refrigeration spaces were kept clean and tidy. This was difficult due to old and worn structures; consequently good results were not always evident.\n\nThe dishes were washed in several small dishpans in the diningrooms. Soap was not always used; the water was not hot enough and the dishes were not rinsed. Proper dishwashing facilities should be installed in a new building and recommended method used. See \"Suggested Dishwashing Equipment for Indian Residential Schools\" and \"Suggested Dishwashing Methods for Indian Residential Schools\".\n\nThe garbage disposal was satisfactory.\n\nThe water supply has been tested (not regularly). The cows are tested yearly for TB. There were no proper facilities for washing and sterilizing dairy utensils.\n\nThe food handling habits were satisfactory. It was good to see that the school girls wore white aprons and hairnets during food preparation. The girls were regularly checked for cleanliness.\n\nIV. Supplies:\n\nThe produce from the school farm consisted of milk, pork, eggs, potatoes, other vegetables, rhubarb, berries and honey. The school farm (60 acres) has a cultivated acreage of 50 acres; consequently some 240 acres of land are rented and extra food is purchased for livestock. This is still a very small acreage for such a large school. Cattle are purchased and butchered at the school.\nLast year there was no gardener at the school; an Indian was paid $4.00 per day for farm work which was not well done. Last year large quantities of wild fruits were gathered and canned by the staff. Next year the Principal intends to freeze seasonal vegetables (i.e., peas, corn, etc.) for winter months.\n\nBread is purchased from Wetaskiwin; other supplies are purchased from Edmonton. The rail freight charge from Edmonton to Robbena is approximately 30\u00a2/cwt. At Robbena the supplies are picked up by the school truck.\n\nOn the basis of the average monthly food expenditure and value of farm produce, the approximate food cost per person per day is twenty-three cents, according to our calculations.\n\nV. Menus:\n\nThe menus were planned from day to day by the kitchen matron. Variety was lacking, since large amounts of dishes were prepared for the noon meal and the left-overs were served (as such) for the evening meal. A planned weekly menu is important to ensure a balanced diet, variety and efficient organization.\n\nNutritional Aspects:\n\nAt this school cases of different skin disorders, scrofula, etc., were observed. Many of the children were pale, expressionless and thin, probably from inadequate preschool diets as well as poor feeding at the schools. A nutrition survey would reveal the true nutritional status of the children in this area.\n\nThe nutritional adequacy of the children's diet was evaluated by comparison with the number of daily and weekly servings of each important food group as recommended by Canada's Food Rules. The servings fall very short in respect to milk, citrus fruit or tomatoes, other vegetables, the use of whole wheat or Canada Approved white or brown bread, butter, eggs, cheese (non-available) and iodized salt. This will reduce the intake of protein and vitamins A, B and C and iodine. It was stated that fish liver oil was given to the children daily; this was not observed.\n\nThe Principal intends to purchase a percentage of whole wheat bread in future. The servings of fruit were small. Sometimes left-over cooked vegetables (from noon meal) served for the evening meals; the servings were small and the nutrient loss would be great due to the long standing period after cooking. Occasionally fresh fruit was sold (at cost) to the children who had money. A mid-afternoon lunch (slice of bread) was served daily.\n| FOOD GROUPS | AMOUNTS RECOMMENDED BY CANADA'S FOOD RULES | AMOUNT SERVED TO CHILDREN |\n|-------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Milks       | 1\u00bd pts. to 1 qt. daily                     | Approx. \u00be pint daily     |\n| Fruits: Citrus Fruit or Tomatoes | 1 serving daily | None (except in early autumn) |\n| Other Fruit | 1 serving daily | 4 to 7 servings (small) weekly |\n| Vegetables: Potatoes | 1 serving daily | 2 servings daily |\n| Other Vegetables | At least 2 servings daily | 1 serving daily (and leftovers for supper) |\n| Cereals and Bread: Whole Grain Cereal | 1 serving daily | 1 serving daily |\n| Whole Wheat or Canada Approved Vitamin B Brown or White Bread with Butter | At least 4 slices daily | At least 6 slices daily (ordinary white). No Butter. |\n| Meat and Fish | 1 serving of meat or alternate daily | 1 serving daily (and leftovers for supper) |\n| Also-Eggs | At least 3 times weekly | Once weekly |\n| Cheese | At least 3 times weekly | None (non-available) Occasionally. |\n| Liver | Frequently | Not used for cooking or tables. |\n| Iodized Salt | Recommended | Stated given. |\n| Fish Liver Oil | Recommended | |\n\nVII. Food Preparation, Cookery and Service:\n\nThe food quality was fair. Recipes were used, but not consistently. Working techniques were not always satisfactory (often due to lack of facilities). Principles of food preparation and cookery for best retention of nutrients were not well-known (i.e., vegetables prepared far ahead of time, standing for long periods after cooking, etc.). The use of noon leftovers for supper, each day, lent a great deal of repetition. It would be better to prepare and cook only the amounts of food required for dinner and...\nserve supper dishes (i.e., meat or alternate and vegetables) freshly cooked and in a different way.\n\nVIII. Cookery and Nutritional Education:\n\nThe girls assisted with food preparation and some cookery. But they carried out many routine tasks necessitated by the existent working conditions; an additional kitchen staff member (e.g., Indian girl) would help this situation.\n\nSome nutrition education was in effect in the classrooms. Improved facilities and staff education are necessary prior to a nutrition education programme.\n\nIX. Interests:\n\nThe Principal and staff expressed interest in the visit. The limitations of the building and farm were strongly indicated. The Principal is anxious to increase the farm production of milk, vegetables and eggs.\n\nThe District Nurse at Hobbs has made many efforts to promote good eating habits amongst the Indians. She was very interested in nutrition education and was well aware of the important foods for health. It is felt that she could offer considerable continuous assistance to this Residential School which is nearby.\n\nThe location of the school on this particular reserve was a problem and interferences by the Indians were noticeable.\n\nX. Assistance:\n\nDuring the visit sample copies of already available and relatively suitable material, for the food service and nutrition education, was discussed with the Principal, matron and cooks. Appropriate quantities have already been forwarded. This Division is planning to send additional material by way of menu patterns, recipes, food purchasing lists, work schedules, nutrition education material, etc.\nSUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. Needed for Health:\n   (a) Food - Milk: \u00bd pint more milk per child daily.\n      Tomatoes or Citrus Fruit: 7 servings weekly.\n      Other Fruit: 1 serving daily.\n      Vegetables Other than Potatoes: At least 2 servings daily.\n      Use of Whole Wheat or Canada Approved Vitamin B Bread.\n      Increased Use of Eggs, Cheese, Liver and Iodized Salt.\n\n   (b) Pasteurisation of Milk.\n\n2. Needed for Food Preparation and Sanitation:\n   (c) A suitably designed food service set-up, in a new building,\n      to include kitchen, dining-room, storage facilities, refrigeration,\n      dishwashing facilities and necessary equipment\n      (large and small).\n\n   (d) Root House (outside main building).\nReport on Inspection of Food Service\n\nEdmonton Indian Residential School, Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nJanuary 27 to 31st, 1947.\n\nI. Staff:\n\n(1) Cook - position vacant at time of visit.\n\n(2) A Cook's Assistant - fairly young - lacked experience and training in quantity cookery, but competent. She was doing a good job under the direction of the matron.\n\nThere was far too much work for one cook (approximately 140 people). The regular cook had left prior to visit (four cooks had been employed and had left since September).\n\n(3) The School girls assisted with food preparation, cookery, dishwashing, table service and cleaning duties. There were several senior girls at this school who indicated special ability and interest in cooking. They work on the half-day system and rotate every week. A monthly rotation system would be better.\n\nII. Facilities:\n\nThe kitchen, diningroom, storage and refrigeration spaces were adequate.\n\n(1) Storage:\n\nAdditional shelves for supplies and a larger rack for bags of flour are required in the main storeroom.\n\n(2) Ventilation and Lighting:\n\nA hood with fan over the stove would help to remove excess heat and cooking odours. Otherwise, the ventilation and lighting were good.\n\n(3) Equipments:\n\nMechanized equipment - hand slicer - Good condition.\nWooden top Kitchen Work Tables - one badly warped. Should be replaced.\nCooking and Eating Utensils - good condition. Many new.\nFlooring - Terrazzo in kitchen, good condition. Surface of milso mastic flooring in diningroom, storeroom and vegetable preparation room was badly worn. Should be replaced.\nSink - 1 only single porcelain (in kitchen) with small drainboards.\n\nThe units and equipment appeared to have been well maintained and repaired.\n\nIII. Sanitation and Hygienic Conditions:\n\nThe kitchen, diningroom, storerooms and refrigeration units were clean and tidy. With a very worn surface, however, it was impossible to make the floor appear clean.\n\nThe method used in washing dishes was not satisfactory for 150. A suitable dishwashing unit of 2 or 3 compartment sinks instead of several dish pans could be installed in the main kitchen which offers the only available space. See paper on \"Suggested Equipment for Dishwashing in Indian Residential Schools\" and \"Suggested Methods for Dishwashing in Indian Residential Schools\".\n\nThe garbage disposal was satisfactory. The water supply has been tested. This should be done regularly. The cows have not been tested for T.B. for one or two years. They should be tested every year.\n\nThe cook wore a white cap and apron. The girls wore blue striped aprons, but no caps or hairnets. They were checked by the Matron for short hair and clean hands before commencing work in the kitchen.\n\nIV. Food Supplies:\n\nThe produce from the school farm consisted of milk, potatoes, other vegetables and rhubarb. The school farm (600 acres) has a cultivated acreage of 400 acres. The pigs are sold and the full meat supply is purchased. Few fruits and vegetables are canned due to lack of help during summer months. Local fish, which could be used to advantage, is very expensive.\n\nBread and other supplies are purchased from Edmonton. The school truck picks up the supplies.\n\nFigures were unobtainable to calculate the approximate food cost per person per day.\n\nV. Menus:\n\nA weekly menu pattern had been planned by the Matron.\nand was suitably placed in the kitchen. The actual daily menu was based on this and decided upon by the Matron and the cook. Some extras were served to the staff, but very often their menu was similar to that of the children. The children's menu offered fair variety and the supper menu provided more food than had been observed in some schools.\n\nVI. Nutritional Aspects:\n\nThe nutritional adequacy of the children's diet was evaluated by comparison with the number of daily and weekly servings of each important food group as recommended by Canada's Food Rules. It will be seen that the servings fall short in respect to Citrus Fruit or Tomatoes, Other Fruit, Vegetables, the use of Whole Wheat or Canada Approved Vitamin B Bread, Butter, Eggs, Cheese and the use of Iodized Salt. This will reduce the intake of protein, Vitamins A, B and C and Iodine.\n\nFresh fruit is sold to the children (at cost) at the school. Vegetables are served raw most often. Liver is served regularly once a week. It is the future intention to keep more hens for eggs and cattle for butchering. Also, the principal intends to purchase a percentage of Whole Wheat Bread and to use iodized salt.\n\n| FOOD GROUPS | AMOUNTS RECOMMENDED BY CANADA'S FOOD RULES | AMOUNTS SERVED TO CHILDREN |\n|-------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Milks       | 1/2 pts. to 1 qt. daily                   | Approx. 1/2 pts. daily    |\n| Fruits: Citrus Fruit or tomatoes | 1 serving daily | None |\n| Other Fruit | 1 serving daily                           | 5 to 6 servings weekly    |\n| Vegetables: Potatoes | 1 serving daily | 2 servings daily |\n| Other Vegetables | At least 2 servings daily | 10 servings weekly |\n| Cereals and Bread: Whole Grain Cereal | 1 serving daily | 6 servings weekly |\n| Whole Wheat or Canada Approved Vita B Bread with butter | At least 4 slices daily | At least 6 slices daily |\n| Meat and Fish: 1 serving of meat or alternate daily | 9 servings weekly |\n| Eggs | At least 3 times weekly | None |\n| Cheese | At least 3 times weekly | None (non-available) |\n| Liver | Frequently | Once weekly |\n| Iodized Salt | Recommended | Not used for cooking or given from Oct. to April |\n| Fish Liver Oil | Recommended | (table) |\nVII. Food Preparation, Cookery and Service:\n\nThe food quality was fairly good. Recipes were not in use, but working techniques were satisfactory. The cook, unknowingly, applied principles for the retention of nutrients (e.g., use of vegetable water in gravy, etc.).\n\nThe food was served on plates and arranged at the tables prior to the meal hour; consequently it was cold. The introduction of family service at each table would be advisable. The diningroom was supervised at mealtime by a staff member, but the table etiquette of the children could be improved. A pleasant mealtime atmosphere was created by an attractive diningroom.\n\nVIII. Cookery and Nutritional Education:\n\nOnce a week an organized cookery class is held, but the cook's assistant is unqualified to conduct such a class. Due to lack of staff, the girls performed many routine tasks rather than learning new work.\n\nNutrition education was not in effect in the classrooms. It was observed at this school that the Indian children indicated very few food dislikes (e.g., vegetables).\n\nIX. Interest:\n\nThe Principal and staff members expressed keen interest in the visit and in obtaining assistance for the food service and nutrition education.\n\nThere was a lengthy discussion with Dr. E.L. Stone and the Principal about prospective cooks' courses. It was concluded that outstanding Indian girls should be considered as a source of cooks for training. This school had some girls that might be qualified for such a course.\n\nX. Assistance:\n\nDuring the visit sample copies of already available and relatively suitable material for the food service and nutrition education, was discussed with the Principal and other staff. This Division is planning to send additional material by way of menu patterns, food purchasing lists, work schedules, nutrition education material, etc.\nSUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. Needed for Health:\n   (a) Food - Tomatoes or Citrus Fruit - 7 servings weekly\n       Other Fruit - 1 to 2 more servings weekly\n       Vegetables other than Potatoes - At least 2 servings daily.\n       Use of whole wheat or Canada Approved Vitamin B Bread\n       Use of Eggs, Cheese and Iodized Salt.\n   (b) Pasteurisation of milk.\n\n2. Needed for Food Preparation and Sanitation:\n   (a) A qualified cook.\n   (b) Installation of a proper dishwashing set-up (2 or 3 compartment sinks)\n   (c) Replacement of warped wooden top kitchen table.\n   (d) Repair of concrete flooring in diningroom, storeroom and vegetable preparation room.\n\n3. Needed for better use of facilities:\n   (a) Equipment - A potato peeler is needed to release time for better training and other duties.\n   (b) Ventilation - A hood with fan over the stove.\nREPORT ON INSPECTION OF FOOD SERVICE\n\nCHAPLEAU INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, CHAPLEAU, ONTARIO.\n\nJANUARY 18 TO 21, 1947.\n\nI. Staff:\n\n(1) Cook's position vacant, head matron acting cook.\n(2) A cook's assistant\u2014 (Indian girl).\n\nThe regular cook had left prior to the visit. This school was definitely handicapped by the lack of staff. The head matron, in addition to her regular duties, supervised the kitchen and acted as cook. She had spent five years as a kitchen supervisor in the North. She was a capable organizer and aware of most of the important aspects of food service. Such a person, with added training, would be of value as a regional supervisor to spend a certain length of time (i.e., a month or more) at various schools to organize and supervise the food service.\n\nThe cook's assistant was a former graduate of the school (16 years old). She was a capable and interested girl but required further training. Since a source of cooks is a real problem it is recommended that such girls be considered for cooks' courses. These girls could do a better job at some school other than where they have attended.\n\nThe school girls assisted with food preparation, dishwashing, table service and cleaning duties. They only carried out routine jobs connected with cookery, since direction and supervision was impossible due to staff limitations. They work on the half-day system and rotate each month.\n\nII. Facilities:\n\nThe kitchen space was adequate. The diningroom was small and further congested by tables (12' long and unnecessarily wide). By the use of smaller tables, so children could be more comfortably seated.\n\n(1) Storage:\n\nThe main storeroom (for quarterly food supplies) was dark and dingy. It was sufficiently large but too remote from the kitchen. The shelves were narrow, unpainted and inadequate. The elevated rack for flour was too small. This room could be more\nconveniently located near the kitchen (space is available). The former bakeshop (off the kitchen) could be suitably converted to a storeroom for current food supplies, or for a vegetable preparation room if sinks were installed, since the bread is now purchased. There were no ventilated cupboards for bread (stored in boxes).\n\nThe refrigeration was very inadequate and consisted merely of two small reach-in iceboxes. They were located in a room off the kitchen where a walk-in refrigerator could be installed.\n\n(2) Ventilation and Lighting:\n\nThere was no means of ventilation other than windows in the kitchen. A hood with exhaust fan over the stove would remove excess heat and cooking odours. The electric light facilities of the kitchen and diningroom were inadequate.\n\n(3) Equipment:\n\nCoal and Wood Stove (new) - satisfactory\nPotato Peeler - old and unserviceable, (not used) should be replaced.\nWooden Top Kitchen Sink Tables - old and worn; should be replaced.\nCooking Kettles and other utensils - were lacking; many old and worn. Additions and replacements should be made.\nDiningroom Tables and Benches - old and badly worn; should be replaced.\nLack of Cupboards - in kitchen for utensils and supplies - in diningroom for dishes.\nSink - only single porcelain (in kitchen) no drainboard.\nFlooring - concrete with badly worn mule stucco finish in kitchen and diningroom; should be replaced.\n\nIII. Sanitation and Hygienic Conditions:\n\nGood attempts were made to keep the food service units clean. But due to lack of help, poor facilities and worn equipment and floors the results were not always obvious.\n\nThe dishes were washed and rinsed in dishpans in the diningroom. A poor quality powdered soap (little suds obtained) was used. This method was unsatisfactory for 90 people. A suitable dishwashing unit (2 or 3 compartment sinks) could be installed in a room adjacent to the kitchen (there is a pigeon hole from this room into the diningroom). See \"Suggested...\"\nDishwashing Equipment for Indian Residential Schools\" and \"Suggested Dishwashing Methods for Indian Residential Schools\".\n\nThe garbage disposal was satisfactory.\n\nThe water supply is tested regularly. The cows are tested periodically for T.B. (this should be regularly done). There were no proper facilities for washing and sterilizing the dairy utensils.\n\nThe girls wore kerchiefs over their hair and colored aprons. The matron checked the girls for clean hands. The children were X-rayed for T.B. on entrance to the school, otherwise on request. There was no complete assurance that the food handlers did not have T.B., which, in some cases, can be transmitted through food.\n\nThere were many mice throughout the building. An exterminator should be engaged to rid the building of such pests.\n\nIV. Food Supplies:\n\nThe produce from the school farm consisted of milk, potatoes, tomatoes, other vegetables and rhubarb. The school farm (2,000 acres) is mostly rock and bush (35 acres cultivated). Feed for cattle and poultry is purchased. The meat supply and a large part of the year's requirement of vegetables are purchased. Few fruits and vegetables are canned due to lack of staff.\n\nBread is purchased from Chapleau. Other supplies are purchased from Toronto (freight $1.35/cwt.) and Sudbury (freight $1.10/cwt.).\n\nOn the basis of the average monthly food expenditure and value of farm produce, the approximate food cost per person per day is twenty cents, according to our figures. This is a low figure.\n\nV. Menus:\n\nThe menus were planned from day to day (and recorded) by the Matron. The children's and staff's menus differed, with extras allowed for the staff. The Matron had a good combination of food combinations and variety but the children's menu did not offer sufficient variety and their supper menu did not always provide enough food (which seemed to be a direct result of financial limitations).\nVI. Nutritional Aspects\n\nThe nutritional adequacy of the children's diet was evaluated by comparison with the number of daily and weekly servings of each important food group as recommended by Canada's Food Rules. The servings fall very short in respect to eggs, cheese, liver, citrus fruit or tomatoes, other vegetables, the use of whole wheat or Canada Approved bread, butter and iodized salt. This will reduce the intake of protein, iron, Vitamins A, B and C and iodine.\n\nPrior to the visit, the Church of England Residential School Commission had notified this school to supplement the fresh milk supply with powdered whole milk so that each child would receive at least one pint of milk per day. The milk consumption was still low. However, this step indicated ready willingness to increase certain foods if financially possible. Fresh fruit was sometimes sold to the children (at cost) through the school. In view of the limitations of farm production some arrangements should be made to provide the important foods.\n\n| FOOD GROUPS | AMOUNTS RECOMMENDED BY CANADA'S FOOD RULES | AMOUNTS SERVED TO CHILDREN |\n|-------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Milk        | 1\u00bd pts. to 1 qt. daily                     | 1 pt. daily (\u00bd of which is powdered) |\n| Fruit: Citrus Fruit or Tomatoes | 1 serving daily | 1 serving weekly |\n| Other Fruit | 1 serving daily | 1 serving daily (usually dried) |\n| Vegetables: Potatoes | 1 serving daily | 1 serving daily |\n| Other Vegetables | At least 2 servings daily | 1 serving daily |\n| Cereals and Bread: Whole Grain cereal | 1 serving daily | 1 serving daily |\n| Whole Wheat or Canada Approved Vitamin B Bread or White Bread with butter | At least 4 slices daily | At least 6 slices daily (ordinary white). No butter. |\n| Meat and Fish | 1 serving of meat or alternates daily | 1 serving daily |\n| Also Eggs: Cheese | At least 3 times weekly | None (non-available) |\n| Liver | Frequently | None |\n| Iodized Salt | Recommended | Not used for cooking or table |\n| Fish Liver Oil | Recommended | Given from October to April (incl.) |\nVII. Food Preparation, Cookery and Service:\n\nThe food quality was fairly good. Recipes were used and working techniques were satisfactory. Best results were not always obtained due to lack of supplies (economical factor) and insufficient help.\n\nThe food was served on plates and arranged on the tables prior to the meal hour, consequently the food was cold. The introduction of family service at each table would be advisable. The diningroom was supervised at mealtime by a staff member. The diningroom did not lend a suitable meal-time atmosphere because it was crowded and unattractive.\n\nVIII. Cookery and Nutritional Education:\n\nAt the present time, the girls are not receiving actual training in cookery, but carry out routine tasks of preparation and cookery, due to the staff shortages, to get the necessary work done.\n\nPrior to the introduction of Nutrition education many improvements should be made in supplies, facilities and staff.\n\nIX. Interests:\n\nThe Principal and Matron expressed interest in obtaining assistance for the food service and nutrition education. In spite of the many handicaps faced by the staff of this school, a good coordinated effort was reflected.\n\nX. Assistance:\n\nDuring the visit sample copies of already available and relatively suitable material for the food service and nutrition education, was discussed with the Principal and other staff. This Division is planning to send additional material by way of menu patterns, food purchasing lists, work schedules, and nutrition education materials.\n\nHowever, such literature will be of little or no use in Indian Residential Schools unless the limitations resulting from lack of proper staff, poor facilities and insufficient money allotment for food can in some way be remedied.\nSUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. Needed for health:\n   (a) Food - 1 pint more milk per child daily\n       Tomatoes or Citrus Fruits - 6 more servings weekly\n       Vegetables other than potatoes - an extra serving daily\n       Use of whole wheat or Canada Approved Vitamin B Bread\n       Use of Eggs, Cheese, Liver and Iodized Salt.\n   (b) Pasteurization of milk.\n\n2. Needed for Food Preparation and Sanitations:\n   (a) A qualified cook.\n   (b) Installation of a walk-in refrigerator.\n   (c) Installation of a proper dishwashing set-up (2 or 3 compartment sinks).\n   (d) Replacement of wooden top kitchen work tables.\n   (e) Suitable cupboards for bread storage, dishes, kitchen utensils and current food supplies.\n   (f) Replacement of old and worn cooking and eating utensils (and additions).\n   (g) New flooring in kitchen and diningroom.\n   (h) Replacement of diningroom tables and benches.\n\n3. Needed for better use of facilities:\n   (a) Equipment - A potato peeler is needed to release time for better training and other duties.\n   (b) Lighting - More ceiling fixtures and larger lights are needed in the kitchen and diningroom.\n   (c) Ventilation - A hood with fan over the stove.\n   (d) Consideration should be given to moving the main storeroom to available space, adjacent to the kitchen.\nReport on Inspection of Food Service\n\nKoville Indian Residential School, St. Albert, Alberta.\n\nFebruary 1 to 6, 1947.\n\nThis school was owned and operated by the Order of the Grey Nuns. Since 130 old people, as well as 154 Indian children, were looked after it was an entirely different set-up from other Indian Residential Schools. Although the old people occupied a separate section of the building, the environment seemed unsuitable for children.\n\nI. Staff:\n\n(1) Kitchen Matron (cook) - Middle-aged-experienced - fairly good cook. Spoke French only.\n\n(2) Cooks Assistants (2) - Inexperienced and lacked training in quantity cookery.\n\n(3) Baker - male - elderly - experienced and a good bread baker.\n\n(4) Butcher - male.\n\n(5) Vegetable Preparation Helper (1)\n\n(6) Dishwasher (1)\n\nThe food preparation and cookery for the children and the old people was done by the same staff. The kitchen matron, although experienced in quantity cookery, lacked knowledge of principles of cookery for the retention of nutrients. The kitchen was well organized.\n\nThe school girls assisted with food preparation, dishwashing and cleaning duties. They work on the half-day system and rotate every week. A monthly rotation system would be better.\n\nII. Facilities:\n\nThe kitchen, diningroom, storage and refrigeration spaces were adequate. The boys' diningroom required painting.\n\nVentilation and Lighting - The dark and dingy appearance of the kitchen would be improved by better electric light facilities (more windows impossible) and painting.\nEquipment - Mechanized equipment:\n- Electric Oven - good condition\n- Vegetable Steamer - (1), new\n- Steam Kettle (40 gals) - (1), new\n- Steamers, Old Style - (3), old and worn\n- Potato Peeler - good condition\n- Mixing Machine, Old Style - (1), old and worn\n\nSinks - located in room adjacent to kitchen\n- 2 compartment galvanized metal sink, with drainboards.\n- Used for pots and pans.\n- 6 compartment porcelain sinks, no drainboards. Used for vegetable preparation.\n\nCooking and Eating Utensils - good condition.\n\nFlooring - Battleship linoleum flooring in kitchen was worn in some areas. The hardwood flooring in diningroom and concrete flooring in other units were in good condition.\n\nThe units and equipment appeared to have been well maintained and repaired.\n\nIII. Sanitation and Hygienic Conditions:\n\nThe kitchen, girls' diningrooms, storerooms and refrigeration units were clean and tidy. The supplies were very suitably stored. The boys' diningroom did not reflect a standard of cleanliness equal to the other units.\n\nThe dishes were washed in several small dishpans, at the tables, in the diningrooms. Although soap was used, the water was not hot enough and the dishes were not rinsed. This method was very unsatisfactory. The Principal expressed interest in the purchase of a dishwashing machine to service the whole building.\n\nThe garbage disposal was satisfactory.\n\nThe water supply is tested (due to high sodium content, it is the intention of the school to dig another well). The cows are tested yearly for T.B.\n\nThe food handling habits of the nuns were satisfactory. The other kitchen employees (female) and the school girls did not wear caps or hairnets.\n\nIV. Supplies:\n\nThe produce from the school farm consisted of milk, beef, pork, eggs, potatoes, other vegetables and rhubarb. The school farm (1150 acres) has a cultivated acreage of 750 acres. It was stated that the farm buildings were inadequate to keep sufficient dairy herd. A percentage of the milk is sold daily.\nMost of the pork is sold. A gardener was unavailable last year, consequently the year's supply of vegetables was insufficient. It was said that a large percentage of the farm produce was sold to meet overseas expenses of this institution. Available fruits and vegetables are canned.\n\nOther supplies are purchased from Edmonton, and picked up by the school truck. It has been difficult or impossible to purchase rice, shortening or lard, raisins, canned tomatoes and beans during the past months.\n\nOn the basis of the average monthly food expenditure and value of farm produce, the approximate food cost per person per day is twenty-seven cents, according to our calculations. Separate accounts for the children and old people were not kept.\n\nV. Menus\n\nThe menus were planned from day to day by the kitchen matron. She seemed quite aware of food combinations, variety and an adequate diet, but these factors were not always reflected in the food served.\n\nVI. Nutritional Aspects\n\nThe nutritional adequacy of the children's diet was evaluated by comparison with the number of daily and weekly servings of each important food group as recommended by Canada's Food Rules. The servings fall short in respect to milk (for older children particularly), citrus fruit or tomatoes, other vegetables, the use of whole wheat or Canada Approved Vitamin B Bread, butter and cheese (non-available). This will reduce the intake of protein and vitamins A, B and C.\n\nThe milk consumption could be increased by discontinuing the sale of it. The Principal expressed the intention of introducing a percentage of whole wheat bread and the use of Canada Approved Vitamin B flour (if available). Fresh fruit could be sold to the children (at cost) at the school. Liver is regularly served once a week. A mid-afternoon lunch (1 slice of bread) is served.\n\nThe food quality was fairly good. There was a tendency to rely on food standards for the Indian children. Vegetables were often overcooked which would result in a high loss of nutrients. Recipes were in use and working techniques were satisfactory.\n| FOOD GROUPS | AMOUNTS RECOMMENDED BY CANADA'S FOOD RULES | AMOUNTS SERVED TO CHILDREN |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Milk**   | \u00bd pts. to 1 qts. daily                    | Young Children: 1 pt. daily<br>Older Children: to \u00bd pts. daily. |\n| **Fruits:** | Citrus Fruit or Tomatoes: 1 serving daily | None (except fresh tomatoes in early autumn)<br>1 serving daily |\n|            | Other Fruit: 1 serving daily              |                           |\n| **Vegetables:** | Potatoes: 1 serving daily | 1 serving daily |\n|            | Other Vegetables: At least 2 servings daily | 10 servings weekly |\n| **Cereals and Bread:** | Whole Grain Cereal: 1 serving daily | 6 servings weekly |\n|            | Whole Wheat or Canada Approved Vitamin B Brown or White Bread with Butter: At least 4 slices daily | At least 6 slices daily (ordinary white). Butter served twice a week only. |\n| **Meat and Fish:** | 1 serving of meat or alternate daily | 9 servings weekly |\n| **Also:** | Eggs: At least 3 times weekly | 2 times weekly |\n|            | Cheese: At least 3 times weekly Frequently | Once weekly (if available)<br>Once weekly |\n| **Iodized Salt** | Recommended | Used for cooking and table |\n| **Fish Liver Oil** | Recommended | Given from October to April (inclusive) |\n\n**VII. Food Preparation, Cookery and Service:**\n\nThe food quality was fair. There was a tendency to relax on food standards for the Indian children. Vegetables were often overcooked which would result in a high loss of nutrients. Recipes were in use and working techniques were satisfactory.\nThe food was served (cafeteria style) by the staff in the diningrooms. Family service at each table would be preferable. The girls' diningrooms were bright and attractive. The service in the boys' diningroom was careless and the meal-time atmosphere was unsuitable.\n\nVIII. Cookery and Nutritional Education:\n\nThe girls performed mostly routine tasks in the kitchen. Since the kitchen is well-staffed the girls could receive more training in cookery. The Principal indicated the desire to set up a household unit for regular cookery classes.\n\nSome nutrition education was in effect in the classroom, but further education of the staff is necessary for such teachings to be effective.\n\nIX. Interest:\n\nThe Principal expressed interest in the visit but strongly indicated their present financial limitations to improve farm facilities and hire suitable help for the farm. Since the nuns receive no salary at this school, they are even more handicapped as this money is most often allocated to improvements.\n\nX. Assistance:\n\nDuring the visit sample copies of already available and relatively suitable material for the food service and nutrition education was discussed with the Principal. Appropriate quantities have already been forwarded. This Division is planning to send additional material by way of menu patterns, recipes, food purchasing lists, work schedules, nutrition education material, etc.\nSUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. Needed for Health:\n   (a) Food - Milk: \u00bd pint more daily for young children\n      \u00bc to 1 pint more daily for older children\n      Tomatoes or citrus fruit - 7 servings weekly\n      Vegetables other than potatoes - at least 2 servings daily\n      Use of whole wheat or Canada Approved Vitamin B bread.\n   (b) Pasteurization of milk.\n\n2. Needed for food preparation and Sanitation:\n   (a) Improved dishwashing facilities\n   (b) Replacement of old steamers (3) and mixing machine.\n   (c) Repair of battleship linoleum in kitchen.\n   (d) Cleanliness of boys diningroom.\n   (e) Painting of boys diningroom and kitchen.\n\n3. Needed for better use of facilities:\n   Improved electric light facilities in kitchen.\nReport on Inspection of Food Service\n\nSt. John's Indian Residential School, Mahasso, Alberta.\n\nFebruary 11 to 14th, 1947.\n\nIn addition to the handicaps of isolation (100 miles by trail from Lesser Slave Lake) the staff have had to operate under very crowded and temporary quarters since the school was burned in 1945. The good attempts and coordinated efforts of the whole staff, under such circumstances, deserve special mention.\n\nI. Staff:\n\n(1) A cook - 1 year at this school; previously a cook in R.C.A.F. for 3 years; young, fairly capable.\n\nThe kitchen was supervised by the cook, under direction of the head matron. Efficient organization was impossible due to the poor facilities.\n\n(2) The school girls assisted with food preparation and cookery, table service and cleaning duties. They work on the half-day system and rotate each month.\n\nII. Facilities:\n\nThe kitchens, diningroom and storage units were temporary and unsatisfactory. There was no refrigeration unit for the storage of dairy products, leftovers, etc. In view of the intention to build a new school the Nutrition Division is willing to approve plans for the food service units.\n\nEquipment - Large equipment was inadequate; small cooking equipment was lacking. Provision should be made for sufficient equipment (large and small) in the new school.\n\nIt was evident that attempts had been made to improve the appearance of the temporary set-up (e.g., curtains on windows in children's diningroom, painting, etc.)\n\nIII. Sanitation and Hygienic Conditions:\n\nThe diningroom was kept clean and tidy. The kitchen, because it was very small and congested, did not appear tidy. The wooden floors were unfinished and although efforts were made, they did not always appear clean.\n\nThe dishes were not properly scraped and stacked, and were washed in dishpans in the diningroom. Although soap was used, the\nwater was not hot enough (difficult to heat on small stove) and\nthe dishes were not rinsed. Proper dishwashing facilities should\nbe installed in the new building and recommended methods used (see\n\"Suggested Dishwashing Equipment for Indian Residential Schools\"\nand \"Suggested Dishwashing Methods for Indian Residential Schools\").\n\nThe garbage disposal although temporary was satisfactory.\nThe wet garbage containers in the kitchen should be covered.\n\nThe water for all of the buildings was hauled from the\nlake every other day. This required a lot of time and was a real\nhardship. The water was kept in steel barrels, which should be\ncovered in the kitchen. The water has been tested in the past\n(not regularly tested). The school has never been tested for T.B.\nIn view of isolation, the Principal intends to find out if this\ncan be done by the school farm instructor. There were no proper\nfacilities for washing and sterilizing the dairy utensils.\n\nThere was no assurance that the food handlers did not\nhave T.B. X-rays have only been carried out when T.B. suspects\nhave been sent to Edmonton (head matron was concerned about one\ngirl at time of visit).\n\nThe cook and school girls wore aprons but no hairnets\nor caps. There were no facilities for handwashing. Food handling\nhabits could be improved at this school (better facilities\nwould help).\n\nIV. Supplies:\n\nThe produce from the school farm consisted of milk (small\namount), potatoes, other vegetables and tomatoes. The school\nfarm (60 acres) has a cultivated acreage of 25 acres, the remain-\nder is swamp and bush. Feed for a few cattle is purchased, mostly\ncanned and smoked meats used (beef is seldom slaughtered). Last\nyear the chickens were killed by stray Indian dogs, but Principal\nintends to purchase pullets this year. It was impossible to\nobtain farm implements with the grant allowed for such last year.\n\nFish is used extensively. This year fish has been caught\nas needed. This has been unsatisfactory and in the future the\nPrincipal plans to store fish for winter months. Some wild fruits\nare purchased from the Indians. Some fruits and vegetables are\ncanned (not large quantities due to lack of staff).\n\nOther supplies are purchased from Edmonton. The rail\nfreight charge from Edmonton to Lesser Slave Lake is 40 to 50\u00a2/cwt.\n(Plus 10\u00a2/cwt. handling charge at the warehouse). The team freight\ncharge from Lesser Slave Lake to Wabasso (4 to 5 days) is $1.50/\ncwt. in winter and $5.00/cwt. in summer. Consequently supplies\nfor the year are brought in during the winter, if possible.\n\nOn the basis of the average monthly food expenditure and\nvalue of farm produce the food cost per person per day was cal-\nculated to be thirty-three cents. This is a low figure for this\narea (freight expense is included).\n\nV. Menus\n\nThe menus were planned a week in advance by the cook\nand the kitchen matron. The weekly menu was suitably posted in\nthe kitchen. Good attempts were made to offer sufficient variety\nand an adequate diet. The financial and farm limitations made\nthis effort difficult. The children's supper meal did not always\nprovide enough food. Few extras were allowed for the staff.\n\nVI. Nutritional Aspects:\n\nThere seemed to be outstanding indications of the effects\nof an inadequate diet of the preschool child, in this area. At\nthe school, cases of different skin diseases, scrofula, granulated\neyelids, etc., were observed. The children's appetites were poor\nin comparison with other areas. The staff commented on the un-\nhealthy state of the children on first entry to the school and\nafter holidays each year. A nutrition survey would reveal the true\nnutritional status of the children in this area.\n\nThe nutritional adequacy of the children's diet was eva-\nluated by comparison with the number of daily and weekly servings\nof each important food group recommended by Canada's Food Rules.\nThe servings fall very short in respect to eggs, cheese, liver,\ncitrus fruit or tomatoes, other vegetables, the use of whole wheat\nor Canada Approved Vitamin B bread and butter.\n\nPrior to the visit, the Church of England Residential\nSchool Commission had supplemented the fresh milk supply with powder-\ned whole milk so that each child would receive at least one pint\nof milk per day. The milk consumption was still low. But, this\nstep indicated ready willingness to increase certain foods if\nfinancially possible. In view of the limitations of farm pro-\nduction some arrangements should be made to provide the important\nfoods.\n\nIn autumn fresh tomatoes are served 2 to 3 times a week.\nDried egg powder is used for cooking only. Liver is served whenever\nbeef is slaughtered (seldom). A mid-morning lunch (slice of bread\nwith lard and jam spread) was served daily. Vegetables were served in soup often, but the amount did not constitute a serving.\n\n| FOOD GROUPS | AMOUNTS RECOMMENDED BY CANADA'S FOOD RULES | AMOUNTS SERVED TO CHILDREN |\n|-------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Milk       | 1\u00bd pts. to 1 qt. daily                     | 1 pint daily (mostly powdered) |\n| Fruit: Citrus Fruit or Tomatoes | 1 serving daily | None (except in early autumn 2 to 3 servings weekly) |\n| Other Fruit | 1 serving daily | 1 serving daily (mostly dried) |\n| Vegetables: Potatoes | 1 serving daily | 1 serving daily |\n| Other Vegetables | At least 2 servings daily | 1 serving daily |\n| Cereals and Bread: Whole Grain Cereal Whole Wheat or Canada Approved Vitamin B Bread, brown or white, with butter | 1 serving daily | At least 6 slices daily (ordinary white). Butter not served (small amount of lard served at each meal). |\n| Meat and Fish | 1 serving of meat or alternate daily | 1 serving daily |\n| Eggs | At least 3 times weekly | None |\n| Cheese | At least 3 times weekly | None |\n| Liver | Frequently | Seldom |\n| Iodized Salt | Recommended | Used for tables; but not for cooking. |\n| Fish Liver Oil | Recommended | Given from October to April (inclusive) |\n\nVII. Food Preparation, Cookery and Service:\n\nThe food quality was fairly good. Recipes were used. Working techniques were unsatisfactory (mostly due to poor working conditions). Best results were not always obtained due to lack of supplies (economical factor) and improper methods necessitated...\nby poor facilities.\n\nThe food was served on plates and arranged on the tables prior to the meal hour; consequently the food was cold. The introduction of family service at each table would be advisable. The dining-room was supervised at mealtime by a staff member. The mealtime atmosphere was pleasant.\n\nVIII. Cookery and Nutritional Education:\n\nThe girls assisted with food preparation and cookery, but the training was not effective because proper organization and supervision was impossible under the existant working conditions.\n\nPrior to the introduction of nutrition education many improvements should be made by way of increased supplies and better facilities.\n\nIX. Interest:\n\nThe Principal and staff expressed keen interest in the visit. Many worthwhile questions about food and nutrition were asked. The Principal wondered if Canada Approved Vitamin B flour could be contracted for by the Church of England Residential School Commission. Also, he was anxious to obtain information on the use of dried eggs and powdered milk (this will be forwarded by the Nutrition Division).\n\nX. Assistance:\n\nSample copies of already available posters, pamphlets, etc., were not taken to Wabasso, as it was previously thought that such material would be unsuitable for such isolated schools. It was realized, later, that this material could be used. The use of the publications was explained and appropriate quantities have already been forwarded. This Division is planning to send additional material by way of menu patterns, recipes, food purchasing lists, work schedules, nutrition education material, etc.\nSUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. Needed for Health:\n\n(a) Food - Milk: 1 pint more milk (fresh or powdered) per child daily\n   Tomatoes or Citrus Fruit: 7 servings weekly\n   Other Vegetables: At least 2 servings daily.\n   Use of whole Wheat or Canada Approved Vitamin B flour\n   Increased use of eggs (fresh or dried), cheese, liver\n   (whenever possible) and iodized salt.\n\n(b) Regular T.B. testing of cows; Pasteurization of milk.\n\n(c) Assurance that food handlers are free from T.B.\n\n(d) Careful dress and personal hygiene of food handlers. See booklet \"If You Serve Food\".\n\n2. Needed for Food Preparation and Sanitation:\n\nA suitably designed food service set-up in the new building, to include kitchen, diningroom, storage facilities, refrigeration, dishwashing facilities and necessary equipment (large and small).\nReport on Inspection of Food Service\n\nWabasecon Roman Catholic Indian Residential School, Wabasecon, Alta.\n\nFebruary 7 to 10, 1947.\n\nThis school was owned and operated by the Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Ground. In spite of the handicaps of isolation (100 miles by trail from Lesser Slave Lake) many worthwhile improvements have been made and the whole staff deserves recognition for their efforts. No salaries are received by the Missionary staff.\n\nI. Staff:\n\n(1) Kitchen Matron (cook) - 5 years at the school - Experienced, capable and efficient.\n\n(2) Bread Baker - previously cooked for 20 years - good bread baker; as well, she made butter and looked after the chickens.\n\n(3) Cook's Assistant - 2\u00bd years at school. She has received training under direction of the kitchen matron.\n\n(4) Indian Girls (5) - employed as Assistants; rotate between kitchen and bakery. They indicated interest and ability. Further training is necessary and these girls might be considered for a cooks' course. The kitchen was well organized under the good supervision of the kitchen matron.\n\n(5) The school girls assisted with vegetable preparation, dishwashing and cleaning duties. They work on the half day system and rotate every month.\n\nII. Facilities:\n\nThe kitchen, dining room and storage (warehouse outside and storeroom inside) spaces were adequate. A new root house had been built last autumn.\n\n(a) Refrigeration:\n\nAlthough there was an ice house and fish house outside, dairy products and left-overs were unsuitably stored in an unrefrigerated room. This space could be made into a walk-in refrigerator.\n\n(b) Ventilation and Lighting:\n\nCross ventilation (windows) was possible in the kitchen, but excess cooking odours remained. A fan could be installed in a window recess, but with the present arrangement of furnace pipes it would be impossible to install a hood and fan over the stove. An electric generator had been installed; the lighting facilities were satisfactory.\n\n(c) Equipments:\n\nMechanized Equipment - Cooking Machine. Cooking and Eating Utensils - good condition. Flooring - Wooden in all units; good condition. Sink - 1 only single porcelain (in kitchens) with galvanized metal drainboards.\n\nThe units and equipment have been well maintained and repaired.\nIII. Sanitation and Hygienic Conditions\n\nThe kitchen, dining-rooms and storeroom were clean and tidy.\n\nThe dishes were washed in several small dishpans at the tables, in the dining-rooms. Soap was not used; the water was not hot enough and the dishes were not rinsed. This method was very unsatisfactory. A suitable dishwashing unit (2 or 3 compartment sinks) could be installed in the main kitchen. Dumb waiters serviced the dining-rooms (second floor) from the kitchen (first floor).\n\nThe garbage disposal was satisfactory. The water supply has been tested (not regularly). The cows have never been tested for T.B.\n\nThere was no assurance that the food handlers did not have T.B. X-Rays have only been carried out when T.B. suspects have been sent to Edmonton.\n\nThe food handling habits of the nuns were satisfactory. The girls wore dark blue aprons but no caps or hair nets. They were checked frequently by the kitchen matron for short hair and clean hands.\n\nIV. (a) Supplies\n\nThe produce from the school farm consisted of milk, butter, beef, pork, eggs, flour (milled), potatoes, other vegetables, tomatoes, berries and rhubarb. The farm has a cultivated average of 175 acres (some land broken recently). The Principal stated that if a milking machine could be obtained, a larger dairy herd could be kept.\n\nFish is used extensively. Indian help is hired to fish from November to January, for the winter months (approx. 15,000 lbs. frozen). Wild fruits are gathered by the staff. Large quantities of fruits and vegetables are canned. A great deal of ingenuity was exercised by the staff to make the maximum use of all local supplies, (e.g., green onion tops stored in brine for seasoning, pumpkin used for jam, etc.).\n\nOther supplies are purchased from Edmonton. The rail freight charge from Edmonton to Lesser Slave Lake is 40 to 50\u00a2/cwt (plus 10\u00a2/cwt handling charge at the ware house). The team freight charge from Lesser Slave Lake to Wabasca (4 to 5 days) is $1.50/cwt in Winter and $5.00/cwt in Summer. Consequently supplies for the year are brought in during the winter if possible.\n\nOn the basis of the average monthly food expenditure and value of farm produce the food cost per person per day was calculated to be sixty to seventy cents. This is a high figure (freight and some overhead expenses are included).\n\nV. Menus\n\nThe menus were planned 4 to 6 days in advance by the kitchen matron.\nVI. Nutritional Aspects\n\nThere seemed to be outstanding indications of the effects of an inadequate diet of the pre-school child in this area. At the school, cases of different skin diseases, sore lips, granulated eye lids etc., were observed. The children's appetites were poor in comparison with other areas. Many were given rest periods and mid meal feedings. The staff commented on the unhealthy state of the children on first entry to the school and after holidays each year. A nutrition survey would reveal the true nutritional status of the children in the area.\n\nThe nutritional adequacy of the children's diet was evaluated by comparison with the number of daily and weekly servings of each important food group as recommended by Canada's Food Rules. The servings fall short in respect to citrus fruit or tomatoes, other fruits, the use of whole wheat or Canada Approved vitamin B Bread, butter and cheese. The milk consumption was somewhat low. This may reduce the intake of vitamin A, B and C.\n\nIn Autumn fresh tomatoes are served daily. In the past, fruit jam or jelly has been served as fruit, but it does not provide sufficient fruit to constitute a serving. Raw vegetables is served daily at recess period. A sample of the flour milled at the school was brought back for vitamin B assay since 75% of this flour to 85% ordinary white flour is used regularly for bread. Cottage cheese is served often during autumn and spring. The Principal stated that attempts have been made to increase the variety of foods served to children. This was obvious. Previous to this principal's appointment, fish was served twice a day but now due to increased farm production meat is served frequently.\n| FOOD GROUPS | Amounts Recommended by Canada's Food Rules | Amounts Served to Children |\n|-------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Milk        | 1/2 pints to 1 quart daily               | 1/2 pints daily           |\n| Fruits Citrus Fruit or Tomatoes | 1 serving daily | 1 serving weekly (except in early autumn 1 serving of tomatoes daily) 3 servings weekly (dried) |\n| Other fruit | 1 serving daily                          |                           |\n| Vegetables Potatoes | 1 serving daily | 2 servings daily (boiled in jackets once daily) 3 servings daily (1 serving raw) |\n| Other Vegetables | At least 2 servings daily |                           |\n| Cereals and Bread: Whole Grain Cereal Whole Wheat or Vit.B Canada Approved white or brown bread With butter | 1 serving daily | 7 servings weekly |\n| Meat and Fish: Also eggs cheese liver | 1 serving of meat or alternate daily At least 3 times weekly At least 3 times weekly Frequently | 11 servings weekly (fish served 8 times a week) 2 times weekly Cottage cheese 4 to 5 times weekly in autumn and spring Frequently |\n| Iodized Salt | Recommended | Used for cooking and Tables |\n| Fish Liver Oil | Recommended | Given from October to April (Inclusive) |\nVII. Food Preparations, Cookery and Service:\n\nThe food quality was good. Recipes were used and working techniques were very satisfactory. Principles for the retention of nutrients were applied in the preparation and cookery methods.\n\nThe food was served (cafeteria style) by the staff in the dining-rooms. Family service at each table would be preferable. The dining-rooms were bright and the meal time atmosphere was pleasant.\n\nVIII. Cookery and Nutritional Education:\n\nWeekly organized cookery classes are held. The girls record and keep (for future use) basic recipes. This is a good idea and could be introduced at other schools. However, the girls should assist with more food preparation and cookery, day by day, since the kitchen is well-staffed.\n\nSome nutrition education was in effect in the classrooms. The booklet \"Your Food and Health in the North\" was used. The staff expressed the difficulty of teaching the children the important foods for health. They want to know \"why\" and yet cannot conceive nutrients. This emphasized the need for especially designed posters etc.\n\nIX. Interest:\n\nThe principal and staff expressed keen interest in the visit. Many worthwhile questions about food and nutrition were asked. The concern for the health of the children was reflected by other measures (e.g., organized physical training classes, steam baths etc.)\n\nX. Assistance:\n\nSample copies of already available posters, pamphlets etc., were not taken to Wahasee, as it was previously thought that such material would be unsuitable for such isolated schools. It was realized, later, that this material could be used. The use of the publications was explained and appropriate quantities have already been forwarded. This Division is planning to send additional material by way of menu patterns, recipes, food purchasing lists, work schedules, nutrition education material etc.\nSUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. Needed for Health:\n   (a) Food - Tomatoes or Citrus Fruit - 6 more servings weekly\n       Other Fruits - 4 more servings weekly\n       Use of whole wheat or Canada Approved vitamin B flour (if assay\n       of vitamin B content of flour milled at school does not show com-\n       parable value),\n       Increased use of cheese.\n   (b) Regular T.B. testing of cows; Pasteurisation of milk.\n   (c) Assurance that food handlers are free from T.B.\n\n2. Needed for food preparation and sanitation:\n   (a) Improved dishwashing facilities\n   (b) Installation of a walk-in refrigerator.\n\n3. Needed for better use of facilities:\n   (a) Equipment - potato peeler\n       bread mixer\n       meat grinder\n       slicing machine\n       To release time for training\n       and other duties\n   (b) Ventilation - fan in kitchen\nOttawa, 29 March, 1947.\n\nColonel D.F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs,\nDept Building,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Colonel Henry:\n\nIn connection with Miss McCready's recent visit to Residential Schools in Alberta I am enclosing the reports on the following six schools:\n\nWabasca Roman Catholic Indian Residential School,\nWabasca, Alta.\nSt. John's Indian Residential School, Wabasca, Alta.\nYouville Indian Residential School, St. Albert, Alta.\nChapleau Indian Residential School, Chapleau, Ont.\nEdmonton Indian Residential School, Edmonton, Alta.\nBruinskin Indian Residential School, Hobema, Alta.\n\nMiss McCready reports a most interesting trip and I would judge a very useful one. As mentioned in some of the reports, the literature and other help that we can send in regard to menus and recipes will be of very limited use in Canadian Residential Schools unless we can find a remedy for the limitations imposed by a lack of proper staff, by the poor facilities frequently encountered and by the insufficient money allotment for food.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF.W. Hanley\n\n[Signature]\n\nLe B. Pette, Ph.D., M.D.,\nChief, Nutrition Division.\n\nLBP/ABJ\n\n[Signature]\nDr. F.E. Moore\nOttawa, 2 April, 1947.\n\nMr. Be. Neary,\nSuperintendent, Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Dietary Service for Indian Residential Schools\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nThank you for your letter of March 17th concerning Miss McCready's recent visit in Alberta. I am returning herewith the copy of a letter signed by Dr. Stone which was inadvertently enclosed with your letter.\n\nIn order that plans may be brought forward rapidly, I would like to suggest that we have a meeting with Dr. Moore concerning a summer course for cooks, around the 15th April, if this would be convenient. Since I shall be away next week, would you be kind enough to enquire from Dr. Moore what time would suit him and set a date during that week in April. You could then notify my office for my information as soon as I return.\n\nI should like to bring to this meeting Miss Margaret Leck who would take charge of such a cook's course.\n\nIn view of the interest in the Prairie Provinces, I think that serious consideration should be given to Dr. Stone's suggestion that a course be held in Edmonton. We would suggest a one-week course, beginning with registration on a Wednesday of a week-end ending on a Friday, confined to cooks or assistant cooks. Not more than 30 should be enrolled for this course and every precaution should be taken to assure their attendance.\n\nImmediately following this week's course, one or two of the cooks would be invited to study an additional week and we would hold a special course for Indian girls from the same school, on how to be useful in the kitchen.\n\nDr. P.E. Moore, Director, Indian Health Services.\nMy proposal is that next winter would then be devoted to concentrating our attention on the 15 or 20 schools represented by the students attending these two courses. When finished this short amount of basic instruction, they should be in a position to follow the menus, recipes and other advice that we would like to have represented in a completely coordinated manner by late September. I believe that this procedure will be much better than attempting to send menus and recipes to all the residential schools, since we will not only be training the cooks, but will be able to follow through with all the advice that they need next winter. If this procedure proves effective, we might continue our cook's courses over a longer period of time next summer according to the number of pupils you could guarantee.\n\nMay I repeat what has been said before that a system must be available for paying these cooks their transportation and their room and board while attending the course and the registration must be adhered to fairly strictly. It is no use putting on a course for five or six students, nor yet is it possible to give suitable training to a group of thirty.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLe Be Pett, Ph.D., M.D.,\nChief, Nutrition Division\n\nLDP/AJS\nOttawa, April 23, 1947.\n\nCol. B.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI am enclosing proposed itineraries for Miss Lock and Miss McCready to visit schools in Saskatchewan and Alberta during May.\n\nIn view of our decision to hold the Cook's Course for the benefit of the schools in the Prairie Provinces, it seems likely that additional schools should be contacted prior to this course. Due to the short time now available, the visit at each school will be fairly brief and may not be as complete an inspection as previously carried out.\n\nPrior to Miss Lock's visit to Lebret, the necessary information on conducting the Cook's Course at this school will be forwarded to Rev. P. Piche, O.M.I.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would notify the concerned Indian officials and school principals of the prospective visits and ask if they could arrange suitable accommodation in each case. Miss Lock and Miss McCready will notify them further of exact arrival times.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL.B. Pett, Ph.D., M.D.,\nChief, Nutrition Division.\n| Date       | Place                  | School                  | Principal/Teacher          | Indian Agent               | Accommodation |\n|------------|------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------|\n| May 2      | Leave Ottawa for Alberta |                         |                            |                             |               |\n| 12-14      | Brooksit               | Sacred Heart            | Rev.

Her itinerary is attached for your information.\n\nWould you please write to the Principals and Agents concerned informing them of her visit and requesting that they arrange suitable accommodation in each case.\n\nYou could refer them to the article on this dietary service in the Bulletin dated December 10th, 1946, No. 2, Vol. 1.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nBFN/MGD\nDepartment of National Health & Welfare\n\nCharles Camsell Indian Hospital,\nEdmonton, Alberta,\n29 May, 1947.\n\nAlberta\n\nDirector Indian Health Services,\nDepartment National Health & Welfare,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nMiss Alice McCready has finished her second visit to residential schools in Alberta. It is hard to judge from one visit to each school, but reports indicate that she has made an excellent personal impression and that the school authorities are receptive to the service she represents.\n\nThe proposal to hold a cooking school at a central point in the Prairie provinces is appreciated and appears to be widely welcomed by the schools.\n\nIt is supposed that the Department will now consider what is to be done next. My recommendation is that a nutritionist be assigned to duty over such an area as to provide one annual visit to each of the 19 residential schools in Alberta.\n\nThis would not take up the full school year of some 40 usable weeks, and it may be considered that the nutritionist can add an adjoining province to her territory. There are about 12 residential schools in British Columbia and numerous day schools. There are also 4 residential schools in the Mackenzie River basin outside Alberta. This would seem to be a suitable territory for one nutritionist.\n\nThis is my official recommendation and request in respect to this service. I am aware that schools are in Indian Affairs jurisdiction and am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Gooderham for any comment he may wish to make.\n\n(sgd.) A. L. Stone, M.B.,\nRegional Superintendent,\nIndian Health Services.\n\ncc to Inspector Indian agencies, Calgary, Alberta.\n\nDr. T. S. Tennant, Vancouver, British Columbia.\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Dietary Service and Visits of Miss McCready\n\nThe Regional Medical Superintendent, Dr. Stone, in his letter of the 29th ultimo has stated that Miss McCready's visits were undoubtedly beneficial to the services, and that she made an excellent impression everywhere.\n\nThis has stimulated an interest in dietary, and there should be a good representation from the province at the cooking school which will be held in July. Special endeavours are being made by our agents to have young Indian girls attend it.\n\nAs to the future, Dr. Stone has recommended that a nutritionist be assigned to duty over such an area as to provide one annual visit to each of the 19 residential schools in this province. That appears to be a move in the right direction, but it is doubted if it would require the full time services of a dietitian. It is our contention that the visits must be confined to a very short stay, when local problems are discussed, and suggestions, if any, made for improvements. Should the nutritionist intend to stay for some weeks at an institution, the impression would certainly be given that this party intended to take over certain duties; this could cause dissatisfaction and unpleasantness. The principals of all schools will welcome advice, but they will not welcome the presence of somebody who intends to run their show.\n\nHerewith copy of the Regional Superintendent's letter of May 29th.\n\nG.

Stone, M.B.,\nRegional Superintendent,\nIndian Health Services.\n\nS/P\n\ncc to Inspector Indian Agencies, Calgary, Alberta.\n\nDr. P.S. Tennant, Vancouver, British Columbia.\nI guess we should let Dr. Pett know - you can send him my copy if you want.\nThank you very much for sending me with your letter of June 6th a copy of a letter from Mr. Gooderham, Inspector of Indian Agencies in Alberta.\n\nI note the suggestion of Dr. Stone which meets with some favour by Mr. Gooderham that every one of the 19 residential schools in the Province should receive an annual visit. Mr. Gooderham has interpreted this as meaning someone stationed in the Province who would be able to spend some time at each school and he does not view this with much favour. I would agree with him that it would be a difficult job.\n\nThe idea of a travelling dietitian staying a few days or up to a week in an institution is developing in other fields, for example, small hospitals. I am quite sure that when suitable personnel can be obtained some of the Provincial Health Departments will find it advantageous to establish several such positions in their Provinces so as to supervise more adequately the food service in various small hospitals that could not employ a dietitian. From our preliminary studies in this matter on behalf of various Provinces, it would appear that a supervising dietitian actually responsible for such work could not operate on more than about five institutions. Such a person would be, of course, in charge of menu planning, buying, and cost accounting of foods. This is a possible hope for small hospitals, but appears to me to be out of the question for Indian residential schools. So far as we are concerned, the present inspections of residential schools are for the dual purpose of finding out whether further trained supervision and assistance can profitably be used by these schools under their present operation and whether the present operation of food services can be used to improve the education and training being given in the schools. In other words, it is more of an inspection service than a continuing supervisory service at the present time. I am not yet prepared to say whether the general set-up is suitable to take proper advantage of the service that we can provide in this respect. One of our earliest observations was the lack of training by cooks and we are attempting to correct that this summer and will evaluate the success of that phase of our work by further contacts with these cooks next winter. This is, however, only one aspect of many that...\nare in need of correction before our inspection report can be completed, and certainly before I could recommend a continuous supervisory service being established regionally.\n\nIn other words, we are trying to see what good actually can be done under present circumstances and any improved circumstances that we can reasonably achieve in a short time such as training cooks or getting better equipment in schools.\n\nIf a travelling dietitian can be recommended for various regions stationed in those regions, I believe that such a service would have to be financed and administered by some branch of Indian Affairs and not by us. In view of the dual nature of the problem, that is the health aspect, plus the educational aspect, I would not venture to say exactly how this staff of dietitians should be administered. If desired, we could continue to act in a somewhat independent manner as inspectors of what was being achieved in this regard by making a visit somewhat similar to those now being made and by maintaining a service in regard to preparation of materials uniform for all regions. This is obviously a matter for some time in the future.\n\nL. B. Pett, Ph.D., M.D.,\nChief, Nutrition Division.\n\nLDF/AJS\n\ncc: Mr. B.F.

We were almost finished, when, in conversation with another Principal, I learned that you require a Statement of the values of School Buildings as well. As the original letter of May 4th came to the school before my time of office, and seeing that we cannot find trace of this letter, I wonder if you would be good enough to send me a copy so that we may know just what is required. I shall then send in the Inventory as soon as possible.\n\nI regret the delay, but the arrival of your letter this month, was the first intimation I had concerning this thing.

I am, therefore, submitting a \"nil\" report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise that the acting Principal of the Sechelt Residential School reports that he is unable to find at the school the forms from which an inventory of all Government properties at residential schools is made.\n\nAs they were probably received at the school when the principal, the Rev.

I laid it aside when received intending to inquire of Inspector Hamilton during his visit as to particulars in regard to filling out this document but his visit was brief and in the multiplicity of other matters it was overlooked.\n\nMy difficulty in this matter is to know what of the implements, utensils, etc., are regarded as Government property and what should be considered to belong to the Church. I would appreciate very much if you would instruct me in this connection as my conversation both with my predecessor and with Mr. Russell Perrier during his visit when I took over the school would lead me to think that at least the greater part of the stock and implements, etc., which are purchased out of per capita grant are regarded as the property of the Church which operates the school.\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nI am, yours respectfully,\n\nJ.

The information for this column can be obtained from the copy of last year's inventory which you have on file.\n\nThe second column should be headed \"Total Receipts\". In this column should be included any articles which have been obtained and paid for by the Department between the period April 1, 1935, and December 31, 1935.\n\nThe third column should read \"Total Issues\". Under this heading will be listed the articles of Government property, if any, which have become useless during the period April 1, 1935, to December 31, 1935.\n\nThe total value should be recorded at the end of the inventory for each group opposite the word \"Total\". Where an individual group covers more than one page, the total should be carried forward from page to page to the end of the inventory for that particular group.\n\nIt is important that the name of the school should be written on the top of each page of the inventory.\n\nRECAPITULATION:\n\nIn preparing this, you should be guided by the following instructions:\n\n(a) \"Agency and Farm Buildings, etc.\" should not be included in the \"Recapitulation\" as such information is not required by the Auditor General's Office for publication.\n\n(b) The group totals referred to above should be recorded on the \"Recapitulation\" sheet, page 18, in the space and under the headings provided therefor.\n\n(c) The total value of Articles \"In Use\" and \"In Store\" for each group should be extended to the outside columns headed \"Total Value\".\n\n(d) The \"Recapitulation\" sheet should be totalled to show the \"Grand Total\" for the school and certified correct by the Principal.\n\nA.

copies of a form used for inventory of Government property on hand at Indian residential schools. Three copies of this form should be completed at the earliest possible date and returned to the Department. One copy should be retained at the school.\n\nYou will note that the form covers the Government property on hand on December 31st, last. Consequently, the inventory you are now requested to complete covers the period January 1st to December 31st, 1936. The first column should, therefore, be completed \"on hand Jan., 1936\" and the last column should be completed as \"on hand 31st Dec., 1936\".\n\nIt is important that the name of the school should be written on the top of each page of the inventory. You should, also, note that, in preparing the inventory, only the articles and property owned by the Department should be recorded. It is not necessary to make any mention of food, clothing or other articles in the school that have been purchased and are owned by the school management.\n\nIt is expected that the three copies of this form will be properly completed and returned to the Department before March 31st.\n\nT R L MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, April 22, 1937.\n\nRev.

for inventory of Government property on hand at Indian residential schools. Three copies of this form should be completed at the earliest possible date and returned to the Department. One copy should be retained at the school.\n\nYou will note that the form covers the Government property on hand on December 31st. Consequently, the inventory you are now requested to complete covers the period January 1st to December 31st, 1937. The first column should, therefore, be completed \"on hand Jan. 1st, 1938\" and the last column should be completed as \"on hand 31st Dec., 1937\".\n\nIt is important that the name of the school should be written on the top of each page of the inventory. You should, also, note that, in preparing the inventory, only the articles and property owned by the Department should be recorded. It is not necessary to make any mention of food, clothing or other articles in the school that have been purchased and are owned by the school management.\n\nIt is expected that the three copies of this form will be properly completed and returned to the Department promptly.\n\nT.

MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nLejac Indian Residential School\nUnder Direction of The Oblate Fathers\nLEJAC, B.C.\n\nNov. 23, 1937\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSome weeks ago we received inventory forms dealing with Government property at Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nLast year when we filled in the same forms considerable discussion took place as to what should be included in this inventory. The difficulty arises from the fact that much of our property is purchased out of the per capita Grant or from profits accruing from farm operations or, in the case of animals, from the natural increase.\n\nSome contend that all these things should be listed as Government property, others contend that only such articles as have been purchased directly by the Indian Department should be included.\n\nI will be glad therefore if you would give me definite directions on this question.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. W. Byrne-Grant, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\nOttawa, December 7, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of November 29th, you should only list on the Inventory returns the articles purchased directly by the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

DEVITT\n\nWith reference to our telephone conversation of this morning I enclose copies of the inventory of Government property in Indian Residential Schools as of December 31, 1937.\n\nA summary of these inventories was forwarded to your office under cover of Mr. Hoey's memorandum of May 16, 1938.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, May 16, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BAILEY:\n\nI enclose herewith duplicate copies of the summary of the Inventory of government property at Indian residential schools, December 31, 1937.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMr. E. A. Devitt\nPurchasing Div.\nMines & Resources\nLangdon Block\nOttawa,\nDecember 12, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return the inventory forms which you recently forwarded.\n\nThe form distinctly states that it is an inventory of Government property on hand. In reviewing the form it is noted that the first item that you have shown on the inventory is an automobile valued at $1500.00. This machine was not purchased by the Government and consequently is not Government property.\n\nThe distinction to be made is that articles purchased by the Government for your school are Government property and should be listed on the inventory. Articles purchased from the per capita grant or other receipts of the school are considered school property and need not be shown on the inventory.\n\nNew forms are being forwarded to you under separate cover.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. P. A. Charron,\nPrincipal,\nBlood Indian Residential School,\nCardston, Alta.\nOttawa,\nDecember 12, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return the inventory form which you recently forwarded.\n\nThe form distinctly states that it is an inventory of Government property on hand. In reviewing the form it is noted that the first item that you have shown on the inventory is an automobile valued at $900.00. This machine was not purchased by the Government and consequently is not Government property.\n\nThe distinction to be made is that articles purchased by the Government for your school are Government property and should be listed on the inventory. Articles purchased from the per capita grant or other receipts of the school are considered school property and need not be shown on the inventory.\n\nNew forms are being forwarded to you under separate cover.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. M. de Bretagne, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Indian Residential School,\nLebret, Sask.\nOttawa,\nDecember 12, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return the inventory form which you recently forwarded.\n\nIt is noted that you have included on the inventory the truck purchased by the Department for your school for the transportation of water. You have not placed any value on this machine and I should appreciate your doing so in order that the inventory may be completed.\n\nOn the first page you enter $865.90 for lumber. Do you mean that you have this lumber left on hand? If so, please let me know why it was not used.\n\nIf it was lumber supplied for repair of the buildings it is not necessary to list it as a separate item as it would be included in the value of the buildings.\n\nNew forms are being forwarded to you under separate cover.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. O. Chagnon, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSandy Bay Indian Residential School,\nMarius, Man.\nOttawa,\nDecember 23, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return the inventory which you recently forwarded.\n\nOn this inventory you should only show the articles purchased from Government funds. Articles which you secure from your per capita grant are not considered Government property for inventory purposes. As a result the automobile should not be included. It is correct to show the valuation on the buildings as these were built by the Department.\n\nWith reference to live stock please note the heading at the top of this section \"Live stock (if purchased by Department)\". Live stock not purchased by the Department should not be included on the inventory.\n\nOn page 2 is shown an entry of $300.00 for furnaces. Equipment such as a furnace is comprised in the valuation of the building.\n\nAt the top of the enclosed inventory you state \"On hand 1st January, 1934\". Column 1 means on hand 1st January, 1938, column 2 means total receipts during year 1938 and column 3 means total issues during the calendar year 1938.\n\nAs it is necessary to have the inventory properly completed I am enclosing the requisite forms in order that you may prepare an amended inventory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. O. Chagnon, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSandy Bay Indian Residential School,\nMarius, Man.\n\nR. A.

Articles which you secure from your per capita grant are not considered Government property for inventory purposes. In preparing the inventory last year you valued the buildings at $241,400.00. The pencil entries on page 3 of the enclosed inventory are the figures given last year. For inventory purposes it is considered that the buildings should be valued at the same amount each year, consequently the last year's figures should be entered where necessary.\n\nThe recapitulation should be carefully prepared. In the one being returned you will note that machinery, implements etc. are valued at $1500.00 but the total shown on pages 1 and 2 is only $840.00. However, if you place the valuation opposite the other articles mentioned on pages 1 and 2 it is quite possible that the $1500.00 total would be reached.\n\nIt is very necessary to have the inventory properly completed and I am, therefore, enclosing not only the inventory which you forwarded but the necessary forms to permit you to prepare an amended inventory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. N. Doyon, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nGuy Indian Residential School,\nSturgeon Landing, Sask.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, January 12th, 1939.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI am returning herewith your inventory of Government property on hand 31st December, 1938, at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School.\n\nPlease note that you should not have included the two automobiles on the inventory, as they are not Government property, but the truck should be shown.\n\nPlease also note that this inventory should be forwarded in triplicate.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. C. Rust, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nPine Creek Indian Residential School,\nCamperville, Man.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 6, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir;\n\nOn November 15, 1938, the Department forwarded to you 4 copies of the inventory form for residential schools.\n\nAlthough it was expected that this form would be completed and returned to us by the end of December, 1938, it has not yet reached the Department.\n\nIt is very important that we have these inventory forms at the earliest possible date and if you have not forwarded yours by the time this letter reaches you it would be appreciated if you would give the matter your immediate attention.\n\nIn preparing the inventory I would direct your attention to the letter of instructions which was sent to you. Only Government property should be included on the inventory form. You should not mention equipment purchased by the school management from school funds.\n\nAlso sent to Principals of\n\nShingwauk Whitefish Lake\nCross Lake Ahousaht\nFort Alexander Cariboo\nMorley Coqualeetza\nOld Sun Kuper Island\nSand Bay\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Some of it has been employed, the rest will be used next summer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return the inventory form which you recently forwarded.\n\nIt is noted that you have included on the inventory the truck purchased by the Department for your school for the transportation of water.

Chagnon, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSandy Bay Indian Residential School,\nMarius, Man.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 20, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to again return the inventory which you forwarded in connection with the Government-owned property at the Sandy Bay Indian residential school. You have not placed any value on all the articles shown on page 1 and several of the articles shown on page 2.

1938\n\nRegarding the usual annual inventory required by\nthe Auditor General, showing all departmental equipment, supplies,\nprovisions and stores on hand on the 31st instant, I am enclosing\nseveral copies of his Circular No. 5, 1938.\n\nThe following should be brought to the attention\nof the various branch and division officers whose duty it is to\ncheck the equipment and prepare the inventory:\n\n1. The return should be submitted on form h01 -\nProperty Return - copies of which may be obtained on\nrequisition in the usual way from the Departmental\nStationery Office, Vimy Building, Ottawa.\n\n2. Each branch return is to be completed and\nsubmitted, with a properly certified branch summary,\nshowing the equipment, value, etc., for the Branch\nHead Office, and its various Divisions, Services, etc.,\nif any. The Branch return should reach this office\nbefore March 31st, 1939, in order that it may then\nbe included in the Departmental Reappraisal.\n\n3. The inventory should include all typewriters,\nadding machines and other office appliances, and only\nsuch stationery supplies as are in excess of six months'\nrequirements.\n\n4. All sales or transfers of government-owned\nequipment will be reported in Column 6 of the inventory\nform - No.h01 - with a notation in the Remarks Column\nas to the Salvage Minute number authorizing the sale.\n5. Articles considered as worn-out, obsolete, or unserviceable, will continue to be reported in the inventory until authority is given by this office to write-off the article in the branch inventory.\n\n6. Test audits have revealed that there are often numerous discrepancies between the branch records, the inventory, and the stores and equipment actually on hand. Steps should be taken to ensure that the inventory includes all government-purchased equipment in possession of the branch.\n\n7. Any equipment properly authorized to be loaned to other Federal Departments, individuals, etc., should be so reported, with the date of loan, in the Remarks Column of Form 401, together with information as to the present location of any articles not actually in the place covered by the inventory. Receipts for all issues, loans, etc., as well as storage receipts, should be readily available.\n\n8. Equipment, stores, etc., surplus to requirements should be shown in the Remarks Column. No surplus stores will be transferred without the concurrence of the Director, etc., concerned.\n\n9. Furniture, etc., supplied by the Department of Public Works should not be included in the inventory for the Auditor General.\n\n10. Buildings, whether or not erected by the Department of Public Works, should not be included in the inventory, which is primarily for stores and equipment.\n\nDeputy Minister.\nCOPY\n\nOFFICE OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL\n\nOttawa, Canada. November 10, 1938.\n\nCircular No. 5 - 1938\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Inventory at Annual Stocktaking.\n\nPursuant to Section 47 of the Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act, please supply me, not later than March 31st next, with a complete inventory of equipment, supplies, provisions or stores, the property of His Majesty, under the control of your department, as at the 31st of December, 1938.\n\nThe inventory should include stationery supplies, travelling accessories such as trunks, bags, cases, etc., and motor vehicles. The actual cost of each item of stores and equipment on hand should be given but, where such information cannot readily be obtained, the estimated value should be stated. In either case, the inventory should be prepared to show the total value of such property on hand.\n\nAs the policy of the Government, respecting the value of public property in general, is not to consider depreciation, I suggest that property values, once established, either on a cost or an estimated value basis, should be maintained unchanged in your records from year to year until such property is finally disposed of, subject to any modifications as a result of separations, additions or betterments.\n\nThe inventory should be signed by the officer directly responsible for the property listed therein, certified by the senior official of the district concerned, and also by the head office official charged with the administration of the property. A general departmental recapitulation should be prepared showing the total value of the stores and equipment maintained at the various locations. This recapitulation should be certified correct by the official by whom it is compiled and approved by the deputy head of the department. The official title of each officer signing should be given.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) Geo. Gonthier\nAuditor General.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nMines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nTO PRINCIPALS,\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS.\n\nRe - \"Inventory of Government Property\".\n\n1. Kindly insert name of School, with date, on each of the three copies.\n\n2. Considerable delay and confusion has been experienced in the past through failure to forward inventories promptly and lack of information therein.\n\n3. You will note that Inventories read \"Government Property on hand 31st December, 1939\". Please act accordingly, forms to be completed and returned to this office promptly, and in no case, later than March 1st, 1940.\n\nAutomobiles and trucks, unless purchased by this Department, should not be shown on this form. All columns must be added correctly and certified by the Principal.\n\n4. A memorandum has been received from the Auditor General and is shown here for future guidance, -\n\n\"As the policy of the Government, respecting the value of public property in general, is not to consider depreciation, I suggest that property values, once established, either on a cost or an estimated value basis, should be maintained unchanged in your records from year to year, until such property is finally disposed of, subject to any modification as a result of separations, additions or betterments.\"\n\n[Signature]\n\nPHILIP LHELAN,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nOttawa, November 15th, 1939.\n\n506-915.\nOttawa,\nDecember 7, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return the attached inventory of the Government property on hand at the Onion Lake C.E. residential school.

The cost of this unit is no doubt included in the valuation placed on the building.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 6, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nYour inventory for the year 1938 showed the following items which are not shown on your inventory for the year 1939:\n\n1 Boat motor ----- $90.00\n2 Gas engines ---- $5.00\n\nIn your inventory for 1938 the typewriter was valued at $110.00 whereas in 1939 it is only valued at $50.00. I am returning your 1939 inventory so that you may make any adjustments you consider necessary. Depreciation should not be shown on any item or on the buildings. They should be carried at the same amount as was given on the first inventory on which they were entered.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev.

Would you please have copies of these forms sent so that I may fill them in?\n\nThe Department supplied us with materials to build a vocational training shop and also gave us tools for this shop. I presume, therefore, that both the shop and the tools should be listed as Government property. Kindly let me know if I am wrong.\n\nWe have had and are having a great deal of rain and, just before Christmas, we had a long and severe storm. Otherwise, things seem to be about as usual.\n\nWith best wishes for the New Year,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S.

C. Perreault, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nMcIntosh, Ont.\nJanuary 11th, 1940.\n\nCIRCULAR MEMORANDUM\n\nInventory at annual Stocktaking,\nDecember 31st, 1939.\n\nRegarding the annual inventory of all Departmental equipment, supplies, provisions, and stores on hand as at December 31st, only one copy of this inventory for the past year should be furnished this office. As usual adequate stores and equipment accounting records are to be maintained in all Departmental offices and made readily available for examination, as may be deemed necessary from time to time, by officers of the Auditor General's Department. If it is found that the Branch inventory as submitted for 1939, represents an accurate account of all Departmental equipment on charge to, and in possession of the Branch or Division thereof, arrangements may be made during 1940 when the last inventory has been checked by the Administrative Branch that in such cases only a supplementary return of equipment, etc., received and disposed of during the year may be furnished for the year ending December 31st, 1940.\n\nIn preparing the inventory for the past year it is thought that the following points might again be emphasized so that further steps may be taken in arranging for uniformity in the preparation of the inventory.\n\n1. The return should be submitted on form 401 - Property Return - copies of which may be obtained on requisition in the usual way from the Departmental Stationery Office, Vimy Building, Ottawa.\n\n2. Each Branch return is to be completed and submitted, with a properly certified Branch summary, showing the equipment, value, etc., for the Branch Head Office, and its various Divisions, Services, etc., if any. The Branch return should reach this office before March 31st, 1940, in order that it may then be included in the Departmental Recapitulation.\n3. The inventory should include all typewriters adding machines and other office appliances, and only such stationery supplies as are in excess of six months' requirements. The serial numbers of all typewriters etc., should be furnished in the inventory.\n\n4. All sales or transfers of government-owned equipment will be reported in Column 6 of the inventory form - No. 401 - with a notation in the Remarks Column as to the Salvage Minute number authorizing the sale.\n\n5. Articles considered as worn-out, obsolete, or unserviceable, will continue to be reported in the inventory until authority is given by this office to write-off the article in the branch inventory.\n\n6. In the past test audits have revealed that there are often numerous discrepancies between the branch records, the inventory, and the stores and equipment actually on hand. Steps should be taken to ensure that the inventory includes all government-purchased equipment in possession of the branch. It is assumed that wherever possible a physical check will be made of the equipment on hand at the close of the year.\n\n7. Any equipment properly authorized to be loaned to other Federal Departments, individuals, etc., should be so reported, with the date of loan, in the Remarks Column of Form 401, together with information as to the present location of any articles not actually in the place covered by the inventory. Receipts for all issues, loans, etc., as well as storage receipts, should be readily available.\n\n8. Equipment, stores, etc., surplus to requirements should be so shown in the Remarks Column. No surplus stores will be transferred without the concurrence of the Director, etc., concerned.\n\n9. Furniture, etc., supplied by the Department of Public Works need not be reported to this office this year, but each Branch should maintain a record of furniture in its possession.\n\n10. Buildings, whether or not erected by the Department of Public Works, should not be included in the inventory, which is primarily for stores and equipment.\n\nDeputy Minister.\nJanuary 24th, 1940.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDr. McGill,\nIndian Affairs.\n\nRe: Inventory at Annual Stocktaking.\n\nReference is made to your memorandum of the 4th instant, your file 150-50, relative to the Kelvinator refrigeration unit at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School near Kenora, Ontario. It is noted that, as you consider this unit is a permanent fixture in the school, there is no reason why it should be included in the inventory as you do not include the heating plant or similar permanent furnishings.\n\nI understand that, prior to the passing of the Consolidated and Revenue Audit Act, your Branch furnished the Auditor General with statements of supplies on hand in the various Agencies, Schools, etc., as at March 31st. However, subsequent to the passing of the Act, Departments were required to furnish complete inventories of all Government-owned equipment, supplies and material in their possession. You will note the requirements in the Auditor General's circular letter on this subject, forwarded about November of each year, and embodied in recent years in the Deputy Minister's circular memorandum relative to inventories. The various Branches of the Department are now required to submit an inventory which includes all non-expendable Government-owned property. This might be defined as including all articles such as agricultural implements and farm machinery, automobiles and accessories, transport equipment (including wagons, horses, boats, outboard motors), camp equipment (bedding, cots, tents, tarpaulins) surveying and drafting instruments, tools and fire-fighting etc., equipment and under miscellaneous - trunks, travelling accessories, office appliances such as typewriters, adding machines, etc.\n\nThe items to be included in the inventory might be classified as those which may be used continuously and which do not enter into the construction of some structure, etc.; articles of food which are consumed soon after purchase; and lumber, hardware, etc., which are used in the construction of a building or other structure, would not come within the category of non-expendable property. Articles of comparatively small value, the length of service of which is usually short and which require replacement frequently are termed 'expendable' property.\nBy referring to the Auditor General's letter of August 28th, 1932, 'non-expendable' property was generally outlined. In the Deputy Minister's circular memorandum of December 6th, 1936, furniture, etc., supplied by the Department of Public Works need not be included in the inventory which was primarily for stores and equipment. However, where Branches had rendered this information and required it for their records, it might still be submitted.\n\nIt would, therefore, seem that such items as the Kelvinator refrigeration unit should be included in your Branch inventory. By referring to the 1938 inventory of the Residential Schools at Alert Bay, B.C., you will note that such units are now reported, so that there seems to be some lack of uniformity in the preparation of the inventories.\n\nMay I be advised please if the information contained in the Deputy Minister's circular memoranda forwarded to you annually before the close of the year respecting the inventory to be prepared at annual stocktaking, is transmitted to all Indian Agencies, Residential Schools and Hospitals. I would also ask that you advise me what steps are taken by your Inspectors to see that equipment is duly reported in the inventory submitted by the Agency, etc. Are complete physical checks, or test checks made from time to time? The return of each of the Divisions is certified to by the Head of the Division. In so doing no doubt some internal check is made by the Division to ensure that all non-expendable equipment is duly reported.\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant.\nOttawa, January 29, 1940.\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Inventory, government-owned property at Indian Residential Schools.\n\nI have for acknowledgment Mr. Jackson's memorandum of January 24, in which additional information is sought with respect to the procedure followed by this Branch in securing inventories of government property at Indian residential schools.\n\nIt is noted that in the penultimate paragraph of this memorandum the view is expressed that large refrigeration storage rooms such as the storage room at Kenora should be included in the inventory. The officials here can see no serious objection to including such equipment, provided that such is your desire. The last paragraph of the memorandum, however, seems to be based on the assumption that Indian agents and Indian inspectors are in close touch with all our Indian residential schools and consequently in a position to make a check of the equipment reported in the inventories requested by the Department from year to year. May I point out that a large number of our Indian residential schools are not now, nor have they been at any time, attached to Indian agencies and consequently do not come under the direct or even indirect supervision of Indian agents and Indian inspectors. Despite this fact, however, we are extremely anxious to have this annual inventory as satisfactory and as exact as possible. It has occurred -\noccurred to me the best ways and means of securing a worthwhile inventory might be discussed by the officials of this Branch and any officials you may care to select, at a conference called for this purpose.\n\nThe information contained in your circular memorandum relating to the taking of the annual inventory is, together with a printed form and a letter of instructions, sent out from year to year to our Indian agents, principals of residential schools and superintendents of hospitals.\n\nDirector.\n\nRAH\nSt Mary's Indian Res. School,\nKenora, Ontario.\nJanuary 24th, 1950\n\nHonourable R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa,\n\nHonourable Sir:\n\nI am sorry to have been cause of trouble to you by a lack of careful attention on my part. Hoping this inventory of the R.C. Indian Residential School, that I am returning to you with the corrections made, to be at your complete satisfaction.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\nJ. Lemire O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 29, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI regret that I am obliged to return the inventory which you recently forwarded.\n\nThe first item on the inventory is $100.00 for an automobile. If this was purchased from school funds it should not be shown on the inventory.\n\nIn several places you will notice pencil figures. These are the amounts shown on the inventory for 1938 and should be included on the inventory for 1939 unless the articles are unfit for use in which case a definite statement should be made to that effect.\n\nIn your 1938 inventory you valued the cows at $1000.00 and the horses at $400.00. You should either include the same amount in the 1939 inventory or give complete information under the heading \"Remarks\" why you have reduced the amount.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. E. W. Byers,\nPrincipal,\nCecilia Jeffrey Residential School,\nKenora, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 29, 1940.\n\nDear Father Mackey:\n\nI regret that I am obliged to return the inventory which you recently forwarded. The head office is very particular that these be correctly prepared and consequently I have no alternative but to send it back.\n\nIn three different places you will note pencil figures. These are the amounts shown last year and should be the same this year in view of the instructions contained in circular letter of November last in which you were informed that there should be no deduction for depreciation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J. P. Mackey,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 31, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Lett:\n\nI regret that I have to return the inventory which you forwarded but the officials at head office are very particular regarding this form and consequently, as will be shown in the remaining part of this letter, it is necessary that I return it to you for correction.\n\nIn preparing this form it should be kept in mind that the only items shown should be those that were purchased by the Department. Articles or furnishings or cattle or live stock purchased from school funds or from the New England Company grant should not be included on the inventory. As a consequence I have marked opposite certain items the word \"out\". This, of course, means that those particular items should be completely omitted. Under the heading \"Live Stock\" I doubt if any of this should be shown. I presume that the foundation stock was likely purchased from school funds and certainly the progeny have been a charge against the grant earned by the school and not any direct contribution made by the Department. Last year you included part of the live stock and unfortunately we did not check the matter at the time. However, I think that we should do so now and I would, therefore, suggest that instead of showing the live stock and their value you should make a statement under the heading \"Remarks\" that you inadvertently included certain of the live stock in last year's report but that due to the fact that they have been secured from school funds it is not necessary for them to be shown on the inventory. I enclose new copies of the inventory form as so many changes will be required that I thought you would like to prepare a complete new form. The other items shown on the form which you forwarded should be included on the one you are now going to prepare.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. A.R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 2, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return the inventory of the St. Cyprian C.E. Residential School for the year ended December 31, 1939.\n\nOn the inventory for 1938 you showed 45 small desks at a total valuation of $270.00. These figures were slightly changed in the 1939 inventory which I am returning as it will be necessary to have these conform exactly with the information given in the 1938 inventory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. W. Barlow,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Cyprian C.E. Residential School,\nBrocket, Alta.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 2, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return the inventory which you recently forwarded regarding Government property on hand at the Shingwauk Home. It is noted that you value the wagon at $45.00 and that in your 1938 inventory you valued this at $60.00. It will be necessary to retain the same amount on the 1939 inventory as appeared on the 1938 inventory. In this regard I would refer you to circular letter of November last in which it was stated that no depreciation should be allowed on any item of equipment or on the value of a residential school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. C. F. Hives,\nPrincipal,\nShingwauk Home,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 5, 1940.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return the enclosed inventory.\n\nIn preparing the inventory last year you valued the fire extinguishers at $100.00 and also included 1 kitchen stove at a value of $15.00. As pointed out in circular letter issued last November there should be no deduction for depreciation. Consequently the fire extinguishers and stove should be carried at the same value each year until they are of no further use. In the latter event you should forward a letter stating why any item that was included on the previous year's inventory has been omitted from the inventory which you are forwarding.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. G. Forbes, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nChristie Indian Residential School,\nKakawis, B.C.\nBIRTLE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n(PRESBYTERIAN)\nREV. E. H. LOCKHART, PRINCIPAL\n\nBIRTLE, Man., Feb 2, 1940\n\nMrs. Philip Nolan\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI received the inventory of Government property for 1939 which you referred me and your letter asking that I make changes so that this inventory will correspond with that of 1938. I am sending you the copy here of the 1938 inventory. Does it correspond with what I sent you?\n\nMy 1939 inventory I see differs in one valuation which is not conventional. It is valued at horse stable which in my 1938 report I placed at $50.00 and in Sep 1939 at $300.00.\n\nThen in my 1939 inventory there is added a slaughter hog valued at $60.00. This building was erected about three years ago and I did not report it before, as it was all built by Special Government Grant. I decided at last to report it as Government property as it is a fixture on the land.\n\nI see there is another difference. In my 1938 inventory I omitted the old Government pond implement which is most appropriately called the \"Old and Humper Mill.\" When I am going again I shall endeavor to comply with your requests.\n\nYours very truly & Lockhart\nOttawa,\nFebruary 9, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant forwarding copy of your 1938 inventory I may say that we have a copy of this on file but we did not keep a copy of the 1939 inventory. Consequently we are unable to compare it with your 1938 inventory. I feel certain that if you make the changes mentioned in your letter of the 2nd instant your inventory will be correct.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. E. H. Lockhart,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBirtle, Man.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 9, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI regret that it is found necessary to return the inventory which you forwarded for the year 1939. In several places this inventory differs from your 1938 inventory and as you were informed in circular letter of November last no allowance should be made for depreciation. Consequently any article placed on the inventory should be shown on subsequent inventories until of no further value. I have placed pencil figures in several placed on your 1939 inventory in order to make it compare with your 1938 inventory. It would be appreciated if you would revise the 1939 inventory accordingly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. E.

You will notice several pencil entries on the attached form. These refer to articles which you mentioned last year but do not include this year. If these articles are still in use they should be shown on the inventory and valued at the same price as last year. If they are not in use you should so state on the inventory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. P. J.

MICHAEL'S SCHOOL\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDecember 14, 1940.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your 150-50 of December 5, with returned Inventory forms for this School.\n\nI would refer you to Paragraph 5 of circular letter dated November 15, 1939, in which I was informed that:\n\n\"Property values once established should be maintained unchanged in the inventory from year to year until such property is finally disposed of.\"\n\n(1) In dealing with the items referred to in your letter, I would advise as follows:\n\nCooling and gas tanks - One tank was finally disposed of by collapse during the year, and the inventory value of the remaining two was shown in the form submitted. The tank omitted from the inventory has been entirely removed from the School, and is no longer part of Government property therein.\n\n(2) Ovens, Bakery - The bake oven at the School collapsed during the year and was finally disposed of by removal to the School dump. Not being of further use, the item was removed from the inventory.\n\n(3) Tools and Manual Training Supplies - The Department purchased for the Manual Training account $300.00 worth of supplies, and during the same period $500.00 worth were used in tuition. The items finally disposed of were deleted from the inventory, and the equipment as noted, provided by the Department during the year were included in the inventory.\n\n(4) During the year, twenty-five old beds passed beyond any usefulness whatsoever, and were removed to the School dump as finally disposed of. Their value was deleted from the inventory, as they no longer form part of the property of the Government therein.\nThe Secretary\n\nDecember 14, 1940.\n\nI am utterly at a loss to know how these inventories are to be filled out in articles finally disposed of by use or otherwise, are still to be included therein, and if purchases made by the Government for the School are not to be added to the inventories each year. It would seem to me that if equipment completely useless and finally disposed of is to be retained on the School inventory, and vice versa, new equipment purchased by the Government is not to be included, the inventory cannot possibly show a true picture of Government property at the School.\n\nCareful record is kept within the School of all new equipment purchased by the Department, and of all equipment destroyed and finally disposed of for purposes of this particular inventory. If such is not required, and the Department do not wish new equipment added to the inventory or equipment finally disposed of deducted therefrom, I would appreciate hearing from you further.\n\nI cannot conscientiously sign any inventory that does not represent the property of the Government in use, as stated above.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\n\nFEA:MP\nENG.\nFort Alexander Indian Residential School,\nPine Falls P.O., Man.\n\nDecember 7th 1940.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe 150-50.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 2nd inst., concerning deductions made in the inventory, and to submit the following explanation for the three items thus concerned.\n\nEngine, gas. 1 Engine deducted, $500.00.\nThis engine became completely ruined, so much so that, in order to be able to pump and produce light, we had to buy 1 10 H.P. Diesel Lister Engine at our own expense.\nThe engine pieces have been exchanged in payment for freight as common cast iron.\nThe old engine was presumed to have been bought by the Dep.\n\nSewing Machines. 4 Machines deducted $50.00.\nThese four old machines had been hard to run for some time already and they have become worn out.\n\nTeam of horses, 1. $235.00. Deducted.\nThis team had become of poor service on account of broken wind and we found unexpectedly a good bargain to exchange them for better horses, young, sturdy and well trained.\n\nEnclosed please find the inventory copies.\n\nThe other items are maintained as before.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev.

You know that in 1939, I bought a new Diesel plant to replace the old Delco which was absolutely worn out, and I spent $1759.00. I asked even to Mr. R.A. Hoey for help to pay for and I obtained $500.00. The old Delco was not suitable for use and I could not sell it, only for repair parts. The batteries were sold just for the cells and their amount deducted from the cost of the new ones. So, I have no more this old Delco and the batteries, and I think that I had permission to get rid of these, because the Department allowed a grant toward the cost of the new one. What I can do on the 1940 inventory is to show this amount of $500.00 given by the Department, but as part only of the new Diesel.\n\nAs to the cows that not figure on the 1940 inventory, I have to say that these 4 cows, given by the Department 10 years ago cannot live up to the last judgment judgement, and I imagine that I do not need any permission to slaughter cows that are 15 years of age. You could tell me that these cows had calves, but I say that the bull was not supplied by the Department but by the school.\n\nBefore making any correction to my 1940 inventory, I will wait for your reply.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. Joseph Angin,\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nAdvice is hereby given that the following articles, on Government inventory at this School, have during 1940 become useless and have been removed to the school dump:\n\n1.

This study has convinced me that the teachers in charge of our institutions have rendered, and are still rendering, conscientious and devoted service. Missionary zeal and the spirit of self-sacrifice have been very much in evidence.\n\nI can state that the reorganization of the Department does not necessarily mean a drastic change in educational policy. If changes are found to be necessary from time to time, these changes will be worked out in cooperation with representatives of the churches and with their approval.\n\nMy personal opinion is that in our educational programme provision should be made for a course of study that would enable the pupils to spend at least one third of their time at manual training or vocational instruction. The general public have an impression that the instruction given in our Indian schools is altogether too abstract and academic. They feel that there should be a more direct relationship between this instruction and the tasks that confront the pupil after his departure from school. This criticism, I feel, applies with equal force to the instruction provided for our white children throughout the Dominion.\n\nI am deeply interested, also, in a \"follow-up System\". I mean by this a systematic method of supplying the Department, from year to year, with information that will enable us to know exactly what becomes of our pupils after they leave school. This work should be undertaken at once by the principals of our residential schools and by the teachers in charge of our day schools. We shall welcome any suggestions as to how this work can be simply and effectively accomplished.\n\nI have been placed in my present position to help and encourage you. I am anxious to do this, in cooperation with the officials here, to the best of my ability. I want you to feel perfectly free to communicate with me at any time. I feel confident our relationships are going to be cordial and helpful throughout the period that may lie ahead of us.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nHon. P. A. Hoey\nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI thank you for the kind and encouraging message you have sent to me. It's a great comfort for a principal to know that he will be listened to with a sympathetic understanding.\n\nIn regard to the manual training you mention in your letter, I am anxious to give it as much and as early as I can. The smallest boys receive it and those in grades 6, 7, 8 are half-day workers i.e., that half the day is spent in class and half in manual work. This is further regulated by the rule that they go to class in the morning and then go to class in the afternoon. They are trained...\nin farming, pottery, carpentry work, shoe making, tailoring, kitchen work and the mechanical work connected with running the light and water system of the schools.\n\nIn order to meet with your desire of a \"Follow-up System\", I shall keep a record of our ex-pupils' occupations. Unfortunately our ex-pupils have still to face the problem of unemployment.\n\nI am most anxious to cooperate with the Department in the good work done for the Indians in our country.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nRev. Paul Merg s.s.\nOttawa, January 22, 1937.\n\nDear Father Mary:\n\nI desire to thank you for your letter of the 20th instant and for the information contained therein. I was particularly pleased to learn that you had already made ample provision for manual training at your institution. It is my hope that this instruction will show gratifying results from year to year. I want to assure you also, reverend sir, that you have given us that you will keep in touch with the graduates of your school and supply us with information, from year to year, in respect to the progress they may be making.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.

I am particularly interested in your paragraph on the need for more Manual Training. I have advocated this for several years as the reports sent by myself and the Public School Inspector will show. I do most heartily welcome your remarks along this line. I shall be glad to do all in my power to aid you in your effort to improve the School System. Our own school as you doubtless have learned from the reports is run on what is known as the Half day system. We have the pupils in the class room for one half of each school day and employ them at the work of the school and surroundings for the other half. We would welcome a chance to add more Manual Training to our Curriculum. To do this we shall require more room. I have asked repeatedly for this but so far it has not been furnished.\n\nMay I suggest, you come and see us, and our conditions at your earliest opportunity, you will then see what we need and we can confer on the best ways to obtain the desired improvements.\n\nI shall welcome a visit more than anything. I do hope the way may open for you to come and see us. I regret I was absent last summer when Dr Magill came to our school.\n\nHoping to see you soon and have a chance to talk things over with you I am yours very sincerely\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, January 28, 1937.\n\nDear Canon Vale:\n\nI want to thank you very heartily for your prompt reply to my letter of the 16th instant.\n\nI note, with interest, your suggestion that I visit and inspect your schools. I may state, in reply, that it is my intention to visit a number of the schools in the province of Ontario, just as soon as I can conveniently do so. I am not at all sure, however, in view of my duties here, that I shall be able to pay you a visit in the immediate future. I have just been informed, however, that Mr. B. Christiansen, our General Superintendent of Agencies, will visit Chapleau in the course of a week or two. When you meet Mr. Christiansen, I wish you would discuss with him the matter of additional accommodation and any other matters relating to the welfare of your institution that you may have in mind. It is my intention to discuss the situation with Mr. Christiansen immediately following his return.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Neely,\nSept. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Canon A. J. Vale,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nChapleau, Ont.\nGordon's Anglican Indian Residential School\nPunnichy, Saskatchewan\n\nPRINCIPAL\nR. W. PRAYLING\n\nReply: Letter 150-60\nJan. 15/37.\n\nPUNNICHY, SASK.\u2014Jan. 25th 1937\u2014\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.\nSup't. of Welfare and Training\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMy appreciation of the circular letter of above date and number, and your mention in the last paragraph of your desire for freedom and confidence, prompts me to remark on one or two of the suggestions (if they have not gone beyond that stage).\n\nDoes it imply that the Manual or Vocational instruction would be given at each I.R. Boarding School or at some centralized location after the child reaches the age eligible to leave school viz. 16 years? That something of this nature should be given has always been uppermost in my thought. After leaving School as at present the child is at a great disadvantage, can only and does revert to little better than their predecessors.\n\nRe Follow-Up-System: I consider this most essential, though not from the School, but from someone else, say perhaps the Agent through the Farm Instructor, so long as they live on the Reserve. As for instance, there are children here from Fort a-La Corne, Pelly etc. 100 to 170 miles from here which I am never in touch with after leaving School. Tho' I always ask them on leaving to write me and let me know how they are getting along, invariably giving a stamped addressed envelope for that purpose but rarely getting a reply. Proving that it would be most difficult for the Principal of a School to get this much desired and needed information and advice, whereas the Farm Instructor is in touch with them throughout the year, I imagine.\nMr. R. A. Hoey  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nPrior to the elevation of His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land, many of our conversations were on the same subject, \"What can be recommended for the betterment of our Indians.\" Then came the hard times, leaving things at a stand-still. His Grace was, and I am sure, still very anxious that our Indians should be helped in some manner to make better progress and eventually become good citizens.\n\nIn conclusion, I trust you will not think me presuming, but being interested in the future of the Pupils that pass through this School is the sole motive. It is possible that a Principal in some School may be helpful in solving this problem, if he were not thought to be exceeding his authority, or interfering in a matter outside of the school duties.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nGordon's School.\nFrom Annual Report of the Secretary of the Interior, Washington, for fiscal year ended June 30, 1894.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nIntegration with community life - During the past year a strong effort has been made to integrate Indian education more deeply with the actual living experiences and the environment of Indian children. With increased emphasis on community life, the school is becoming more and more the focal point for community interests and activities. No longer are classes held for the school children alone. The basic new is that of a parent-child cooperative program.\n\nThe school or community shop is becoming a popular place for the men to repair their tools; men and women come in to the school to sew, to bathe and wash their hair and clothes, for help on house problems, to attend clinics, and, in some cases, at night to learn to read and write. Nursery schools have been established in a number of the older boarding schools. Child care is part of every older girl's training.\n\nParents contribute a wealth of information on spinning, weaving, and dyeing materials, in curing foods, and in making pottery, basketry, and leather goods, in conjunction with the general curriculum which is being encouraged in all of the Indian schools and communities. An increased effort is being made to preserve the rich contribution which Indian arts and crafts have to make to the culture of future generations.\n\nOne concrete example of community interest is the Red Lake day school, near Leupp, Ariz., where a group of several Indian families, interested in home gardens, built and paid for an irrigation dam, by means of which\nan ample food supply was provided for their school and community.\n\nThis changed emphasis on the interrelationship of school and community life is true not only of the day school but of many of the boarding schools as well. Greater emphasis is being placed on more practical work, such as special agricultural and home-making courses. At one school, 3-week short courses were provided throughout the year for mothers and girls in outlying communities. School and home gardens have been made by children and teachers. School hothouses and hotbeds provide tomatoes, cabbage, beets, and flower plants for the homes. Factory classes and part of many homemaking courses and furnishing increasingly is taught in the homes from which pupils come. The furniture and furnishings are simple, but of a practical and durable type that can be made and paid for by an energetic homemaker.\nOttawa, January 28, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Freyling:\n\nPlease accept my most sincere thanks for your letter of the 25th instant and for the suggestions contained therein.\n\nI may state, by way of comment, that one or two thoughts I expressed in my letter of the 15th instant were submitted wholly by way of suggestion and designed to obtain from the Principals and Teachers in charge of our schools any views they might have in mind in respect to changes that should be made in educational policy.\n\nThe suggestion you make, in respect to the promotion of manual or vocational instruction, is pretty much in accord with my own views on the matter. It is my hope that, some day, the Department will be in a position to establish senior vocational schools and in this way prepare our Indian boys and girls for the tasks that lie ahead of them in life. In view of the economic depression in which we find ourselves, however, it is not at all likely that we can make provision for the establishment of such schools at any time in the immediate future. The demands for more liberal relief allowances and for additional health services are steadily multiplying. I am convinced, however, that, in the meantime, our residential schools can make a\n\nR. W. Freyling, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nGordon's Indian Residential School,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nreal contribution by making provision for manual training, even in the junior grades. I have in mind carpentry work, blacksmithing, auto mechanics, shoe repairing, and, in the case of girls, house work, dress making, crochet work and, in fact, anything that will contribute to the development of certain schools.\n\nAt the moment, I am interested most of all in the cultivation and care of gardens. I have been simply amazed, since I entered the Department, at the inability of our Indian population to grow sufficient vegetables to maintain themselves even in the summer months. I am not medical man but I am inclined to think there is a vital and direct relationship between this failure on the part of the Indian to grow and consume vegetables and his very unsatisfactory physical condition.\n\nIt is not my intention, of course, that you should attempt the impossible; but I have long since reached the conclusion that it is just a waste of time and effort to provide academic instruction for the average pupil who has no mental aptitude for such study. This applies to our Indian pupils, and it applies with equal force to the white pupils in attendance at our public schools.\n\nI note, with interest, your comments on the \"follow-up system\". Your suggestion, that we obtain the cooperation of our agents and farm instructors, is one that I shall be glad to follow up. Is it your present practice to send to the Agents a list of the senior boys and girls who leave your school from year to year? It seems to me that, if a list such as this were sent, with comments on certain pupils who may require additional supervision and care, it would be well worth while. A suggestion has been made that a placement officer be employed and put in charge of this work, and this suggestion is now under consideration.\n\nI am enclosing, for your information, an\nExcerpt taken from the last annual report of the Secretary of the Interior, Washington. I am enclosing this with the hope that you will find it interesting and perhaps suggestive.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nYour letter of Jan 15th, addressed to Rev. Father McGrath reached our school yesterday and as the new Principal, it is my pleasure to acknowledge its reception and to assure you of my hearty co-operation in your work on behalf of the Indian children in our schools.\n\nIt will be three weeks tomorrow since I took charge of the school here and this is my first experience in this line of work. It will therefore take a little while before I get a thorough grasp of the conditions and needs of the School.\n\nI was discussing your letter with Mr. Moore the Indian Agent and he explained to me that the problem of vocational and manual instruction is more difficult here than in most of the schools. The parents of many, if not most, of our children are engaged in trapping and much of the farm work which the boys learn at the school will not be used.\n\nThis is true also of the girls. They will go back to their camps, where there are no cows, no poultry and therefore no question of butter-making etc., of course the training in cooking, sewing, mending etc will be invaluable to them and they receive very thorough training common to these subjects.\n\nThe Sister Superior has already called my attention to one problem which is a constant source of worry. The baking is done at the school. Bread is made five times a week, at each baking 200 lbs of flour are used. This is apparently a large quantity of dough and although mixed by hand with a stick, this is such heavy work that the boys and girls are obliged to take turns and even at that I am told that it is too heavy for them. Using the boys for this work has many inconveniences. We only have about twelve boys who are physically able to do this work. They are needed for the chores connected with the farm. There is the inconvenience of bringing the boys into the part of the school reserved for the girls and there is also the disadvantage of compelling the boys to do work which they think is fit only for women and work which...\nLejac Indian Residential School\n\nUnder Direction of The Oblate Fathers\n\nLEJAC, B.C.\n\nthey will never have occasion to do later on. I was told on my arrival at the school that this is one of their most urgent and difficult problems. The remedy suggested was that the work be done by means of an electrical dough mixer. I at once made enquiries about the possible cost. The result was not very encouraging. I found that there were two firms in Winnipeg handling these dough mixers but the cost is quite high........ $400.00.\n\nI mention these things because in the course of conversation with Mr. Moore, we decided that you would be in a position to tell us what is done to meet this problem in other schools and what remedy you would suggest. If we could get rid of this druggery it would save a lot of time and energy for other work and help the discipline of the School.\n\nI am going to follow out your suggestion with regard to the \"follow up\" system and hope in the very near future to be able to give you a report on the subject. The information will have to be second-hand since I do not know the students who have gone through the school in recent years.\n\nAs far as the boys are concerned we are very fortunate in having a very able carpenter in charge of the manual training and the work done and learned is of a very practical character. Apart from that the boys pick up what they can round the farm. No doubt even here with our special problem there is room for improvement and I shall be only too glad to try out any suggestions that you may make from time to time.\n\nPossibly you may have an opportunity before very long visiting the Schools. This will be the most satisfactory way of learning our problem and suggesting the remedies.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nRev. W. Byrne-Grant, O.M.I.\n\nPrincipal.\nAfternoon,\n\nInt.

I am also\nof the opinion, and have been for some considerable time, that some\nprovision should be made in our educational programme for greater\nscope in vocational training, particularly as it applies to the boys,\nthere is little doubt that the majority of the Girls in our Resident-\nial Schools get a thorough training in domestic science though some-\ntimes this is carried out on a large or \"Institutional\" scale and much\nof the benefits to be derived from such training is then lost, it has\nbeen our policy for the past number of years to have the girls carry\nout part of their training in the Kitchen and under the supervision\nof a member of Staff prepare meals, mix and bake bread etc in small\nquantities such as would be used by the average family say of from\ntwo to five, this has been a great help to the girls when they have\ngraduated and returned to the Reserves.\n\nI am also of the opinion that the academic training of the\nIndian child in our Schools needs to be revised, there is much in the\nCurriculum as carried out to-day that can very well be eliminated\ninsofar as it applies to the Indian Schools, an elementary education\nproperly administered, the children thoroughly grounded in these\nelementary subjects so that they may go back to the Reserves and\ncarry on all that is required, I cannot convince myself that the\naverage Indian Boy or Girl is ready to enter the competitive labour\nmarket just yet, there are the odd ones of course who have the ability\nto prepare themselves and to make the most of the opportunities\ngiven them to go out and make their way in the world, but my experi-\nence is that the average Indian Boy or Girl will gravitate to the\nReserves when they leave the Schools no matter how well they have\nbeen trained, this is the reason why I am not in favour of an extended\nacademic training unless facilities were provided whereby students\nwould be prepared to meet and to do the tasks which will face them\nwhen they return to the Reserves we will be meeting a long felt\nwant, in this Indian question, in this connection we have made a\nstart here and at the present time the older boys are learning\nsimple carpentry with tools such as they would be in a position to\npurchase if living on the Reserve, it is planned that they will\nalso be divided into classes during the Spring & Summer months to\ntake up the study of Farm Mechanics, Animal Husbandry etc., I do not\nthink we should revert to the old type of Industrial School and\nattempt to train the boys as Carpenters, Blacksmiths etc with the\nidea that they will be trained to compete in the open labour market,\nit has, I think, been definitely proved that they have not those\nqualities of \"stick-to-it-timeliness\" and are soon discouraged, but\nrather we should aim to prepare them to meet those ordinary emergen-\ncies encountered daily by the ordinary working man.\nRegarding the \"Follow-up system\" your plan could I think be followed with the co-operation of the Indian Agency staff and the Staffs of the Schools, in our case, we have several children attending this School who come from Agencies rather remote from the School, such as The Pelly Agency at Kamsack, The Qu'Appelle Agency at Moose Jaw, the Carlton Agency at Leask and The Duck Lake Agency at Duck Lake, it would be somewhat difficult for the Principal of this School to give accurate reports of his ex-pupils living on these Agencies but with the co-operation of the various staffs on these Agencies who are, or should be, thoroughly conversant with the ex-pupil the Department could have information which would keep them up-to-date, as far as the File Hills Agency is concerned I could obtain the information without a great deal of difficulty, in this respect I will appreciate it if you will advise me how far back you wish these reports to extend, the Pupils who have graduated in the past five or six years have had some very difficult times to contend with as you having lived in the West are fully aware, the Indian has been no exception and with the necessary curtailment of finances the younger people in many cases have found it impossible to even get a start, however if you will give me some idea of the period you wish to have covered I will endeavour to supply the necessary information.\n\nIf you are in the vicinity of File Hills at any time in the future I shall be pleased to have you visit us and become personally acquainted with us and with our work here, I feel that relationships are more closely cemented with the handgrip of friendship and a discussion of the problems one is meeting with.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nLEBRET SASK\nIndian School\nJanuary 26th 1937\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe- Yours 150-60 January 15th -\n\nI beg to advise you that in answer to your letter mentioned hereby, I do not find any better suggestion than the ones pointed out in a kind of survey made by my own brother, the Rev. F. GUY DE BRETAGNE, O.M.I.\n\nAs you will notice yourself by the remarks of this Missionary the facts mentioned in the same report are concerning especially the Reserves closely situated to the Lebret School.\n\nMy Superiors have appointed me only lately to my present situation but I have mostly worked in Manitoba for many years, where I have visited many Reserves and do perfectly know their material progress. The sources of revenue were different, of course, for the people living around the Manitoba and Winnipegosis Lakes (that I thoroughly know) and this fact is calling another adaptation to the solution of the problem presented by your solicitude to the welfare of our Indians.\n\nIn the Rainy River district, where I was Principal at Fort Frances, the problem has other presentations in each Reservation.\n\nBut all this is only a question of adaptation and the actual great need is the System you are looking for and we hope will come after your research will be completed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. M de Bretagne O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\n\nR.A. HOEY\nSupr. of Welfare and Training\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nWe, who have spent our lives among the Indians, realize that, while something has been accomplished to train and educate them, a great deal has yet to be done. We are also aware of the fact that real educational work among the Indians is of recent institution and that we cannot expect to transform the Indian nation from a state of semi-barbarism into full civilisation within the short period that we have been working for and among them.\n\nHaving all this in mind, your letter came to me as a pleasant surprise and also as an encouragement of a high order, for now, myself and my co-workers, are assured of heartfelt cooperation, something which has been, in the past, rather sadly lacking.\n\nWishing you the very best of success in your new field of endeavor, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.E. Baillargeon O.M.I.\nPrincipal\n\nST. MARY'S INDIAN SCHOOL\nKENORA, ONTARIO\nKenora, Ont.\nJanuary 25, 1937,\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada,\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI take great pleasure in acknowledging your circular letter of the 15th instant addressed to all the principals of Indian Residential Schools.\n\nMay I be permitted to say that I greatly appreciate its very sympathetic tone. It does look as if we were last to have in the Department a man who will appreciate the work done by Indian missionaries and teachers regardless of their religious affiliation and who can acknowledge that the work of these same missionaries and teachers has been one replete with a great deal of devotedness and a vast amount of self sacrifice. Speaking for all my co-workers in this field I can say without fear of contradiction that their motives have always been of the highest order and that they have always sought in the first place and foremost the welfare of their charges.\n\nTheir work has not always been appreciated, the results obtained have often been criticised by those who know nothing or very little about the Indians, who never had sufficient moral courage to devote their lives to their welfare and who have too often classed Indian missionaries among the simple of this world, who though well intentioned, can only be classed among the poorly equipped intellectually.\nOttawa, February 2, 1937.\n\nDear Father Byrne-Grant:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo and to state, by way of comment, that I appreciate very fully your prompt and courteous reply to my circular letter of January 16th.\n\nThe circular was sent out wholly by way of suggestion and designed, primarily, to establish a more intimate contact between the Schools Branch and the teachers in charge of our schools. It is not my intention, of course, that you should attempt the impossible, but I do feel that our schools must move steadily in the direction of more vocational instruction. The needs of our Indian population demand this, and I feel confident that the response on the part of our school principals will be very encouraging. I was particularly pleased to note that you have a capable carpenter in charge of manual training. Carpentry work is well worth while and should be encouraged, even though this may mean less time devoted to the ordinary academic studies.\n\nI have been interested in your reference to the need for a dough mixing machine in your institution. I am personally opposed to the installation of power machinery in our residential schools.\n\nRev. W. Byrne-Grant, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nLojaj Indian Residential School,\nL e j a e, B. C.\nschools, except in cases where the need is very urgent. I have asked Mr. Phelan to look up what the approximate cost of a hand operated dough mixing machine would be. If the cost of this machine is at all reasonable, I can see no reason why you should not have one installed.\n\nMany thanks for your invitation to visit British Columbia and inspect your school. I shall certainly embrace the first opportunity that comes to me to do so, although it is not at all likely that I shall be able to do so at any time during the year lying immediately ahead of us.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Heay,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, February 2, 1937.\n\nDear Miss Forbes:\n\nPlease accept my thanks for your letter of the 29th ultimo and for the information contained therein. I was particularly pleased to learn that you are making provision for manual instruction at your school and that you had already discussed the subject with your Inspector. Knitting and sewing are both well worthy of encouragement. Should you desire materials to enable you to proceed with this work, please take up the matter with the Indian Agent, either personally or by letter, and have him obtain the necessary authorization from the Department for these supplies.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss Jennie Forbes,\nTeacher,\nIndian Day School,\nApt. 2, N. S.\nOttawa, February 3, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Rhodes:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo and to state, by way of comment, that I appreciate very fully indeed your courteous and prompt reply to my circular of January 15th.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that the views you express in respect to educational policy are wholly in accord with my own views. I have not had an opportunity, of course, to make an extensive study of the subject, but I do feel that the policies you express are very much in accord with the needs of our Indian population. My personal opinion is that each residential school should be almost wholly autonomous in so far as educational policy and the arrangement of a curriculum are concerned. I make this comment because the needs of our Indian people are in no sense uniform throughout the Dominion, nor are they uniform even considered in a provincial sense. It is not at all likely, however, that I shall be permitted to suggest anything quite so radical in my attempts to change the policy now in force. I do feel, though, that we must move steadily in this direction.\n\nI had nothing very definite in mind when I suggested the necessity for a \"follow up system\", other than the desire to obtain information in respect to our pupils during the years immediately following their departure from school. I am interested,\n\n- particularly\n\nF. Rhodes, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nFile Hills Residential School,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nparticularly, in the pupils who leave our residential schools from now on. I have no desire to put the Principals of our schools to the trouble of going back and obtaining information in respect to the pupils that have graduated from year to year until now. I am inclined to think, from one or two suggestions that have reached me, that a fairly effective system might be worked out between the Principals on the one hand and our Indian Agents on the other. The Agents might be supplied with a list of those graduating from the schools at the end of each school year, with the request that they report back to the Principal on the progress, if any, made by these pupils on the reserves or at other work. The Principal could then add to this information any facts he himself might have and forward the information to the Department. I feel that you might perhaps start off in some such way as this, in an attempt to obtain the information I have in mind.\n\nMany thanks for your invitation to visit File Hills. I shall certainly embrace the first opportunity that comes to me to do so, although it is not likely that I will be in a position to do so at any time during the year lying immediately ahead of us.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.

Neely,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, February 3, 1937.\n\nDear Father de Bretagne:\n\nPlease accept my most sincere thanks for your letter of the 26th ultimo and also the memorandum attached thereto.\n\nI simply desired, in this letter, to assure you that the suggestions contained in this memorandum have been given very careful consideration.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nPermit me to offer my thanks for the interest you have shown in the pupils of the Indian schools, as well as in the work of the school teachers. The progress and the well-being that you were trying to create in our school is very commendable.\n\nI take great pleasure in collaborating with you to this end by bringing to your attention the obstacles which I know from personal experience to be opposed to the best interest of the school children.\n\nThe ideal would consist in keeping the sexes apart to this end that the boys might receive an education which would prepare them for college, and, on the other hand, the girls might be taught to become especially good housekeepers.\n\nNow for us, at Indian Lorette, the realization of this ideal is impossible for the following reasons: Firstly, the school is too small; Secondly, the grades are much too numerous.\n\nWe have only two classrooms for six grades. It is practically impossible to educate the children when there are 35 of them of three different grades living for six hours a day in classrooms 24'x26'. That is why we have asked our Agent, Mr. Maurice Bastien, to request that you make provisions for the enlargement of the school, in order that we may have at least another classroom. Mr. Armstrong judged this enlargement to be very necessary during his visit here, last October.\nTherefore, we ask you to kindly see to this matter, if you are really interested in the good education of these children, and we are sure that you will take the necessary measures to have this enlargement made.\n\nThirdly, a school library would be a great help for the education of the children.\n\nAs we only teach English for an hour a day, these books would have to be bilingual in order to make up for the little time we can give to each grade.\n\nWe hope you will understand this and grant our request. We will be glad to furnish you with any other information on request.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) Sr. Ste-Aim\u00e9e du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur,\nIndian Lorette, Que.\nOttawa, February 5, 1937.\n\nReverend Sister:\n\nI appreciate very fully your prompt and courteous reply to my circular of the 16th ultimo.\n\nYou are aware, of course, that in this period of economic depression the money at our disposal is decidedly limited and the demands for relief amongst the members of our Indian population seem to be steadily increasing. I can assure you, however, that the request you make for additional accommodation will be given careful and sympathetic consideration, just as soon as the appropriations at our disposal enable us to consider such extensions.\n\nYou might, at your convenience, select a number of suitable homes giving the names of the publishers, to the amount of, say, $10.00.

The Parents all too eager for them to leave the School, the father becomes less energetic than ever, sends the boy out to cut hay or wood (at present practically the only source of income) soon the lad is back to the old state of life and becomes satisfied. There is no further aim, because he has never had the opportunity to reach out for something fresh or more appealing.\n\n(2) My idea is something of this nature:\nThat a piece of land be set apart for a given number of boys as they leave School - on each Reserve or Agency - purchase of Horses, Cows, Brood Sows and Equipment. Every Boy to take part in Raising Stock, the Breaking up and Conditioning of the land, Seeding, Harvesting etc. etc. The land to be cropped with various grains, grasses and roots, marketed and the monies kept in trust.\n\nThis outlay for equipment, seed etc. could be repaid under similar conditions such as the Hudson's Bay or C. P. R. (not the land) or interest only paid, from the Crops and increasing Stock after the first year or two, and as the Boys leave to take up land for\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nthemselves, the surplus \u2014 apportioned \u2014 would help toward the purchase of their own equipment.\n\nBuildings needed for the accommodation of living would be kept clean and in good order by the Boys, (they being taught this in the School), so be erected near the Farm Instructor for Supervision and restriction of visitors. The Barns etc., to be built from logs cut from the nearby woods, by these boys; teaching them how to set about such work for themselves later. This breaking up and cultivation would also make the land a greater asset to the Department, whilst proving to the older Indians what can be accomplished by a little perseverance \u2014 with a possible inducement to improve their own conditions.\n\nTrades could be taught; among those most needful \u2014 Wheelwright and Blacksmithing \u2014 Harness Making; Repairs for implements, wagons, sleighs, harness etc. are daily needs. Repayment for such work being made by the trading of pickets, wood, hay, etc. which would be allowed to accumulate in shipping quantities and for which there is always a ready demand.\n\nThere are many callings that could be named, but until there is a far greater advancement from the old regime than at present shown, it would be waste of money to venture on same. So that there seems little outlet other than those I have mentioned, which are both needful and beneficial.\n\nTo equip the boys leaving School with horses, harness, wagons etc. would be useless to 90%, as the great majority of the Indians will not provide for Winter care, and as in the past, turn the horses out to shift for themselves and die from exposure and lack of food. This I feel sure can be verified by figures you will have on file, by taking the number of Families, and what each family has in the way of Live Stock \u2014 Horses etc. and until they realize the value of these animals the provision for same would be ruinous.\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nTrapping doubtless could be successful if conserved for a period, and the pelts shipped or sold by a responsible representative of the Department as in the case of the Grain at present.\n\nIndian lumber camps under trained Supervision could be lucrative in time.\n\nMy endeavour is to try to suggest something that seems useful and practical. If there is any part in it that may lead to a further thought of someone else, I should feel gratified by this small contribution. As to the future of the Girls it is far more difficult than the Boys, more especially through the lack of interest by those who have given them a short trial when positions have been procured for them.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nGordon's School.\nGORDON'S SCHOOL.\nJAN. 23/57.\n\n( January - February )\nBOY'S CHORE LIST.

Hoey, Esq.\nSup't. of Welfare & Training\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI thank you very much for considering the suggestions of mine regarding a more useful future for our Indian Children.\n\nPrior to receiving your letter dated the 29th of January, I had just finished an outline of what could be considered in this nature, without a very great expenditure and am attaching same to this reply.\n\nThis School, for instance, has not an employee who could give the elementary tuition for any trade, or room for the accommodation of an extra help in residence and we are situated 7 miles from a town.\n\nThe Girls are now taught General House Work, Bread making by hand, Cooking, Sewing - in the School Sewing Room, Cutting out and making Garments, as well as by the Officers of the School's Junior W. A. in which there are 35 girl members.\n\nGardening - preparation of Soil for Seeding, Cultivating etc. is in full swing by the Boys, from seeding time to the gathering in of same - equally so in the grain and root fields. Few Gardens are seen on Reserves, either Flower or Vegetable.\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am attaching a monthly chore list - it may be interesting - which conveys the daily work of the Boys; the inside work includes making beds, cleaning the Dormitories, Wash Rooms, polishing floors etc. etc.\n\nRe \"Follow Up System\" - All Children on leaving School are entered on a Department Discharge Sheet. Two are sent to the Indian Agent for approval, one of which is for the Department in Ottawa, the other for the Agent's Office files. No child leaves this School (when eligible) unless turned over to the parent or guardian, which then ends the responsibility of the Principal, as at present standing.\n\nRe \"Washington Report\" - Conditions in the U.S. are so totally different that comparison is impossible, though to know what is being accomplished is most praiseworthy and interesting. May I further suggest that firstly our Canadian Indians be brought into line with the object, or better still be compelled to live under a more healthy condition with improved surroundings, which would eventually lead them up to the standards of their U.S. brothers.\n\nConcluding with the reminder that these expressions are my own, and in no way intended to be adverse to any other suggestions, only hoping that something may come of it.\n\nAppreciating this opportunity of rendering my ideas on this question,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal,\nGordon's School.\nNipigon, Ont.\nFeb. 1, 1937\n\nP. H. Harvey\nDept. of Welfare & Training\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn replying to your letter of January 25th I may state that I am deeply interested in any new system suggested for the teaching of the Indian children.\n\nAlthough I have been engaged in teaching for several years, this is my first year teaching Indian children, and so far I have found that they like very much to do handicrafts of any kind. I always devote a certain amount of time each week to that work such as making baskets, paper dolls, flannel weaving etc. Besides for the girls I have recently organized...\na sewing club and they are doing splendid work for beginners. I would welcome any suggestions of any kind, especially for the boys. I shall be pleased to hear from you at any time.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nMary MacLeod\nTHE MOUNT ELGIN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nTHE UNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nMUNCEY - ONTARIO\n\nREV. O.B. STRAPP, PRINCIPAL\n\nMr. R.A. Hey,\nFebry. 3rd, 1937.\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nOttawa.\nOnt.\n\nISO-60 January 15th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your communication of the above date and file. In reply may I first assure you of our earnest desire to co-operate to the fullest extent with yourself and the members of your staff in providing and carrying out an adequate program of education for our pupils.\n\nI have read your letter carefully and beg to offer the following suggestions:\n\n1. Visits should be made at intervals by a member of your staff for the purpose of inspecting the residential school and discussing matters affecting the discipline and general atmosphere of the school, also possible improvements in methods and administration.\n\n2. Regional conferences of principals should be called at five year intervals for the purpose of discussing programs and methods. The meetings could be held at the residential schools in rotation during the pupils' vacation periods and the expenses of the principals not cut off their own school's budget.\n\n3. Provision should be made for removing pupils from the public school classes who demonstrate their inability to make satisfactory progress at age 15 or attainment of grade 6. These pupils should be given intensive training in a trade, farming or dairying for the boys and domestic science and gardening for the girls. Such pupils should not be discharged until properly trained or at 18 years of age.\n\n4. Residential schools should not be permitted to become a 'Dumping Ground' for children who are 'Non Band Members' or who may be problem children on the reservations. Non band members upon discharge from the school are faced with the fact that they have no legal right to hold land upon the reservation nor to even live there. If they are able to find employment at a distance from the reservation they are acceptable as workers but are barred from the social life of the community. The result is that they are dis-satisfied and unhappy and it is not long before they begin to drift to and fro between the reservation and the white communities, and as an economic unit cease to be of value and instead become a burden. The problem children constitute a real menace to the welfare and safety of all the pupils in residence.\nThe Mount Elgin Indian Residential School\nThe United Church of Canada\nMuncey - Ontario\n\nREV. O. B. STRAPP, PRINCIPAL\n\nFebry. 3rd, 1937.\n\nThere should be a full time 'Vocational Officer' employed for Ontario whose duty it should be to visit the residential school, interview all pupils who are to be discharged during the year, obtain from the principal their rating in public school and vocational work and then consult with their Indian Agent and parents as to the advisability of arranging for their settlement upon the reservation or placement in a position away from home. It is obviously impossible for the principals of the residential schools to keep in close touch with all their former pupils owing to their responsibilities in connection with their schools and the extent of the territory from which the pupils are drawn. Close co-operation between the local agents, missionaries and a vocational officer would, I believe, do much to help the graduates find their place in life and attain ultimate independence.\n\nWe as a staff at Mt. Elgin are intensely interested in the pupils committed to our care; their joys and sorrows we endeavour to share and for their problems we earnestly seek solutions. May I again assure you of our willing co-operation and express the hope that you will shortly find it convenient to pay us a visit.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, February 8, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Frayling:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant and to state, by way of comment, that I appreciate very fully the information and suggestions contained therein.\n\nI simply want to assure you that these suggestions submitted to me will receive very careful and very sympathetic consideration.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.

I was more than delighted to learn that you are seeking to promote, in your own way, a certain amount of vocational instruction in your school. I do not know that I can tender you any specific advice at this time, other than that you continue along your present lines. It is somewhat difficult, as you know, to extend vocational instruction in a small day school.

In reply I wish to thank you for your offer of assistance in the matters and particularly that of our travelling staff members and school pupils.\n\nI am certainly of opinion that united action among educational personnel has been too arbitrary and careless and should be made more practical for the future of our school children.\n\nI wish to say that I am most willing to cooperate with you in supplying the information and particulars which may be needed by you for the adoption of a follow-up system and help the pupils in their future career.\n\nThanking you once more for the interest you take in the welfare and training of our residential schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nV. de Varennes, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, January 26, 1937\n\nThe Honourable T. A. Crerar,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Crerar,\n\nI have recently received a memorandum with regard to game depletion by drought as one of the causes of dissension among the Indians.\n\nMy informant points out that although this may make matters worse, that for years other causes more fundamental in character have been at work. Among these, one of the most serious is the unscrupulousness of the traders in exploiting the Indians. I feel sure, from my own knowledge, that there is a good deal in this charge.\n\nMy informant states that \"In 1923 the Steamer Montgomery took out the supply for the Hudson Bay Company and charged them 50 cents per 100 lbs. from Winnipeg to Poplar River Landing.\n\n| Winnipeg Prices on Commodities | Poplar River Landings prices to Indians |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 98 lbs. 1st grade flour       | 98 lbs. 2nd grade, $6.50                |\n| 100 lbs. sugar                | 20.00                                  |\n| 1 lbs. butter                 | .60                                     |\n| 1 lbs. tea                    | .25                                     |\n| 1 lbs. lard                   | .20                                     |\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\n| Winnipes Fur Prices | Poplar River Prices to Indian |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Al. Silver Fox      | $75.00                        |\n| Al. Otter           | $25.00                        |\n| Al. Red Fox         | $16.00                        |\n| Al.

All commodities sold to the Indians are all on the same basis, and the same with the fur they have for sale. The lowest price for a red fox received by an Indian was 25 cents that winter.\"\n\nMy informant gives a further instance:\n\n\"One of the traders had fifty-four fox skins stored in the basement of the missionary's place. Of these seven were cross foxes, this was all 2nd, 3rd and 4th grade fur valued by my son and I at $360.00. The trader informed me that he had paid for the 54 foxes fifty dollars in trade to the Indians, which would approximately come to $20.00 to $25.00 by Winnipes prices in groceries.\"\n\nI understand that large territories have been set aside especially for the Indians to trap; but unless there is some control over the trading, it is obvious that the benefit goes not to the Indian, but to the trader.\n\nFurther, with regard to health matters - Tuberculosis has, of course, been prevalent among the Indians ever since I was a child, and the government has done a good deal in the way of sending in medicines, but it is surely obvious that tuberculosis is due in part at least to the low standards of living. So far, very little has been done in a practical way to improve these standards.\"\nThe Indian schools have done something to train the younger people in sanitation, and to accustom them to higher standards. Unfortunately, however, these young people go back to the reserves or to villages where they have no opportunity of practicing what they have learned. Indeed, in many cases, their education would seem to be a handicap rather than an advantage. As an illustration I turn to the West coast where young people, after they leave the schools, are sent to live with their parents many of whom are living in villages in very wretched conditions. The result, especially upon the girls, has been disastrous\u2014many of the graduates of the schools preferring a life of prostitution in the cities to that of the very bad conditions in the villages.\n\nThese are matters that cannot be taken up with advantage on the floor of the House, but I would urge that your Department give more careful consideration to these questions than has been the case in the past. May I ask particularly with regard to the charges of exploitation referred to in the earlier part of this letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. S Woodsworth, M.P.\nFebruary 6, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McMillan,\n\nI have given careful consideration to the complaint sent forward to you by Mr. J. B. Woodsworth, M.P., in respect to waywardness and immorality amongst the younger people of our Indian population on the Pacific coast.\n\nI may state, by way of comment, that the problem to which Mr. Woodsworth directs your attention is not an educational problem in any basic sense. His contention is that living conditions in certain Indian villages lend themselves to immorality amongst school graduates who return there to reside. In as much, however, as we are responsible, not only for the education of Indian children, but their general welfare as well, the criticism, if well founded, should be given consideration.\n\nI regret to state that we never have had, nor have we now, an effective \"follow-up system\" that would enable us to know exactly from time to time what progress, if any, the graduates of our schools are making. In this connection you will be interested to learn that, this month, I have sent out a circular letter to the Principals of our Residential Schools and the Teachers in charge of our Day Schools, containing the following paragraph:\n\n\"I am deeply interested, also, in a \"follow-up system\". I mean by this a systematic method of supplying the Department, from year to year, with information that will enable us to know exactly what becomes of our pupils after they leave school. This work should be undertaken at once by the Principals of our residential schools and by the teachers in charge of our day schools. We shall welcome any suggestions as to how this work can be simply and effectively accomplished.\"\n\nIn addition to this, we have undertaken an experiment at the Kispiox reserve, Babine agency, northern British Columbia. On this reserve, arrangements have been completed for the organization of classes in the school twice each week. Instruction will be given to teen-age boys and girls and to adults, in sewing, dressmaking, nursing and other subjects. If this experiment, which is very inexpensive, is successful, it is our intention to extend it to other districts.\n\nThe assumption that economic conditions\n\n- contribute\ncontribute to immorality may or may not be valid. It is significant that the Deputy Minister of Health for the province of Manitoba, in his report of this year, refers to the alarming increase in delinquency and immorality amongst the school population. It would appear from the report that this tendency is not peculiar to any particular district. If such conditions exist amongst the white population, the task of correcting them amongst primitive or semi-primitive people, such as our Indians, is going to be exceedingly difficult work. It is my intention to give the whole matter careful consideration, just as soon as the time at my disposal will enable me to do so.\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nFebruary 8, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Woodsworth,\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 26 last, dealing with several matters pertaining to the administration of Indian Affairs, particularly in the Lake Winnipeg district and in Indian Villages on the Pacific coast.\n\nConcerning exploitation of Indians of the Poplar River Reserve by traders, this matter was brought to the attention of the department some time ago and was referred to Mr. A. G. Hamilton to express his views as to the adoption of some procedure other than that now in vogue of disposing of Indians' furs for them, provided any recommended change would benefit them.\n\nMr. Hamilton in reply stated that he would like to give the matter further consideration and would later submit a report. He has not as yet done so, however, and has been again written to on the subject.\n\nI am sure that you will readily recognize that this is a somewhat difficult matter to deal with in a manner that will assure equity as between the Indians and the traders in transactions which take place personally between these two parties. We have already made a step in advance in the Pan-Indian scheme the Indians agent is endeavoring to some extent the sales of the furs collected by his Indians and it is hoped that we may be able to extend the system where it is practicable to do so. We trust that our inspector will be able to submit some proposal that will be acceptable and feasible.\n\nYour remarks with regard to ...............\n\nJ. S. Woodsworth, Esq., M. P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nYour remarks with regard to the prevalence of tuberculosis among the Indians are noted. We are doing what we can to combat this disease with the limited funds at our disposal, and we quite subscribe to your remarks that tuberculosis is in part at least due to the low standards of living among these native people.\n\nI was quite disturbed to note, from your letter of recent date, that you had learned of a marked tendency toward delinquency and immorality on the part of certain girl graduates of our Indian schools, who reside in villages on the Pacific coast. May I express the hope that this tendency is local and in no sense general amongst the Indian population of British Columbia. I should state, in fairness to the officials here, that we have received no reports from our Indian agents, indicating that such conditions exist.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that, this month, we have circularized the principals of our residential schools and the teachers of our day schools, asking them to cooperate with us in the organization of an effective \"follow-up system,\" which system should enable us to follow intelligently the progress made by the graduates of our schools during the years immediately following their departure from our institutions. This month, also, we have undertaken an experiment in adult education at the Nicola reserve, designed to encourage teen age boys and girls to take up courses in sewing, dressmaking, nursing, auto mechanics, boat building, etc. If this experiment is measurably successful, it is our intention to extend it to other districts.\n\nIt is our intention to communicate with the newly appointed Commissioner of Indian Affairs in British Columbia, Mr. Hesley, asking him to make a careful investigation of the prevailing economic conditions on the reserves, particularly the social and economic conditions in the Indian villages, and to report to us just as soon as he can conveniently do so.\n\nI am sure that Doctor McMillan, Director of Indian Affairs, and Mr. R. A. Hesley, the Superintendent of Welfare and Training would be glad to discuss these matters with you personally should you find it convenient to visit them in their offices in the Booth Building.\n\nYours sincerely,\nThe Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission\nof the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nGENERAL SECRETARY, M.S.C.C.\nREV.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have received your letter of the 3rd inst. No. 150-60 enclosing copy of your circular letter of the 15th, also embodying certain proposals in connection with that sphere of the Department's activities over which you have been called to preside. If there is any way in which our Commission can assist you in the discharge of your responsible duties, you may be well assured that this assistance will gladly and freely be given.\n\nIn your circular letter reference is made to further manual training in the Indian Residential Schools, and also to the very important question of a \"follow-up system\" in connection with the graduate pupils. Our Commission has already given very considerable attention to both of these questions, but only at one of our schools, namely, at Alert Bay, has anything worthy of the name of manual training been undertaken. Even here, this would have been quite impossible without the help provided by the Department in meeting half of the Instructor's salary. The development of this branch of education has seemed to our Commission to be very important, if the Indian peoples of this country are to be fitted to take their place as citizens of the same.\n\nWith regard to the system of follow-up work, our Commission are convinced that no system will succeed without the co-operation of your Department's representatives, namely, the Indian Agent and the missionaries of the different churches who are engaged in purely missionary work. After the pupils\nleave the school they require guidance and encouragement, and these may best be given by Indian Agents and Missionaries. The Woman's Auxiliary of our Missionary Society has a special Committee which is doing quite a good work amongst the girl graduates, and their one regret is that they have not sufficient funds at present to provide \"Field Matrons\" or \"Deaconesses\" to carry on this work as they feel it should be done.\n\nIt has been the policy of our Commission to place the health of the Indian children in the schools in a position of primary importance. Registered Nurses have been given the Head Matronships and other staff positions. Instructions were issued to the various school management to keep careful record of the weights and measurements of children from the time of their admission until the time of their discharge. The Alert Bay School adopted a record sheet sample of which is enclosed herewith, and it was the intention of our Commission to have a sheet of this kind prepared for all of our Society's Schools; also it had been in use for a year or two at Alert Bay with a view to ascertaining whether it required further revision or not. As you will, no doubt, receive replies from many of our Principals to your circular letter, I will not write further at present, but will be very glad indeed to confer with you at any time I may be able with regard to the proposals set forth in your circular letter.\n\nWith very good wishes,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW/W\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nPro-School History\n\nName ..............................................

I agree with your personal opinion that some provision should be made for a course of manual training for the boys, and a course of dressmaking and domestic science for the girls.\n\nEarly in the fall I took up the matter of dressmaking etc., with the chief of this Reserve explaining to him that I had taken a course in these branches and that I was sure that the taking up of this work by the school children and other young ladies of the Reserve would be very beneficial to them. Owing to lack of funds and material we let the matter drop. Re vocational training for the boys, probably some provision could be made at the Manual Training Classes in the City of Sydney.\nI'd be only too glad and willing to cooperate in the \"Follow-up System\" as it would not only keep a check on pupils who leave school having attained the required age, but also on those who leave before attaining it. I would suggest that stricter methods in compulsory attendance be used in such cases. For the young people over 15 years of age a census of such could be taken by the teacher, and necessary information concerning their occupation at the present time.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\nCatherine Gallagher\nDear Sir,\n\nI think the appointment of such an officer as yourself will prove most to be one of the best moves made for Indians in a great many years.\n\nAs for the Reserve, I had numerous conferences on the subject at least two years, until some poor Indian fellow, but always found an attitude of isolation towards Indians. It made me think often that someday Indians take me much do something ourselves, and hope for India cooperation after we make a beginning. I defended after we make a beginning, I defended opening the subject until the Department lest I be thought meddling.\n\nIf I may, however, I shall write in a little letter about some of the things I thought\n\nJoseph\n\nAgent\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter 150-60 dated February 3rd, together with the enclosed circular.\n\nA large percentage of the teachers in our day schools are women and I am afraid they will have only a vague idea of the difficulties encountered in establishing school graduates. I am sure the Indian Agents could offer helpful suggestions and letters from our Farming Instructors would at least be interesting.\n\nFirst, I would like to discuss the boarding school graduate. The boys know how to farm, garden, and care for stock. They have been accustomed to the most up-to-date implements, tractors, good horses, and a Farming Instructor always at their call. They get up in the morning when called, eat when told, and work as instructed. When the work is finished, they amuse themselves until told to do something definite. If sick, they receive care and attention. It is a life where everything is planned and provided. After eight or ten years in this environment, the boy is turned back on the reserve and expected to make good.\n\nIn some cases, he has been provided with a team, harness, wagon, and plough. He is expected to go to work and make a living. The close supervision is gone - the boy knows he cannot be made to work a definite number of hours each day. Then there is the question of food and his desire to attend all Fairs and Sports Days within a seventy-five mile radius of his home. The result usually is a failure and yet I am not prepared to altogether blame the Indian. The parents usually have little, if any, control as the child has been away from home influence too long. He has been educated and is not willing to take advice from his old father. I agree that at least one-third of the boy's time, while at school, should be devoted to manual training. He should graduate qualified to do ordinary carpentering, blacksmith work, and painting. He could then build his own house and do the ordinary repair work necessary in operating machinery. The bush Indian should be educated in the north and not taken from that environment. They will never be able to farm in those parts and, while away, lose the early home training in regard to\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt., of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nregard to hunting, trapping, and fishing, which training is most essential.\n\nThe day school pupils receive less academic training, but are better fitted to make a living in their particular district because of home training. They face with their parents the problems of providing food, clothing, and shelter, and I believe appreciate more any assistance granted.\n\nIn many cases, I think it much better to make the graduate prove his worth before assistance is given. I have suggested supplying the Agents with an accountable advance (not large) in order that they might start a community farm. The best boys could be sorted out and, as the scheme enlarged, they could be given 50 acres of cultivated land and some equipment. I find the Indian rarely has enough horse power and, by the time he gets 20 to 40 acres broken, he has ruined a horse or one is dead and the work stops. We cannot expect Indians to greatly exceed the white man's ability in this respect and one has only to make a few enquiries to find out how much it cost to start one man on the \"Back to the Land\" plan. The expense does not end when he is placed, but seed, food, and clothing is often provided for some time, and in many cases exemption is made in interest and taxes.\n\nAssistance granted in a haphazard way, without being followed up, does not amount to much. These grants of horses and machinery do not bring the desired results, only in a few exceptional cases. The community farm would try the boys out, give them a chance to find their own feet and see for themselves what is required of a good farmer. I think, after the first two years, these farms would pay their way and the scheme could be carried on by the Agent without assistance.\n\nIf this plan were adopted or tried out, we might further encourage the graduates by giving the girl some house equipment when she marries. This would not involve much expense and would be something to look forward to. I believe, if this matter were handled carefully and under close supervision, we could gradually settle a large percentage of the graduates and at small cost. However, with the Agents having very little authority and no funds with which to start such plans, it is impossible to get anywhere. This is a big problem and one deserving much careful thought and study. It constitutes our most important problem - \"The establishing of home life\".\n\nIt is impossible to do anywhere near justice to the subject by writing and I hope soon to have the privilege of discussing thoroughly this matter with you.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nMr. R.A. Hey,\nDept. Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hey,\n\nI have received your letter of January 15th, and the excellent ideas it contains concerning work in the Indian schools have me very much impressed and encouraged.\n\nI believe the Indian Department's aim is to prepare the children for the problems of their adult life, at work and at home; to give them a fine standard of health, cleanliness, and general living conditions; to make them self-supporting and upright. The present course of study ignores an important means of reaching this goal; and that is, sufficient manual training. All Indian children in the range of my short experience form habits through their hands, and I am convinced that only a well-planned manual course can succeed in instilling life-long habits in their minds.\n\nThe change to an improved system will probably be slow, and any practical suggestions I might make have doubtless been thoroughly considered by your department. Each school should devote at least two hours a day to manual training. Those children who, at the age of eleven or twelve years, show a particular aptitude in any direction, whether it be woodworking,\nserving, etc., or in academic study, could be sent to a special training school, established by the Department at chosen points in the Dominion. At these schools the children could be trained individually for that vocation to which they are best suited.\n\nThe disadvantage of such a plan is the expense of building and operating special schools\u2014or even one experimental school. The advantages are that all the children obtain the practical and moral benefits of the manual training, while those particularly adept ones are not held back by the others.\n\nI hope I may be forgiven for writing at such length on the subject. My only excuse is that since accepting a position in an Indian school I have given a great deal of thought to the matter.\n\nBefore closing, I should like to inquire regarding seed for our school garden. Should I address my application for government seed to your department or to the Department of Agriculture?\n\nI should like to speak again of the encouragement your letter brought to me. I am sure that with the added gift of your advice and assistance, the work in our schools will be happier and more progressive.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nNorman Van Hattum.\nWalpole Island, Ont.,\nFeb 12, 1937.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter dated January fifteenth received and have been debating since whether an answer was expected or not. I finally decided I would write anyway, hoping that in the rush of your new duties it will not take too much of your time.\n\nYour opinion as to changing our system and giving the pupils one third of their time at manual training and other forms of Vocational training I think is a splendid idea. So much seems to depend on this early Vocational training. We have several men here, around the age of forty, who received that training at the old Boarding school and are today the outstanding men of our island. This appears to be putting our day school on a lower plane of education, but of course at that time our day school here was not getting really qualified teachers which accounts for this fact.\n\nI have felt for the past few years that manual training was necessary so last year...\nwe rigged up a bench across the back of the room and bought a few tools, which I personally financed, and made a start. The children were, and are, happier because of it. I have never felt like taking much time for this however, as the entrance examinations are a black cloud always on the horizon and I have felt that we are expected to pass pupils through these exams.\n\nIn regard to these entrance pupils, it might be interesting to you to know what happens to them after they reach High School. I think in the past five years, we have had eight who went on to High School and without any exception they were a disappointment. They had the ability to learn in fact some beat their forms but quit after two, three or four years, right when the goal was in sight.\n\nTo me it is obvious that it is a mistake to send on the majority of these pupils.\n\nIf the length of time they stayed in this school was increased by two or three years and the work more of a hand nature it would be better. But they would pile up here so that another two-room school would have to be built, because we already have approximately sixty.\nAs to the \"follow-up system,\" suggested; it would be a simple matter for me to give names and occupations of all pupils who have passed through Mrs. Daley's room and my own since we have been here. We could also furnish if necessary, their general outlook on life and moral tendencies. And believe me, Sir, that is the heart breaking part of this teaching Indian children. We teach a child, who has every indication of growing into a man or woman who will be a credit to any community and he gets out of school and in one or two years is no better than the rest. We feel of course, that in time this will be overcome or it would all be a farce, this work being carried on year in and year out.\n\nWe have been hoping that a change would be made, a drastic change if necessary, and believe me if Mrs. Daley or myself can be of any assistance, we will be only too glad to help.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJames W. Daley\nPrincipal - No. 1 School\nWhitefish Lake School\nNaughton, Ont.,\nFeb 12, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Hay,\n\nI would heartily welcome any provision made on our educational programme concerning manual training. I too have the opinion that our pupils would benefit more from that training than they are from our present course of study.\n\nFor instance take the boys and girls that left this school a few years ago. What are they doing now and what are their living standards up to? You will find most of them living in a small, one-room shack very peacefully and contentedly. Their houses are sadly in need of soap and water, clean household articles and well cooked meals. This is because they have never been taught the value of good housekeeping and how to improve and beautify their homes. They spend their money buying ready-made clothes for all the family.\nThe women do not sew, mend or knit. They have no gardens of any kind on this reserve with the result that they are very often short of food. They seldom ever have any vegetables.\n\nNow this has led me to wish for a school garden this summer. I have been planning for one but I don't know whom I should ask for that. Can you or are you in a position to give me any help?\n\nLast fall when I began teaching I gave the girls a few lessons on sewing and they were very delighted and eager to learn. Of course I couldn't keep it up because I couldn't stand the expense as I was supplying all the necessary material.\n\nThere is one other reason why I would like to have manual training here. It would be an incentive for the children to attend school regularly. They are very poor in attendance.\n\nI would be very glad to receive any helpful suggestions you may have to offer me.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMiss M. Kincaid\nOttawa, February 16, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. McKinnon:\n\nPlease accept my sincere thanks for your letter of the 9th instant and for the kind references to myself, contained therein.\n\nI should certainly appreciate any information and any suggestions you may care to submit to me for consideration, from time to time.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Neay,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJos. McKinnon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSydney, N. S.\nOttawa, February 16, 1937.\n\nDear Miss Gallagher:\n\nPlease accept my sincere thanks for your letter of the 2nd instant and for the information contained therein.\n\nI was particularly interested in learning of the attempt you had made to promote dressmaking at your school. I am sorry to learn that the attempt had been abandoned. You might, if you can conveniently do so, take up the matter with the Agent. We would be prepared to supply you with a small amount of money for material, if you and the Agent together would consider it advisable to proceed with this instruction.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss Catherine Gallagher,\nTeacher, Indian Day School,\nSydney, N.S.\nOttawa, February 16, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton:\n\nPlease accept my most sincere thanks for your letter of the 8th instant and for the information contained therein.\n\nYou may be interested to learn that I discussed the subject matter of your communication with Mr. Christiansen, and the views you express are wholly in accord with our own. I shall certainly embrace the first opportunity that comes to me to discuss these matters more fully with you. In the meantime, I simply desire to assure you that the suggestions you have submitted will be given very careful and very sympathetic consideration.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A.

I can assure you that your prompt and courteous reply to the circular letter I sent out a few weeks ago was very deeply appreciated.\n\nI note your reference to seed for your school garden. You should forward your request for this seed to the local Agent, who, in turn, will forward it, with his recommendation, to the Department.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nNorman Van Hatten, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nMcIntyre Bay Indian Day School,\nMacdiarmid, Ont.\nOttawa, February 16, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Daley:\n\nPlease accept my most sincere thanks for your letter of the 12th instant and for the information contained therein. I can assure you that your prompt and courteous reply to my circular letter is very much appreciated.\n\nI was particularly pleased to learn of the experiment you had made in manual training. It is my hope that we shall be in a position to extend this training, not only in our residential schools, but in our day schools as well.\n\nI simply desire to assure you, in this letter, that the suggestions you have sent forward will receive very careful and very sympathetic consideration.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.

A. Neay,\nSept. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss M. Kinoshmeg,\nTeacher,\nWhitefish Lake Indian Day School,\nNaughton, Ont.\nCarcross Indian Residential School,\nCARCROSS, Yukon.\n\nFebruary 10th 1937.\n\nR.A. Hoey Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nMany thanks for your friendly and interesting letter of January 15th. I have read this letter very carefully and find it a pleasure in answering same. One of the criticisms often voiced here in the Yukon is that our ex-pupils are unfitted to adapt themselves to a home environment so different from what they have been used to at the school. It seems that the best word that can be used to describe their attitude of mind on reaching home is - DISSATISFACTION. Not only are they dissatisfied with home conditions so different from what they have been used to for so many years at the school but they find it extremely difficult to earn a living.\n\nAt the school here the boys are taught farming and gardening. Well, whilst gardening can be undertaken on a small scale in the Yukon, early frosts and a very limited market, would make it a precarious way of earning a living. As far as farming is concerned it is my personal opinion that such is out of the question, for the Indians in such a mountainous country as this. The obtaining of hay to feed stock is very difficult. Hay shipped in from 'outside' costs over a $100.00 per Ton landed in Carcross and local hay, only found in a very few places, costs from $40.00 to $50.00 per Ton.\n\nThe price of lumber in the Yukon which ranges from $60.00 per M. up would be a decided obstacle to any boys learning carpentrying with a view to adopting the trade of a carpenter after leaving school.\n\nI have just been talking with the Classroom Teacher about the mentality of the pupils now enrolled here. Her opinion is that of one who has\nhad many years experience teaching in residential schools in various parts of Canada. It is her opinion that they are of a very low mentality compared with Indian children she has taught in other schools. If a child reached Grade VIII or even Grade VII they would be outstanding. This alone would tend to bar them from following any profession or trade after leaving school.\n\nAbout the only pursuit that the Indians in the Southern Yukon follow and I believe the same is true of the Northern Part, is hunting and trapping. In this connection I feel that a residential school could help them. During past years both the boys and girls here have spent considerable time during the winter in snaring rabbits. These rabbits have been purchased from them not only by the school but by those in Carcross and vicinity who engage in Mink and Fox Farming. There is no doubt in my mind but that this form of activity should be encouraged and occupy a prominent place on the curriculum and if the Department could supply the boys and girls with snare wire and traps they would be rendering the pupils assistance well worthwhile.\n\nIt might be of interest for you to know that a dog - team is kept at this school, not so much with the idea of using it for school work but to give the boys an opportunity of handling a dog team a thing that they will most certainly have to do after leaving school.\n\nIn connection with that paragraph of your letter in which you mention the \"Follow-up System\" I would like to make the following suggestion. The missionaries in the various settlements who are or should be in close touch with ex-pupils could make an annual report at the close of each year to the Principals as to the activities, conduct etc. of those who have left the school. This information could then be passed on to your Department and I am sure would also be of value to the school management. Such a system would of course have to be arranged through the Bishops of the various Dioceses or other Church Leaders.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nH.C.M. Grant,\nPrincipal.\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nEDMONTON\nALBERTA\n\nFeb. 13th 1937.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nYour letter of January 15th to hand. Since then I have been very busy with our \"FLU\" epidemic, which has fortunately passed without any very serious aftermath.\n\nI must thank you for your letter. It was very refreshing and heartening. It means much to me because of its understanding and spirit of cooperation. I have been nearly twenty five years in Indian Educational work and I am still anxious to see progressive movements. I appreciate your letter for its spirit and suggestions.\n\nWhile still retaining our church relations, I have been impressed for some time with the need of our Indian Schools, with all their equipment, becoming more an integral part of the life of the reserve. This applies more particularly to follow-up work. Too much of the work of the school is lost with the discharge of a pupil. I believe that with the backing of the Department, much can be accomplished by a larger cooperation between school management and Agency officials. This is just one suggestion to start with.\n\nI trust before long that we may have the pleasure of a visit from you. The function of this particular school in the whole scheme of Indian Education can then be discussed at greater length.\n\nSincerely Yours;\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nBox 1163,\nCornwall, Ont.,\nFeb. 15/37.\n\nMr. R.G. Hoey,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI received your letter some time ago and I intended answering sooner but I have been very busy.\n\nI noted the contents of your letter and I am very much interested.\n\nOur educational programme is a bit stiff. It would be rather hard to change our course of study owing to the very few Indian children that are really interested in continuing their education in High Schools and Colleges.\n\nYour idea of spending about 1/3 of the time in manual training and vocational work is very good. One third of the time is\na whole lot though. I presume you mean to have this sort of work related to the other subjects\u2014that is manual training would necessitate certain amount of work in arithmetic, spelling, etc. Then '3 of the time wouldn't be too much.\n\nJust what kind of work do you mean by \"vocational work\"? I have a fair idea but I would like to know what you have in mind.\n\nTo get the school children really interested in manual training etc. we must show them how they will be able to make money out of this kind of work. My idea is that we should try and locate a market for little trinkets that can be made.\n\nI have been assisting some Indians in disposing of hand-made lacrosse sticks and I am getting along very nicely in this line.\nThere are a few other items I have in mind but I am a little bit hesitant a bit about going ahead with it as I haven't enough capital (money) to finish the thing ahead in case some trouble turns up.\n\nIf we get the adults working on something they can make money out of then we have the children interested in this sort of work too. Co-operation means a whole lot in anything.\n\nThe Department was good enough to supply me with some tools and lumber for a work bench for my school and when I get things working properly I believe it will be a big aid to my children.\n\nIt would be a good idea to send out some very simple blue print plans to some of the teachers. I mean, very simple ones at first because most teachers know nothing about blue prints. I must admit that I know nothing about\nthem myself. But, teacher and pupil could both learn at the same time.\n\nIf there are any other things I can think of at a later date I shall be only too glad to write you.\n\nI trust that you will overlook errors in this letter as I am writing in a hurry.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nColin J. Chisholm, teacher,\nCornwall Island East Indian Day School.\n\nP.S.\n\nMiss Moody has no doubt spoken to you about certain things I mentioned to her and I trust you will understand why I told her to speak to you.\n\nC.J. Chisholm.\nMohawk Ontario,\nFeb. 14/37.\n\nR.A. Haey, Supt.,\nWelfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of Jan. 15, was to hand,\nand I regret, I have not been able\nto answer sooner. I have been\nabsent from duty owing to the\nsudden death of my mother, and\ntherefore your letter didn't receive\nmy attention until my return.\n\nHowever, I might say that I\nam also interested in what you\nterm a \"follow-up system.\" And I\nassure you that I will gladly\nsupply you from time to time, with\nthe necessary information concerning\nthe graduates of this school.\n\nAlthough when I consider the\nyouth above school age, who\nare on the Reserve, it is with\nsome disappointment, as they are a hapless lot. Fifty percent of whom do not even try to practice the forest craft of their fathers. It is amazing to learn that some do not even know how to hunt or trap. This Reserve is extremely unfitted for agriculture in any form. The only profession open to the Indian youth in this area is to be a successful trapper and hunter. I believe that wood-craft and other Indian Arts (e.g., basketry, etc.) would be a great improvement to the course of study if included. Also, trapping methods could be taught in conjunction with Nature Study, thus giving them a more humane idea of the profession.\n\nAs for the girls who graduate, their one ambition is matrimony, and yet they cannot cook, other than for the bare necessities of a livelihood. A model kitchen and lessons in preparing wholesome yet plain dishes would help them greatly in their\nafter life.\n\nI have been on Indian Reserves before but never have I witnessed such shiftlessness and poverty as I find here. A course of study, which is less academic, and more vocational would certainly help rectify conditions for the future at least.\n\nIn due course, I shall prepare a list of ex-pupils of this school, ones who graduated before my appointment here, and I shall endeavour to also list their present occupations if any. I shall also note any suggestion which might add to the pupils efficiency in after life, that might aid in any reconstruction of the course of study.\n\nNow might I draw your attention in a literary aspect to the course of study and in connection with suitable books. I find it difficult to obtain suitable text books from the Dept. The supplementary reading books, should I think, take in\nstories, in connection with the Indian child's environment. The authorized Ontario History and Geography texts are printed in a vocabulary much above the average intelligence of the Indian. Yet the Dept. does not supply such books as \"Dent's Geography & History Readers\" which are less costly and more suited for the purpose. The Indian child is always attracted to things of a colorful nature, and certainly cannot interest himself in text books which would tax the intelligence of a senior pupil from our white schools.\n\nIf you could assure me of shipping us books that I could list, I'm sure you would be doing the Indians here a favour. When a lesson is taught, it is a great source of satisfaction for a teacher to interest the class in a book, which the class can further their knowledge, not above their comprehension.\n\nSo in closing, I hope\nthat you can understand things as I have explained, and I thank you for the opportunity you have afforded me; I assure you I shall communicate with you often as I find the necessity to do so.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJ.R. Douglas,\nTeacher, Indian Day School.\n9 Doyle St. Truro\nNova Scotia.\nFeb 14th 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nYour letter of Jan. 15th was received and greatly appreciated. I feel that in view of your statements, our relationships are going to be cordial and, to me at least, helpful. I thank you for it, and you may depend that I will enjoy co-operating in any way with the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nFrom the records you will see that this is my first year in gov't service. In fact my first year of teaching and as yet, I am loathe to make any suggestions other than concerning those things with which I have daily contact. Some times I feel very much in the need of suggestions and would appreciate them myself.\n\nSpeaking of the N. Scotian Indian [Writer]\nI think that the \"follow-up system\" you mentioned would, in a few short years, tell even a far off Australian all he would want to know concerning the work and life of our Indians. The lot of the father seems the accepted lot of the son; likewise the mother and daughter. Baskets, blankets, etc., seem to be their only resource outside of their \"order.\" All of it can not be attributed to them alone. Our \"colored friends\" will get the preference every time when there is any work to be done. This serves to shove the Indian down further. From lords of this country, they have, in the eyes of the men in the street, sunk to the level where they are beneath our African brothers. The Indian scowled with T.B. \"peddling\" his wares is an abject figure. I would here like to mention the uphill fight the local Indian Agent is waging continually to instill some feeling of self-respect and honest pride in his charges. But it seems to be of no avail. The morale seems to be gone and little wonder. His hope is in the school. The present system of school has failed. Will there be any changes? Will there be vocational schools for boys? And home\nTraining for girls? Shouldn't Indian boys be taught cobblering, masonry, carpentry, plumbing, blacksmithing, mechanics etc., and installed as helpers or given half a chance to rise? Or girls taught sewing, knitting, sanitary homekeeping, dressmaking? These things are taught in reform schools, in prisons, in various institutions for blind, deaf, mentally deficient, and why not the neglected Indians?\n\nNow I'm sorry to say this missal has taken form other than what I intended. But I must mention to someone in authority the most important needs of my school and from all the letters I certainly select you. I probably took too much advantage of your generousness when you said \"I want you to feel perfectly free to write me any time\" so now in conclusion I'll confine myself to my school. The building itself is in very good shape, the grounds are meager and being on a hill (slight) are damp; however drains have been dug and help considerably.\n\nBut first on my list I would like a little school library and supplementary reading matter. I had quite a siege bringing the children up to where\nthey are now, clamoring for Silent Reading. They thoroughly disliked it at first and it was almost considered punishment to have them read. But now they ask for it daily and are eager for any new reading matter. The only outside reading they have is the occasional book I can buy and on my salary minus board, and travelling expenses and a large family of brothers and sisters these books are of a necessity quite occasional. If any grant is possible I would like to select the books myself as these children grasp remarkably little of what they read and only the simplest stories and reading matter could be chosen.\n\nThe next case on the docket is the need of a jacket for the stove which throws off a scorching heat to the comfort of children seated nearby.\n\nThe third item is mentioned, not expecting to throw the Ind. Affairs Br. into confusion but to call attention to the fact in case repeated demands come from inspectors or doctors, the present desks have been service since somewhere in the eighteen hundreds. Over fifty years\n\"in his majesty's service.\" Now I feel that anything in Gov't service that long should be retired on a pension. They are too worn to be repaired and like all things doing fifty years uninterrupted service are beginning to bend under the strain and are beginning to look something like this seat. The children touch about where the X's are, which may possibly result in curvature of the spine. Any Doctor or inspector would advise new desks and seats. If there should be any action taken I would like to select the type of desk or at least would want them individual types and movable. For classroom activities, drill, projects etc., the movable desk is invaluable.\n\nThe last but not least I think you will find is in line with your suggestions. Namely, a start on some manual training equipment. You see, Our Agent has arranged with the Town of Truro for me to instruct nine of their children in close proximity to my school in return for the privilege of sending our bigger boys to their manual training school. With this start we hope to have those boys\nhelp our younger ones in the school. Besides, though being no artist myself in that line I have friends who specialized in that work and I feel I could call on them for a start. Later on these boys may take their course in town quite well prepared.\n\nI might mention that the Agent's wife and her sister are starting a sewing and knitting class on the reserve for only two women of them can knit and, to all appearances, less than that can sew. Those boys who are attending them are doing very well and are mixing in quite easily.\n\nNow that is all I want to say concerning school. I want to ask a few questions and wind this missal up. Are Indian school teachers (that is phrased wrongly)\u2014I mean we teachers of Ind. schools\u2014in the habit of getting passes or reduced fares travelling to and from our schools? I heard we were but nobody seems to know definitely. And don't you think it\nWould be a good idea to have teachers' institutes or get-togethers where we can all exchange our difficulties and have some experienced teachers\u2014Indian teaching\u2014help us by their experiences? This is the accepted thing, regularly, in provincial schools and young teachers look forward to an opening to air their difficulties. The Indian school teachers are more or less isolated.\n\nAnother device which I think is admirable for experience of some travelling and stimulates teaching is the exchange of teachers. It is quite possible for teachers to get into a rut, roughly speaking, by teaching year after year facing the same problems, personalities in the same school. But no teacher likes to be moving continually because he soon acquires a name and faces the risk of not getting a school for next year. And sometimes I think it's not fair to have one cooped up in one place. He has no raise in pay and so he doesn't advance himself in any way. He doesn't meet new situations, or sees nothing new and I think\nhe suffers by it. In the Indian Schools things would be different. They don't have temperamental parents who if they didn't like the teacher because of some little difference would demand his release, etc., etc.\n\nAs far as I can see things are quite different on Reserves. They don't take it in their heads to tell the teacher how this should be taught, etc., and consequently teachers could move without fear of being idle.\n\nNow Mr. Hoey, I thank you for your time\u2014if you have reached this page. I wish too that you don't refrain from commenting on anything I've said. As I said earlier, I'm only a beginner and am likely wrong, and some older, wiser person could convince me, which I would be glad for. I hope to hear from you soon, in regards to those things for my school, at least.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nF.B. McKinnon.\nTeacher Millbrook Reserve\nTruro, N. Scotia.\nOttawa, February 19, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Chisholm:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant and to thank you very heartily for the information contained therein.\n\nWhen I expressed the view in my circular letter that approximately one third of the regular school period should be devoted to manual training, my intention was to suggest this as an objective toward which our schools should move gradually. A great deal, of course, will depend upon local conditions, the facilities at your disposal, etc. It is somewhat difficult to define vocational instruction. I like to think of it as a philosophy of education. In practice, however, it should result in provision for instruction in carpentry work, auto mechanics, blacksmithing, handicraft work, elementary agriculture, and, in the case of girls, sewing, crochet work, elementary domestic science and, in fact, any subjects which will enable them to become better home makers. It should be comparatively easy to convince the Indian pupil that his chance of success in modern society will depend largely upon the development of certain skills, the acquisition of which must, of necessity, make him more useful to society.\n\nMiss Moodie, when she called upon me a few days ago, intimated that you were anxious to be excused from taking a summer school course at one of the training colleges. If you have this in mind, you should send in a formal request for this exemption, giving in detail your reasons.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Heay,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nColin J. Chisholm, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nCornwall Is., East Indian Day School,\nBox 1163, Cornwall, Ont.\nOttawa, February 19, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Douglas:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant and to thank you very heartily for the information contained therein.\n\nI note, with interest, your reference to the advisability of promoting instruction in handicraft and your reference to textbooks. I am writing at this time to state that the suggestions submitted by you will receive very careful and very sympathetic consideration.\n\nI appreciate very much indeed your willingness to prepare a list of ex-pupils, with a report of the progress they have made since their departure from school. I feel confident a report such as this will be very valuable to us when we have under consideration changes in educational policy.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J. R. Douglas,\nTeacher,\nRobert Indian Day School,\nMoberly, Ont.\nOttawa, February 19, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. McKinnon:\n\nPlease accept my most sincere thanks for your letter of the 14th instant and for the very interesting information contained therein.\n\nThe funds at our disposal during the present fiscal year are not sufficient for the purchase of library supplies. We have, however, a miscellaneous collection here, and it is our intention to forward this collection to your school, just as soon as we can conveniently do so. It is my hope that you will find these books reasonably satisfactory.\n\nI note your reference to the stove and certain repairs that should be made to it. May I suggest that you take up this matter with the Agent and have him send in a requisition to the Department for these repairs. You should do the same thing in respect to the desks, intimating to the Agent that he should draw this matter to the attention of the Department early in the next fiscal year, beginning April first.\n\nI know of no provision whereby teachers of Indian schools can obtain reduced railway rates. There are, of course, the regular excursions, arranged by the railways from time to time, which,\n\n- if taken\n\nMr. F. B. McKinnon,\nTeacher,\nMillbrook Indian Day School,\nTruro, N. S.\nif taken advantage of, might enable you to organize a teachers' convention with comparatively little expense. The time at my disposal has not enabled me to make a careful study of the district in which your Indian schools are located. If, however, you could arrange to have a number of teachers in your province meet at a convention for a one or two day study of the problems peculiar to Indian education, you would be accomplishing something well worth while. As a matter of fact, a teacher in southwestern Ontario is making arrangements, at the present time, for such a convention in his district. Until now, I understand it has been the practice of our Indian day school teachers to attend the regular conventions, held from year to year by the provincial authorities. There is no provision here, of course, that would enable us to defray the cost of a convention, but I am inclined to think that the actual costs to teachers would be very small.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nThe Country Indian Day School,\nOka, Que., Feb. 8th., 1937.\n\nMr. R. A. Rossy,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFirst of all let me thank you for your letter of Jan. 15th. May I wish you all success in your work. I wish also to pledge my support to you in our work.\n\nYour \"Follow-up System\" is a good idea. I have thought that this should be done and have taken pleasure in keeping \"tabs\" on the pupils who have graduated from this school during my work as teacher here since 1920. There would, however, have to be a limit of let us say five years. The best way would be to supply every teacher with a form on which he would note the progress of pupils who have left school during the past five years. Another form could be forwarded showing the work and the progress of those who left school ten years ago. That means that once a pupil was off the five year list he would not appear on the records until he had been out for ten years. Of course each pupil would have to have a permanent number. Or each pupil could have a sheet of his own and it could be in the possession of the teacher until the end of the five years. I am very much interested in this work and would like to see it under way in the future.\n\nI am more interested and gratified to see that you favour Manual Training and Vocational work among the pupils. This certainly is badly needed and is, I think, of more importance than years of memorizing dates in History and wrestling with analysis of sentences, etc. It is my wish that my pupils will know how to read intelligently, work problems in their grade in Arithmetic and above all be good spellers. Health and P.T. are important as is also study of the Scriptures but for the other subjects I try to make them as interesting as I can by projects. Work that the children can do. I wish you could call some time and see the relief maps that my pupils are working at now in Geography. They enjoy this kind of work too.\nI make a specialty of the teaching of Agriculture. I feel that this is one of the ways in which we can instil the lesson of independence in later life. I like the subject and as I have a special certificate for it I find that I can get more from the pupils in this than in anything else except the bit of manual work I can sneak in. I say \"Sneak in\". I have had to do just that because there were a couple of the parents objected to it and the agent asked me to discontinue it. We have made some very nice little raffia baskets and some picture frames from thin wood.\n\nI should like to take a course this summer in Toronto in Auxiliary class work at the Junior Vocational school. There is, however, not much use in my taking this course if I am to continue on here. I would be willing to go ahead with it if you could see your way clear to giving me a transfer from here to a reserve near London or Brantford. If I were over there near other schools I could be of help to the other teachers in the same part of the country and give them hints and helps if they wanted it, on Saturdays. I feel that this work should come to the fore in our schools and I think that I could do more in a place where the people were a little more broad-minded than they are here. If I were in a place where I could contact the other teachers I would be in a position to let them have the benefit of my experience and the special training which I should have after taking the course referred to.\n\nPlease accept this letter as I have written it. For the sole purpose of letting you know that I am with you in all you try to do and also to ask your advice along the lines mentioned above. Again let me thank you for your kind letter.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nAlbert E. Smith.\nOttawa, February 19, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Smith:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant and to thank you very heartily for the information contained therein.\n\nIt is my hope that the time at my disposal will enable me to give some thought to the preparation of forms suitable for a \"follow up system\". I am not so much interested, however, in going back over a period of years. I think the system would perhaps prove more effective if we concentrated our attention upon the pupils who will graduate from our schools in the future. This, however, is simply my own personal opinion.\n\nI was encouraged to note your reference to manual instruction. It is my hope that you will be able to extend this instruction, despite local prejudices you may encounter from time to time. I am convinced that a great deal of the instruction for which provision is made at the moment is altogether too abstract for the average Indian pupil.\n\nI regret that your chances of obtaining a transfer to another Indian day school in the province are in no sense encouraging. We have actually dozens of applications for positions on file here. A great deal of local pressure is exercised upon us when a vacancy occurs. Your only possible chance would be to work out the transfer between yourself and some other teacher\n\n- who might be\n\nMr. Albert E. Smith,\nTeacher,\nCountry Indian Day School,\nOka, Que.\nwho might be prepared to take up duties at Oka. I would like, however, to see you take the special course at Toronto this summer, if you can possibly do so. This course would probably prove very valuable to you, in view of the fact that vocational instruction is likely to be more emphasized in the future than it has been at any time in the past.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of January 15th, which I was very interested in getting from you. I must apologize for not acknowledging it before.\n\nI thoroughly concur with you that our educational program with the Indian children might be made much more practical to them when they get back on the reserve if we were able to give more technical and manual training.\n\nChiefly I should suggest carpentry work which would enable them to build themselves decent shacks or houses to live in, and then as much general knowledge as we could given them in cultivating the land for garden products.\n\nWe have always been very much handicapped in that respect here in the lack of material to work with.\n\nThese two things I think will be primary in starting them to be able to support themselves.\n\nOf course these things I mention only refer to the boys. It has always been the custom in these schools to do all that could be done in instructing the girls in housekeeping, cooking, mending, sewing, and such like. They are not very much use to them unless they have somewhere to do it in.\n\nIt has been my experience to see that Indian children, both boys and girls, are much more clever working with their hands than with their heads.\nIf at any future time you are able to pay us a personal visit it will be very much appreciated. You will be able to see things for yourself first hand.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nFred A. Mayo.\n\nFred A. Mayo,\nActing Principal.\nOttawa, February 20, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Mayo:\n\nPlease accept my most sincere thanks for your prompt and courteous reply to my circular letter of January 15th.\n\nI shall certainly embrace the first opportunity that comes to me to visit a number of our residential schools and also our day schools. In the meantime, however, I am making a somewhat intensive study of the reports here, in the hope that I will be able to work out certain modifications of the educational policy now in force. I am simply writing at this time to assure you that the suggestions contained in your letter will receive careful and sympathetic consideration.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., Feb. 10, 1937.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have been longer than I expected in replying to your letter of January 15th, #150-60.\n\nIn the first place, let me express again my great appreciation of the action of the Minister in placing you in this position of responsibility and opportunity. Many fine expressions of appreciation have come to me, especially from officials of our Home Mission Board.\n\nI thoroughly agree with the personal opinion you express in regard to the educational programme which should be adopted stressing manual training, all kinds of handwork and vocational instruction. I feel, however, that a certain percentage of our brighter pupils, who are free from that inferiority complex which is so characteristic of many of them and who are in every way as well qualified as the best of our white children to make their way in the world in teaching, nursing or other professions, should be given the regular academic training and all opportunity and encouragement possible to go ahead and make good.\n\nIn regard to the \"Follow-up Work\" to which you refer, I feel that more should be done than is being done at the present time. I am very doubtful\nabout the wisdom of employing placement officers to carry on this work but I think it must be done by the very diligent application and co-operation of everyone concerned in the development and safeguarding of these young lives. The principals of schools, the superintendents of Indian schools and agencies, the agents on the reserves with their farm instructors and ministers and field officers of the Churches concerned must work together in this matter and some campaign of education and agitation must be carried on to lay this matter on the heart and conscience of those who might contribute to the care and safeguarding of our Indian young people when they leave school.\n\nWhen you are on your next Western trip, we will be very glad to have you visit our school here and will be pleased to talk over any of these matters which concern the welfare of our young Indians.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPrincipal.\nMr. R. A. Heey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Heey:\n\nThank you very much for your letter of January 15th.\n\nIn reply, I should like to say that I am fully convinced that manual training is one of the most important branches of education for the Indian children. We are at present giving the girls a fairly comprehensive course of domestic science, but we have no facilities for manual training for the boys. The school was built originally for less pupils; and even playrooms are not provided for. Of course, the boys get training in farm work, teaming, gardening, etc.\n\nWith reference to the \"follow-up\" system; an effort has been made to keep in touch with graduates of this school by circular letters from time to time; but I think that it is only by close co-operation by Indian agents and the clergy on the Indian reserves that much can be done in this direction. It is, indeed, one of our most serious problems. Most of the reserves from which our children come are so far away that it is not possible for me to visit them. I know that the Indian Residential School Commission is giving a great deal of attention to the after-care of graduate pupils, and I shall always be ready to co-operate in any scheme that may be adopted for the better carrying out of this work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Principal.\nLake Helen Indian Day School,\nNipigon,\nOnt.\n20th February, 1937.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMany thanks for your letter of the fifteenth of January, received last Saturday. I quite agree with you that it would be very desirable for the Indian pupils to spend a larger part of the time on manual training or vocational instruction.\n\nThe same applies to the education of white children, as you remark, but I certainly think it applies with great force to Indian children. For instance, here the trapping is not very good being too close to the settled part; and to hunt and trap a little, or guide\non occasion, appear to be about all there to accept work in the logging camps. These occupations are all seasonal; leaving frequent periods of unemployment. If the boys could learn a trade it might help a great deal. In many cases, I believe, if the last two years, say from fourteen to sixteen, were given principally to vocational training, for the boys that it might have very beneficial results.\n\nI shall be glad to give you any information I can regarding old pupils, etc.\n\nYours truly,\nMargaret Casey\nSept. R. A. Hey.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn answer to your very interesting and instructive letter, Roe, your \"Follow-up System,\" I am sure no doubt will be of speedy accomplishment with a little co-operation.\n\nThe Indian Pupils as a rule continue attending school till they have completed the Eight Grade and then fall back to the ordinary routine of housekeeping or trapping. I would like to know if pupils received at least a few years High School. I have heard the pupils remark that it was of little use to work hard to pass the Entrance examination as that tie as far as they ever get. So you see there is nothing I would like to hear more concerning your course of study.\n\nThank you.\n\nChristian W.

A. Neay,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss C. M. Nophin,\nTeacher,\nIndian Bay School,\nHunter's Point, Q.M.S.\nWhycocomagh, N. S.\n\nFebruary 22nd, 1937.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI have received your letter No. 150-60, dated January 15th, and in accepting your kind offer to communicate with you, I now take the liberty and pleasure of writing this personal letter regarding this school and educational matters, here.\n\nI have taught in this school for over thirteen years and during that time, although I have experienced some difficulties, I feel confident that progress has been as satisfactory as could be expected under existing circumstances. None of my former pupils have achieved any high educational degree but I feel satisfied that all who have left school had a common school education.\n\nDuring the first few years I was here, nearly all the reading and writing of letters etc. was done by me as only a very few Indians were able to either read or write. Now, it is only on very rare occasions that I am called upon to either read or write for the Indians as the younger generation can do that themselves. A few years ago, newspapers were unknown in Indian homes, but now the majority of the families are receiving them either daily or weekly.\n\nIn making these statements I do not mean to belittle the teaching ability of my predecessors or to have you imagine that I, and I alone, have resurrected the Indians of this Reserve from a grave of total ignorance and placed them above the standard of others but I will frankly and truthfully say that each and every one of the younger generation, who have completed this school's course of studies, have what is considered a fair education and are capable of teaching their parents.\n\nA teacher here is confronted with many difficulties unknown to teachers in white schools, the first and foremost\nbeing that the children cannot speak or understand any English when they first come to school on account of there being no other language but Micmac spoken in their homes. This being so, the average child has attended school for a year or more before he or she is on a parallel with a \"white\" child on the first day of attendance. I must admit that I have found it impossible to have the children use English in ordinary conversations, outside of the school. That this is a handicap has been proven to me by the early advancement of the children of a family who live near my home, play and talk English with my own children. I now have a limited knowledge of their language and I often wonder how I ever taught the junior children during the first few years I was here, when I could not understand them and they could not understand me.\n\nAnother difficulty I experienced was the lack of home study as the children did not, and could not, get any assistance from their parents. The children of today are not so handicapped in this regard as every home has at least a few members who are educated enough to help them.\n\nAs regarding suggestions for improvement, I have very little offer as I consider that everything possible is now being done by the Indian Department and all concerned. However, I am of the firm opinion that this school-building should be enlarged, divided into two rooms and a second teacher employed. I do not say this with the idea of lessening my own work and duty but with the firm belief that it is next to impossible for any one teacher to give sufficient time and attention to such a large number of pupils as are attending this school. At present there is an enrollment of forty-three pupils and within the next few months I expect to have eight or nine more. My earnest suggestion is that one teacher have charge of the beginners and Grade 1 and after they have learned to speak and understand English, as well as being able to do some reading, writing etc., that they be transferred to the other teacher, in another classroom, for general studies. In this manner each teacher would have about twenty-five pupils (the average in local white schools), there would be sufficient time for the teaching of vocational training etc., in addition to regular school duties and I feel assured that each and every child would leave school far in advance of the present standard. Visiting school officials and Indian Agents have often remarked that I had too many pupils to teach in a proper manner and that the schoolroom was overcrowded. In bringing this matter to your attention, I am not doing so as a complaint but as a suggestion for the improvement of educational conditions, knowing that same will have the support of the Indian Agent and School Inspector.\n\nHowever, it would be impossible to have a second teacher without having the school building enlarged by the addition\nof another classroom. The building has a floor area of 875 sq.ft. (35 by 25 ft.) and that includes space for a stove, two cupboards; a lunch-table, four aisles and a platform 25 by 5 ft., leaving a very limited space for the twenty-two seats and desks now in use.\n\nRegarding the \"Follow-up System\" referred to in your letter, I can supply you with particulars regarding each one of my former pupils if separate individual reports are required. Generally, they are married at an early age, especially the girls, and carry on with household duties and the making of baskets etc. as they have learned at their homes when very young. A few leave home to do common labour and household work in nearby towns but as a general rule, they soon return to this or some nearby Reserve, are married and thereby a new home is established.\n\nBefore bringing this letter to an end, I wish to say that I have always found the Indian children to be as bright and intelligent as the average white ones and I like my position as their teacher. Of course they have their own distinctive and natural peculiarities but I am now so familiar with these that I find very little difficulty in mastering them.\n\nI welcome this opportunity of writing to you in a personal manner and thank you for your kind invitation to have me communicate with you at any time, an offer I will be only too glad to take advantage of when I have an occasion to do so. I wish to assure you that I will always be glad to carry out any instructions you may give or give you any information you may require and that I can supply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAlexander Macdonald\nTeacher\nIndian Day School,\nWhycocomagh, C.B., N.S.\nKatzie Indian Day School,\nPort Hammond, B.C.\n\nFeb. 22, 1937.\n\nR.A. Hoey Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of Jan. 25th. I am very interested in the proposed introduction of manual training and vocational instruction into the educational programme of Indian Schools.\n\nI will endeavor to supply any information about our reservation that may prove helpful, as you have asked for. The Indian boys from this day school have all been engaged in fishing after leaving school, but have had no other pursuits or occupations with which to occupy the season when fishing is slack. The Indian girls do some knitting and simple needlework and embroidery, for which they show considerable interest and aptitude. They seem anxious to dress just as the white people do, and are very interested in needlework for these practical reasons.\n\nThe Indians of this reservation are very anxious for instruction of this kind, such as lace-making, knitting, glove-making, dress-making, embroidery, basketry, and leatherwork for the girls. The Indian boys and men are especially interested in manual training which will enable them to make furniture for their homes, - and for those who excel in this work, to sell to the stores. They also expressed wish for even such advanced instruction which would enable them to build nicer homes, with some knowledge of interior decoration.\n\nHoping that this satisfactorily answers your enquiry, and with every good wish for the success of this splendid addition to Indian education,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMary Winter\nUnited Church Indian Day School,\nBerens River,\nManitoba.\nFeb. 19th, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Hey:\n\nI appreciate the letter which I have just received from you. It is a satisfaction to me to know that you are Supt.of our work. Manual training has a great future as an educative art. It has a special appeal and worth to Indians. In introducing it I hope you will give their own crafts precedence.\n\nIndian handicraft has a very strong appeal. A few years ago our Junior Red Cross sent a small present of this work to Winnipeg. On its merits it found its way to Toronto and thence to the International Red Cross Conference at Tokyo. The Japanese requested to keep it and sent us a present in return.\n\nA year ago we prepared our first portfolio for exchange under the Junior Red Cross. Again we had the joy of seeing it approved very well. It went to New Zealand. Some months ago special portfolio was received at Toronto for exchange. Miss Brown, the National Director, surprised us by asking us to accept it under the condition that we send a return. In her letter she said that she had chosen our school from all the schools in Canada that she had special knowledge of. Our Church later commended us that we had been selected from about 800 schools, many being city schools. Last October we sent our return via Winnipeg. It was held there and displayed at the Bay for some days. Our work has mostly been: bead-work, silk-work, knitting, painting, mocassins, and snow-shoes.\n\nI believe that this work has a special place to fill. It is this work which should be followed if manual work is to be stressed. There are Indian women who cannot make a pair of mocassins because their lives in youth were spent in schools away from home where these crafts were not practised. The best snow-shoe makers are the most illiterate. Ask a young graduate from a boarding school to make a moccasin and watch him blush.\n\nThe three most valuable sidelines we have followed apart from the above are: stamp-collecting, scrap-book work, and typewriting. All these are appealing to Indians and are assets in themselves.\n\nWe must not expect the Indians to make their gifts through us. They will make them when following their own instincts. Inert efforts to conform them by our visions, impulses and anecdotes will always bring the wrong results. The Follow-Up system may reveal this.\n\nWishing you the very best success in your great work.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. R.A. Hey,\nSupt. Of Welfare and Training,\nDept. Of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, February 27, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Street:\n\nPlease accept my most sincere thanks for your letter of the 19th instant and for the information contained therein.\n\nI was particularly pleased to learn of your handicraft work and of the success that had come to your pupils. It is somewhat difficult, of course, with the equipment at your disposal, to promote this work in the sense that it should be promoted. I am hopeful, however, that, in the rehabilitation programme we have now under consideration, provision will be made for the further extension of this work, especially in the outlying districts.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nColin D. Street, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nIndian Day School,\nBerens River, Man.\nBig Island Lake Indian Day School\nBeacon Hill, Sask.\nFeb. 20th, 1937\n\nHon. R.A. Hoey, Dept. of Welfare and Housing,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nNo. 708-598\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nYour circular letter to the teachers in charge of the Indian schools was received on the 16th Inst. I am anxious to get at once, on your request, also as a proof that I am much interested in the welfare of our poor Indian pupils.\n\nI made a careful perusal of the content of this highly important letter. Sincerely I felt much encouraged because I noticed that our highest official wished to cooperate efficiently with us. Something was being done in the right direction before, but there is much to do yet in the reorganization of this Board.\nYou are right in stating that most of the teachers in charge of Indian institutions have rendered conscientious and devoted service. That their missionary zeal and self-sacrifice have been much in evidence.\n\nTo my humble knowledge I ought to state sincerely that your success will depend pretty nearly entirely on what you say plainly in your lettering:\n\n\"Changes will be worked out in cooperation with representatives of the Church and with their approval.\"\n\nYou could not say better. There should be no room for bigotry and fanaticism who are causing hindrances to good work in this said Branch. The missionaries are working steadily without counting their pains for the welfare of the Indians do certainly know what should be done for their welfare. If not much result was obtained in raising the Indians to a satisfactory standard of life, considering the length of time that the Government formed an Indian Dept. is due largely to the lack of co-operation.\nof the Officials with the representatives of the Churches and I will add up with the representatives among themselves.\n\nI am very well aware that you have a gigantic task in your hands and it will take much courage and strength of character in order not to be discouraged easily in working for the Indians. We have to work for their welfare often against their own will.\n\nYou are entirely right in stating this: \"in educational programme provision should be made for a course of study that would enable the pupils to spend at least one third of their time at manual training or vocational instruction.\" It will require expenses in order to equip schools with necessary material for such manual work, but it should be done anyhow. The right way to go at it is to begin slowly in each school and progress little by little; for example supplying, one year, garden tools, the\ntools for woodwork etc. For girls, supply knitting needles, yarn, print etc so that they can knit stockings, mittens and make their dresses, aprons etc. A hand sewing machine should be supplied to each school etc etc. I might state that if you have not married teachers you will have hard job in your Day school to have manual training done for both boys and girls. It is very important that teachers have their residence on the Reserve otherwise they cannot follow up their pupils. They should have access to the farm stables, shop of the Farm instructor. For the school curriculum it is ridiculous to follow up the course of the Province we live in as the needs of the Indians are not the same as those of the White People. A summary course of studies should be planned by the experts of your dept of Education. Although lots should be left to the initiative and judgment of the teacher. As you state correctly you cannot make lists.\nchanges. It would not be wise neither.\n\nSome of your Indian agents should be trained not to only reduce expenses but to supply promptly the necessary things for the good operation of the schools and reserves. There should be more supervision in order to find out if schools are equipped properly and promptly. I do not here want to accuse anybody in particular.\n\nIt is in the mind of some of your officials that the teachers should be just confined to their school rooms, not to have any other work to perform on the Reserve. This is false. Teachers should be the very soul of the Reserve. Thus the necessity to hire only teachers well recommended by the Church Representatives and well qualified for this important employment.\n\nRegarding your \"Follow-up System\" I might say that it is of the greatest importance for your Indian Affairs Board to do this \"Follow-up\" as it will enable\nyou to see where the mistakes are made either in the Boarding schools or the Day schools so that they may be corrected. What I will suggest is to have a \"questionnaire\" not too complicated and short once in a while sent to the teachers of the Day schools regarding the best means to obtain the maximum success in such a purpose. Also to the Principals of Boarding Schools in order to find out the best means to accomplish a certain work. Questions can be sent also to the Representatives of the Church for the same purpose. By having the ideas of many you can pick up the best and suitable in order to put them in function.\n\nI think that the teachers on the Indian Reserve could keep you posted on the conduct and the work done by the children after they left school both of the Boarding and Day school pupils as well. A blank could be supplied by the \"Indian Affairs Branch\" to that effect so that the teachers would fill it in at\nleast once a year.\n\nThe both Boarding and Day schools should operate and are necessary, regulations should be made to define which children should attend the Boarding School in the Agency or the Day School on the Reserve. In small places the Boarding School is ruining the Day School as it is making a huge campaign, a mad run after pupils for the said Boarding School. In my opinion children under 12 years of age who are not orphan, feeble, abandoned should assist to the Day School on their Reserve. For this point also you can get in touch with the Church Representative who could give you suggestions on the matter. Something very serious must be done in order to have Day School pupils attend school more regularly. That is a great proposition.\n\nI have over twenty years experience in teaching and have also been in business\nfor over fifteen years trading with Indians of the North West Territories, Alberta and Saskatchewan. I understand the character and the needs of the Indians very well. It is a sad thing to see how the Indians have been abused by some traders and merchants robbing them of their work, cattle, horses etc. Now the Dept. hope to give relief to them who should be very well off. This is another thing that the Dept. shall see to in a wise manner.\n\nIn the medical branch of your Dept., something must be done in order that the enormous sum of money spent each year for the sanitary and health condition of the Indians, produce a better result. Since about 70% of the Indian children do not reach the age of going to school, dying before being 15 years old, there is surely a very great reform to work out. Medicines that are sent to the agents shall not be retained at the Agency but distributed right off when they are needed.\nI am living here with my family on the Big Island Lake Indian Reserve in north-western Saskatchewan, right in the bush. Indians are full-blooded Indians. Some wearing their long hair and quite a few are still going keeping their old traditions. The Day School is open since 2 years. Everything here is at a beginning. The Reserve is about 42 square miles. If you wish to make a trial test of some kind for a Day School I will be pleased to co-operate with you very heartily.\n\nOne thing I like to bring to your attention is not to try to make White People with the Indians but just lift them up to a better standard of living mentally and physically and this in remaining Indians.\n\nOf course I am writing all this on the strength of your letter stating: \"I want you to feel perfectly free to communicate with me at any time.\" I hope that this\nLetter in order! Your field of action is so vast comprising the whole Dominion and the needs of our Agency is sometimes contrary of another making things very complicated to settle up. The wants of the agencies and reserves are not always alike. Pretty much every agency has their own particularities.\n\nWishing you success in your new field of action and hoping to have the pleasure to read you soon again,\n\nI am,\nYours Respectfully,\nJ. H. Liette\n\n[Signature]\n\nBeacon Hill,\nSask.\nOttawa, March 1st, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Lirette:\n\nPlease accept my most sincere thanks for your letter of the 20th ultimo and for the information contained therein. I can assure you that your prompt and courteous reply to my circular letter is very deeply appreciated.\n\nI am writing at this time to assure you that the suggestions contained in your communication will receive very careful and very sympathetic consideration.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoby,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J. H. Lirette,\nTeacher,\nBig Island Lake Indian Day School,\nBeacon Hill, Sask.\nIndian Day School,\nRestigouche, February 25, 1937.\n\nMr R.A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your honored letter of January 15, (150-60) and beg to assure you of my heartfelt gratitude for the interest you so kindly expressed in behalf of the teaching body of Indian schools.\n\nYour opinion regarding our educational programme is in perfect accordance with my own. Our own pupils have proved to be much more inclined towards manual training than intellectual science, the former being more necessary to them in their postschool years. This is why we have made it our duty since several years to train the girls of this school in household science, as much as circumstances allowed; this explains also why we lately solicited, and \"easily obtained\" from the Department, the means of purchasing a few tools and a little wood to\nprovide the boys with manual work, which contributes largely in keeping them to school.\n\nI very respectfully take advantage of this opportunity to recall the honorable Board of Indian Affairs the urgency of building here a new school provided with special rooms for the training of boys and girls to manual work peculiar to each sex. The room measuring 16 x 9 ft actually at our disposal for such purpose is barely sufficient to give a decent domestic training to the little girls of our day school. If it were suitable in size and had more accommodations the Indian girls could be invited to come several times a week, after they have left school, and under the direction of a special teacher devoted merely to post-school work, they could continue their course in domestic science: viz. cooking, sewing, gardening, etc. and be incited to good behavior in their respective employments; their \"postschool\" teacher could see by herself, either by visits to their homes or skilful inquiries, how they profit by the lessons received, and search means of improving their ways if necessary.\n\nWould this not be a practical means of getting in touch with our pupils after they leave school, and of realizing the \"Follow-up System\" you are logically planning. Most of our pupils, on leaving school, are hired as servants in Campbellton and surroundings.\n\nI would be pleased to know your opinion about my respectful suggestions, and I trust you will kindly present to the consideration of the Department the question of a new building\nhere and favor it as best you can.\n\nThanking you once more for your benevolence I remain,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSister Mary of St Leo Principal\nThe Salvation Army\nGlen Vowell Mission,\nHazelton B.C.,\nFebruary 20th, 1937.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYours of January 15th. to hand. Glad to note your interest in and appreciation of the work of the various Churches and their representatives. This is encouraging indeed.\n\nI am interested in your plan to devote more time to manual training and vocational instruction.\n\nThis is the first intimation I have received of such a change and would like to hear more about it and to know what equipment a teacher may apply for. At the present there is no equipment here of any description.\n\nYou speak of the \"Follow-up System?\" That should benefit both the Department and the Indians. As there is nothing the Indian girls can do after they leave school and until they are married, they are forced to sell their bodies and soul for a living. This is no idle statement and there is plenty of evidence in this country. The boys, as a rule go trapping and fishing with their father and also work at odd jobs at pole camps etc. Any effort for the betterment of the girls, children or anyone, will receive our hearty co-operation.\n\nHoping to hear from you again,\n\nI remain,\nAdjutant A.F. Parkinson.\nRed Bank,\nNorthumberland Co.,\nNew Brunswick, Canada,\n\nFeb. 24th, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYour communication No-150-60, received, inviting my ideas on an educational system of welfare and training for Indians. Although having lived many years with the Indian and having labored educationally and otherwise for some thirty years among them, I feel my knowledge is nevertheless rather provincial which no doubt gave rise to our present educational system, still I feel that it is not impossible to have some kind of a standardized system for the Dominion of Canada as a whole.\n\nOur present system logically has no other end in view, then the ultimate absorbing in time of the Indian within the ranks of the Whites which today is being done; naturally therefore a system of education had to be inaugurated partly on the same base as our Provincial white schools, yet flanked by a strong domestic training, with the whole firmly bound together by sound religious principles thus bringing out everything and developing every part of the soul so that one faculty, or power, may not be developed at the expense of the other, with, of course, due attention given to the education of the heart, the affections and the will.\n\nSuch an education, I feel, far surpasses, in the end that of the intellect, since no amount of knowledge can, in so, make a man good, pure, honest or obedient,-this is too often demonstrated by the all too many moral derelicts that have through life menaced sound society by not a few of the world's intellectual \"RIGHTS.\"\n\nIf to the above system were added manual training which the Ind Dept., at Ottawa, to date, has refused, if also the system of dole, to our Indians that has so undermined our teaching of thrift, were checked, again if proper supervision by Ind. agents were given to the Ind. home in general,-Eg.-seeing that seed given by the Dept. was really planted, not eaten nor sold, that crops so planted were properly cared for and harvested, likewise inducements held out for tidy thrifty homes, etc., etc., etc.,-if finally a few of the very small reserves could be moved to larger ones, then we would have a system that would open a better road on which the Indian here could more surely walk side by side with his neighbor the white man thus tending to the end I had in view when I inaugurated our present system. Even now under present conditions many of our young Indian boys and girls, in work, thrift, style, dress, habits, etc., etc., far surpass the average whites.\n\nIt would here require many pages to explain in detail our present educational system, however a glance over my biannual reports that should be found in the Dept. of Ind. affairs would quickly give you a good insight into this system. Inclosed you will please find a few of our teacher's monthly reports that may explain matters somewhat ----There could be another system based on the fact that it was the intention of the Government to ever keep the Indian as an Indian yet in a somewhat civilized form. In this case I feel apominien standard could be utilized. All Indians of the Maritime provinces might be placed on one Reserve, or for that matter, from four or five provinces, or grouped together by denomination, or tribes, etc., etc., etc.,-then upon these large Reserves churches, schools, hospitals, could be constructed, mills, machineries, woodworking factories, etc., could be erected, farm machinery supplied, etc., thus while carrying out their own craft, they could also become somewhat acquainted with that of the whiteman. In this case a limited academic education, sufficient to carry on their affairs, would be quite enough, since they would have apart their common life while greater attention could then be given to manual training in all kinds of craft work.\n\nRespectfully and humbly submitted for your kind interest,\n\nYours devoutly,\n\nR.A. HOEY,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nInd. Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Can.\nOttawa, March 1st, 1937.\n\nReverend Sister:\n\nPlease accept my most sincere thanks for your letter of the 26th ultimo and for the information contained therein.\n\nI note, with interest, your reference to the desirability of additional school accommodation in your district. You will be glad to learn that this matter has been carefully reviewed and that the appropriation necessary to proceed with the work was included in the Estimates now before Parliament. It is reasonable to suppose that the building will be erected in due course.\n\nI was particularly pleased to learn of your interest in vocational instruction. It is my hope that you will be able to gradually extend this work when you are provided with the necessary equipment.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Heay,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Sister Mary of St. Leo,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Day School,\nRestigouche, Que.\nOttawa, March 1st, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Parkinson:\n\nPlease accept my most sincere thanks for your letter of the 20th ultimo and for the information contained therein.\n\nWhen I expressed the view that approximately one-third of the regular school period should be devoted to manual training, I had in mind a general objective toward which we should work gradually. I am not, of course, expecting the impossible, particularly in the case of the smaller day schools. The Minister, speaking in Parliament a few days ago, took the position that our course of study would have to become gradually more practical and more vocational in character, and it is our duty, of course, in so far as is humanly possible, to carry out his wishes in this regard.\n\nWe are prepared, from time to time, to make a small allowance for vocational equipment. This policy has been followed for a number of years, I understand, in the province of British Columbia. If you feel that the pupils in attendance at your school would profit from a course in, say, carpentry, you should discuss the matter with the Inspector when he calls upon you and, with him, work out a programme adapted to the peculiar needs of your district. Any request for vocational equipment should really be endorsed by the Inspector and forwarded to us through the Agent. I have learned, from experience, that it is best to start in a small way, particularly when the accommodation at your disposal is limited.\n\nAgain thanking you for your letter, I remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.

C.\nOttawa, March 1st, 1937.\n\nDear Father Ryan:\n\nPlease accept my most sincere thanks for your letter of the 24th ultimo and for the monthly reports, attached thereto, which I found very interesting.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that the views you express, in respect to a worthwhile educational programme, are pretty much in accord with my own. My limited experience, however, does not permit me to comment upon the suggestion you offer with regard to the centralisation of Indian administration in the Maritime Provinces.\n\nI understand that Mr. Christianson, the recently appointed General Superintendent of Agencies, will visit the Maritime Provinces in the course of a few weeks. He will be sure to call upon you at that time. I want you to feel perfectly free, when you meet him, to discuss with him any problems you may have in mind, and particularly, of course, the problems relating to the welfare and management of our schools. If you do this, I shall be glad to discuss the situation in the Maritimes with Mr. Christianson, immediately following his return.\n\nAgain thanking you for your letter, I remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.

At present the work is conducted in very much the same way and by the same instructor.\n\nAs to the progress made by the pupils after they left school, not one has made a trade of it. But what they have learned has helped them a great deal in their own way. Three of them have been able to put up a fairly good size house. Two others helped their parents in putting up new houses for themselves. One shortly after he left school made an addition to his father's house to accommodate his grand mother.\n\nMy humble opinion is that, the Indians around here lacking ambition and initiative, will not go beyond this for some time to come.\n\nThe general attitude of the pupils towards this kind of work is good. They like it. Their parents, ex-pupils of long ago, have said many times that they were sorry for not having had such an opportunity. And whenever white visitors come to the school and see what is done by our Indian children they envy their lot, as compared to what is done in most places for their own.\n\nMay I mention that apart from the main building all the others have been put up and are kept in repair by the manual training instructor and the pupils.\n\nTrusting that these few remarks answer the purpose of this letter I beg to remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYours obediently\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nKitwanga B.C.\n17 Feb '37\n\nDear Mr. Heey,\n\nYours under date of Jan 25 '37 just received.\n\nI shall be glad to consider some of the notes in your circular letter I wrote later.\n\nMy wife & I have for several years been actively engaged in Indian work and make it our personal endeavor at all times to cooperate with their advance as far as possible in every way.\n\nThere are several suggestions I may write later.\n\nAt all times willing to help especially if specifically required to do so faithfully.\n\nB. Shearman\nLittle Grand Rapids March 5thi 1937\n\nRe: Mr. Hoey Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter January 15th just received, it had been addressed via Barrens River hence the delay we have absolutely no communication with Barrens River in the winter months, via Winnipeg ensures quicker service during winter.\n\nI am very thankful to know that You are deeply interested in regards to our Pupils, this gives me a chance to lay before You our problems here.\n\nFirst - I am of the same opinion namely that the Indian children ought to have Instructions in Gardening Carpentry and Mechanics the Girls in Sewing Knitting and other Household Duties.\n\nSecondly - The pupils that leave School ought to be helped and encouraged.\n\nBut our big problem is this - Our people here are hunters and Trappers, we have helped a few in building of homes and the making of gardens but the majority are still leading a very nomadic life, never home very long they move about continually trying to make a living. This does not give their Children a chance to attend School hence very poor progress, I do not know how long a School has been established here but at least several decades yet there is not one Indian here that speaks or understands English.\n\nThis is our tenth year here and we have tried hard, we have tried to get a Truant Officer (as the Parents of Indian Children do not seem to have any control over them) for whenever a child does not wish to go to School it just wont go but without Success. A lot of our Pupils do understand English, yet You cannot get them to talk it outside of School.\n\nI feel that the money spent here could be used to a much better Advantage than it is at present re Education.\n\nThere are two Schools here yet a third of the Children belonging to this Reserve never receive any Education as their parents settled about 9 miles northeast from here.\nAfter being ten years on this ground I have come to the conclusion that the only remedy to ensure better education here is this\u2014\n\nTo have only One School here and a good One in fact a Boarding School where the Children would stay when the Parents go hunting, there are about one hundred Children here all told, the most of whom receive hardly any education and are dreadfully neglected.\n\nThere should never be two Schools of different faiths especially Protestant and Catholic allowed on one Reserve as there is continual friction; for instance here, we are very tolerant and never say anything re the Reds here, yet they tell our people that their religion is wrong those that are married by us are told they are not married at all pictures are given to the people showing them that the only way to heaven is past the pope that Martin Luther with Buddha and others are on their way to hell which is very confusing to the Indian people to say the least.\n\nAs the Methodist School was here first and has the most Adherents and as the best way for all concerned would be one School in which all the Children would receive proper attention and care I move that the Charge over this School would be given to the United Church of Canada who would supply about eighty children from their people.\n\nAnother item in favor of a Boarding School here would be that the Parents could see their Children be satisfied of their welfare; they never consent to have their children sent out to another Boarding School further by spending their Summer holidays at home they would not be taken out of their environment and could keep in touch with their surroundings, we have seen pupils return from Industrial Schools on to the Reserve (the only place where they could go) absolutely helpless and useless.\n\nFinancially it would not cost much more as the two Schools combined now cost as a lot of the food could be grown here quite successfully also fish and quite a bit of meat. Today we are giving our School children for their Midday meal Potatoes (grown) in our garden and Whitefish of which I caught a thousand last fall, we also have about twenty goats half of them milking and some poultry all of these do quite well here.\n\nPupils graduating from these Schools here would have a good chance to secure work in the different mines here not far from their homes.\n\nI am writing this in haste but would be very glad to furnish You with any particulars that You may be interested in,\n\nYours very truly\n\n[Signature]\nIndian School,\nRed Pheasant,\nSask.\nMarch 1st, 1937.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter with reference to the Educational Programme\u2014Although the general public think the education given to the Indians too abstract and too academic, personally I feel that time spent on the academic portion of the studies, especially English, is very necessary. My reason for this is the English language is essential. With my own pupils, I have found them reluctant to converse with strangers visiting the school, even though I know they understand everything that is said to them. I have struggled to overcome this difficulty by encouraging them to ask questions. I use pictures to illustrate happenings, sport, and scenes in other countries, thus trying to show them how other people live. Most of my pupils have never been farther than 25 miles from the Reserve. I may say here the reluctance to converse is not confined to the pupils of this day school. I have found pupils here on holiday from the Residential Schools have the same handicap, and I feel this is a drawback, for as they grow older they lose their English, instead of becoming more proficient, and so cannot express their thoughts clearly when conversing or making deals with white people\u2014the result, the Indian becomes suspicious even though there is no reason for it.\n\nIf the pupils ask questions it shows their minds are working\u2014they are not taking things for granted, and their English is not \"parrot fashion.\"\n\nI have had experience in several New Canadian schools and most decidedly more repetition is needed with Indian scholars\u2014this delays progress.\n\nThe Manual Training and Vocational Instruction should help with English as well, if the pupils are encouraged to ask questions and give their ideas.\n\nManual Training for boys, say from Grade IV onward would be splendid, serving perhaps as an incentive to more regular attendance and advanced study.\n\nI have given much thought to the results of the Residential and Day schools. The Residential School is fine but I do feel it must be quite a hardship for a pupil to return from a school that has every modern convenience to a one room house on the Reserve\u2014this one room housing the whole family\u2014with the most necessary utensils and conveniences lacking. It means the ex-pupil has to completely readjust himself or herself\u2014and in some cases the readjustment results in going back further than if he or she had never left the Reserve.\nWould it be advantageous to have pupils attend the Day School until they reach Grade IV? (I do not mean orphan or those who have lost their mother.) I have often thought this might have a stabilizing and disciplinary effect on the parents, causing them to realize their responsibilities toward their children. Some of them think that once a child has reached school age, the responsibility for food, clothing, and shelter lies with the Residential School (and not with the parent) until the child has graduated. If they found their children had to attend the Day School until they reach Grade IV, the Indians would make an effort to see their children were punctual, regular and hardworking at lessons.\n\nI find the Indians are not able to act on their own initiative\u2014they seem to want a guiding hand\u2014but even here their prejudices are aroused, though the guiding hand is all for the good of the Indians.\n\nThe Follow-up system should tend to give the ex-pupils the idea the Indian Department is interested in their doing and watching to see if they make good. At present dancing is their chief recreation and the morals of some of the younger generation are not all they should be by a wide margin. If they knew morals were included in the Follow-up report surely this fact would be a great help. The Follow-up system could easily be filled in by the Teacher on the Reserve, using various headings as to number of cattle, horses etc.; acres in crop, married or single, general behaviour, work carried on in summer, in winter etc., forwarded to Ottawa.\n\nIt must be taken into consideration that at the present time boys leaving school have nothing to start out with\u2014no horses, no cattle, no implement of any kind, no money, and a very small chance of earning any, so no wonder their morals are at fault\u2014they have nothing to occupy their minds.\n\nIf a lantern were placed at the schools, education could be carried on among the older people in the winter by means of slides. These slides can be obtained from the Provincial Govt. at Regina. The lantern could be used for the school children to help in their study of Geography and History.\n\nI trust what I have written may be of some little help to you in your future plans. I have tried my best to get the pupils to be open, straightforward, and honest. The children are not as energetic as other races. I often think this is due to poor living conditions with scarcity of food, as my pupils always seem more alert after their noon meal.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nHenry Reynolds\nAnglican Ind.

I do feel a lot more could be done, but we have an inspector who demands we give, and expects as much of these children, as he gets with white ones. It does not come natural to them, they have little behind them. They love freedom of action.\n\nOf course, I have come across a few, interested in and ambitious for academic work, about 5% of all I have taught. These I would give time to, as I find when they are interested the work is easy and pleasant.\n\nThe follow up work might be done through the teachers keeping in, or with, their registers, an up to date account of pupils passing out.

Hoey Esq.,\nSupt of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nYour letter of Jan. 15th. to all teachers in\nthe Indian work was received by me this week, and was read\nwith great interest, more particularly as it was in entire\nopposition to what we had been given to understand would be\nthe result of the change over in this agency at least.\n\nThe school here is a day school and at present\nis in a very primary stage the highest grade being Gr. 2.\nOne of the greatest difficulties on the reserves is with\nregard to attendance. Just as soon as a boy or a girl is\nbeginning to show some progress he or she is so often taken\nout of school, and there seems to be no way of making\nattendance compulsory. In addition to this the parents on\nso many of the reserves are naturally nomads, and pack\nup and go on the least excuse. This reserve subsists entirely\nby hunting and fishing so there is very little to hold them\nwithin school distance.\n\nThis is only the second year that I have had\ncharge of this particular school, and I was fortunate in\nthat I followed a man who had been unsuccessful. Though\nthis meant starting at the beginning with the pupils it also\nmeant that it was easier to get the interest, and so I have\nfelt that to a great extent I have the parents behind me, with\nexceptions of course, and have had a fairly regular attendance\nthroughout the year, except for sickness. This year we have\naveraged 18 for the whole year.\n\nWith regard to manual or vocational training, I\nshould be greatly interested in any scheme put forward to\nencourage this. So far as my girls are concerned I have given\nas much time as possible to needlework; all of them except\nthis year's beginners having mitts, socks, and underwear of\ntheir own making. As I have provided quite a lot of their\nclothing through various friends, I have been able to insist\ntoo that this is kept in good repair, by either parents or\npupils. Even the boys have mitts of their own making. In\naddition the girls get lessons in dish-washing, sweeping and\ncleaning, in connection with the school dinners, besides the\nwashing of towels and dishtowels. I have always felt that\nthe day schools have the advantage in this respect, as it is possible to teach using practically the same tools which they would have to use at home, the wash-board for instance. I have applied to the W.A., asking them to provide two suits of underwear such as would be provided for the same children if they attended a boarding school undertaking to supervise the washing and repair of the same, as a regular part of the school-work. However nothing has been forth-coming as yet, and there are not the facilities in the present school building for further laundry experiments.\n\nWhen I first came to Canada I started a manual instruction class in my school on the prairie, and the boys there were very interested in making quite a number of articles. We had two quite neat little cupboards, one as a museum with glass doors which the boys had made, and every boy contrived to have something, varying from a knife-and-fork-box to a radio table for his parents at Christmas. I was very fortunate there in that the trustees provided all the tools I asked for and made me a very solid work-bench. Naturally I should not think of comparing the work with that of an expert carpenter, but the boys and the parents were very proud of the results.\n\nAgain with the present building such work would not be practical, but as the school is in such dangerous condition that the agent advised dismissing the pupils in the event of a high wind, lest it should collapse on them, I feel sure that plans must be afoot for a new one, which will I hope have a basement.\n\nSo far as is possible I can assure you of cooperation in any schemes for improving the education in the Indian schools. At the same time I agree with you that in the day schools at least, the instruction given compares very favourably with that given in the rural schools of the Dominion.\n\nWith many thanks for your letter and its note of encouragement,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGora Merritt.\nOttawa, March 11, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Schuetze:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant and to state, by way of comment, that I appreciate very fully your prompt and courteous reply to my circular letter of January 15th.\n\nI am writing at this time to state that the suggestions contained in your communication will be very carefully and sympathetically considered.

Athey,\nSup't. of Welfare and Training,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your letter, which was delivered February 18. I appreciate its common sense and gentleness.\n\nMy two years' experience with the Indians cannot be of great help to you. Too bad you sent us word to the Reverend Father in charge; you would have suggestions this time, and up to date.\n\nHowever, I'll write:\n\n1. Our teaching is too academic. I think so, for the class we teach. Such was our training, every one of us; but it is very different to be in contact with the Indian mind.\n\n2. One-third devoted to manual training. I cordially approve. That is what we do.\n\n3. Some change in the Program. It is already on a low standard, in the primary grades. I think at least compared to the East. Children of the East, both Americans and Canadians have had some training.\nbefore school age; they have ideas, notions already, they speak our language; they are interested, and so are their parents; they attend regularly, they have ambition, they memorize easily, just the opposite for the Indian child. Dullness, poor health, illiterate parents, no ambition, irregular attendance. What can we do especially with the day scholars? The inmates have more chance, and they get ahead. At the age of ten or eleven, the brightest can manage the three R's, more or less, but I have boys of fourteen still in the Grade 1. I am sending a specimen, one of my former pupils, First year junior high, of Lewiston, Maine. Age fourteen, one out of twenty pupils. Not the brightest. Compare with my brightest up here. Half Breed girl, 15, Grade 6. I am not a bit discouraged, but I feel like changing my methods, as I can't lead them. I have simply to follow them according to their primitive state of mind.\n\nReturning to the following system, we keep in contact with our pupils by correspondence and visits. They feel they are welcome any time.\n\nThese hints are nothing, and no doubt you'll have to read interesting pages written by the principals of the leading schools of the country, and I can but applaud.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nSister Moir\n\nDear Sir,\nForest, March 4, 1937.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nDept. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour kind letter of January 25th was received. Your interest in our work and in the welfare of the Indian population is appreciated and encouraging.\n\nIn the work on the Reservation I find vocational instruction of great importance. Records show that no pupil has gone beyond the sixth grade at about the age of thirteen the children become restless and difficult to instruct. They marry early or do whatever work can be found so that the academic work during school life seems unimportant in comparison with the fundamental rules of health, sanitation and a knowledge of the\nnative handicrafts. They are eager to read while at school but I see no evidence of this interest prompting the ownership of books in the home.\n\nOur equipment for manual training and sewing is limited. We bought some tools and materials with prize money from the local fair, where the children marched in the parade and had an exhibit of school work.\n\nYour suggestion of a \"Follow-up system\" is very interesting. It should be a wonderful help in the community life which is at a standstill here.\n\nRecently I wrote to the Department of Indian Affairs asking for a residence in connection with the school so that I can take a more active part in the welfare of the Reservation. I drive ten miles daily to school so I have little opportunity to cultivate a community club or any welfare work at all.\nYour Department has been very kind to me during my six years in the Stoney Point School. I will welcome any plan or opportunity to help the young people of the Reservation for there is a great work to be done here among people who haven't even a weekly church service.\n\nHoping that I may be of service to you and your Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMary E. Anderson,\nForest, Ont.\n\nTeacher at Stoney Point.\nFredericton, New Brunswick,\nRural Route No. 6\nFebruary 25, 1937.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoag,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training\nOttawa\nCanada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI was greatly pleased to be asked for suggestions regarding the improvement in the welfare of our Indians.\n\nWe try to follow as closely as possible the programme set down for the white schools as well as imparting Christian Doctrine and spending three hours per week in Domestic Science work. Our Domestic Science instruction comes under the following headings:\nknitting, making mats and quilts, patching, visiting homes and lectures. We are supplied fifteen dollars' worth of material yearly which is too small to cover a year's work. The Department will not supply the day schools with sewing machines. This means the pupil has to take the article to some home to be sewn and when not supervised is often unsatisfactory.\n\nThe boys follow the same course as the girls and this work does not appeal to them, and I might say is of little use to them in after life as the women on this Reserve take care of it. The Indian boy loves hard work and some of my pupils\nhave made rough but very good imitations of snow-shovels, steam-shovels, animals, Indian heads, boats, violins, aeroplanes, a gun (that really shoots) etc.\n\nSome of the older Indians on my Reserve do lovely work now. What could they do with proper training?\n\nI think that a more thorough course of Manual Training and Domestic Science should be carried out in our schools. This could be accomplished by employing a teacher to give three lessons per week. In this way the same teachers could take the classes in the three schools in this section, namely - Oromocto, St. Mary's and Kingsclear.\n\nRegarding the \"Follow Up.\"\nplan that you suggested\nthey could also be included\nin these classes those boys\nand girls who have recently\nleft school or are under twenty-\none.\n\nIn the Domestic Science\ncourse for girls I would\nsuggest that it include \"The\nCare and Feeding of Children\".\nI feel if the girls had the\nproper training there would\nbe more demand for Indian\ngirls for domestic service in\nthe homes of the white people.\nThis would fill in those\nyears between fifteen and\ntwenty when ordinarily the\nIndian girl remains at\nhome, dependent on the Dept.\nand too often marries too young.\n\nYours very sincerely,\nEstelle M. O'Brien\nHartley Bay, B.C.\nMarch 3, 1937.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI received your circular letter and am very glad that there is an increasing interest on the part of the Dept. of Indian Affairs in the educational welfare of the Indian boys and girls.\n\nAlthough I have been but two years in this particular work, I have a great deal of interest in it and in the people themselves. Your letter contained suggestions of possible changes in the days to come in regards to the educational policy now in force.\n\nI am taking the opportunity, therefore, to express to you some of the ideas I have formed in the short time in the work. These are very likely not at all new, and no doubt have been expressed before, but I submit them for what they may be worth\u2014as criticisms\u2014constructive at least.\n\nIt is to be understood that what is said here is in relation to the conditions existing in this village and others of a similar type. This is a fishing village\u2014always has been and always will be; the boys and men are engaged solely in making a living by means of fishing and trapping. There cannot be any other means of earning a living by the people here. The terrain does not permit it; logging is finished in the immediate vicinity and since the ground is boggy and muskeg, the possibility of farming is entirely out of the question.\nI heartily agree with the suggestion of some type of vocational instruction, but you can see that from the above existing conditions a choice is hardly available.\n\nIn day schools such as the one here where there are some thirty-three pupils, ranging from six years to seventeen, and in grades from one to eight, the task seems even a more difficult one. It would be a physical impossibility to expect one teacher, no matter how capable, to teach, in addition to scholastic studies, such training as mechanics, carpentry, etc., to say nothing of cooking and household science among the girls in the school.\n\nThe fact that there are Residential Schools in various parts of the country does not minimize the difficulty. Just to send some or all of the pupils to a school such as that for some kind of vocational training after a few terms in their village day school would not fairly solve the problem.\n\nThere is, however, to me at least, a manner in which the difficulty might be solved, or at least smoothened into a solution.\n\nThere has always been advocated at some time or other that there should be some type of follow-up system of school graduates, especially those of a residential school where the graduates are supposed, as a result of their training to be more fitted to take a place in the world.\n\nIt is however, a well known fact that there is not much of a place for him or her in the white man's world\u2014at least not until our white social system opens up a place for them. Therefore the logical conclusion to arrive at would be that there should be a place for them among their own people. This however presents the question that it is not fair to expect the Indian to return to his people and work among them for nothing.\n\nI am of course still bearing in mind that all this is\nbearing on the education of the Indian child who is attending the day school in his or her own village.\n\nTherefore would it not be an idea worth considering to have suitably trained young men and women chosen from the particular village to which they belong return there to take up the work of training the boys and girls in the day schools along the lines most suited to the employment at present of the majority of people in the villages?\n\nAs I have already stated, the work as a result of geographical surroundings in this village is limited to trapping and fishing. The latter brings to mind the thought of training in carpentry, boat-building, mechanics, and navigation for the boys. I added navigation to the list since only a few months ago a regulation was enforced whereby no man may act as skipper of a fish packer without owning a certificate obtained by examination\u2014and this entails instruction. This regulation affects a number of Indians, one at least in this village.\n\nThe problem arises as to fair remuneration for such a native instructor. That point, however, does not enter here save to state that too large a remuneration would have as disastrous an effect as an unfair one. Surely a fair estimate could be arrived at.\n\nI have been stressing training for boys\u2014certainly the idea could be evolved along suitable lines for girls.\n\nI am not advocating that such instruction replace the present, but I do submit that one-third of the school time could be given over to this training, with the entire structure supervised as to time, regularity, etc., by the white teacher in charge of the day school.\n\nSuch a plan would be feasible all over whether the employ-\nmany of the people was fishing, farming, lumbering or mining. It would mean a drastic change in curriculum, but I heartily agree with you that the curriculum could stand it.\n\nNo doubt the idea arises that such a plan would take years before it could be carried out. I do not think so. I sincerely believe that it could be put into force in a very short time. In almost every village some young man or woman with sufficient knowledge now could be the pioneers. I do know that in this village, carpentry and boat-building could be started any time proper equipment was furnished and the necessary arrangements were made.\n\nThe above is written only after some considerable thought on the matter and from actual observations made while engaged in the work. All is submitted in the spirit of co-operation and with all assurances of good will,\n\nyours very sincerely,\n\nJ.A. Findlay\nTeacher, Indian Day School.\nBloodvein,\nMatheson Island P.O.,\nManitoba,\nMarch 6th, 1937.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nDept. Of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just received the friendly and cordial letter you have sent out to the teachers in the Indian School. I feel that it is going to be greatly appreciated by all.\n\nI fully agree with the opinion expressed in the fourth paragraph of your letter. I have often thought that too many subjects are taught to our Indian children, with the result that when they leave the schools they have not had the time to grasp thoroughly the important and useful branches. In 1926 I wrote to the Department at Ottawa asking if they could not see their way clear to provide a few tools so that the boys could be taught elementary carpenter work and I also asked if provision could not be made so that we could give the girls some domestic training. I presume that the time was not propitious for such a request as I received no answer.\n\nI have been teaching in the day schools on Lake Winnipeg for eighteen years now. I have seen boys come back from various schools with diplomas obtained in various subjects but I have yet to see these same lads have a chance to utilize their advanced education. A pupil who has shown exceptional talent should not be allowed to come back to a reserve where his or her only means of obtaining a living is by fishing or trapping.\n\nI believe that for schools situated in northern parts or rather isolated spots a programme of studies consisting of reading writing and useful arithmetic, with some knowledge of his country (Canada) is sufficient.\n\nI trust, Mr. Hoey, that I have not been too outspoken and feel sure that you will notice that the above remarks only apply to schools with the same surroundings as ours. I have always thought the world of my little Indian kiddies and anything which will lead to their benefit is the only object I have in mind.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nThe Pas Indian Day School,\nThe Pas, Man.\nFeb. 28th, 1937\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI was very pleased to receive your letter of January 25th, 1937 and to note that you wish teachers to feel free to communicate with you.\n\nI have only been in Indian work for five years, but here are many suggestions that I have longed to make with regard to changes in the educational programme.\n\nAs regards manual training and vocational instruction, I heartily agree with you. It is only about one child out of every hundred who goes beyond the eighth grade in the Day School. There are many things that could be taken off the course of study and the time given to some training more beneficial. In the above school the boys are in the majority and older than the girls. I would like to teach the boys gardening while the girls knit, hook rugs, do raffia work. On this particular Reserve there is no farming but all attempt gardening to the extent of planting & harvesting potatoes only.\n\nAll the children are fond of\nreading, but there are many selections in their Readers that they cannot possibly understand. We have a pre-primer for Indians and I should very much like to see a whole new set of Readers put out for them.\n\nThis not being a farming country, the Indians depend entirely upon hunting and trapping for a livelihood. At the beginning of March, they move to the trapping grounds with their families and do not return until the end of May. The boys learn to trap and the girls help with the skinning and cooking. I agree with this, for the Boarding School Boy cannot trap when he returns to the Reserve. However, it is also impossible for them to make up three months work during the month of June. As a remedy for this, I would suggest that the School be closed for the long holiday during the 'Rat Season' and kept open throughout the Summer, except for a short period at the end of July and the beginning of August when it is far too hot for School. Of course, this would not be so pleasant for the Teachers, but we except a few disadvantages when we enter the work.\nRe your \"Follow-up System\", I am afraid that you will meet several obstacles. The Boarding School children often go hundreds of miles away when they leave School. The children from this School usually stay on the Reserve for a while and then go to points on the Hudson Bay Railway where it is impossible to keep track of them as there is no agent, minister or teacher. So far, I have been unable to think of any way in which this work can be accomplished.\n\nAnother thing that I would like to see, is work provided for orphans leaving Boarding Schools instead of sending them back to the Reserves.\n\nMay I wish you success in all your undertakings.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAnne Wright.\nOxford House,\nManitoba.\nFeb. 22, 1937.\n\nSupl. R.A. Hoey\nDept. of Mines.\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI was indeed grateful for your kind and most encouraging letter. I was deeply interested in your remarks about vocational instruction. Undoubtedly, it is the only way we can be of any definite service to the Indian race.\n\nIt is especially necessary for the girls who marry at an early age, untrained and depending entirely on a local store for clothing, stockings etc purchased at an exorbitant price.\n\nKnowing how drab and colorless their homes would be, I have been working out a plan with the school girls and boys along the lines mentioned in your letter.\n\nWe began last year with the yarn sent up by the Government. For the past few years the yarn had been given to the children to take home. Whether or not it had been used for the children I could not ascertain. One thing was certain...\nThe school girls could not knit. There were very few needles but that obstacle was soon overcome. One energetic father cut wire into correct lengths and laboriously filed until needles of the right size were produced. Soon other fathers did the same and the chief made larger wooden needles for the beginners.\n\nWe worked at recess, dinner hour and on Friday afternoons. Girls from seven to ten years made scarves. Girls from ten to fifteen made mittens. Mittens were also made for the boys. This gave additional practice.\n\nAfter Christmas I bought flannelette and each girl cut, basted and sewed a pair of bloomers. This was followed by white cotton which was made into handkerchiefs hemstitched and embroidered.\n\nThey were so eager and learned so quickly that a more extensive program was planned for this year. We started again with the yarn supplied by the Government. Girls from seven to ten years knit mittens or sweaters. Girls from ten to fourteen years knit short socks. They became very popular on the Reserve and odd women who could knit appeared with socks.\nlike the school girls.\n\nI had purchased enough pretty print for a dress for every girl. They had a choice of color and pattern. Every girl made the entire dress herself with my supervision only. On this Reserve, the fashion has been a front opening on the dresses lapped over about three inches and fastened with a pin. The school dresses were all made with a high neck line and a neat opening on the back. This style has been copied too and all dresses made since Christmas have the back opening instead of the front.\n\nMany small pieces were left over. The three oldest girls became interested in hope chests (Meatli's milk boxes painted) and then for future use. First, we decided on quilts. The pieces left over from the dresses were used for this purpose. Flour bags supplied the backs and we are now waiting for the cotton bats.\n\nIn the meantime, the girls have bleached, hemmed and embroidered flour bags which have made very pretty table cloths. Flour bags are also being used for one pair of pillow cases, two pairs stencilled back curtains and dish towels.\nThe boys lack material but they are not forgotten. There is a coping saw, hammer and other tools for them. We use the wood from the Arctic biscuit boxes. So far we have only made door stops, rabbit carts and other small toys. These are sandpapered and painted.\n\nThe oldest boy is making small furniture. He measures accurately and is taught to do it just as carefully as if he had enough wood for large furniture. They learn to use the English names for the tools.\n\nRecently in our English class one little fellow said \"I can saw. I can hammer\" \u2014 and after a moment's thought \u2014 \"I can axe.\" Nothing the matter with the little carpenter \u2014 just our English language at fault.\n\nI would greatly appreciate some suggestions for the boys work \u2014 useful articles for an Indian home.\n\nYours truly,\nAda M.

You might, if you find it convenient to do so, discuss this matter more fully with the Indian Agent and also with Inspector Barry. I am inclined to think that your suggestion, if adopted, might have very beneficial results.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J. A.

But I may have mentioned that the school where I am is not equipped for such work, as a matter of fact I have been unable to get any equipment for primary work, such as number and letter tickets.\n\nHowever, the children of the Sucker Creek school, obtain instructions at home in some handiwork so do not miss so much as in some sections where it is not given at home or school. I give them some work in both Household science and Agriculture, as much as my time and equipment permits.\n\nThanking you again,\n\nYours respectfully,\nBertha Willis\nWikwemikong Ont.\nMarch 13, 1927.\n\nSir Mr. Hey,\n\nI am very grateful for your kindness in endeavoring to secure work for James Dyer.\n\nYour letter was addressed to Gardner Place, but could not be opened, hence the delay in replying to thank you for it.\n\nYours very sincerely,\nCatherine Davis\n\nTo Mr. R.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of Jan. 25 was handed to me by Miss Hickey and I regret having been unable to reply sooner.\n\nI appreciate very much the interest and cooperation you are taking in our work.\n\nI am also in favor of more of the pupils' time being devoted to manual training or vocational instruction as a preparation for their future work. At present I am experimenting by teaching the girls sewing and knitting. The problem which confronts me is \"What shall...\"\nI give the boys to do?\" While I have been keeping them well occupied with review work, etc., and am planning to have them make agricultural scrapbooks, I would welcome any suggestions you can offer me in this line.\n\nThree pupils left the school last year. One is a boy who has been cutting wood all winter. The girls are in their own homes helping their mothers. When possible I secure work for the girls in the hospital in Sault Ste. Marie.\n\nAssuring you of my appreciation and desire to cooperate with you in this work, I am,\n\nYours respectfully,\nLouise Gattie\nIn reviewing the work of the Residential School for the past year, the impression persists that, on the West Coast, the existence of Indian Residential Schools can only be justified to the Canadian public by the extent to which these schools can be made the means of equipping the boys for obtaining a better means of livelihood in the industries peculiar to their Reserve location, and the girls with a domestic training which will find expression in dissatisfaction with, and determination to better, the present deplorable housing and living conditions on their home Reserves.\n\nNo comparison can be drawn between the functions of the Indian Schools and the white schools. In the latter, the children, for the most part, come from well-earned-for homes, accustomed to a healthy home atmosphere and home comfort, if not luxury. The home example constantly before them inculcates habits of industry, initiative and individual responsibility, and knowledge, if not always the practical observance, of the principles of Christian citizenship.\n\nAll this is lacking in the environment of the Indian child before he comes to the school. Moreover, the non-moral conditions of life in an Indian community with which every Indian child is familiar and from which he has never been protected, lays upon the Indian school the responsibility of inculcating in the Indian child a moral standard which is the antithesis of all his home experiences.\n\nThis condition is pressed home when one is acquainted with the case of a little Indian chap of seven, who, after coming to school, betrayed knowledge of sexual matters far beyond his years and said he had learned these things at home. As is only possible, when one considers the source of his knowledge, his reaction to the knowledge was anything but good. When the parents were reprimanded with their reply was: \"It doesn't do him any harm. He has to learn these things sometime\".\n\nThe Residential School system is the only system that can bring powerful and lasting influence to bear on the subversive tendencies and habits of the Indian people. Indian education in the residential schools, under what must essentially be a missionary-minded staff, must embrace every phase of uplift. The social and moral problem is not the only one. The economic problem is of equal importance.\n\nWhere the natural sources of industry of the Indian, fishing and trapping, excepting only those engaged in agricultural pursuits in territories adapted thereto, is rapidly, and with impunity, being encroached upon by better equipped and organised white people and Japanese, and where in these industries the Indian is being exploited and discriminated against, as there is ample evidence to prove, the function of giving the Indian vocational training to enable him to compete with less handicap in the struggle for existence is one that the residential school, adequately equipped for this purpose, can fulfill. A present investment of Government moneys at this critical stage of Indian economic history for the better equipment of residential schools to provide specialized Indian vocational training would yield very definite returns to the Dominion.\n\nAll Indian Residential Schools have these peculiar problems to solve in an individual way. We, at Ahousaht, are primarily interested in the fishing industry. The West\nCoast Indian, in common with all Canadian Indians, unfitted by nature for competition and progressive organisation in industry, is rapidly losing out to the Japanese fishermen, and an industry which, in former years, yielded to the Indian an adequate living is now dwindling until few are able to provide themselves with new equipment to replace the worn-out. Under these circumstances the Indians can look forward to nothing else than a complete submersion under the powerful forces arrayed against them. We are in process of organising at the school the means to withstand the economic submersion of the West Coast Indian, and with the assistance of Government, we hope to equip the Indian boys with the means of livelihood and the knowledge that will permit them to enter into fairer competition.\n\nWe have been fortunate in obtaining substantial Government appropriations during the past year for the erection of buildings and for building improvement which will assist the school in being of better service to the Indian community through the training of the young generation, but much more is needed to bring the school to competent functioning capacity.\n\nWe have had a year of splendid discipline in the school and one cannot speak too highly of the devotion of the staff to almost continuous duty. The freer intermingling of the sexes in social contact has tended greatly towards the elimination of the unhealthy mental attitude to which Indian children by their home experiences are rendered prone, and which timid and fearful restrictions cannot do anything but emphasise.\n\nThe class-room work received a good report from the School Inspector, but the experience of former years tends to indicate that the academic work should not be unduly emphasised. The several graduates from this school to High School have made no good use of their opportunities and it is evident that the greatest lasting good can be derived by local training commensurate with the opportunities afforded school graduates in their home environment and on their own Reserves. On the recommendation of the Inspector the higher grades are now on a half-day classroom and half-day vocational training basis.\n\nThat the pupils appreciate the home atmosphere of the school is indicated by the reluctance of the older boys and girls to leave school. One of the older boys, whose age of nearly 18 made it impossible for him to be kept on the school roll any longer, came to the Principal before he was discharged and begged him to tell his father \"in a polite way\" that he could not be discharged. One boy, after his age necessitated his discharge, came voluntarily to the school and worked for his board for the succeeding six months until he found occupation fishing. Some of the older girls already express their regret at the time for their compulsory discharge draws near. Residential school work would show increased value, especially in the all-important sphere of vocational training; were the age of discharge raised from sixteen, as at present, to eighteen. One can only view with impatience the prospects before school graduates, and look forward with longing to the time when the boys can graduate from the school to useful industrial work and the girls to comfortable and healthy homes.\n\nThe C.I.T. and Tunis Groups and the Easter Bible-study camp outings, together with regular school talks on the intimacy and daily necessity of Divine Association, have broadened the spiritual outlook of the pupils.\nThe problem of recruiting pupils is one that is causing us much concern, as it is causing concern to other Protestant residential schools. It would be greatly desirable were the Government to lay down specific and indiscriminate regulations governing applications for admission of Indian pupils to the schools operated by the different Churches catering to Indian education. Under the present somewhat ambiguous conditions it would definitely appear that an Indian with Roman Catholic affiliations or antecedents has no privilege of assuming Protestant allegiance and having his children educated in a Protestant school, however much he may desire to do so.\n\nMISSION WORK.\n\nThe experiences of any Indian missionary constitute a succession of \"kicks and halpences\", of ups and downs. One cannot undertake this work with a myopic view and remain sane. Only when one remembers that Christianity has had hardly more than a half century to loosen the death-grip of paganism, can one view with toleration, if hardly with satisfaction, the decided progress Indians have made during their short experience of Christian influence, surrounded, as they are, by a modern civilization affording them anything but a good example of the efficacy of Christianity.\n\nOne can only briefly recount experiences setting forth both sides of the eternal fight between the forces of pagan darkness and Christian light. Can one credit the circumstances confronting an Indian Agent in an unexpected visit to a Reserve on the East Coast in this enlightened Dominion of ours and in this twentieth century? He arrived to find the people congregated in one house where a man was lying sick. Two women were at the feet of the bunk holding the sick man's feet, a length of the long rope-like seaweed found on the coast was knotted loosely around the neck of the sick man and two men at the head of the bed were preparing to pull taut the rope and strangle the supposedly flinching life out of the body. An examination by the Agent disclosed simply a severe bowel congestion and medicine had the sick man sitting up and well on the way to recovery in a few hours. It must be said that the reserve to which these people belonged had never come under Protestant mission influence.\n\nA brighter view is revealed in an Indian home at Ahousaht Village. Here an Indian girl, formerly discharged from the school with incurable T.B., with no other prospect for her than to die in the midst of uncomfortable Reserve surroundings and leave her infection as a legacy to her Indian relatives and friends, lay dying in her humble home. But her lingering hours are brightened and her path made clear by the singing of favourite hymns by her school-going friends and by the prayer and ministration of the missionary, which banished all fear of a pagan unknown and carried her on her way to the meeting with her Heavenly Father with a child's simple confidence.\n\nIn the darkness again we tell of the destruction of three full-grown and bearing apple trees which grew in the yard of the little house in which the girl died. Pagan superstition prompted the father to cut down the trees, which had nominally belonged to the dead girl, and burn all her small possessions when she had passed on and had no further use for them.\n\nContinuing in darkness, the infant child of this girl, born to an atmosphere of disease, lingering hopelessly for some months in the care of the aged grandparents. In one\ncorner of the shack lies the father of the baby and the husband of the dead girl suffering from a revolting skin disease covering the whole body; a disease which hospital examination failed to diagnose. The baby died and the grandparents, their pagan superstition overriding the protests of the sick father, hurried the little body away immediately after death to burial without the knowledge of the Mission.\n\nThe marriage of this young couple was a tragedy. The young husband had been one of the healthiest and most athletic of school graduates, the young wife far advanced in T.B. Why was the marriage permitted? What else could be done in a case where the union had already been consummated by co-habitation and where our antiquated social laws provide no legal control over such cases? It was a choice of two evils, a choice which every Indian missionary is continually called upon to make. The traditional tribal influence of the elder generation, still steeped in pagan custom, which not only permits but encourages disregard of the Christian and legal marriage relationship, is an evil that is being fought with all the precept at the command of the residential school, and the fight is being slowly but surely won.\n\nEmerging into light again, we mention a summons to the missionary at six o'clock in the morning to go to the village where an Indian child had died during the night. The absence of mourners and of the little rough box at the home caused no perplexity as West Coast Indian custom requires the removal of a body from the home immediately after death. On reaching the little Mission Church on the hillside the coffin was found laid on the steps outside the door and the mourners waiting for Christian service.\n\nIs Indian Mission work worth while? Immeasurably so. Cavilling cynics, from the shallowness of their perception, continue to reiterate that \"the only good Indian is a dead one\", and that the Indian problem can best be solved by a negative policy ensuring the obliteration of the race. Could the great need of these simple children of God, appalled and confused as they are by the sudden imposition on their primitive paganism of a devastating civilization the inconsistencies of which are perplexing even to the humanity that has built it up over a millennium of time, be brought home to the great Christian body that compose's our Church and our Dominion, there would not be lacking forceful influences, efficiency and means to obliterate, not the Indian race, but the conditions that now lay that race \"at our gate, full of sore\".\n\nAn outstanding event during our past missionary year was the visit of Rev. Arthur Barner, D.D. The Spiritual native prompting, and the devotional consciousness aroused in our little Indian world by his visit cannot fail to have lasting good influence. We are looking forward to Dr. Barner's next visit.\nIndian Residential School\nAhousaht, B.C.\n\npractical care and understanding of small-boat marine engines.\n\nPupils, as they leave school should have available to them boats constructed by the school and equipped to provide means of industry for two or more pupils to each boat.\n\nUnder the co-operative plan suggested, where the supervision of the Department would be in evidence, these pupils would continue to be supervised in their industry and could, under normal conditions, repay by yearly instalments, the cost of the boat and the equipment. In this way, once the scheme was in satisfactory operation, it would be self-supporting.\n\nTo put the scheme into operation, more facilities would have to be provided at the school in the matter of buildings and staff. There is no doubt that a new school will have to be built in the next few years if this school is to continue in operation. When this is decided it would be advantageous to rebuild with the above object of specialized vocational instruction in view.\n\nThe present income of the Indians from fishing, with the disadvantages under which they work, is insufficient to either provide new equipment or to repair the old. It is obvious that, if such conditions continue, it will not be long before the Indians will have no equipment whatever for fishing, and the industry, except insofar as work would be provided seasonally at the canneries, would cease to be a means of support. The idleness of the young men of the Ahousaht Village that is now evidenced is sufficient proof that the means to engage in an industry that is quite open to them are not to hand.\n\nOf particular importance to the success of this scheme of practical economic rehabilitation is the fact that any such scheme must have not only the backing but the actual supervision of the Government.\n\nI have only time to briefly outline the conditions and the means of betterment at present. The objection to it, of course, is that it is going to cost money. The answer to that is that the expense is an economic investment for the future saving of a much greater expenditure. Had the Indians engaged in fishing and trapping in northern areas been accorded some measure of protection and had their means of trade been supervised by the Government, we would not now be facing the situation of loss of support from the natural resources which have hitherto contributed to the support of these Indians, with no other means of support possible in the country which is their natural habitat.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\nIn haste to catch\nthe infrequent mail\nIndian Residential School\nAhousaht, B.C.\nMarch 15th 1937.\n\nMr. R.A. Hosey,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nWest Coast Indian Vocational Training.\n\nThe Ahousaht Indian school is situated on the Island of Flores off the West Coast of Vancouver Island, about half way up the coast. It is a unit of the West Coast Indian Agency, with office at Port Alberni. This agency includes a number of small reserves located in fishing villages along the west coast, the total population numbering about 1700, all engaged in fishing, with the possible exception of some few around Port Alberni, who are, or could be, engaged in lumbering, employed by the large mills.\n\nThe fishing activity as it applies to Indians is largely the catch of salmon and cod. Gasoline-propelled boats are used and the fish are caught at various seasons of the year by spoon trolling and by seine netting. The approximate value of new equipment for a fishing boat employing two or three men, such as is adaptable to Indian fishing, and such as is used by the Japanese, is $2000.00. This includes the value of the boat. Fishing activity can be engaged in practically the whole year, with the exception of part of November and December.\n\nThe fish are sold off the fishing boats to purchasing scows anchored in certain harbours and movable from place to place. The fish are then collected from the scows into packing boats, that convey them to the canneries or to Canadian or United States ports for sale.\n\nTo indicate the competition that is operating against Indian interests, a brief survey of conditions is given.\n\nIt can be said, I think, without possibility of dispute, that, although the Japanese have been excluded by Government provision from certain coastal waters, a conservative estimate would be that 75% of the capitalisation of, and labour in, the fishing industry on the West Coast from Ucluelet to Kyuquot is controlled by Japanese. The Japanese fishing industry is controlled by a very efficient Co-operative organisation, to which all Japanese fishermen belong, presumably under what is known as the Imperial Trading Company, the local organisation having headquarters at Tofino, under the name of the Tofino and Clayoquot Co-operative Association. This organisation owns their own scows and packers, modern in every respect. The pooled profits of the organisation is put back into improved equipment and advanced to the fishermen members to finance new boats and equipment. The Japanese fishing boats are therefore up-to-date in equipment and all diesel motosed. The Indian fishermen, with their indifferent boats and equipment are compelled to sell their fish to the Japanese packers, for which they are paid the market price. This obviously reacts to the increased power and financial strength of the Japanese organisation, as the packing and sale profits must go through Japanese co-operative channels. The only result can be the steady deterioration of the industry as an asset to Indian livelihood, as the returns are too meagre to permit of purchasing of new equipment or the\nIndian Residential School\nAhousaht, B.C.\n\n2. Improvement of the old, under the present lack of organisation of the Indian industry, and the steady strengthening of the Japanese position by taking advantage of the Indian necessity.\n\nWhile some of the Japanese purchasing depots are under white management, there can be no question that the operations are directly under Japanese control.\n\nThe situation from Kyuquot north on the West Coast is substantially the same, except that here the control rests in a Finnish Co-operative society, operating under the same conditions as already described.\n\nOne possible solution of the Indian problem represented by these conditions would be to set aside certain coastal waters for the exclusive use of Indian fishermen. However, here we would have the extension of special privilege, which is seldom of lasting good to industry, and it would do little to benefit the Indian except to possibly ensure him his usual hand-to-mouth subsistence.\n\nThe other, and a progressively constructive solution is to build up the Indian industry so that it can stand on its own feet and operate under favourable conditions with its competitors. To do this an Indian co-operative would have to be formed. It is generally known that this cannot be developed with the control resting with the Indians themselves. They are simply not as yet capable of organisation or co-operation self-controlled. A packer would have to be provided for the conveyance of fish and several seasonal scow depots provided at various points. However, the advantage of securing the additional profits of such an innovation to the Indian co-operative would undoubtedly become a self-supporting economic asset, as has been amply proven by the operations of the competitive organisations. One such packer could take care of all the Indian catch. This would have to be done under Indian Department supervision, but the initial expense entailed would be amply warranted in the setting of the Indians on a permanent and satisfactory economic basis, tending towards secured independence, as opposed to the present definite downward trend of Indian fishing industry leading inevitably to Government support and the further decadence of the Indian race.\n\nThe function of the West Coast Residential school has its share in this proposal. Let me emphasise that the sole possible occupation of all the West Coast Indians is fishing. No School devoting much of its training and activity to agriculture or stock raising seedbeds can be of any benefit to West Coast pupils in establishing them in their natural industry on an equal footing with competitors.\n\nWhat is needed at Ahousaht, as a centre for the training of West Coast Indians, is the establishing of an adequate and competent training school (in combination with necessary academic studies) with efficient and organised teaching under special instructors in boat building and care and repair, and in the\nIndian Residential School\nAhousaht, B.C.\n\npractical care and understanding of small-boat marine engines.\n\nPupils, as they leave school should have available to them boats constructed by the school and equipped to provide means of industry for two or more pupils to each boat.\n\nUnder the co-operative plan suggested, where the supervision of the Department would be in evidence, these pupils would continue to be supervised in their industry and could, under normal conditions, repay by yearly instalments, the cost of the boat and the equipment. In this way, once the scheme was in satisfactory operation, it would be self-supporting.\n\nTo put the scheme into operation, more facilities would have to be provided at the school in the matter of buildings and staff. There is no doubt that a new school will have to be built in the next few years if this school is to continue in operation. When this is decided it would be advantageous to rebuild with the above object of specialized vocational instruction in view.\n\nThe present income of the Indians from fishing, with the disadvantages under which they work, is insufficient to either provide new equipment or to repair the old. It is obvious that, if such conditions continue, it will not be long before the Indians will have no equipment whatever for fishing, and the industry, except insofar as work would be provided seasonally at the canneries, would cease to be a means of support. The idleness of the young men of the Ahousaht Village that is now evidenced is sufficient proof that the means to engage in an industry that is quite open to them are not to hand.\n\nOf particular importance to the success of this scheme of practical economic rehabilitation is the fact that any such scheme must have not only the backing but the actual supervision of the Government.\n\nI have only time to briefly outline the conditions and the means of betterment at present. The objection to it, of course, is that it is going to cost money. The answer to that is that the expense is an economic investment for the future saving of a much greater expenditure. Had the Indians engaged in fishing and trapping in northern areas been accorded some measure of protection and had their means of trade been supervised by the Government, we would not now be facing the situation of loss of support from the natural resources which have hitherto contributed to the support of these Indians, with no other means of support possible in the country which is their natural habitat.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nIn haste to catch the infrequent mail.\nIndian Residential School\nAlnesshi, B.C.\nMarch 15th 1937.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nThe delay in answering your letter of Feb 20th is accounted for by the fact that we only receive mail here once in 10 days. I had, however, been writing a letter to you, consequent to receipt of your circular letter of January 15th, during such time as I could spare from the many duties around an institution such as this.\n\nMay I introduce myself to you? You may remember me submitting a report on T.B. conditions among the Indians when you were in the Manitoba cabinet, and when I was United Church missionary at Poplar River on Lake Winnipeg, a report in which the late Dr. David Stewart was very much interested and about which he corresponded with me, and which you kindly acknowledged, and intimated that it might be used in an effort to have the Federal Government form some policy of control. I have for years been deeply interested in Indian economic conditions and was able to institute the innovation of having the Federal Government send supplies to the Poplar River Reserve to be paid for by the Indians out of their treaty money. This was carried on for some four years while I was there and spread to other Reserves in that locality, effecting a saving on actual computation of over $200 to the Indians, not taking into effect the better prices obtainable for their furs on account of being less dependent on trading credit. I hope this system is still operative.\n\nBy way of further introduction I may say that there is still a turf fire waiting for me in my old home in Co. Tyrone, although I was born in Fermanagh, a fact which you may, perhaps, better appreciate.\n\nI appreciate very much your letter of January 15th. I am certainly of the opinion, which I have pressed upon the Department for a number of years, that it is only in training the Indian population to better means and habits of industry, and (just as important) in adequately and authoritatively supervising their industrial efforts and their markets, that we can avoid the greater part of them becoming, in the not distant future, an economic encumbrance to the Government. The situation here on the Coast is not as yet so acute as in Manitoba. There the fishing industry on Lake Winnipeg was at one time a lucrative source of livelihood to the Indian people. When the whole industry was turned over to white fishermen, mainly Icelandic, the Indians had to turn their attention to trapping. It is very evident that trapping also, with the encroachment and superior equipment of white trappers and the spread of mining development, will soon cease to be a source of livelihood to the Indian, and nothing else is left to him in that country.\n\nIt is only too evident that the resources of fishing and trapping in available territories is being exhibited to eventual\nIndian Residential School\nAhousaht, B.C.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey, (2)\n\nextinction, and, recognizing this, it may sometime be the function of the Residential schools to train the Indians to new and unaccustomed sources of livelihood. Agriculture is at once suggested but this would mean transferring the Indians to other territories, for invariably the territories occupied by fishing and trapping Indians is altogether unsuited for agriculture.\n\nUnder these conditions, therefore, it would appear that what is desirable for the present is to train the Indians to better withstand highly organized competition in those industries peculiar to their location and from which they have made a desultory living for generations.\n\nIt is rather remarkable that the annual report which I made to the Women's Missionary Society of the United Church, who control this school, in January last, should touch upon the matter to which you have given expression in your circular letter. I thought I would send this report on to you.\n\nIn particular reply to your letter of Feb 20th, I am placed in rather an embarrassing position by your request, but I consider that frankness is the only policy, and I trust that you will keep the matter confidential. You mention instruction in carpentry, painting, care of engines, feeding of chickens. I came to this appointment in July 1935. Very little had been done in the way of improvement to the school property for about 20 years. The report of the Indian Agent since I came here will indicate to you the condition of the school buildings. The staff consisted of the Principal, Matron, Asst. Matron, Kitchen Matron and two teachers, one of whom was male. Obviously, little could be done in the way of vocational instruction in the school with this staff. A school gasoline launch, 40 feet long, had been constructed during 1932 and 1933, by the Principal, some of the older boys, and some outside help. I cannot find where any of the boys did particular work on this boat. The boat, with the engine, cost $2500.00, the material and engine having been paid for by the Department. The engine was installed by the manufacturers. The boat is a very creditable asset to the school, where we have to haul our freight about four miles by water and land it in small boats through the surf. (I have in mind a bush road of about half-a-mile to a harbour in which the C.P.R. boat docks and which will enable us to unload freight in any weather conveniently.)\n\nThe boat, however, is certainly too expensive and not of the type suitable to Indian fishing. Possibly the work of some of the older boys on this boat could be included in vocational instruction. For the building of this boat a workshop was erected, a frame building, 24 feet by 48 feet, very suitable for the building of boats. A dormitory for the smaller boys is located above this workshop. Various clamps, large and small, used for boat construction is included in the equipment. No boat building other than that mentioned has been done.\n\nIn this workshop the older boys made a number of cedar chests, from material supplied by the Department, which were\nIndian Residential School\n\nMr. Hoey, (3)\n\nevidently sold. Totem poles and small eagles or \"Thunder birds\" were also made, mostly, I gather, without instruction. Under the heading \"care of engines\" we have one heavy duty gas engine which runs the laundry machinery and the water pump. Also we have a very complicated high speed engine supplying the electric light. I cannot find where any instruction was given in care of these, nor that there was any member of the staff nor anyone in the vicinity who was capable of giving instruction. It was the custom to designate one boy each month as \"engineer\" to look after the engines. The result was very apparent. The engines and the laundry machinery were wrecks. The lighting plant would not function. I had to ship the laundry engine and the lighting plant to expert machinists for repair when I came here, at a cost of about $250.00. The laundry machinery (two ordinary washing machines) I have had patched up until it is possible for us to get proper equipment.\n\nPainting. I hardly know whether this refers to commercial painting or artistry. We had one boy at the school who showed some aptitude for art and spent much of his time at it. One of my first jobs was to scrape every inch of the outside of the school building to remove the green slime that accumulates on buildings on this coast in the course of years of weathering and to have the whole building painted. The school boys did this work, but, although it provided good experience for them, I would not call it vocational training. The other buildings have not all been painted yet, although I have the paint on hand to do much of it.\n\nFeeding of chickens. There were 23 old hens here. I think their maximum R.O.P. was 7 eggs in any one day. One boy was detailed to feed them. We killed them off, but it is our intention, when we have completed the programme of building which we have now in hand, to develop about 20 acres of good land on the school property to supply the school with vegetables, fruit, milk and eggs. This could be conveniently done. Some effort was made to cultivate the land years ago but abandoned apparently from lack of interest. It is an unusual condition on the west coast to have such an area of land suitable for agriculture and it is difficult to understand why more advantage was not taken of it. I have had the soil tested by the Department Agriculturalist and his report will show that it is good. The school has shipped in all its garden produce, fruit, eggs and milk to the amount of about $1500.00 a year, and there is no doubt that this could all be produced on our own land. Since I have been here I have done some effective drainage and have removed large stumps immediately behind the school. Last year I planted some 300 small fruits and 120 plants of rhubarb and their growth is amazing. There is much work to be done, but I do not wish to undertake too much at once, and the building programme is just at present keeping us occupied. Mr. A.W. Neill, the Federal Member, visited us last year and he recommended a small tractor for development of the farm and garden. There is no doubt that this development would be a financial aid to the school. The B.C. market price of potatoes wholesale, for instance, is now $2.80 per cwt.\nIndian Residential School\nAhousaht, B.C.\n\nMr. Hoey, (4)\n\nHowever, the matter of development of the land could not be said to come under the heading of such vocational instruction as is adaptable to our Indians. It is true that the project would undoubtedly urge the people to do some gardening in their Village, where there is some small area suitable for this purpose. The force of example, one of the most potent forces in Indian education, would tend to this result.\n\nI do not know whether you are acquainted with the Reserve lay out on the West Coast. The Indians are congregated in fishing villages and do not occupy any large tracts of land. These villages are their \"reserves\". The rocky and mountainous nature of the country debars them from agriculture or stock raising to any extent. However, there are some apple trees in the Ahousaht village, planted years ago and sadly neglected, but still bearing.\n\nSince coming here we have during the past year built a $3000.00 residence for the principal and his family, appropriation for this being made by the Department. The previous accommodation was one small room in the school building. I would have preferred this money to have been spent in other ways in better equipping the school for its function, but the matter was in hand before my appointment. I employed some of the boys on the building and they showed, some of them, good adaptability, and gained good experience. We are at present engaged in building a new laundry with a recreation room for the boys above, and this is being constructed by the school boys under the direction of the vocational instructor. I was able to get an appropriation of $480.00 per year from the Department for the engagement of a vocational instructor last October. The school has augmented this salary to $600.00. I succeeded in getting a man from Northern Manitoba whom I knew, who is an expert mechanic, also an airplane pilot and an excellent all-round man. He came here for a change of climate, but it is obvious that I cannot expect to keep such a man at this salary for very long. He has already had offers from the mining camps at a much greater salary. However, he has been of great assistance to me in property improvement.\n\nI had him in mind in furthering the plan which I will later outline to you in developing the vocational instruction at this school so that it will definitely result in the increased industrial independence of the Indian people, but he has been fully occupied up to now and will be for some time in improvements in the school property, clearing land for building, building of fire escapes, care and repair of engines etc., In all this he has had the senior boys assisting and being instructed, but as yet there is no definite programme of vocational instruction, with graded and progressive classes, such as I consider there should be.\n\nFrankly, our present facilities do not provide means for my idea of vocational instruction. The many odd jobs around such an institution as this and the present necessity for much patching of buildings, repairs, and new buildings can fully occupy the time of the senior boys and does provide them with a sort of general experience. Probably this sort of thing has been accepted as \"vocational instruction\" hitherto, but obviously it is far\nIndian Residential School\nAhousaht, B.C.\n\nMr. Hoey (5)\n\nfrom an ideal which would have for its objective the turning out of our boys fitted by training to engage in any competition in the occupation from which they are not only going to earn their future living, but in which we might expect them to excel to such an extent that they will definitely improve the whole economic condition of themselves and their community.\n\nWe have in our village now about a dozen young men just hanging around. Day after day they wander over here to the school. I give them such odd jobs as I can afford, such as supplying wood, but they impress me as being nothing but an economic liability to the community and the country. They are not to be blamed. They have no boats to fish with and, with the exception of the cannery season during the summer, when they find employment at the canneries, there is nothing for them to do. The inclinations to mischief, such as homebrew and immorality, under such conditions is obvious. If these boys had boats and fishing equipment, with the enthusiasm which specialised training in this occupation would engender, there need be no idleness for them.\n\nI arrange sports for them when the weather is favourable and one of the ideas of the recreation room which we are building and to which it is my hope to add a gymnasium at some time, is to keep these village boys from deteriorating into useless parasites of society. Some of these boys have had a few years in high school. The Ahousaht school has been noted for the number of pupils prepared for high school during the past few years. To my mind, this was an utterly mistaken policy. There is only one chance in a thousand of Indian boys or girls being able to compete or to find outside employment against a white boy or girl of similar attainment. The only result of higher education has been to give the Indian pupils a glimpse of something to which they cannot possibly attain. The usual thing is that they have gained more appreciation of the frivolities and indiscretions of outside civilization and have adopted them. They almost invariably come back to the only conditions open to them on their home reserve and discouragement and possibly thwarted ambition (in some few cases) have made them more reactionary than their old people.\n\nThis letter has become too long. I know that you are deeply interested in the Indian problem, and this is my excuse. I will, in another letter, suggest constructive methods which, in my opinion, apply to residential school functions in this particular area.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nIn the accompanying article, may I say that I have looked into the situation outlined during the past year or so.

It is my hope that we may be able to effect either a consolidation or a partial consolidation of our educational institutions in that particular district in the immediate future. I have already written to the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, asking him for a full report in respect to the Indian population, the permanency of the population and the advisability of building a central school for vocational instruction, probably at Alberni. In the meantime, the information with which you have supplied me is very much appreciated.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. B.

I shall be glad to see you at my office any time you may find it convenient to call during your stay here.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nAlbert E. Smith, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nCountry Indian Day School,\nOka, P. Q.\nST. JOSEPH'S MISSION\nCARIBOO INDIAN SCHOOL STATION P.G.E.\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nMarch 11th, 1937\n\nMr R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nUpon my return from Ottawa, where I had the pleasure of meeting you, I found your letter (150-60) of January 15th on my desk. Before I had the time to reply, influenza hit us and hit us hard: eight of the staff, 51 out of 54 boys and about 30 girls were in bed. A dozen ran temperatures of between 103 and 104\u00b0 and caused us a little anxiety. The rest were not seriously ill and I was able to assure the Indian Agent that we could handle the situation ourselves and did not need the Doctor. The latter was kind enough to pay us a visit, although he had his hands full with other cases, and he was pleased with what we had done. All are now up and well. Some have a cough but the Doctor told us to expect this and he added that this cough might last into the summer.\n\nYour letter, I think, sets your seal of approval on what we have been doing for years: we have tried to prepare the pupils for their future life. With this end in view we take the children up to the end of Grade VIII but, though it was suggested but not imposed by the Inspector, we do not take them further. They have class (after 30 minutes religious instruction which I give myself and try to make it interesting and practical) from 9.15 until about 11.30, with a short intermission, on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and, for art, drawing, painting, on Saturday mornings. They have about an hour and a half of study Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday afternoon. We used to have only an hour of study until the teachers asked for the additional half hour on account of the time lost during class hours, for the treatment of trachoma. Would you please let me know if we are giving too much time to class and to study?\u2014I should say that singing practice is\nheld two or three times a week during class hours.\n\nThe girls will be married or will, for a time, be servant girls on neighbouring ranches. They wash the dishes, sweep, scrub, dust, etc.; do all the laundry by hand; iron, clean and press clothes; sew, darn, knit, crochet, mend; do a little gardening, picking vegetables, pickling, preserving (this last clause refers chiefly to the girls who are about to be discharged and who spend their last holidays here); every week, three girls are taken out of the classroom and, under the supervision of a Sister, do the cooking for the School; three more are taken out of the classroom every week and, under the supervision of a Sister, do all the baking. They have to keep well up in class to be allowed to cook or bake and they consider being deprived of their turn in the kitchen or bakery as one of the severest punishments they can be given. They like the work and do it well. The first cook or baker is a girl from 15-17 years of age; the second, from 13-15, and the third is from 11-13.\n\nA member of the Indian Department, hearing that all the washing was done by hand, kindly suggested that, if we asked, we might be given machinery. I am against machinery: it is poor training for the future and the girls, who have had machinery in School, find going back to the old tub at home rather hard. I have noticed that the vast majority of the women trained here regularly wash once a week at home.\n\nThe boys will have their own small ranches, will work as ranch hands or cowboys and some will be, at times, loggers. We train them for that.\n\nThose who show any aptitude get training in carpentry and blacksmithing. (An ex-pupil, who has a daughter here, is blacksmith for the largest ranch in the country; another, who has three children here, is carpenter and mechanic at another large ranch). The older boys do some ploughing, harrowing, hay-raking, etc.; they help brand, castrate, etc., and get a certain knowledge, as do the middle-sized boys, in irrigating. The younger boys look after the garden, the pigs, the chickens and geese. As they will have a good deal of\nSt. Joseph's Mission\nCariboo Indian School Station P.G.E.\nBritish Columbia\n\nit to do later, the older boys, with two or more men, fell trees in the winter and \"buck\" them. The men haul and deck the logs and the boys saw them into blocks. These the older boys and men split.\n\nSome will later have to have a knowledge of simple gasoline engines and machinery used with them (for hay-baling, wood-sawing, alfalfa-cutting, grain-crushing, etc.) and, so, the older boys do this work (or, rather, help in doing it) here. They also do the milking and separating; the girls make the butter. The middle-sized boys help cure ham and bacon; they also do a little cobbling.\n\nThis will give you a fair idea of the practical training we try to give. Here are a few things written or said which will show either that some are pleased with the results or are awful fibbers.\n\nMr Wynn-Johnson, rancher, 3000 cattle: \"Allow me to introduce the Principal of the Cariboo Indian School,-the place where they train the boys and girls to work conscientiously and efficiently\".\n\nMr Harris, farm foreman for Mr J.: \"The boys we have from your School are good milkers; they are the first on the job in the morning,-we don't have to call them\".\n\nAmelia Louis, ex-pupil: \"I am working for Mrs Ross. She says that I wash, iron and mend well and that she wishes her daughter could do the same\".\n\nThe Indian Agent: \"That is certainly wonderful bread. Could I take a loaf home?\"\n\nMy intention in giving these quotations is not to blow my own horn but to suggest that we have been following the ideas you suggested.\n\nDo we give enough or too much time to this vocational training? I would like a frank reply.\n\nEvery afternoon, Sundays and holidays excepted, the boys work from 1 p.m. until 3 to 3.30; the girls work from 1.30 to 3.30. Milking takes another 30 to 45 minutes and washing dishes takes longer. Housework and bed-making takes about 20 minutes. Monday morning, the girls wash and the boys do their work. These hours are followed very regularly; at times\nthey have to be changed.\n\nThe children are told frequently to report if they feel tired. They are fat and are able to play after their work and so they do not seem to be overworked.\n\nI would like a reply to this question. We begin our holidays at the end of July so that the pupils can be at home to help with haying which is late in the district. Those who are discharged to be discharged are kept here, as a rule, during the holidays preceding their discharge, which takes place Sept. 15th (and are paid for this time in clothes), so as to get special training. They are given what I would call \"half-freedom\" so as to make the transition from School discipline to home-freedom less abrupt. The boys, during this time, work with and eat with the men and are under the authority of the Foreman. This shows them what conditions will be when they leave School and work for Whitemen (most of whom prefer Indians for haying and for ranch-hands). Now, some of these boys and girls have asked me to let them out of the classroom in May instead of at the beginning of the holidays and to let them get more training in cooking, baking, sewing, etc., or in ranch work, blacksmithing, etc. I have tried it out during the last two years and the results have been good. Those to be discharged have been given the option of going to class or to working. Most have chosen the latter. May I continue this practice? Unofficially, certain members of the Indian Dept. have expressed themselves in favor of giving those to be discharged this extra vocational training.\n\nAnother question: I have tried to make the training in carpentry practical; the boys built our chapel, carpenter shop, sewing room; they have made doors, windows, chairs, tables, kitchen cabinets, wagon boxes, sleighs, hay racks, hay slips, a miniature model house, feeding troughs and racks and have repaired floors, doors, etc., put in panes of glass, etc. Is not this the way to prepare them for the future or should I, as suggested (not so high up) of the Dept. suggested, have them make totem poles and showy but useless cabinet work? I take pity on you and close.\nOttawa, March 24, 1937.\n\nDear Father Forbes:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant and to thank you very heartily for the encouraging information contained therein.\n\nI was more than delighted to learn of your vocational set-up. It seems to me you have succeeded in working out a course of study peculiarly well adapted to the needs of your pupils. The Minister of the Department, in the House, a few weeks ago, made the statement that our courses of study in Indian schools would have to become steadily and increasingly more vocational in character. In view of this statement, it is not at all likely that we can go too far in the development of vocational projects.\n\nIt is somewhat difficult for me to reply to specific questions, not being familiar with local conditions. I feel confident, however, that if you discuss these matters with the Agent and with the School Inspector, you will experience no difficulty in working out a satisfactory solution. I am heartily in accord with your views in respect to the senior pupils being given additional vocational instruction during the one or two years immediately preceding their departure from school.\n\nAgain thanking you for your letter, I remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nH. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Geo. Forbes, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nCariboo Indian Residential School,\n150 Mile House, B. C.\nHagersville, Ont., Feb. 19, 1877.\n\nR. A. Hey,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter I humbly wish to acknowledge the interest you have taken in the teachers of our Indian schools. Never, in my teaching experience upon the Six Nations Reserve, until the present time, have I felt the liberty of conferring and discussing our problems with officials of the Indian Department. We, as teachers, are prone to attribute this feeling to lack of interest which, in my opinion, is so characteristic of the Indian Race. However, I feel that our relations will be cordial and you will deal sympathetically with our problems.\n\nIndian children, I find through means (though limited) that I carry on in my own school, show an aptitude for acquiring knowledge through manual work, rather than through book learning.\n\nRecently, the Women's Institute have obtained a vocal teacher. Opportunity was given for a limited number of pupils from each school to attend these lessons, and from the whole group a smaller group will be selected to represent the Reserve at a musical festival to be held in Brantford. Progress is favorable and I believe that our children's efforts will compare with those who have been receiving vocal instruction for years.\n\nSimilarly, much I feel could be accomplished by your suggestions of manual training and household science.\n\nIf some project dealing with poultry, could be started in our public schools, we could not imagine with what interest boys and girls would attend its classes. Then the school would be in touch with the community and it would be a practical course of lessons of which they would recognize the need. As a case of study we might; In Arithmetic, find the cost of eggs, feed, chicks, aggregates, and averages, fractions, etc.\nIn Geography: Egg producing countries, Canada's poultry exports transportation, storage.\n\nIn Art: Sketches of brooders, brooder houses, making posters.\n\nIn Language: Business letters, wording posters.\n\nIn short an inexhaustible amount of information might be obtained and boys and girls might apply it to a good advantage in their own homes.\n\nFor information re. the \"Follow-up System,\" my records show that during five years of experience, eight pupils have graduated. Two are completing a secondary school course, three have left the Reserve and are now residing in the United States, the others are working at home. Usually, entrance graduation marks the completion of the Indian child's education, as my records might apply to the whole Reserve.\n\nI have made a study of the different types of monthly report card and I would like your permission to forward a sample.\n\nLet me again thank you for your encouragement and I hope that this information is what was so kindly requested of me.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nOliver M. Smith\nOttawa, March 25, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Smith:\n\nPlease accept my most sincere thanks for your letter of the 19th instant and for the information contained therein. I was particularly pleased to learn of the progress made by the pupils of your district in Music.\n\nI heartily agree with you that a short course in poultry raising should prove very helpful and interesting to the senior pupils. I shall be glad to keep this suggestion in mind when our educational policy comes up for review from time to time.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Oliver M. Smith,\nTeacher,\nSix Nations No. 8 Indian Day School,\nR. R. #6, Hagersville, Ont.\nWelfare & Training\n\nTo the Honorable Staff\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nKind and dear Sirs,\n\nI am greatly honored to be called upon to express, in the name of my classmates, our thanksgivings for the benevolence with which the Department of Indian Affairs supplied us with wood, tools, varnish, etc., to test our skillfulness in handicraft.\n\nTo bend over books and copies, hours after hours, is a hard task for us, little Indians, who like to scamper and fret. But, since our teacher has interested us in fretwork, our daily programme is somewhat altered; and, as a\nConsequence our class attend school more regularly. Since January twenty pieces have been made: tables, inkwell holders, trays, pipe-holders, brackets, etc. The last pieces showing greater skill.\n\nHow proud I feel to have the honor of sending you my \"Quebec Bridge\" for a pipe-holder as a sample of our work and a token of our gratitude.\n\nPlease accept it with our respectful homage and the compliments of the season.\n\nYour ever grateful children of\nThe Indian Day School, Restigouche\n\nBy John Lavigne, 13 years old,\n7th Grade.\n\nIndian Day School,\nRestigouche. March 29, 1937.\nSkeena Crossing, B.C.\n(Kitsumkalum Reserve)\nMar 14, '37.\n\nDear Mr. Hoy:\n\nYour letter dated Jan. 25, '37 gave me the greatest of pleasures. I certainly welcome your interest and preferred assistance.\n\nPerhaps, you know that I am a novice in this work; this is my first attempt at teaching an Indian School. After a few years I may become wiser. I shall at least become accustomed to some things that now puzzle me.\n\nConcerning your many suggestions, I agree in general with all you say, but there are some vital problems that we must face before we can change conditions.\n\nI doubt whether the public mind begins to realize the magnitude of our task. Being a student and also intensely interested in children's problems, I have discovered a few facts concerning my work.\n\nDoes the public mind realize the many handicaps of an Indian child? They have to learn a foreign language when they come to\nschool. It's almost like sending a child to school to learn French or German. They have one language in school and another at home, at play and at all their social functions.\n\nWe have this problem, fathers and mothers (young married couples) who attended school for years\u2014they read and must translate into their own native language ideas and figures before they have any meaning for them.\n\nMy greatest problem is to get the children to form \"mental images\" from our English language without thinking it first all over in their native tongue.\n\nUnlike a white child they have no idea of things until you teach them. Every object has two names\u2014an Indian name and an English name. You can see the difficulty\u2014a not too bright child has to carry such a load of mental imagery.\n\nPersonally I think one third of the school curriculum should be given to teaching them to understand the meaning of English words. We could profitably cut out many subjects taught a white child and give the time to making him understand what he reads and speaks when he uses English words.\nA second problem in our arithmetic. I notice the textbooks emphasize problems: The Indian child can't grasp such simple abstract words as subtraction, multiplication and division\u2014why burden him with a complicated abstract idea\u2014the plainer the work the better. I find an example on the blackboard\u2014a concrete illustration often gets into their minds much quicker than a very simple problem which he cannot yet intelligently read. Perhaps we need an Indian Child's Textbook.\n\nFurther we need to link up our teaching of arithmetic to actual life. We have to let them see the value of a dollar. When he realizes that education is his only protection against exploitation, he wants to learn. I find the Indian is afraid of being made a victim of in business. Its pathetic some of the things they ask me and their fears are real to them.\n\nPerhaps my greatest problem is the school attendance. Children come regularly for a few days or weeks, and then the family moves away to a logging camp for months. A man thinks a day or two from school doesn't\nmatter, so he takes his child on a trapping expedition, or to get firewood.\n\nThe result is I have about 30 children in my school and about as many different grades. You can't teach even half a dozen any one problem at a time because they are all at different parts of the same subject. You will realize what it means in an arithmetic period to have all your scholars doing different exercises.\n\nA few are very regular and these make good progress, others are as old as 13 years and still struggling in Grade I; can neither read, reason, or figure, because they come about once in three weeks on the average, and then are ashamed of their own standing in the school.\n\nAnother very great need, so one I am working on, a school library. It's pathetic to create a hunger for books and reading and then have nothing to feed them with. We have about six people taking a newspaper, no regular subscribers to an magazine. I have bought, borrowed and begged and yet there is a cry give us a book for Black. I have heard of children begging for bread, these children are simply hungry for good story books, something they can read. They have no other pleasures here.\n\nMust close now (sincerely) Bishop Black.\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your communication relative to the welfare & training of our Indian pupils, it has long been my contention that the system of academic training as it is now, will never bring about the results we look for, until we can supplement it with something of a more vocational character, which will be of direct use to the child in after-school days.\n\nThe Indian needs, more than anything else, to be trained to do\u2014to make\u2014to finish what he begins. We must ever be ready to encourage initiative, spurring on the \"desire\" as well as the \"how\" to do.\n\nMy aim has always been to keep alive the creative spirit, born in every child; Continually fostering his ever-ready impulse to make something for himself.\n\nAs I see it at the present day, the curriculum in our white schools has tended to destroy initiative rather than foster it; the creative spirit has become slowly submerged, overwhelmed by cramming. Our own children enter school full of ideas to do & to make but eventually find themselves with \"no time for anything but study.\"\nWith the little material at our disposal here, I have tried to teach my pupils to do things for themselves, be it in garden or in yard, around or in school, or in the Kitchen; mending, sewing, knitting etc., things they will not learn at home, but which are essentials of later life.\n\nEach reserve has its own problems, I am sure. Here we have always the apathy of some of the parents, with lack of interest in, encouragement for the child's ideas; thus it follows that our greatest handicap is irregular attendance\u2014a bugbear which I have tried by every available means to overcome.\n\nIn every case except sickness (I refer to Scabies & Impetigo, our worst foes,) the parents are solely to blame. They wander off, visiting at places too far distant from school for pupils to come; they go off berry-picking, hunting etc., taking the entire family with them, for weeks at a time.\n\nInadequate footwear during spring & fall also bears largely on irregular attendance.\n\nI feel very strongly that these parents should realize their compulsion to let their children attend school regularly; there are no valid reasons except those stated, for non-attendance. These children are all keen to come every day.\n\nReferring to a \"Follow-up System.\"\nThereby supplying information stating what becomes of our pupils on leaving school, it would seem that, on reserve where farm instructors reside, all such information would be available from him at any time, as complete records of each pupil are on file there.\n\nI am glad to know that we may communicate with you at any time; this gives us encouragement for the future.\n\nThanking you\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Mrs) E.M. Siddons\n\n(A.T.)\n\nSouth Day School\nJas Smith Reserve\nFort \u00e0 la Corne\nSaskatchewan\nOttawa, March 31, 1937.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nPlease accept my most sincere thanks for the thoughtfulness and courtesy that prompted you to send forward to the Department the model of the Quebec bridge, constructed by one of your pupils. I can assure you that this action on your part is very deeply appreciated. Please convey to the pupil responsible for the work our very best thanks. The model, itself, reflects great credit, not only upon the pupil, but upon those responsible for its construction.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & training.\n\nThe Rev. Sister Superior,\nRestigouche Indian Day School,\nRestigouche, Que.\nOttawa, March 31, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Black:\n\nPlease accept my most sincere thanks for your letter of the 14th instant and for the information contained therein.\n\nI was particularly interested in your reference to the need for books in your school. I think you would be well advised to discuss this problem with the Indian Agent or with the Inspector and have a recommendation sent forward from either of them to the Department. If you do this, I feel confident, your claim for assistance will be very sympathetically considered when it comes before us here.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Heay,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Bishop Black,\nTeacher,\nKitsegukla Indian Day School,\nSkema Crossing, B. C.\nOttawa, March 31, 1937.\n\nDear Mrs. Siddons:\n\nPlease accept my most sincere thanks for your letter of the 8th instant and for the information contained therein.\n\nI was particularly interested in your reference to the difficulties experienced in obtaining a regular attendance at school. It is somewhat difficult for me to suggest a remedy, not being familiar with local conditions. I do feel, however, that you would be well advised to discuss this matter, either personally or by letter, with the Indian Agent. I know, from experience, just how difficult it is to report progress with an irregular attendance of pupils.\n\nAgain thanking you for your letter,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Howy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMrs. E. M. Siddons,\nTeacher,\nFort a la Corne South\nIndian Day School,\nKinistino, Sask.\nProvidence Residential School,\nFort Providence, N.W.T.\nMarch 21, 1937.\n\nMr. R.A. Hare,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to thank you most sincerely for the sympathy and encouragement which you have shown to the teachers in charge of Indian schools.\n\nI am of the same opinion that a programme of study should be made allowing the Indian children to spend at least one third of their time at manual training which will prepare them for their future life.\n\nAfter a number of years experience as teacher in the Indian schools, I can say that certain subjects are altogether too abstract for Indian pupils.\n\nHis Excellency Bishop Bignot had already spoken to the teachers of this District concerning that same subject. I feel confident that he will be with you to have it put into execution.\nThe pupils generally remain no longer than four or five years at school; they are then returned to their parents. Under their supervision they are taught to set traps and hunt.\n\nMost of their time is spent in the bush, therefore we have very little contact with them after they leave the school.\n\nI believe that the Indian Agent and R.C.M.P. Police have more occasions to frequent the pupils after they leave the school, as they usually visit the Indians.\n\nThanking you once again for the sympathy and encouragement you were so kind to express to all.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\nSister Mack.\nPrincipal\nLittle Pine Reserve,\nPaynton, Sask.,\nMarch 26, 1937.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn response to your request for suggestions regarding Indian welfare and training, we would like to offer one or two of our ideas.\n\nThe adjustment of the Indian public school curriculum to allow for systematic training in handcraft and manual work under school supervision would be a great improvement. Special provision should be made for the few outstanding pupils capable of going on to higher studies. These would be trained to be leaders of their people. The uplifting influence of these young people in training cannot be overestimated. Their periodic visits to the reserve at holiday time exert an influence which nothing else can.\n\nLittle Pine is a small, backward reserve, but it has been possible to send on four pupils of this Day School. Adam Cuthand will finish his training for the ministry next Spring (1938) and the three others are in grades ten, eleven and twelve in high school.\n\nBeadwork is one handcraft which could be taught to the girls. It is sometimes thought that only the old women can do this native work, but it has been disproved as far as this reserve is concerned. A short time ago only one woman was known to make a pretty beaded mat suitable for a teapot stand or table decoration. In the last year and a half we have had mats made by twenty different women on the reserve. Within a year about forty mats have been sold through the school alone, and every mat had a different design and color scheme. This industry has been awakened by the Saskatoon\nArts and Crafts Society which supplies the beads, specifies certain standards and pays for the making. The Society finds a ready market for all the mats it can procure. Some designs are prettier than others, and some work is superior to the rest, but if the girls in school were trained to do perfect work, and choose the best materials, when they left school they would be ready to get the highest prices for their products. Indian designs and Indian color schemes should be preserved, but stress laid on suitable articles for the white man's market. This type of teaching would also be appreciated by the parents, and help to bridge the great gulf between school and home, awakening greater interest in the school in the ignorant minds of some of the people.\n\nThe Society has slightly raised the price for these mats and this has been a help to the people during a very hard year. Almost every parent of school children has made a mat and this has proved a good point of contact with the home, where academic studies are not appreciated. About fifty dollars have been earned on the reserve by beadwork. This is not a large amount but it is a good beginning in the right direction, that of teaching the people to make a living by their own work.\n\nThe clipping from the \"Saskatoon Star\" attached to our Quarterly Report for this term, refers to this reserve.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. L. Cunningham.\nHoly Angels Residential School,\nFort Chipewyan, Alberta\nMarch 20, 1937.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nIt is with a real interest that I took note of the letter addressed to Sister Champion, the former Principal. Being in charge of this school only since last September, I am not altogether at the height of my position; these mission schools are so different from our Manitoba schools where I had been teaching before.\n\nI was happily surprised to notice your signature at the end of the letter. I have seen you at many conventions, and as a member of the teaching staff I have been witness of all the work done by the \"Minister of Education\" who was the Honorable R.A. Hoey. I am assured of the success of our Indian schools.\nYour \"Follow-up System\" greatly appeals to me and I am willing to give my cooperation to any method suggested by the other Principals who have some experiences with our children.\n\nI am interested in our Indian boys and girls. I feel happy among my dark-eyed pupils and I wish to help them to enjoy life and to make the best of all the gifts God has favored them. I would appreciate if the Government would supply convenient supplementary reading. Easy books, adventures, discoveries, brave deeds wrought by so many Northerners, inventions, life of early settlers, so many things would show them what men have done and would help them to try to be self-dependent. I think this would be a help to our boys and girls.\n\nWishing you the best of success in your new attributions and hoping for a visit from you in a near future\u2014it would be such an encouragement.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\nSister Kristoff, Principal.\nOttawa, April 2nd, 1937.\n\nDear Miss Cunningham:\n\nPlease accept my most sincere thanks for your letter of the 26th ultimo and for the expressions of opinion contained therein.\n\nI can think of no valid reason why you should not extend the vocational instruction you are now giving at your school. This extension, of course, should take place on the understanding that an opportunity will be given to the students who are interested in academic work to proceed with their regular studies. You might discuss this matter with the Inspector when he calls at your school.\n\nIt is exceedingly difficult to work out a curriculum for our Indian day schools that would be applicable throughout the Dominion. Conditions vary to such an extent that uniformity is scarcely possible and I am not sure that it is at all desirable. I want to congratulate you on the interest you have taken in the promotion of handicraft work, and I was also interested to learn that the Saskatoon Arts and Crafts Society has succeeded in discovering a market for the mats produced on the reserve.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss A. L. Cunningham,\nTeacher,\nLittle Pines Indian Day School,\nPaynton, Sask.\nOttawa, April 2, 1937.\n\nDear Sister Kristoff:\n\nPlease accept my most sincere thanks for your letter of the 20th ultimo and for the information contained therein.\n\nI was particularly interested in your reference to the province of Manitoba and to the fact that you had taught there. It is my hope that you will enjoy your work in the north country, although conditions must differ greatly from those to which you have been accustomed.\n\nI have discussed with the officials here the desirability of obtaining a few books for your library. It is our hope that we shall be able to forward these in due course.\n\nAgain thanking you for your letter,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev.

Dewey,\nSup't. of Welfare and Training,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: 150-60\n\nYour latest of January 25th has just reached me. I should like to thank you for the great interest you express to help the teaching staff wherever difficulties are encountered.\n\nI have not yet been paid for July and August 1935 on which months I was told to teach. Now you let the clergy mingle in the Indian Affairs as to hire me a teacher. Now the bishop of De Pas and the father of this mission Father Dubois then superior told me to come up at Island Lake for July and start teaching which I did and the agent sent back my first quarterly report which was done on ordinary paper; regular forms were missing and he insisted that I submit an ordinary form and would not be paid for July August and September. I fill out the report properly and\nI still have the letter in hand.\n\nNow I should in mere justice be paid for my work. Speaking about justice, I can easily remark that the teacher of the other school here at Island Lake has not the required number of pupils to keep his school open during winter. Only two families live and spend winter near the school total 5 pupils (ordinary) and he gets his salary all the time\u2014and during July and August. The largest months of school attend and over 25 enrolled did I lack\u2014Please consider the matter again. I devote myself in all sorts of ways, with the moral training, the intellectual as well and manual labor is going fine; in fact next summer I shall inaugurate a school work exposition on the Treaty Ground and will have funds to give prizes to the best results.\n\nFor this reason I should need tools\u2014Please see that next year we get some. I shall not press but leave it to your discretion. Last year I had good success with the school garden. The ground was cleared of stumps by the pupil and myself. We are still burning our own wood from the school grounds.\n\nI should like to have seeds of turnips, carrots, onions and tomatoes.\nI am sorry I have to use this side of paper, as I am short of paper. The poor service of transportation is the cause.\n\nI have furnished a few pounds of wool to the girls, but I think the department will generously do his part for the sake of the ladies' cause.\n\nI earnestly trust that my constant efforts will obtain credit to my demands, and hope that your welcome generous interference will give the best of results.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nChristie O. Gauthier\nSchool Teacher\n\nP.S. Just now before sealing I heard from Mr. Match himself, teacher of the other Indian school, that he had $100 per month and I get only $95 per month, and I have twice more work than he has. It was surprising himself. He is single and I have a family to support.\n\nA.M.\n\nDear Sir, I know these things are the truth.\n\nM. Dutel, Pte. C.M.\n\nR.C.M.\nOttawa, April 5, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Gauthier:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 17th and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nI note, with interest, your reference to the service rendered by you during the months of July and August, 1935. I may state, by way of comment, that a full explanation of the attitude of the Department to your request for a salary allowance for these months was sent forward to you, in a letter dated August 14, 1936. Under present regulations, we are not permitted to pay a teacher for a period exceeding the regular 10 months' period in any given year. The records indicate that you were paid for the months of September, October, November and December, 1935; and for January, February, March, June, July and August, 1936.\n\nYou should discuss with the Indian Agent, either personally or by letter, the question of obtaining the tools necessary for vocational instruction at your school. A recommendation from you, endorsed by the Agent, will receive sympathetic consideration. This applies, also, to supplies, such as wool, etc.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A.

In conjunction with the curriculum we are attempting texts suitable to our pupils' needs. At present we are gathering material for a Problem Arithmetic covering the work of grades 4, 5, and 6.\n\nWe wish to obtain all the assistance possible in these projects and are forwarding these questions to you, hoping that you will give us your answers, adding any comment which you think will be constructive in the producing of our text and in the building up of our curriculum.\n\n1. What in your opinion are the requirements of the Northern Indian in Arithmetic?\n\n2. Would you outline a number of topics and situations where the Indian needs to make calculations.\n\n3. If you have Indians in your employ could you cite any specific weakness, in methods probably, which class room teaching could combat.\n\nH.Meadows\nNorway House, Man.,\nMarch 30, 1937.\n\nHon. R.A. Horsley,\nIndian Dept.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs I think you will be interested in the work I am doing in the classroom here, in the development of texts and a study course suited to the needs of our Bush Indians, I am enclosing a copy of a letter which I have circulated in order to get assistance in the development of an Arithmetic text.\n\nI have spent two years in the residential school here during which time I have been studying the needs of our children and working on the projects mentioned above.\nBefore taking over the classroom work I dealt with the Indian boys in farm and general work and noted many of their weaknesses in methods and language. Since coming into the classroom I have sought means of combating these.\n\nFor help in this work I have gone to missionaries, traders and educated Indians who have been engaged in Indian work for many years. Thus we have been able to bring to the problems many years of combined experience.\n\nTo aid in teaching English I have made a study of the Cree language and have discovered similarities and differences which have aided tremendously in the teaching of English; it has also given me\na better insight into the Indian nature and a better understanding of their problems. As most teachers do not stay in the work long enough, or have not the desire to learn the Cree I am desirous of getting the results of my work set down in permanent form. We have a small press here at the school on which we hope to do it, so that succeeding teachers may benefit from and progress beyond our work.\n\nAfter signature being on my teacher's certificate I thought you might be interested in seeing your course when we have it outlined, having so recently played a leading part in the educational system of this province.\n\nOne of the main reasons for lack of progress here has been\nthe lack of any definite objectives, at\nthe outset teachers find it impossible\nto teach the provincial course of\nstudies and seeing that what they\nare teaching is impractical and almost\nuseless in the lives of their pupils,\nthey become vacillating in policy\nand a good deal of the children's\nschool time is filled with\ntime-filling but purposeless work.\nWe urgently need a guide to work\nby and it has been my aim to\nwork one out for this school.\nIn some points it may be use-\nful to teachers in the whole\nLake Winnipeg district as we draw\npupils from all these reserves\nand I have received aid from\nalmost all of them.\n\nAs this is by last year in the\nschool here & hope to finish the work by\nthe end of the term and shall send\nit along to you. Hoping that you\nwill be interested, Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\nH.

Frostley Barley\nTo Mr. Hoey\nDept. of Mines and Resources\nInd. Branch\nOTTAWA\nCAN.\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI do thank you for your kind circular letter which you sent proud to us in January.\n\nI have now been over twenty-five years in our Anglican Indian schools. At first in boarding schools at Lac la Ronge for 7-8 years from 1911 to end of the war. Then in Southern Alberta at the Old Victoria Home at Brocket. And then to the Centre Regina day school, Wadena Man. Now at this day school for the past nearly ten years. So you can see I am keenly interested in all that concerns Indian education, both in Day and Residential Schools, & how it can best be related to the everyday life on the Reserve here as the missionary as well as my school teacher. I have to\nlook at the work from varied angles, to help them along. We have a sort of Mother Meeting in the Church Basement every Thursday afternoon, to which I encourage the ladies & that makes them have a little friendly rivalry as to how they bring their duties all up to date & clean! They are told take in a friendly cup of tea & a bit of something to go with it, & then take a little reading or chat & a prayer. While the bigger ladies come into the schoolroom for the afternoon.\n\nThen from Christmas to Easter, when the need is greatest, into nothing much to do & all play to do it\u2014& I tell the men to come on a Thursday evening to the Church Basement, where checker & dominoes await them. They have keen games, till it takes in a cup of tea & coffee all around. Then we have a Bible Class between 10 & 11 p.m. Sometimes I have\nas many as 30 at it. - and their Brotherhood meets around in their own homes on Sunday evenings, for a religious gathering. (I am not sure if they have meetings at Sunday school or Thursday evening.) I don't seem to have much time for visiting, with Day School. But I have an old Indian Lady Reader whose been here doing it for more than 30 years, so he mostly goes to do that part.\n\nThe Day School here is held in the front room of the Mission House. At present we have six, so there are no rooms at Boarding School + what I have are just beginning them as soon as they can fairly intelligently wander thro' the three Rs. - but they go mostly to our School at Akimiski.\n\nNow here is my problem - it is the upkeep of this schoolroom to come out of my pocket? It is badly needed doing up. Needs something like wood or linoleum to put along the walls neatly as they sit in their desks. - the rest of the walls & ceiling I fixed up myself.\nSince I came (ten years next Sept.) it did not occur to me to seek the D. Dept. for help, as I did what I could myself. - Neither I think did my predecessors (of 5 or 6 years before my time) This arrangement of having the school in the Mission House suits me very well, as Indians are coming all the time about something or other & in this way it can be managed very economically so I don't need to leave the children to speak to them, as it's just an annoyance to the tally. But I wondered if the D. Dept. could manage a small grant to do up the room - it tidy up their part the children use.\n\nAnother thing that is entering my mind is what to do for a Coronation Celebration for these Indians. A Feast & perhaps some kind of service like we have at Christmas followed by a service. - But should not each child have something given them, like a cup or a plate with coronation emblems on it? - and just how are\nthe funds for funds to be provided\nfor I could get these out of my\n$80 a month. Also quit a lot\nChildren are R.C.s on the Reserve\nI made no difference, + provided\nfor all kids on the Reserve at\nChristmas, clothing & toys & candy\nLill 18 months ago, when they\nput up an R.C. Church on the\nReserve, + their visiting priest,\n+ I divided up the children according\nto their baptism by one or other.\nSo far he + I get on very well,\neach going our own way with\nour own children. So we have\nbeen here some 57 years, + they\nonly just gone up. The whole\nis isolated down it makes little\ndifference so far... except to\nmyself, + I purchased a church on their\npoint when the R.C. priest + I are quite\nfriendly, + as I've lived a bit in\nR.C. countries so know them well.\nPoint what is good in them + go my\nown way in peace + friendliness, as\ntheir nation gained in accepting.\nNow what can be done on\nthese two problems? How to tidy up my schoolroom, & what to do about funds for a Coronation Celebration.\n\nMr. William Leahey, our Indian Agent, is recovering daily; he says that these last few months of his time are to be granted him as leave of absence, & thus ill health, (asthma & heart trouble) he greatly desires to move right away. He was hoping it would be April 1st, but so far has heard nothing further. So it's a question if he will be here for the Coronation week. Hence it seems up to me to do something about it myself, & get a new flag & flagpole too? & some decorations such as a Christmas tree.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Rev. Deaconess) Winifred H.

If you can make another one without inconvenience and send it forward, such action on your part will be very much appreciated.

These repairs, I understand, are ordinarily discussed with the Agent, who sends forward his recommendations to the Department. I shall be glad to keep in mind your request for a flag and flag post. The other repairs, I think, you should discuss with the Agent.\n\nI regret to state that we have no special appropriation here for Coronation ceremonies, although a number of requests have reached us for assistance. It is my hope, however, that the reserves will be able to observe the day appropriately, without incurring unnecessary expenses.\n\nAgain thanking you for your letter, I remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.

Conditions are in no sense uniform, hence the difficulty. In the meantime, however, it is my hope that our teachers will do everything they possibly can to place more emphasis on manual training, even though the facilities at their disposal may be somewhat inadequate.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.

I am very thankful to have your sympathy in this matter.\n\nIn regards to the two religions, the ReC's are only a small minority here, and most of them were former Methodist's and would easily change if they saw any advantage to themselves, for that is really most of the Indians religion (together to that Church which benefits him mostly) I am sorry to say.\n\nIn regards to goats, we can truly say that we have saved several children's lives here with fresh goats' milk, sickly undernourished tots pick right up and become healthy and strong on that milk.\n\nWe have a real good strain. I paid from $40.00 to $50.00 for our first Nannies. We are offering milking Nannies from $15.00 to $20.00 to $25.00 for the best, as we have too many now.\n\nThe Chief and Councillors here would like to have some of them, one Councillor made application to the Department for some but without avail.\n\nI think if the Department would help our people more in the way of making their own living, in giving them a few goats garden tools, scythes, etc., it would be far more beneficial than the present system of giving them rations which pauperizes them. I have noticed that every year they become more helpless.\n\nAnother thing the Missionary or Teacher whoever is on the Reserve ought to have authority from the Department to see that the Indians make proper use of the things given to them by the Department; in the spring for instance make them put in a garden. The Indian Agent only visits these Reserves once a year for a few hours.\n\nPlease excuse this lengthy letter but we really have the welfare of the Indian people at heart; they themselves never see far enough ahead.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note:]\n125-126\n150-60\nOttawa, April 23, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Schuetze:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant and to state, by way of comment, that I have discussed the subject matter of your communication very fully and in detail with Inspector Hamilton, who visited Ottawa a few days ago.\n\nInspector Hamilton is anxious to secure a number of goats for certain Indian reserves in the province of Manitoba. Consequently, I am of the opinion that you will experience no difficulty in disposing of your animals. You might, following the receipt of this letter, communicate with Mr. Hamilton and let him know exactly how many animals you have for sale.\n\nI discussed with the Inspector, also, your suggestion that the teacher or missionary be given authority to see that the Indians utilize properly the supplies sent them by the Department. I am hopeful that Inspector Hamilton will be able to adjust this problem.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Heey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nLuther L. Schuetze, Esq.,\nTeacher, Indian Day School,\nLittle Grand Rapids,\nvia Winnipeg, Man.\nGibson Reserve,\nBala, Ontario.\nApril 25th 1937.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSome time ago I received your very fine circular letter (\"180-60\") regarding the work of the Indian Day Schools.\n\nAbout 100% leave their school here at sixteen years of age to do manual work, get married and \"exist\" here. My husband (who is the missionary) and I organized three years ago, when we came here, handicraft classes for the boys and girls. We felt they needed to be instructed in the use of handwork as well.\n\nWe were financially helped to get started by the \"Dept.\" in tools for the boys and some cloth and yarn for the girls.\n\nMr. Powers holds regular classes for the boys and teaches them how to make useful things for their homes, how to care for the tools, uses of them, etc.,\nI have taught the girls how to sew and knit. They have knit themselves sweaters, stockings, sweaters, gloves and mitts. They sewed at first simple things, then later, articles of clothing. They have improved so well that some of them can cut out their own patterns for blouses, hats, pockets, etc., and then make up the articles very nicely by hand or machine. The boys and girls together made fine quilts recently. (At odd times I have taught the boys to patch their own clothes they happen to have on.) Some of them can sew equally as well as the girls in anything simple.\n\nOur biggest problem was getting materials. The normal training class was not very successful in obtaining free materials from the lumber companies around here. That had been a serious drawback. However, the girls have been more than happy in obtaining very fine materials which was sample cloth from friends who own or work in the various companies in Toronto. I wrote them what we\nwere doing and we liberally responded with odd pieces of cottons, flannels, various velvets, Mr. Jackson (manager of the wool firm of Palmer and Baldwin, who is a friend of ours) very kindly sent us twenty-two bales of wool in December, for the class. With liberal people here and there the sewing and knitting class has been provided for.\n\nWe have tried particularly hard to get some pupils to pass entrance and go to high school. Owing to the unfortunate fact that they will only spare English while at school, they have difficulty in expressing themselves as \"white\" people enough to pass the Grade VII white people's Grade Ontario's tests. It seems unfortunate that some special attention should not be given to their exams done in English in June at Bena.\n\nTrusting these few facts may enlighten you a bit on the outside (of the regular mathematical day school) work.\n\nI am,\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\n(Signed) Lucille B. Sommer.\nOttawa, April 30, 1937.\n\nDear Mrs. Sommer:\n\nPlease accept my most sincere thanks for your letter of the 25th instant and for the information contained therein.\n\nI was indeed encouraged to learn that you had been making a systematic attempt to promote vocational instruction at your school. The results, too, appear to be very gratifying. It is my hope that we will be able to move steadily in the direction of a worthwhile practical course of study in our Indian day schools and also in our residential schools.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Neey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMrs. Luella B. Sommer,\nGibson Reserve,\nBala, Ont.\nIndian Residential School\nAhousaht, B.C.\n\nApril 13th 1937.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nRe Domestic Training.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nIn outlining suggestions re vocational training and general Indian occupational betterment on the West Coast in my letter to you of March 15th, I confined my remarks to the boys and men. Of equal importance is the training of the girls. In the West Coast Indians we have a people of superior intelligence to any of the western Indians I have yet come in contact with. Nearly every Indian under forty to fifty years of age is a graduate of some residential school. Living conditions on the reserves, however, reflect comparatively little indication of training extending over such a period of time.\n\nDisease conditions, with T.B. and venereal disease predominant, are deplorable, due mainly to the housing conditions and the reluctance of Indians to advance more to the white standards of housekeeping. Many of the homes are large barns of dwellings where whole families, including the in-laws, live together, dominated more or less, as is the Indian custom, by the older generation. It is to these conditions that we have to send our girl graduates back, with little chance of putting into effect the teaching acquired in the schools.\n\nIt is the opinion of some medical authorities that the residential school is the medium by which health conditions among the Indians on the Reserves can be improved. While we can keep the children healthy at the school, and, by care, diet and treatment, build up those that come to us under physical disability, it has been amply demonstrated that such care is to a large extent neutralized as a permanent benefit when children have to return to living conditions on the Reserve.\n\nThe solution, to my mind, is in the training of the girls that are to make the future homes, set by an aggressive and authoritative programme of reserve betterment starting in the schools and being followed up in the villages.\n\nBuilding material is cheap on the Coast. The large cedars, of which there is an almost inexhaustible supply, at least until the commercial fir is no longer available, is used for all building purposes, with the exception of flooring. The cedar is hand split into shakes; or large shingles, which provides the outside covering for walls and roof. Some of the small lumber mills used to saw logs brought to the mill for one-half of the lumber content, but this is no longer usual. However, there is no reason why graduates of the schools, on marriage, should not have a comfortable cottage building ready for occupancy, thus gradually doing away with the large community house or the alternative small overcrowded shack, with the disease conditions and the unhealthy immoral conditions which these propagate. Furthermore, with a home of their own to go to, graduates would have opportunity to\nIndian Residential School\nAhousaht, B.C.\n\nMr. Hoey (2)\n\ncontinue the habits formed at the school and be removed from the subversive domination of the elders. I have tried to interest the graduates of this school, now in the village, some of them married, in this matter of separate home building, but, while they all admit that it would be very desirable, we cannot bring sufficient pressure to bear upon them to arouse them to this activity. Nor is the training of the girls in the school in domestic work of the type to so inculcate better domestic habits in them while they are in school that they would insist on improvement in the village or at their marriage.\n\nOur equipment is perhaps unusually poor at this school, but in general our conditions here apply to all schools. The older girls make the meals for the children, each one with alternating duties, and also work in the laundry, where the washing is done by machinery, and, washing on three mornings in the week, we have all we can do even with machine equipment to get the washing done. The ironing and sewing is, indeed, practical training which they can take with them on graduation, but, for the most part, the training is of necessity part of the school routine, and no time or facility is available for practical general housekeeping and the care of a home in which they could take individual pride, which they could take with them as a standard to maintain after leaving school.\n\nI have had in mind since taking up this work the building of a three or four room cottage, the lumber being obtained by cutting logs and having them sawn at a mill; all the work and the building being done by the boys under conditions such as could be undertaken without outside assistance in the village. The cottage could be furnished mainly by home constructed furniture and decorated and arranged by the girls. A member of the staff could occupy one of the bedrooms, and two or three girls, alternating monthly, occupy the cottage, make their own meals, wash with wash-tub and board, and be given a budget to keep house with. If the habit could be instilled into them sufficiently by personal pride in a home such as they could have in the village, I doubt very much whether they would be satisfied to go back to the present condition of community life, with meals, for instance, of straight fish or seal meat picked up by the fingers from a dish or perhaps a cedar mat spread on the floor.\n\nI have within the last few days had a problem with a girl, now sixteen, whose father wants her to leave school. The father is elderly and is on relief. Her brother is a graduate of this school but has perforce gone back to Indian conditions of living in the village. The father has no home of his own and lives wherever he can, sometimes in one of the smokehouses in the village. He furthermore lives with an old woman, more for company, I presume, than anything else. Emma is a bright, attractive girl. We have had her helping at the residence and doing some of the cooking occasionally. Her manners at our table are no different from our own. If she were to leave school now to the conditions to which she would have to go, in twelve months time there would be little indication in her habits that she had ever known the \"white\" people's mode of life.\nIndian Residential School\nAhousaht, B.C.\n\nMr. Hoey (3)\n\nCapt. Barry, the Department Inspector, when he was here recently in the matter of the report on educational matters about which you wrote me, was ready to recommend that Emma be kept at the school until she was eighteen, but I am of the opinion that she can be better occupied in the domestic care and betterment of her father and brother, under proper conditions. I therefore saw the father and brother, and told them that, if they would acquire a suitable home, which I would inspect, and equip it in a satisfactory way so as to be comfortable for both themselves and Emma and permit her to continue housekeeping as she has been taught here, then I would consider asking for her discharge at the end of this term. This they promised to do, and the brother is quite capable of doing it when the incentive is strong enough. This is not an isolated problem, but applies to at least half the girls now attending school, although this is an outstanding case.\n\nIn the matter of the report which was required re educational matters on the West Coast, may I say that I have given my opinion of conditions and needs with an unbiased mind, eliminating altogether personal considerations. May I suggest then, should a central residential school be built on the Coast, that consideration be given to the training of both the boys and girls with a view to the gradual betterment of Reserve living conditions as well as the industrial future of the Indians. A domestic training unit for the girls, practical and suitable to Reserve conditions, would, I think, do more to control disease and immoral conditions than any policy which the Government could undertake without enormous expense, and would be more permanent than any possible policy.\n\nTo assist reserve housing betterment, a small sawmill at the school, inexpensively erected and operated, and available to the Indians of the Coast for sawing material for house and boat construction, would provide vocational training, would provide such boat material for the building suggested in my previous letter, and would make available to the graduates material for home construction along designated lines on leaving school or on marriage. It would be a desirable complement to the proposed providing of school constructed boats for the equipment of the boys in the fishing industry.\n\nI have had much discussion on the Coast with Whites and Indians regarding the practicability of the proposed West Coast Indian Co-operative organisation. It seems to be a generally accepted fact that some such organisation is the only means of securing the industry to the Indians as a permanent means of support. May I suggest that the matter merits investigation? There is no sound reason why the Indian industry might not be later developed to include canning plants on the co-operative basis also, as many of the girls and women are employed in such plants during the summer.\n\nI am of the opinion that, on the West Coast, we have the material to hand, in the intelligence and industry of the Indian people, with the fishing industry responsive to organised development, as the Japanese have shown it to be, to make a marked advance in Indian administration, leading to independence and eventual citizenship. Sincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, May 4, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Caldwell:\n\nPlease pardon me for not replying to your letter of the 13th ultimo until now. I have been absent from the office on an inspection trip, hence the delay.\n\nI may state, by way of comment, that I have studied the suggestions submitted by you for my consideration very carefully and in detail. It is my hope that I shall receive, from the Commissioner for British Columbia, a full and comprehensive report of educational facilities on the west coast of Vancouver Island in the course of a few days.\n\nI am inclined to think you would be well advised to discuss with Major MacKay the suggestions contained in the latter sent forward to me. I think you will find him very sympathetically disposed to your proposals and very anxious to cooperate with you in a worthwhile programme.

Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI just felt I wanted to add a few words to what I said in my letter of February 10th, 1937, in regard to the \"Follow-Up\" work, mentioned in your letter of January 13th, 1937, #150-60.\n\nI have the impression that if the area where Indians live and where graduates seek and find employment was divided into districts and some Superintendent or agencies, principal of school, missionary or agent was definitely appointed for that district and given responsibility and, to some extent, authority to deal with graduates employed or in business for themselves, giving them advice, encouragement and in cases where their conduct was not proper to have some authority in having them either sent back to the reserve or otherwise dealt with, it would be a step in the right direction.\n\nAs you know, many of these young people having been under the care of a school for so long find it difficult to adjust themselves to their new freedom when they get out and some recognized officer of the Department could give them a great deal of help and have a very decided restraining influence upon some of them who especially need it.\nOttawa, May 10, 1937.\n\nDear Dr. Doyle:\n\nI desire to thank you very heartily for your letter of the 7th instant and for the suggestion contained therein.\n\nI may state, by way of comment, that the organization of an effective \"follow-up\" system was discussed very fully and in detail with the western Inspectors when they attended a conference at Ottawa a few weeks ago. I may say that I have experienced a great deal of difficulty in working out what might be considered a worthwhile system. I have, however, prepared a number of forms that will be sent forward to the Principals of residential schools in the course of a few days. When these forms reach you, you will note that the Principals are asked to give specific information in respect to the conduct and academic standing of the pupils and forward this information to the Agents. The Agents, for the time being at least, are specifically charged with the responsibility of keeping in touch with these pupils and of making an attempt to see that they are protected and, if possible, given an opportunity to become self-supporting. It is just possible that we may have to amend these regulations from time to time. In the meantime, however, I am anxious that a start should be made, and I am hopeful that the experiment will be measurably successful.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM GEORGE H. GOODREID, TEACHER,\nKITKATLA INDIAN DAY SCHOOL, dated May 3, 1937.\n\nOrig. on 168-18-1.\n\nWith regard to vocational and manual training, the girls should be taught sewing and knitting, and the boys, woodwork. This can be started as soon as a grant is given or arrangements made for special requisitions.\n\nIt would possibly be of real assistance to teachers in isolated places like this if some literature on this work were made available. If there are no elementary textbooks, reports or suggestions from teachers with special qualifications may make for efficiency and prevent inadequate or too elaborate progress being attempted.\nGleichen, Alta.\nMay 26, 1937.\n\nAttention Mr R.A.Hoey,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters to Indian Agents and to School Principals re the \"follow-up\" recommendations for Ex-pupils.\n\nAs you know, a similar plan as suggested was started on this Reserve many years ago; large Band Funds, of course, assisted in the experiment. The Millionaire's son is never a good example and we may put the young Blackfoot in that class. However, may we be permitted to make a comment or two.\n\nVery few (if any) boys, white or brown, will settle down to work at 17 or 18 without close supervision. The average Indian boy must see his new world on horseback or by car, for at least two years; it is not only a waste of money but possibly derogatory to his future to give him a farm or equipment for which he is entirely irresponsible and from which he may get a quick return of considerable size. Very few parents of Boarding School children have the slightest idea of parental responsibility. This is not his fault but rather the curse of the whole educational system. As a result, you cannot put dependence on the average parent to constructively help to build a responsible character out of the boys or girls from an institution. No Agent, Farming Instructor, Stockman or other Supervisor can get far with a boy who is a free agent. The lad is at the age when he thinks he knows everything!!\n\nSo long as there are Boarding Schools, I believe we must either let the ex-pupils get oriented into their new world by the saddle horse along the wild oat route or else follow up the Boarding school with instructive farm-work or apprenticeship in some line to which he may seem fitted, where he is paid and granted more liberties than at school. All this would be under supervision of both sexes and though I cannot elaborate on it here, the cost should not be prohibitive, possibly economy in the long run. We will watch with interest the results of your experiment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 4, 1937.\n\nRe: \"follow-up\" system.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo and to thank you very heartily for the comments contained therein. I may state, by way of comment, that it is our intention to organize a \"follow-up\" system that will enable us to have on file here in the Department a record of the progress made by the pupils during the years immediately following their departure from a residential school. This task is undertaken by way of experimentation and in the hope that it will prove useful.\n\nIf the pupils, during the first year or two after graduation, display a tendency toward waywardness, we should have at our disposal here specific information relating to such conduct. It is my hope, therefore, that there is no conflict between the work we are attempting and the views you express. It is just possible that we may not be able to do much in helping a pupil immediately following his emergence from school. We should at least, however, attempt to keep in close touch with him and, by cooperation with the missionaries, keep him under close supervision, in the hope that, later, when he applies for assistance, we can know exactly the type of individual with whom we are dealing. If, from time to time, any thoughts occur to you in respect to the \"follow-up\" system and ways whereby it could be strengthened and improved, I want you to feel free to communicate with me again.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

This will not be sufficient for our graduates this year as over twenty forms will be needed.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal.\nMiss E. A. Yates,\nTzunahla Day School,\nCanyon City, Mill Bay,\nNanaimo River, B.C.,\nMay 15th, 1937.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nDept. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs,\nCanada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour kind remarks and your interest in my work and the welfare of the Indian children was a source of encouragement to me.\n\nI note what you say concerning the vocational training of the children. Here the chief occupation is fishing. The boys start to accompany their fathers in this work while still very young so that by the time they are fourteen or fifteen years of age they know a great deal about fishing and are\ncapable of handling the ordinary gas boat or canoe. A careful study of the tide tables and their influence upon the fish would be very helpful. They build their own houses halls etc. Therefore, I am of the opinion that they should receive a good training in carpentry and be given a general knowledge of the other trades that enter into the making of a good home.\n\nSewing, knitting, home nursing and household economics are the studies that would help to make our Indian girls into good home makers. Fish net making would be a very useful training in this district for many of the women are able to earn good money by making and mending fish nets. Because the old Indian art of basket making is rapidly disappearing, I think some instruction along this line should be given in our schools.\nMy school is a very small one which makes it difficult to give vocational training. The cost of materials and equipment would be so great in comparison with the number of children benefited. I have done very little of this work in actual school hours. In connection with the Salvation Army activities I have been holding a sewing class for girls one night a week.\n\nNext year I would like to teach sewing and knitting in the school. One of the older native women, Mrs. Apah, would be willing to come and teach the children basket making one afternoon a week. Arrangements could be made for the same lady to teach them net making and mending.\n\nSeeing that the Government grant for this school is small an additional grant to buy material and to give a small\nremuneration to the native women,\nwould be necessary. I understand that\nthe Inspector is recommending that a grant\nbe given for this purpose. I hope arrange-\nments can be made fairly early in the\nnext school year for the mail only once\na month, cause great delay in securing\nmaterial etc.\n\nIf I can secure the information\nnecessary I will endeavour to instruct\nthe boys in the detailed knowledge\nof the tide tables.\n\nThe older girls and boys who have\nleft school take a very active part in\nall that takes place in the village.\nThis winter they have been attending\nBible classes which have helped them to\nretain their knowledge of English.\nThey are greatly interested in music\nand spend much of their spare time\npractising on their instruments.\nSome of the older boys have their own boats and go fishing on their own, while the others help their fathers.\n\nHoping that it will be possible for the Dept. to supply the grants which will make it possible to give the children some of the vocational training they need so much, I am,\n\nYours Truly,\nCapt. E. G. Yates (signature)\nKwahala School (name)\nCanyon City\nNass River\nB. C.\nOttawa, June 8, 1937.\n\nDear Miss Jater:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th ultimo and to thank you very heartily for the information contained therein.\n\nI am deeply interested in the attempts you are making to promote vocational instruction at your school and note, with interest, your reference to certain supplies that will be necessary before you can proceed. I shall make arrangements to have the supplies purchased, just as soon as a recommendation from the Inspector or from the Indian Agent reaches the Department. You might, if you so desire, communicate with either the Inspector or the Agent, giving in detail the supplies you have in mind.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss Edith A. Jater,\nTeacher,\nGwinnha Indian Day School,\nCanyon City, Hill Bay,\nB. C.\nWalpole Island Ont. June 4th 1937.\n\nSir,\n\nIn acknowledging receipt of your letter dated May 15th 1937 in reference to a follow-up system for pupils graduating from Indian residential schools, I might say that I consider this one of the best suggestions I have had in some time. I consider the same plan should be used for pupils graduating from local Highschool, Technical schools, or Collegiate institute. I have felt that there was missing link, after pupils graduating from schools of high learning, and were allowed to drift back to the Reserves, and become re-established among their own people and in a year or two lose all desire to better themselves, very often the older Indian encourages them to again take up the Indian mode of life. Often the Indian pupil is capable after graduating, of competing with other races if he once get a start. They are backward or have an inferiority complex and many of them won't push for the first start.\n\nYou do say if the follow-up plan is intended for those pupils who graduate from Highschools, or for those who pass there entrance, it will do doubt help in both cases.\n\nOn the Walpole Reserve we have a girl who attends Normal this year, and I expect she will pass. She passed the fifth form at highschool last year. I would like this girl to be placed in a teachers position or some other good position without a gap between her the time of her graduating and and secure a position, she is a conscientious worker, but would probably carry on better if she could get a start soon after her graduating. We also have a young man here that completed the regular course at the Sarnia Collegiate a year ago. He is now working as a labourer, I have been trying to have in place ins a better position.\nOf course I do mean that all Indian pupils who graduate should be taken away from the farm, but there are always some that are not inclined to farm, and living as the Walpole Island Indians do right on the U.S. border and close to Detroit Mich., where wages are quite high, and much of the time work quite plentifully, it is hard to keep the young people on the farm. This applies to some extent to the white as well as the Indian people, but the Indian is quite apt to forget the farm if he can see a daily or weekly pay check coming in. It is estimated that over 150 of our Indian people from Walpole Island are working on the U.S. side now, the majority crossing daily to work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian affairs branch,\nDepartment of mines and resources,\nOttawa, June 11th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to circular letter of the 15th ultimo.\n\nI believe it would be advisable to keep a record of those for whom the Department has provided a tuition grant to enable them to attend high school. It would be interesting to know at the end of five years what use they have made of the educational advantages that have been given to them. A supply of forms for this purpose will be forwarded to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA.

I shall be very pleased to cooperate in carrying out this project.\n\nWe have an unusual number of children graduating this year so that the number of copies of the Report sent will not be sufficient. I should be glad if you would send me at least 5 more copies.\n\nThis is in answer to circular letter of May 15th, signed by Mr. R.A. Hoey, Supt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 15th, 1937, re the \"follow-up\" system for pupils graduating from Indian Residential Schools, together with a copy of letter sent to the Principals of Residential Schools, also a copy of the Form which will be used for report purposes, and may add that contents have been carefully noted,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nB.T.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSup't of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 25th Jan., last, in which you express the opinion that more time should be devoted to vocational instruction in our schools.\n\nAt this school we now have a small workshop in which the boys are given instruction in carpentry. No provision is made for vocational training of any kind for the girls.\n\nManual training classes are held twice weekly immediately following the regular school hours and it is suggested that a change be made so that this tuition be given during regular school hours\u2014two afternoons each week.\n\nTo provide for the girls during these\nproposed periods, an arrangement might be made for instruction in basketry, mat-making and needlework, by a native teacher.\n\nSuch teaching could be carried on without interruption from the beginning of October to the end of March - six months. Fees paid to the native teacher might be fixed at say one dollar per lesson, which would, in six months, almost total $50.\n\nEquipment and material for the girls use would cost about $35 per annum, with perhaps an additional $10 for the first year, when the initial equipment purchases would be higher in cost than during subsequent years.\n\nA regular annual allowance should be made for the purchase of material for use in the boys manual training room. $35 per annum would, I think, be sufficient.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. A. Bryant\nOttawa, June 14, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant and to thank you very heartily for the information contained therein.\n\nI want to congratulate you, if I may, on the attempt you have been making to promote vocational instruction at your school. I note, with interest, your reference to the desirability of employing a native teacher. I am anxious that you should discuss this matter with the Agent and also submit, for his consideration and approval, a list of the facilities necessary to provide this instruction. If you do this, the Agent's recommendation will be very sympathetically considered when it reaches the Department.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. T. A. Bryant,\nTeacher, Indian Bay School,\nNesthahtla, B.

It is my hope that we shall be able to improve it from time to time until we have on file here a complete record of every residential school graduate during the five or six years immediately following their graduation. In the meantime, it is gratifying to learn that the graduates of your school have been making a reasonably good showing. I shall be glad to keep this list on file for future reference.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Neey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. A. R.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your circular concerning the follow-up system for pupils from residential schools, and may say that I am pleased with this new system.\n\nThese regulations will refer only to pupils who have remained at school for the usual terms of years. I would be pleased to know exactly what is this usual term of years. According to the Indian Act, the pupils should be discharged when they are 15 years old. According to the actual regulations of the Indian Affairs Branch, they should be discharged when they are 15 years old. What is the limit of age? Or is a pupil bound to remain at school a certain number of years, and what is this number of years?\n\nI will pleased to get information in this connection that I may forward the forms of follow-up system to Mr. Indian Agent Mac Donald.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Joe Angin,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 17th, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Indian Act provides that the compulsory age for the attendance of Indian children at residential schools is between seven and sixteen years; although, with our permission, children may be kept in a residential school until they reach the age of eighteen years.\n\nThe Department has made no definite ruling regarding the exact number of years a pupil should remain in a residential school. The age for admission and discharge was set with the understanding in mind that, within that term of years, the average pupil would be able to cover the course of studies at any Indian residential school.\n\nThis year and in future years, the forms for the follow-up system should be forwarded to the Indian Agent concerned for those pupils who have been in your school for a reasonable length of time and have satisfactorily completed the work which has been assigned to them.\n\nIt is not necessary to forward forms for pupils who have been discharged owing to illness or who were only in school for a year or two.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nThunderchild Indian Res. School,\nDelmas, Sask.\n\nR. A. Ross,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES & RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nOttawa, May 15th, 1937.\n\nTo Indian Agents:\n\nIt has been decided by the Department to inaugurate a \"follow-up\" system for pupils graduating from Indian residential schools.\n\nEnclosed, for your information, is a copy of a letter which is being directed to the Principals of the residential schools, also a copy of the form which will be used for report purposes.\n\nThis year, you will receive from the Principal of each residential school, a list of the pupils who will be discharged in June, 1938. This is intended to give you an opportunity of discussing the welfare of the graduates with those interested and deciding on the best plan to suggest to the graduating pupil.\n\nYou will, also, receive this year a form from the Principal giving the necessary information regarding each pupil from your agency who is being discharged at the end of the current academic year, namely, June 30th. Immediately on receipt of this form, you should get in touch with the farm instructor or other official on the reserve to which the pupil is proceeding with a view to assisting the pupil during the critical years following departure from residential school. The forms which you receive should be carefully filled in your office and, at the end of the first, second, third and fourth years, you should briefly record on them the progress made by the pupil. At the end of the fifth year, you should report more fully and forward the form to the Department.\n\nYou will appreciate that this attempt is largely experimental. Success will depend almost wholly upon the willingness of the Indian Agents and those associated with them in Indian work to cooperate in an endeavour to assist the graduates from our residential schools.\n\nThe Department will be glad to receive suggestions from time to time as to the manner in which you consider the methods employed could be improved.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nFOLLOW-UP REPORT ON RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL GRADUATE\n\nIndian Residential School\nMay 31st, 19...........\n\nTO .................................\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nI desire to inform you that the under-mentioned pupil will be discharged from this school on .................................\n\nName of Pupil & register number .................................\n\nAge on Discharge .................................\n\nNumber of years in school .................................\n\nTrade or industry learned .................................\n\nGeneral remarks of Principal re above pupil .................................\n\nReserve to which pupil is being sent .................................\n\nPrincipal.\n\nREPORT OF INDIAN AGENT regarding life of above pupil since date of discharge.\n\nEnd of First Year .................................\n\nEnd of Second Year .................................\n\nEnd of Third Year .................................\n\nEnd of Fourth Year .................................\n\nEnd of Fifth Year .................................\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nNote:- On the completion of the pupil's studies, this form must be filled in by the Principal and sent forward to the Agent in charge of the Reserve to which the pupil is returning.

At the end of five years, this form should be sent forward to the Department.\n\n500-657\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES & RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nOttawa, May 15th, 1937.\n\nTo Principals\nof Indian Residential Schools:\n\nIt has been decided by the Department to inaugurate\na \"follow-up\" system for pupils graduating from Indian residential schools. We feel certain that we shall receive your enthusiastic cooperation in the promotion of this project.\n\nThe following suggestions are submitted for your guidance: You will note that these refer to pupils who have remained in your school for the usual term of years. It is understood that certain pupils are discharged for medical and other reasons before their education is completed. These regulations are not designed for such pupils.\n\n(1) About one year previous to the discharge of any pupil, the Indian Agent concerned should be advised. Full particulars should be given regarding the reserve from which the pupil comes and, if possible, the names of his or her parents. This will enable the Indian Agent to consider what is the best advice to give a pupil on discharge, regarding his future welfare.\n\n(2) One month before a pupil is actually discharged, one of the enclosed forms should be completed for such pupil. These should be forwarded to the Indian Agent from whose agency the pupil comes.\n\n(3) If there is a missionary belonging to your Church on the reserve to which the pupil is going, you should also advise him regarding the name of the pupil.\n\n(4) When pupils are being discharged, they should be advised that the Agent is being requested to report on their future progress and they should be urged to make proper use of the instructions they have received.\n\nIt is\nIt is understood that these regulations will apply to students leaving residential schools at the end of the present academic year. Notices also should be sent out this year in respect to pupils who will graduate at the end of the academic year 1938.\n\nFor your information, I enclose copy of a letter which is being directed to all Indian Agents. You will note that we are endeavouring to interest all those directly or indirectly connected with our work in regard to the future welfare of ex-pupils. In this manner, we hope to assist them during the critical years following their departure from our educational institutions.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRegarding paragraph two in your circular of May 15th last, may I ask for a more definite statement regarding the words, \"you will note that these refer to pupils who have remained in school the usual number of years,\" where is the usual number of years? Does it refer to the Act which definitely states that compulsory education applies to all children between the ages of seven and sixteen. Children who have been sent home sick of course are not eligible.\n\nLast year I had children come into school running in age from seven to fourteen, and I know of a number who have gone much over the stipulated senior year Indian Act Standard.\n\nChildren in Grade I at the age of ten to fourteen are a hold-up to a teacher and to the school without taking into consideration the great wrong inflicted upon the child. You will, I am sure, admit that is a delinquency somewhere, and I feel that if you could make a definite statement as to the interpretation in your mind when writing the above quoted words, it would clarify the situation for me. It would also definitely make provision for no deflecting of work, giving no room for excuse either from the parent or field official.\n\nPersonally I have tried to use the Act, but to no avail, because of no definite action from and through others. If a follow-up scheme is to be evolved, then fundamentally it must carry some definiteness. I would be glad of something really definite which I could use during our closing exercises on the night of the 29th instant, in addressing the parents and in talking to the immediate graduates.\n\nI trust you will overlook my desire for something definite, for if we are going to get away from the spirit of \"any old thing is good enough for the Indian children\", we must do something.\nMy long experience with the Indian work has taught me to look for a definite statement which will not permit means of responsibility to escape.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nA. R. LETT\nOttawa, June 21, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Lett:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, in which you ask for additional information, in respect to the subject matter of paragraph 2 of the circular sent out from the Department May 15th, last.\n\nI may state, by way of comment, that this attempt to organize an effective \"follow-up\" system is largely experimental, and it was our intention that the circular letter should be merely suggestive. It is exceedingly difficult to submit, at this stage, definite or arbitrary proposals. I am rather inclined to think the changes will have to be made from time to time, in an attempt to improve and perfect the system.\n\nWhat I have in mind at the moment is a report from the Principal to the Indian Agent on every pupil who has received instruction at his school, with the exception of sick children who may be sent home from time to time or pupils who may be transferred from one residential school to another.\n\nYou will note that, on the report to the Agent, you are asked to state the number of years the pupil has been in attendance at school. You can readily appreciate, therefore, that the Department will be in a position to obtain from these reports the exact period a pupil may have spent at a residential school and that this information will come to us from the Principal in charge of the institution and will be reliable and authoritative in all cases.\n\nI have been somewhat disturbed to learn that pupils have been entering your school, ranging in age\n\nfrom\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\nfrom 7 to 14. I had an impression that recruiting was so keen and so vigorous in British Columbia that very few pupils had an opportunity to remain out of school, other than those in attendance at Indian day schools. If such is not the case, then the matter should be taken up with the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, the Provincial Inspector of Schools and the Indian Agent. I feel confident the Government and the taxpayers of Canada will not tolerate an official whose attitude to Indian education is expressed in the phrase you quote: \"Any old thing is good enough for the Indian children\". As a matter of fact, the Government of Canada today is spending more money on the children in attendance at our Indian residential and day schools than the amount being spent on a group of children of similar age in any country or which I have knowledge. In view of this fact, the Government expects results, and I am inclined to think that the system on the whole has worked reasonably well. This does not mean that it should not be improved, and, in our attempts to improve it, we are depending upon the cooperation of the Principals of our schools, the Missionaries on the reserve and the officials of the Department who have had experience in the field. I consider it the duty of these officials to point out to us, from time to time, any weaknesses that they may discover or any abuses that may be in evidence. If they are willing to do this, I shall be glad to make a sincere and earnest attempt to correct them from here.\n\nI want to thank you for the courtesy that prompted you to write and for the information contained in your letter.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Heay,\nSept. of Welfare & Training.\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to your circular letter of May 15th last regarding the follow-up system for pupils graduating from Indian Residential Schools.\n\nThe principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School requires a further supply of the Forms 500-657 on which the follow-up reports are made.\n\nHe states that only five forms were received, which is insufficient to cover the pupils graduating this year.\n\nWill you please have a supply of the forms mailed direct to the Principal, Cariboo Indian Residential School, 150 Mile House P.O., B.C.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E. Taylor\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOTTAWA\nMission House,\nKingcome Inlet, B.C.\nJune 10th, 1937.\n\nDr. R.A. HOEY,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI very much appreciate your letter dated January 25th, but which did not reach me till March. Please excuse the delay but before writing I wished to discuss the matter with people here and to give it some thought. I will be very glad to give all the assistance and cooperation in my power and any suggestions you wish to give will be carried out as well as circumstances will permit.\n\nYour ideas with regard to a \"Follow-up System\" are in accordance with my own although any instruction in vocational training would be extremely difficult as the children are often absent. Fishing and logging are the chief activities here. Although there is some of the best agricultural land in this valley the Indians show little inclination to farm. When either of the two farmers in the valley desire hired help they are obliged to get it from Vancouver. This seems a pity as many of the younger men have been to the Residential School at Alert Bay where they learned some farming.\n\nI will give you a resum\u00e9 of our activities and perhaps you will be good enough to offer criticism and advice.\n\nFirst of all we both give every encouragement to the Indians. For example, a few of the older boys and girls have expressed a wish to continue their studies next year. Should they do so I have agreed to allow them to come for instruction after school and to study in the house during the day. I trust this is in order. My school would be too unwieldy otherwise.\n\nWe have three branches of the Woman's Auxiliary Branch of the Church. The older women do knitting, make garments, fancywork and make quilts. We teach the Girls' Branch fancywork, plain sewing and knitting while the Juniors learn plain sewing. As yet we have nothing like that for the young boys.\n\nTwice a week I have classes in reading and writing for the adult men and women. They are enthusiastic but unfortunately their nomadic habits do not make for much progress. One afternoon all the little pre-school age children come to school. This is to teach them some English so that when they do come to school it will be easier for them and for me. The parents are greatly interested.\n\nWhen I came here three years ago many of the young men had musical instruments (saxophones, trombones and the like), but knew nothing at all of music. I told them that I could and would teach them the rudiments of music and how to follow an instruction book. They have worked hard and can now play all the latest dance tunes. There are now two piano accordions, three saxophones, a cornet, two trombones, a drum, a banjo and guitars.\nI also teach individual lessons on the organ and the children\nand taught the rudiments of music with the object of having a school\nband with toy instruments. We have part singing after the Tuesday\nand Wednesday evening services. The Indians like it very much.\n\nOn Friday afternoons I teach the schoolchildren games and folk-\ndancing. We also have dancing classes for the older boys and girls.\n\nI have told you all this so that you will have some idea of what\nis already being done and so that you can, if you will, offer\ncriticism and advice. Everything mentioned takes place after school\nhours. Besides we have the usual Church Services and Sunday classes.\n\nMy school is large (42 on the register) but I would like very\nmuch to have some manual training. If I could get the materials I\ncould let the children make sweaters, hooked rugs, dresses and some\ncarpentry as seatwork (supervised). Perhaps also, with the\ncooperation of my colleague, they could do some cooking and gardening.\nIs it possible to obtain an initial grant from the Department for\nthe purchase of such things as: a sewing machine, knitting needles,\nrug hooks, crochet hooks, wool, dress materials, sewing cotton, needles\npins, carpentry tools, flour etc. and gardening tools? I would also\nappreciate a book on manual training. Training. The things made by the\nchildren could perhaps be sold at a part of the price going to the\nchild who made the article, a part for more materials and a part to\nthe school (or anything you suggest). In this way after the first\noutlay the venture would be self-supporting.\n\nShould you wish to communicate with me during the holiday months\nmy letters will be forwarded from the above address or, my address\nwill be:\n\n4506 West 9th Avenue,\nPoint Grey,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nHoping my letter is satisfactory\nI am,\nYours very truly,\n\nMiss P. M. Armstrong\nOttawa, June 26, 1937.\n\nDear Miss Arrowsmith:\n\nPlease accept my most sincere thanks for your letter of the 10th instant and for the information contained therein. Your letter and the report of the Inspector on your school both suggest that you have been doing very effective work.\n\nI am deeply interested in the promotion of vocational instruction or manual training at all our schools. I am aware, of course, that, in the case of the small Indian day school, there are obstacles that cannot be easily overcome.\n\nMay I suggest to you that you communicate with the Indian Agent for your district, giving him a list of the supplies necessary to make a start with the manual training you have in mind. If you do this, the Agent's recommendation, when it reaches the Department, will be very sympathetically considered. You might, also, discuss with the Agent or with the Inspector, the disposal of the articles made by the pupils, but I can, personally, see no objection to the suggestion contained in your letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

C.\nBIRTLE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n(PRESBYTERIAN)\nREV. E. H. LOCKHART, PRINCIPAL\n\nBIRTLE, MAN., June 10, 1937\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nYour letter re \"Follow Up\" system for pupils\nto hand which I am very pleased to have received.\nEver since I entered upon this work about two years ago I have\nbeen much concerned about the very poor outlook for the boys\nand girls from schools. From my experience here I can say that\nthey are children of promise only handled properly little\nthings will give good account of themselves. It is true that\nwe have our problems in handling some of them, yet I am not\nafraid to have them compared to conduct while in our school\nwith an equal number of boys and girls of our white people. Our\nboys play hockey, baseball, foot ball etc. with the white boys and\nwe hear something of the complimentary remarks that are\nmade in their behalf. Until we see performances in demonstrations\nsuch as that at Boarding School when they are working here\nunder good leadership I do not say I don't know where I could\nfind white boys to surpass them.\n\nSo far the Department seems to me to have provided nothing\ndefinite for their future except the London Resources. They are\nsigned into our schools to be under the guardianship of the\nprincipal for such term as the Department of Indian Affairs\nIt seems advisable. Then as young as even sixteen. If Department takes, we have no further authority over them. We are so very busy in our school that we cannot possibly be on the Reserve to which they have gone to get their leadership.\n\nAnd to my mind the Indians require definite leadership in their life and work throughout the entire life of their individual and for generations to come. They have inherited indolent and indifferent habits. But I believe from my experience with these children, that when you as a Department take them out of your hands, you would give them another leadership in work that appeals to them. Yes, even just that one work you have in store by them on the Reserve, namely farming, and let them see that their is encouragement then in keeping with the work that they do, that they would respond well. But themselves they do very little on their own initiative.\n\nFor instance, in conversation with Agent Smith along this line he told me of an Indian Lynn McGlynn whom I know well, working for Mr. Molson, who lives farming near the Reserve. And that Mr. Molson said he never had a better man work for him. Now Molson further says that after Lynn had worked for him for some time he gave him a team of horses to go home to his Reserve for a week to do some work for himself, and that after ten days absence he went to see how Lynn was getting along and found that he had done nothing.\n\nI have a man in our school, William Stone, farm instructor, and blacksmith, who I find is just the type to bear such leadership. He has great ability as a mechanic. He is capable doing each and every fairly work required in the erection of schools of building such as we have as well as has been done and doing some plants decidedly better.\n\nI would be very sorry to lose him. But I believe that if such leader-\nIf we provided for the Indians the results would be excellent. And if a joint would do to those who are trying to do our best for the children in the schools. But to say that you will never get anything worthwhile with them until you change your system to that of definite leadership. Your present system of farm instructors and school on some reserve seems to me to be money almost completely thrown away.\n\nWhen you think for instance of a Reserve forty section land with about fifty families, affirm instructors for several years and almost approximately a section and a half of land under cultivation, and a lot of that very poor farming well I must say if I were the man appointed as farm instructor I wouldn't want to stay more than two months.\n\nI have some boys asking if they might stay here and work during the holidays. I hardly mind having them and will pay them according to the work they do. Perhaps just turning sixteen. I don't want them to do more than they are capable of doing. But I believe they will do as much as two ordinary white men and if they do more they will get pay accordingly.\n\nI might here mention that Agent Smith asked me a short time ago if I had any school who could take charge of a tractor on the Crees or other reserves. I was in position to tell him that he had five or six boys fifteen or about sixteen sixteen years old who were in charge of a tractor on our school farm. But when I did not consider that a boy that young should be expected to take such a heavy responsibility as to handle a tractor so far out reach of help from some older person. I looked for someone else until eighteen years of age. I consider he could give them more time more efficient tractor men. I think fifteen is about young enough to start Adam at that work here at school.\nSince my coming here we have met the approval of your Department in establishing a school, and after selling materials for the payment of the labor we have erected as follows:\n\n- Implement shed 34' x 16' ft\n- A Hutten 18' x 8' ft\n- A Hog Pen 25' x 14' ft\n- A Blacksmith shop 20' x 20' ft\n- A Barnary for Cattle 16' x 28' ft\n- A Turkey Pen 9' x 12' ft\n- 2 Grain bins each 12' x 14' ft\n- 2 Smaller Barnaries\n\nA one-room house on Church Quarter section.\n\nThere was a two-room building apart from the stone school building which for a number of years was used as a two-class room building. We have converted this into a six-room residence. Cost of material and labor would amount to $700.00.\n\nThe first hut house we built, 14' x 16' ft, got burned out. We stored some for doors and windows in boxes more than our building dollars. Your Department helped us in this building another of the same dimensions at the extent of $1,100.00. We were therefore out of pocket over that fire to the extent of $500.00.\n\nWe have within the last three years broken up 80 acres of scrub land and have it now in a good state of cultivation. This school was opened six years ago this coming autumn on grounds in very crude state. I have been hoping ever since my coming here that Department would give us a good substantial grant for the beautifying of the grounds around the building. The only prospect so far has been $100.00 which Agent Smith told the Inspector Hamilton said he would ask\nfrom the Department. It has not come.\n\nThrough my management of the finances here my plans are subject to the approval of the Department so to spend in the neighborhood of $2000.00 on the grounds commencing work not later than next Spring. Perhaps I may be in a position to commence this Fall. There's a plan for the grounds drawn up by the Baltimore Nursery which I think is well worth considering. I believe I can make this a beautiful place.\n\nOn a separate sheet I will write you re another matter.\nI understand that the Indians are allowed their choice of school to which to send their children. I have been acting on that principle. There are reserves ministered by the Presbyterian Church from which there are children in schools under the management of other denominations. I have never said a word in opposition to that. But I find there are cases where Indian parents want to send children to the British School and they are not allowed to do it.\n\nTake for instance James Becheekoot of the Sandy Lake Reserve Star Blanket Band. This man has four children that he wants to send here and he has been told that he can send them to a residential school but that it must be Onion Lake school. There are several other children on that reserve whose parents have told me they want to send their children here.\n\nI want nothing more than to see this matter done. I want nothing more than to see this matter done. I want nothing more than to see this matter done. I want nothing more than to see this matter done.\n\nI ought further state that I take all the children of this school home to the Reserve for holidays and bring them back. The parents having no expense and trouble in connection therewith and I ask the Honorable Gentlemen of the Department to help finance the transportation.\n\nYou mentioned the importance of the principal keeping in touch with the children when going for their holidays, especially the older girls and I believe you suggested that in the case of the older girls from distant reserves that they be kept in schools near the parents would naturally feel very much if they could not see these girls for a few years and would not likely feel disposed to start their girls in the future to school.\n\nShe is known compulsory education in the case of the Indians.\nbut the compulsion does not seem to amount to much in some of the reserves. Schooling for many of the children commences anywhere from nine to twelve years of age, and the parents allowing their children to attend our schools is better. There are quite a number who get one half of the schooling they would get if interested at seven years of age.\n\nI might say that several of our teenage girls are asking today. I am willing to keep them and am communicating with the parents about it. I am quite concerned about these children when home for holidays. Law enforcement is quite slack as far as Indians are concerned. Penalties very very slight in some serious cases.\n\nBut leaving aside what I call the very serious cases, I want to mention the matter of Indians leaving their reserves without permission. I understand that an Indian, according to the Indian Act, must not be off the reserve to which he belongs, without having obtained a permit for more than two days. I know Indians that are frequently off their reserves decidedly more than this length of time. I think our parents and other relatives come to visit the children of our school. But it would be quite a relief to us if the obtaining permits were enforced.\n\nI am allowing visiting very much beyond the amount of time suggested by the Department. But the routine of our school life is being disturbed too much and that could be checked without the name brought into it. I don't think that I should get the bill in the Act Indians by their being told that I suggested a stricter enforcement of the law.\n\nBut now I must conclude. In a circular letter to principals you asked for suggestions and said you wished to help us all you can in our work. I have now done considerably\nsuggesting and I do ask for help. I want to do everything I can for these boys and girls and the very best that we can do, help is not enough. They are worthy using race or class of people in our Dominion.\n\nI am your respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n& A. Lockhart\nOttawa, June 28, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Lockhart:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant and to thank you very heartily for the information contained therein. I may say, by way of comment, that the \"follow-up\" system organized by the Department is largely experimental in character. We had very little on record here to guide us. It was felt that an attempt should be made to obtain authoritative information in respect to the progress made by the pupils during the years immediately following their departure from school. I am not at all sure that we shall be able to obtain the services of a director for this work at any time in the immediate future. In the meantime, we are seeking the cooperation of our Indian agents or farm instructors and the missionaries on the reserves. The reports reaching me indicate that my proposals have been favourably received and that a sincere attempt is being put forth by the field officials to make the system a success.\n\nI was interested in your reference to the programme you have in mind, designed to improve the appearance of your school grounds. I regret to state that the funds at our disposal for such work are very limited. We have in Canada at the moment a number of residential schools so old that they are no longer habitable. It is felt that the repair of these buildings has a first claim upon the funds available. I do wish, however, you would discuss the project with Inspector Hamilton and, if possible, with Mr. Leslie, Superintendent of the Dominion\n\n- Experimental\n\nRev. E. H. Lockhart,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBirtle, Man.\nExperimental Farm at Morden. This farm was established by the Dominion Government to encourage tree planting in the Prairie Provinces and fruit growing in districts adapted for that purpose. Mr. Leslie should certainly be consulted before you proceed with any programme you may have in mind.\n\nThere is nothing in the Indian Act compelling an Indian to obtain a permit before he leaves his reserve. There is a clause governing his residence in a foreign country. I think you might be well advised to put up a notice at your school, intimating that on and after a certain date visitors would only be permitted at the school on certain days and at certain hours. This practice, I understand, is followed at other residential schools, and the Indians seem satisfied when they grow accustomed to such regulations.\n\nI note, also, your reference to certain pupils who were informed - you do not state by whom - to attend residential school other than the Birtle School. It would appear that the policy of the Department in the past has been to insist on the separation of Catholic and non-Catholic pupils, but it does not appear that any rigid regulations have ever been drawn up in respect to the attendance at residential schools of non-Catholic children. It would appear that the recruiting efforts of the Principals in charge, the location of the schools and the wishes of the parents have been, in most cases, the determining factors.\n\nIf you are experiencing any difficulty in obtaining the number of pupils necessary to keep your school operating on an economical basis, I should be glad to bring the matter to the attention of certain agents, with the object of assisting you in any attempts you may make to recruit pupils for your institution in the future.\n\nAgain thanking you for your letter,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nFort Good Hope, N.W.T.\nJune 19, 1937.\n\nR.A.Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir; Re Circular Dated May 15, 1937.\n\nI have carefully read the above circular and can only say that this system is of no value in this part of the country. All Indian pupils on leaving school immediately go back to their only mode of life namely trapping and the only supervision they are likely to have is that of their own parents.\n\nThere are no reserves in the N.W.T. as thought of outside and no instructors are employed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMedical Superintendent.\nOttawa, June 29, 1937.\n\nDear Bishop Breynat:\n\nYour Lordship may remember having discussed with me, during your last visit to Ottawa, the desirability of creating a \"follow-up\" system that would enable the Department to have on file here a report of the progress made by the pupils of our residential schools during the years immediately following their departure from these institutions.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that the matter has been given a great deal of thought and consideration by the officials and that report forms have been sent to the Principals of all residential schools and to our Indian Agents throughout the Dominion. I am sending herewith copies of these reports for your information.\n\nI am today in receipt of a letter from Dr. P. W. Head, Indian Agent and Medical Superintendent at Fort Good Hope, in which he states that the system we have in mind is of no value whatever in his district. This, I may state, is the only intimation I have had that the system is unworkable.\n\nI am anxious that you should consider the whole scheme, as outlined in the report forms, and let me have any criticisms or suggestions you may care to offer. Would it be possible to have the Missionaries in the North West Territories undertake the task of reporting to the Department on the pupils that return to their respective districts?\n\nRight Rev. G. Breynat, O.M.I., D.D.,\nVicar Apostolic of Mackenzie,\nFort Smith, N.W.T.\nfrom residential schools? If this system is unsuitable, can you think of any other system that would be more practical and enable us to obtain, from year to year, the information that we are so anxious to secure?\n\nI shall look forward with interest to any comments you may care to make.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Neay,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, July 7th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the enclosed form, which apparently came from your office. As you were advised in official letter of May 15th, these forms should be retained in your office for a period of five years and, at the end of each year, you should report on the progress of the ex-pupil.\n\nWhile it is noted from the form that Frances Sacobia was married on June 26th, this does not necessarily mean that the Department is no longer interested in her. We wish to know, at the end of each year for the next four years, if her conduct is such as to be a credit to herself and the school at which she was educated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Fletcher, Esq.,\nClarkson, Ont.\nGurneyville Alberta\nJune 24-1937\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey\nDept. of Welfare and Training\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI did not wish to answer your letter without ample time for consideration; hence the delay which I hope you forgive.\n\nThere are two reserves, Cold Lake and Nechako, with which I am well acquainted. For many reasons, not only have they not progressed during the last 10 years, but, have on every standpoint, gone backward.\n\nAs things are today, there is no future at all for the young man whether raised at home or in boarding school. Neither owns anything worth mentioning. He resides with his parents who have nearly nothing to give him, or with old couples who are already dependants themselves.\nThere is no more hunting nor trapping on their land, while outside they come into competition with young white settlers who being raised closer to nature than the average Indian boy of today, are better hunters and trappers, better equipped with guns, snares and traps. We must not be surprised if the Indian in that field is successful, no more.\n\nThe depression has taught him that work is hard to obtain outside. He knows that the farmer prefers a man of experience, and of his own color to an Indian. It is, therefore, with reluctance that he leaves his reserve and applies for work.\n\nI am leaving many questions untouched in this letter, and many of the suggestions I propose, are based on endless questions asked with priests and farm instructors, men who have known them for 25 to 35 years, who understand their character and can explain their mistakes. They all come to the following\nconclusions.\n\n(i) Until we have eradicated his atavism and the influence which the old plays upon the young, we must not expect too much from him.\n\n(ii) We must be prepared to see him earn his living and improve his standard of living, not from what he will do outside, but on his land.\n\n(iii) We must not expect everyone to become a successful farmer. We must have patience here.\n\n(iv) The manual training we shall teach him will have to be very practical. Some line, which if he becomes skillful in, will be remunerative.\n\n(v) The day school must be made more up-to-date, (b) become the most comfortable house of the reserve, (c) a place where the child likes to go and where the older ones, whom I know, crave for something to read, could sit and pass their evening mostly during the winter months and where the teacher could easily be on hand to lead them.\n\nMotion pictures could complement the studies of\nSocial science, Hygiene, General science etc., one good picture, showing how germs propagate, would do more towards cleanliness than years of advice from teachers, nurses and doctors.\n\nThe pupils should receive one good meal a day not only during the winter months, but through the whole school year. A reasonable amount of clothing should also be provided.\n\nSo that the mothers, girls and infants should not be left to their own devices, I would suggest that the teacher's wife receive a fair remuneration for cooking and teaching the girls and mothers some sewing, knitting and housekeeping.\n\nThe teacher should be provided with ample material for teaching the different grades and as much as possible follow the course of studies of the province in which the school is situated.\n\nThe spirit of cooperation must be cultivated, and it should be the duty of\nthe Farm Instructor as well as teacher to promote, at all cost, that spirit.\n\nI have often seen the most salutary plans fail to nothing and the cause was the lack of unity among the Indians themselves.\n\nThere shall always be a certain % of parasites. They simply will not work. How to deal with them is a serious proposition. They are generally in the way of progress. Nomads...of ten sick or weak. They can be silenced by a ration.\n\nHoping these few suggestions may be of some use to you.\n\nI remain sincerely yours\n\nChar. T. Hubert\n\nGurneyville Alberta.\nOttawa, July 7, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Hebert:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo and to thank you very heartily for the information contained therein.\n\nI am anxious that you should discuss with the Indian Agent, either personally or by letter, the desirability of having the Department provide you with certain supplies necessary for instruction in crochet work, sewing, knitting, housekeeping, etc. If you can see your way clear to do this, I can assure you that the Agent's recommendation will be very sympathetically considered when it reaches the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

Veey,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs and Training,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReceived your letter relating to manual training and vocational instruction in Indian day schools. I am of the same opinion as yourself, that at least one third time should be spent in manual training or vocational instruction. In this (Rocky Mountain Day School) I manage to keep the girls busy sewing or knitting during part of the year, but during this time I have nothing to give the boys to do manual work, and therefore find it very difficult to keep them occupied at academic work while\nthe girls sew or knit.\n\nCapt Barry Inspector of Schools suggested that the boys make totem poles, but on further consideration we found that this tribe had never made totem poles and there isn't a totem pole to be found on any of their reserves. In fact the Indians of this reserve do very little native art. It is limited to the making of moccasins and a few other articles. There is no birch bark in this district to make baskets.\n\nI feel sure that I could get the boys interested in sewing moccasins, mills and other beaded articles during fall and winter. Then in the spring I would suggest a variety garden patch for each.\nof the bigger boys and girls.\n\nIn conclusion, I think if the Dept. would allow, say, five dollars per month, I could purchase materials to give the pupils at least one third time manual training.\n\nI am very much interested in this and would like to try it out next year.\n\nI appreciate the help and encouragement from your dept. very much and will endeavor to comply with your wishes.\n\nThe school building is very poor but we manage to keep it clean and it serves its purpose for the present.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEdith Macdonald\n\nTeacher Rocky D\u00e9troit Indian Day School.\nOttawa, August 11, 1937.\n\nDear Miss Macdonald:\n\nI want to thank you for your letter of June 30th and for the information contained therein. I was particularly pleased to note that you have been attempting to promote vocational instruction at your school.\n\nI have been wondering if it would be possible for you to communicate with the Agent, either personally or by letter, with respect to the supplies you feel necessary for the promotion of vocational instruction amongst the boys. You should give the Agent some idea of the supplies required and the amount in each case. If you do this, the Agent's recommendation will be given very sympathetic consideration when it reaches the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A.

I would like to suggest a place be inserted for the pupils' school number and also for the Treaty and Band number, and name of Band.\nThe Honorable,\nR.A. Heye,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nI must apologize for being so late in answering your letter of the 29th of June with its annexed Circular regarding the desirability of creating a \"follow-up\" system for the children who leave the Residential schools. I have been in continuous travel since the Spring, and I just happen to find it among some other papers in my travelling case.\n\nI have read the Circular, and I find, with Dr. P.W. Head, that it would be very difficult to put it to practice in the North West territories, where the conditions are so very peculiar and where Reserves are not regulated by ordinary rules which prevail outside of the Territories.\n\nSince you are inviting suggestions, I am giving you what I feel would be the best for the country:\n\nOur main effort should be to have a serious control of the sanitary conditions. Unless we do something in that direction, we will have to deal with only more or less sickly individuals. This is far from being an impossibility. The Indian Agents could be required to make an annual visit in the different camps, and then see that every building is kept in good order, especially for what regards cleanliness and sanitation. There is no doubt but that many of the houses of the Indians should be destroyed or burnt, because of the many germs of various diseases which have contaminated previous owners. This, of course, will necessitate the building of new homes; but I do not see that any enormous expenses would be involved. Practically in every case it would be quite enough to provide some lumber for the flooring and the roofing. The ex-pupils, with the aid of their parents, will certainly be able to erect a log-building which for this country is by far the best, unless one is prepared to undergo a large expenditure.\n\nI would also suggest that the pupils who leave the residential schools be then provided by the Department with some traps...\na rifle, some ammunition, and some nets to start his new life. In his annual visit, the Indian Agent would then see what has been done, and if necessary give the appropriate advice for the actual conditions to be maintained or improved in the near future. A friendly advice from the Agent may go a long way towards developing in the young people some kind of ambition in accord with their way of living; trapping, fishing, and hunting.\n\nIn my mind, this seems to be the better way to exercise a gentle control, which may be necessary; but this should be regular, and devoid of any bothering or enslaving proceedings.\n\nI firmly hope that something can be done for the ex-pupils; and that it will prove efficient, if it is done in a liberal and I might say a fatherly spirit.\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Athabasca,\nVicar Apostolic of Mackenzie.\nOttawa, January 17, 1938.\n\nDear Bishop Breynat:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 12th instant and to thank you very heartily for the information contained therein.\n\nIt was not our intention that the regulations prepared by the Department and supplied to residential schools, in an attempt to encourage a follow-up system for pupils, would be applicable to all the schools in the Dominion. I can readily appreciate the fact that a great many difficulties would arise in the application of these regulations to schools in the North West Territories. Your suggestion, that pupils who leave the residential schools in the North West Territories from year to year be provided with a certain amount of hunting and trapping equipment, will be given very careful and very sympathetic consideration.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRight Rev. G. Breynat, O.M.I., D.D.,\nBishop of Adramyte,\nVicar Apostolic of Mackenzie,\nFort Smith, N.W.T.\nR. A. HOEY, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been reading over your letter to me sent from Ottawa on January 15, 1937, and am taking this opportunity of giving you some idea of what I have endeavoured to do on the Reserve and in school.\n\nDuring my first year here I saw the need of some form of social Club for the Indians, but as I was unable to use the school, I had no suitable place where the people could meet. During the Exhibition of Indian work in Prince Albert during July, I approached the Inspector of Agencies, Dr. Robertson, on the matter. He kindly offered suggestions and gave me permission to use the school. In October I organized a Social Club and during the winter had a very good attendance. As it was new to the Indians here I did not expect too much for the first year. Our meetings were held on an average once in two weeks. I confined most of our talks to Health Studies and how Home Life could be improved. These talks were given in English and Cree. Games and Cards were enjoyed after the business session and a light lunch served at the conclusion of each meeting. Although many of the older Indians speak mostly Cree, I found some of the younger ones wanted reading material. I was able to assist in a small way with a few magazines and papers but thought for another year a small library could be established and wondered whether the Department would donate a few suitable books to make a start along this line.\n\nI see the real necessity of a young people's club whereby some of the older school pupils could take part. I feel the young people prefer English only and now that I take the Sunday morning services in English I have a very good attendance.\n\nA small beginning has been made regarding manual work. Many of my girls are quite young and only a few of the boys are really old enough to do much woodwork. The boys made small beds while the girls made the bed clothes and did little knitting. Articles such as hayracks have been made and only odd pieces of wood were used. I feel with some equipment more can be done. With this end in view for my next requisition I am applying for some tools. I am endeavouring to carry out a farm project next term whereby a model farm will be made and the work correlated with the other subjects.\n\nSince I have been in charge of the school there has been no school garden. There is a suitable piece of ground\nnext to my own piece which would be ideal. Sufficient vegetables could be grown and as the basement in the residence is large enough no root house would be necessary. I understand the Department would supply the necessary seed for a school garden and I am applying for same through the local Indian Agent. I feel that some sort of local Exhibition of school work could be inaugurated and that garden produce could be included.\n\nRegarding ex-pupils may I take the liberty of suggesting how some record could be kept on their behalf.\n\n(1) School attended; (2) Year of graduation; (3) Age; (4) Present occupation. Perhaps the question of marriage could be included. Some Indians marry non-Indians and leave the reserve. I am compiling a record after the above to be sent you at the end of June. I omitted to mention the grade reached on graduation.\n\nI shall be glad to receive the list of books especially suitable for Indian pupils.\n\nAs many teachers seldom see each other, I feel it might be beneficial to all if at some time they could have their own convention. Some uniformity of work might then be devised. Some sort of syllabus regarding manual work could be drawn up.\n\nI shall very much appreciate hearing from you and any suggestions you can give me for the benefit of my work.\n\nThanking you, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd.) Frank C. Dey.\nKinistino, Sask.,\nMarch 31st., 1938.\n\nDear sir:\n\nIt is some time since I received your letter regarding the education of Indians. Since then I have been compiling an answer in the form of suggestions, criticisms, etc., which I hope may be of some use in mapping out a programme for Indian education. I herewith present them to you with only one thought in mind\u2014that our educational system may be improved.\n\nProgram of studies:\n\nOur instructions from the Department read: \"The curriculum to be followed in each school is that prescribed by the Dep't. of Education for the province in which the school is located.\"\n\nNext\u2014\"The Dep't. Indians Affairs prescribes certain text-books. For those subjects for which the Dep't does not prescribe text-book, provincial text-books should be used.\"\n\nThere are two things wrong with these instructions to a teacher:\n\n1. A great deal of the material given in the curriculum of this province which, though very excellent for white children, is unsuitable for use in Indian schools.\n\n2. Many of the text-books prescribed by the federal dep't. are meant for schools in other provinces and are very excellent\u2014but do not fully cover the work as prescribed for each province.\n\nThis places the teacher at a decided disadvantage, first, because much of the course of studies is unsuitable for Indian children; and second, because text-books allowed do not cover all of the work prescribed by the dep't.\n\nFor the general betterment of education in all Indian schools, I believe:\n\n1. That there should be appointed in each province an inspector for Indian schools\u2014preferably a teacher who has had several years experience in an Indian school.\n\n2. That this inspector, with the help of the teachers of that province, arrange a course of studies for the use of the teachers.\n3. That there be made available to the teachers of each province a uniform set of text-books to follow as closely as possible the new course of studies.\n\nHere are some of the reasons I (together with other teachers) have for suggesting such changes. As I stated above much of the material given in the curriculum is unsuitable for Indian children. I mean by this that in order to satisfy the public school inspectors we must teach, or attempt to teach, what is outlined in the curriculum, even though we know that it is unnecessary and a waste of time. Let me give a concrete example of this.\n\nDuring my first two years in an Indian school I spent a great deal of time trying to teach the children to sing by note. They were unable to understand what it was all about and beyond the preliminaries I found that it was an impossible task. During this time the public school inspector visited the school several times and was quite indignant because I was having no success. The same was true of advanced art.\n\nI do not mean to strike out at the public school inspectors but it seems to me that there is something definitely wrong when an inspector admits that he knows very little about Indians and their capacity for learning. One inspector told me that he knew a certain teacher was not efficient but he was good enough for Indian children.\n\nTeachers are in the position where they might easily slip into a \"rut.\" There is nothing definite in the way of what should be taught for the best results or what should be eliminated from the \"course.\" This puts the teacher on his or her own initiative and often the choice of subject matter is not wise.\n\nI sincerely hope that this reply will not convey the idea I think our present system is at fault. My only desire is that the living standard of the Indian people of Canada may be raised, be looked upon as a real asset to the country. Our schools can make a real beginning in this direction. I trust that these suggestions may be of some use in your task.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSup't Welfare & Training,\nDept Mines and Resources (I.A.B.)\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, April 14, 1938.\n\nDear Mr. McDonald:\n\nI desire to thank you very heartily for your letter of the 31st ultimo and for the information contained therein.\n\nI can assure you that the suggestions sent forward by you will be given careful consideration. May I point out, in the meantime, however, that the appointment of an inspector to undertake the supervision of the Indian day and residential schools in Saskatchewan is scarcely practicable. The distances in that province are, as you know, so great that an inspector would be called upon to spend most of his time on the road. In addition to this, his work would overlap that of the Provincial Inspectors. The tax payers of Canada today are very vigorously opposed to duplication of effort.\n\nIt is exceedingly difficult to evolve a programme of studies suitable for the Bands of Indians throughout the Dominion or even the province of Saskatchewan. The life lived by the Bands of Indians in the south, engaged in agriculture, is entirely different from the life of the hunting and trapping Indians of the north or the life lived by certain Bands or Indians who gain their livelihood almost wholly from fishing. I am anxious, therefore, that each Indian school should be to measure at least, autonomous, and that our teachers should rely less on text books than in the past. You are aware, of course, that in Great Britain, subjects alone are assigned and no text books whatever authorized. The pupil in attendance at school can select any text book on any subject that may appeal to him.\n\nIn my circular letter of a year ago, I pointed out that at least one third of the school period should be devoted to manual training; woodwork for boys and crochet work, knitting, sewing, etc., for girls. I am convinced that the teacher following this programme will experience no difficulty with the provincial inspectors. As a matter of fact, there is a very wide-spread demand today throughout Canada for the establishment of such a programme in the public schools.\n\nMay I again thank you for your letter and may I express the hope that I shall hear from you again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hogg,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nThomas E. McDonald, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nFort a la Corne South Day School,\nKinistino, Saskatchewan.\nOttawa, April 14, 1938.\n\nDear Mr. Dey:\n\nPlease accept my most sincere thanks for your letter of the 2nd instant and for the information contained therein.\n\nI was particularly interested in the attempt you are making to promote adult education on the reserve. I can readily appreciate how difficult it must be to get a club such as you have had in mind organized on an Indian reserve. It is my hope, however, that you will succeed and that the movement will spread to other reserves in the province.\n\nI note your reference to the need for books and it is my hope that we can forward these books to you in the immediate future.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hogg,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nFrank C. Dey, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nLittle Red River Day School,\nTweedsmuir, Saskatchewan.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith Reference to your letter of May, 13th, 1937 to the Reverend Principal, of the Kenora R.C. Residential School re \"follow up\" system for pupils being discharged.\n\nEnclosed please find letter we have received from the Reverend Principal of the Kenora R.C. Residential School, which explains itself.\n\nWe have received reports from the Cecilia Jeffrey and the Sioux Lookout schools, but none for the two Catholic Schools in this Agency.\n\nIt does not appear to me to be a difficult task to carry out the instructions, as Principals must have some idea as to the children likely to be discharged.\n\nHowever in view of the letter enclosed I will be glad to receive instructions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Edwards\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\nCopy sent to Father Plourde\n\nOttawa,\nApril 28, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant enclosing letter received from the Principal of the Kenora Residential School in connection with the follow up system of pupils graduating from Indian Residential Schools.\n\nThe Principal's letter refers to regulation No. 1 contained in our circular letter of May 15, 1937. Apparently the Principal has not carefully considered our reasons for providing this regulation. Our thought was to establish full co-operation between the Principal of the Residential Schools and our officers in the field with a view to aiding the pupil upon discharge from a Residential School. To do this effectively the Indian Agent must know the names of the children to be discharged from the Residential School some months before the date of their actual discharge. Otherwise he would be unable to make any provision for them.\n\nThe Principals know the pupils in the school who are approaching 16 years of age. They also know, or can ascertain, whether home conditions are suitable for discharge of the pupils at that age or whether application should be made to the Department for permission to keep the children at a Residential School for a further period.\n\nGiving the list of those who will probably be discharged within the next year to the Indian Agent does not necessarily mean that the children must be discharged at that time as circumstances might alter the case. It is also realized that the Principal cannot always foresee other circumstances that might warrant discharge of a\n\nF. Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\npupil before the regular time. However, we feel that compliance with this regulation will reach the majority of the children who are to be discharged and, as pointed out above, will permit the Indian Agent and other officers on the various Reserves to give some thought to what they can do to assist the discharged pupil to take full advantage of the training that he has received in school.\n\nI, therefore, trust that the Principal of the Kenora Residential School as well as the Principals of the other schools in your Agency will co-operate fully with you in carrying out the regulations contained in circular letter of May 15, 1937.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nApril 26, 1938.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI enclose for your information a copy of circular letter of May 15, 1937, in connection with the inauguration of a follow up system for pupils graduating from Indian Residential Schools.\n\nRecently Indian Agent Edwards wrote the Department enclosing a letter which he had received from the Principal of the Kenora Residential School. I enclose a copy of this letter and I think you will agree with me that Reverend Father Baillargeon has not fully considered the reasons why the Department placed regulation No. 1 in our circular of May 15, 1937. For your information I also enclose a copy of our reply to Indian Agent Edwards.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J. O.

Hey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Dept., Ottawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease be kind enough to send me a copy of the latest \"Indian Act\" with amendments up to date.\n\nI would like to know all about your \"community plan.\" Inspector Robertson of Regina was telling me that we should try this plan here on Big Head Reserve, but I would like to know how to go at it.\n\nAlso I saw in the newspapers that an amount of $150,000 could be loaned to Indians in Canada. That a bill was passed to this effect. Indians could borrow money; the money could be spent on said amount in order to help cooperative projects in agriculture and other kinds of work for the welfare of the Indians as well. Please give me full particulars.\n\nI am under the impression that...\nyou had worked out a plan for your boys and girls out of school into a follow-up plan. Will you kindly explain said plan to me.\n\nThanking you in advance and hoping to hear from you in a near future.\n\nI am,\n\nYours Gratefully,\nJ. H.

Dey.\nROUGH DRAFT OF SUGGESTED CIRCULAR LETTER\n\nTo Whom Addressed:\nInspectors,\nIndian Agents,\nPrincipals of Indian Residential Schools,\nTeachers of Indian Day Schools.\n\nThe Department wishes to bring to the attention of all Inspectors, as well as Principals and Teachers the necessity for making the education given to Indian children such that practical use can be made of it on graduation.\n\nThe following remarks are intended to cover the work of the Elementary School, that is up to the close of Grade 6. The number of Indian pupils taking the Junior and Senior High School courses is not large, and it has been found that, with the exception of special cases, little is gained by the average Indian boy or girl from such High School training.\n\nThroughout Canada more and more attention is being given to that type of education which will fit the pupil best for adult life. It is the wish of the Department that in Indian schools much greater attention be given to the subject of Vocational Training than has been the case in the past. Such Vocational work will include a variety of subjects of which we need only mention here, Domestic Science, Manual Training, Automechanics, Boat Building, School Gardening, and Art and Craft Work. While all these subjects could not be taught in every school, attention should be given to that type of Vocational Training which will best fit our young graduates for life on the Indian reserves.\n\nDomestic Science:\n\nIt is necessary in the large residential schools to have much of the routine work done with the help of machinery involving the use of steam and electrical energy. Girls should however be taught simple methods of hand laundering, the cooking and serving of family meals as distinct from the general preparation of the school meals, the making of bread, and the preservation of fruits and vegetables for winter use. The reasons for following certain approved procedures should be clearly taught.\n\nIn large schools the girls are taught to sew, mend, patch, darn, knit, crochet, and embroider, etc., but far too little of this has been done in the day schools. In future a definite period should be set aside in the afternoon on several days each week in the day schools for instruction in the above subjects.\n\nIn some day schools the girls prepare a simple hot meal for the school lunch at Noon. This is quite easy to arrange for when the teacher's residence is attached to the school, but even in other cases some attempt should be made to teach the day school girls the preparation and proper serving of a simple meal, even if this only consist of cocoa or soup and bread or biscuit.\n\nThe cultivation of small school gardens by girls and boys is also a worth while project. In some day schools the fruits and vegetables gathered in the school garden are preserved by the girls in glass sealers, and used at school lunches during the winter.\nManual Training:\n\nIn several of the residential schools too much time is devoted to the making of detailed scale drawings of articles to be constructed in the Manual Training Shop. Older Indian boys who happen to be in the lower Grades through failure to make satisfactory progress in strictly academic subjects are quite unable to make detailed scale drawings. They are quite good in handwork and well able to carry out large projects in Manual Training; but of course fail to construct any worth while scale drawings. The making of such drawings is a great mistake, and as they are quite unnecessary such a practice holds back worth while Manual Training. Very simple rough dimension sketches are all that need be attempted, and from these the articles may easily be constructed.\n\nThe use of machinery in the Manual Training Shop should be strictly limited, and it is better that none should be used. Manual Training Instructors should realize that their first duty is to train the boys in the use of simple tools which the Indians are likely to have at their disposal on the Reserves.\n\nThe construction of highly polished furniture is not the aim of Manual Training in Indian schools. Articles such as ladders, field gates, wheelbarrows, chicken coops, bee hives, simple tables and chairs, etc., should be constructed. Time should also be given to the carrying out of repair work around the school, the construction of display boards, book shelves, work tables, and other articles needed in the class room. The ability to meet a lock or glaze a window is of far greater value than the knowledge of inlaying, and the use of native woods is preferable to that of more expensive imported hard woods.\n\nMusic:\n\nIn addition to the usual class singing taught in Provincial schools the Indian children should be taught some simple hymns, and the national songs. Indians have a well developed sense of rhythm, and simple rhythmic bands might well be organized in the day schools as well as in the residential schools where they are already a success. Instruments should be for the most part home made.\n\nWhere a good gramophone is available it is possible to train the Indian children in Music Appreciation.\n\nArts and Crafts:\n\nDefinite periods are to be given to the teaching of Arts and Crafts in all Indian schools. This subject takes the place of Manual Arts and Handwork in Provincial Programmes. The craft work should be closely correlated with art work. Craft work should be decorated with Indian motifs, and should be of the type suitable to the age of the pupil. Materials used should be those to which Indians in the locality are accustomed. Weaving Mats, Sewing Cards, Raffia, and even Plasticine, are quite out of place in an Indian school.\nArts and Crafts Continued:\n\nMuch of the old Indian art is dying out with the old people. It is the wish of the Department that Indian children be instructed in the skills of their parents so that the better types of Indian craft work may be preserved.\n\nIt has been found, particularly in the West that Indian girls consider it a retrograde step to make baskets. They wish to be as like the modern city girls as possible. The cause of this dislike of Indian craft work is the very pronounced inferiority complex from which Indian children suffer. Great care should be taken by teachers in their teaching and control of Indians to avoid anything which might increase such an inferiority complex.\n\nHealth:\n\nIt is essential that a definite period be set aside daily for instruction in Health.\n\nSimple talks and demonstrations should be given, so that children will know how to guard themselves and others against infection.\n\nCleanliness is essential in and about the school, and children should be taught good personal habits. Teachers of Primary Grades should be particularly careful to see that the usual Health Rules such as those set out by the Junior Red Cross organization are observed. Where pupils come to school without handkerchiefs, simple paper handkerchiefs should be provided as required by the children.\n\nThe Health requirements in some Provincial Programmes of Study are too elaborate for the successful instruction of Indian children. Such courses will of necessity need to be modified to suit local conditions. Health subjects can be taught with success to the children in a number of Grades at the same time. Organized games and Physical Instruction should not be neglected.\n\nElementary Science:\n\nThis subject formerly known as Nature may be correlated with Geography and with Health. Simple experiments should be done by the teacher in the classroom. Notes may be taken by the older children, but it is highly doubtful if the pupils should be provided with a text in this subject. Certain Work Books may be used with success.\n\nAcademic Subjects:\n\nInstruction in the strictly academic subjects of the courses drawn up by the various Provincial Departments of Education, should in general occupy the morning periods only in Indian day schools, and not in excess of half of each day's work in the residential schools.\n\nJust as good progress can be made by the children when only a small part of each day is devoted to the strictly academic subjects, and it must be remembered that the duty of the school is to give the pupils that all round training of which they stand in need. It is not in the best interests of the Indian children that they be simply instructed in the academic subjects and their progress in these subjects make the condition of promotion to a higher Grade. In general regular promotions should be made yearly. Children who have attended regularly should on no account be denied promotion. Those who appear very slow in the academic work quite often do just as well in a higher Grade as they would in the lower Grade if forced to repeat the year.\nIn general it is possible to follow the Provincial courses in such subjects as Arithmetic, Reading, Language, Writing, and Spelling.\n\nNo period should be longer than twenty minutes, and probably fifteen minutes is quite long enough for the Indian child in one of the Primary or Junior Grades.\n\nThe actual teaching lesson involving the use of the Blackboard by the teacher is of the utmost importance in an Indian school, but success depends also on the proper use of the various work books in Reading, Nature Science, and English Language.\n\nIndian children have considerable difficulty in covering the Provincial courses in the Social Science subjects of History and Geography.\n\nIt is doubtful if the Indian can benefit much from a study of conditions in other countries during periods in the distant past. The subject of Geography must of course be taken up in dealing with History, but in addition there should be definite lessons in Geography and pupil activity in the way of enterprises and projects apart from the History lesson.\n\nIn general the Geography of Grades 3 and 4 should consist of a World Journey taken by the combined Grades. The actual teaching should be mainly by the Story Method. The teacher should make full use of such texts as THE BOOK OF BOYS AND GIRLS ROUND THE WORLD supplemented by extracts from THE BOOK OF NEW CANADIANS. Large poster maps should be drawn to show the course of the class journey. Built-up Panel Posters and other posters should be constructed and these should cover life in each country visited, and be made while the country is being studied. Such Geography as the above should be taught in short periods of about ten minutes and must be taken each day to ensure success. It is quite possible to group all Grades from 3 to 6 inclusive for such a World Journey. Grades 5 and 6 require instructional in Regional Geography in addition to the above World Journey. Grade 5 should cover North and South America with special reference to the Province in which the school is located, and British North America with the other British possessions in the New World. Grade 6 should cover the remainder of the World Geography with special reference to the British Commonwealth of Nations.\n\nTexts may be used to some extent in Grades 5 and 6, but the teaching of Geography to Grades 3 and 4 should be entirely oral.\n\nThe teaching of History, like that of Geography must be strictly from the social point of view. Lists of Kings and Queens Wars and Treaty Obligations are of little use to the Indian children. A very brief outline of European and particularly British History is all that is required to lead up to the more important study of Canadian History.\n\nIf not taught in detail the study of the rise of the British from the time of the Roman conquest to the age of exploration is a well worth while enterprise or Project. The parallel between the history of the Romans in Britain and the French and English in Canada should be developed. Reference should be made to the rise of the Anglo Saxons, Danes, and Normans, who each in turn changed the course of History. The Crusades and rise of Turkish power should receive attention as owing to the interruption of the trade routes exploration was the more necessary to find a short way to India. The work of Prince Henry of Portugal followed by the discovery of America, leads to the early discoveries by French and English along the eastern Canadian seaboard and thus the History of Canada is introduced. This latter may well be considered through the work of the Missionaries and the expansion of the fur trade over westward. The particular history of the Province in which the school is located should not be neglected.\nMethods:\n\nIt is essential that the most approved modern methods of teaching be used in the Indian schools. Lessons in all subjects must be motivated. When Indian children are not anxious to learn the fault probably lies with the teacher in that the methods used are not suitable.\n\nTo gain the wholehearted support of the Indian parents teachers must visit the homes on the Reserves. Problem cases should be discussed with parents. Teachers who know the home conditions of pupils will often understand better the limitations of their pupils.\n\nMany teachers appear never to have heard of Educational Psychology, though this subject is taught in all Normal Schools. It is particularly necessary that teachers in Indian schools have a good grasp of the essentials of Psychology as that subject applies to the learning process.\n\nBlackboard work is most important, and teachers should make a free use of coloured chalks in their own work on the Board. It has been found that far too great reliance has been placed on text books. The more successful teachers make use of texts for material, but they are by no means confined to the contents of such books. The best lessons are the vigorous oral lessons with much Blackboard illustration.\n\nSocialized methods on the whole are out of place in the Indian schools. The lecture method, and the question and answer method, have been found very successful. What is called the Project or Enterprise should be used in certain subjects, particularly in connection with Social Science and Elementary Science.\n\nSuccess in the teaching of a Rural Ungraded School whether Indian or not depends on the proper grouping of Grades. Grade 7 may nearly always work with Grade 8, while there is little reason to teach Grades 5 and 6 as separate groups in subjects other than possibly Reading and Arithmetic. Some highly successful rural teachers always group Grades 7 and 8 together as well as Grades 4 and 5; Grade 3 may to a less extent sometimes be grouped with Grade 4. Grade 2 must almost always be taught by itself, while Grade 1 needs to be subdivided into two groups in most of the Indian schools. If the children in an ungraded Rural School be taught in the groups suggested above it will be found that almost all the pupils can be promoted one complete Grade yearly, and this yearly promotion is a most important matter in an Indian school.\n\nGeneral:\n\nThe suggestions outlined in this circular are made with a view of helping Inspectors and Teachers, particularly those in ungraded Indian day schools, by indicating methods and organisation of work which has been found highly successful.\n\nIn addition to the proper marking of the registers daily, morning and afternoon, those children coming late to school should be shown by a pencil dot in the attendance mark.\n\nProperly balanced Time Tables should be on display in each school-room, but it is even more important that each teacher have on her desk a detailed preview of the day's work.\n\nInstructions and work for the pupils should be placed on the Boards before the opening of school in the morning.\n\nThe afternoons should in general be devoted to Vocational Training, Manual Training, Art and Craft Work, Music, etc.\nTo Whom Addressed:\n\nInspectors,\nIndian Agents,\nPrincipals of Indian Residential Schools,\nTeachers of Indian Day Schools.\n\nThe Department wishes to bring to the attention of all Inspectors, as well as Principals and Teachers the necessity for making the education given to Indian children such that practical use can be made of it on graduation.\n\nThe following remarks are intended to cover the work of the Elementary School, that is up to the close of Grade 6. The number of Indian pupils taking the Junior and Senior High School courses is not large, and it has been found that, with the exception of special cases, little is gained by the average Indian boy or girl from such High School training.\n\nThroughout Canada more and more attention is being given to that type of education which will fit the pupil best for adult life. It is the wish of the Department that in Indian schools much greater attention be given to the subject of Vocational Training than has been the case in the past. Such Vocational work will include a variety of subjects of which we need only mention here, Domestic Sciences, Manual Training, Auto Mechanics, Boat Building, School Gardening, and Art and Craft Work. While all these subjects could not be taught in every school, attention should be given to that type of Vocational Training which will best fit our young graduates for life on the Indian reserves.\n\nDomestic Science:\n\nIt is necessary in the large residential schools to have much of the routine work done with the help of machinery involving the use of steam and electrical energy. Girls should however be taught simple methods of hand laundering, the cooking and serving of family meals as distinct from the general preparation of the school meals, the making of bread, and the preservation of fruits and vegetables for winter use. The reasons for following certain approved procedures should be clearly taught.\n\nIn large schools the girls are taught to sew, mend, patch, darn, knit, crochet, and embroider, etc., but far too little of this has been done in the day schools. In future a definite period should be set aside in the afternoon on several days each week in the day schools for instruction in the above subjects.\n\nIn some day schools the girls prepare a simple hot meal for the school lunch at Noon. This is quite easy to arrange for when the teacher's residence is attached to the school, but even in other cases some attempt should be made to teach the day school girls the preparation and proper serving of a simple meal, even if this only consist of cocoa or soup and bread or biscuit.\n\nThe cultivation of small school gardens by girls and boys is also a worth while project. In some day schools the fruits and vegetables gathered in the school garden are preserved by the girls in glass sealers, and used at school lunches during the winter.\nManual Training:\n\nIn several of the residential schools too much time is devoted to the making of detailed scale drawings of articles to be constructed in the Manual Training Shop. Older Indian boys who happen to be in the lower Grades through failure to make satisfactory progress in strictly academic subjects are quite unable to make detailed scale drawings. They are quite good in handwork and well able to carry out large projects in Manual Training, but of course fail to construct any worth while scale drawings. The making of such drawings is a great mistake, and as they are quite unnecessary such a practice holds back worth while Manual Training. Very simple rough dimension sketches are all that need be attempted, and from these the articles may easily be constructed.\n\nThe use of machinery in the Manual Training Shop should be strictly limited, and it is better that none should be used. Manual Training Instructors should realize that their first duty is to train the boys in the use of simple tools which the Indians are likely to have at their disposal on the Reserves.\n\nThe construction of highly polished furniture is not the aim of Manual Training in Indian schools. Articles such as ladders, field gates, wheelbarrows, chicken coops, bee hives, simple tables and chairs, etc., should be constructed. Time should also be given to the carrying out of repair work around the school, the construction of display boards, book shelves, work tables, and other articles needed in the class room. The ability to paint a lock or glaze a window is of far greater value than the knowledge of inlaying, and the use of native woods is preferable to that of more expensive imported hard woods.\n\nMusic:\n\nIn addition to the usual class singing taught in Provincial schools the Indian children should be taught some simple hymns, and the national songs. Indians have a well developed sense of rhythm, and simple rhythmic bands might well be organized in the day schools as well as in the residential schools where they are already a success. Instruments should be for the most part home made.\n\nWhere a good gramaphone is available it is possible to train the Indian children in Music Appreciation.\n\nArts and Crafts:\n\nDefinite periods are to be given to the teaching of Arts and Crafts in all Indian schools. This subject takes the place of Manual Arts and Handwork in Provincial Programmes. The craft work should be closely correlated with art work. Craft work should be decorated with Indian motifs, and should be of the type suitable to the age of the pupil. Materials used should be those to which Indians in the locality are accustomed. Weaving Mats, Sewing Cards, Raffia, and even Plasticine, are quite out of place in an Indian school.\nMuch of the old Indian art is dying out with the old people. It is the wish of the Department that Indian children be instructed in the skills of their parents so that the better types of Indian craft work may be preserved. It has been found, particularly in the West that Indian girls consider it a retrograde step to make baskets. They wish to be as like the modern city girls as possible. The cause of this dislike of Indian craft work is the same profound inferiority complex from which Indian children suffer. Great care should be taken by teachers in their teaching and control of Indians to avoid anything which might increase such an inferiority complex.\n\nHealth:\nIt is essential that a definite period be set aside daily for instruction in Health. Simple talks and demonstrations should be given, so that children will know how to guard themselves and others against infection.\n\nCleanliness is essential in and about the school, and children should be taught good personal habits. Teachers of Primary Grades should be particularly careful to see that the usual Health Rules such as those set out by the Junior Red Cross organization are observed. Where pupils come to school without handkerchiefs, simple paper handkerchiefs should be provided as required by the children.\n\nThe Health requirements in some Provincial Programmes of Study are too elaborate for the successful instruction of Indian children. Such courses will of necessity need to be modified to suit local conditions. Health subjects can be taught with success to the children in a number of Grades at the same time. Organized games and Physical Instruction should not be neglected.\n\nElementary Science:\nThis subject formerly known as Nature may be correlated with Geography and with Health. Simple experiments should be done by the teacher in the classroom. Notes may be taken by the older children, but it is highly doubtful if the pupils should be provided with a text in this subject. Certain Work Books may be used with success.\n\nAcademic Subjects:\nInstruction in the strictly academic subjects of the courses drawn up by the various Provincial Departments of Education, should in general occupy the morning periods only in Indian day schools, and not in excess of half of each day's work in the residential schools. Just as good progress can be made by the children when only half of each day is devoted to the strictly academic subjects; and it must be remembered that the duty of the school is to give the pupils that all round training of which they stand in need. It is not in the best interests of the Indian children that they be simply instructed in the academic subjects and their progress in these subjects make the condition of promotion to a higher Grade. In general regular promotions should be made yearly. Children who have attended regularly should on no account be denied promotion. Those who appear very slow in the academic work quite often do just as well in a higher Grade as they would in the lower Grade if forced to repeat the year.\nIn general it is possible to follow the Provincial courses in such subjects as Arithmetic, Reading, Language, Writing, and Spelling.\n\nNo period should be longer than twenty minutes, and probably fifteen minutes is quite long enough for the Indian child in one of the Primary or Junior Grades.\n\nThe actual teaching lesson involving the use of the Blackboard by the teacher is of the utmost importance in an Indian school, but success depends also on the proper use of the various work books in Reading, Nature Science, and English Language.\n\nIndian children have considerable difficulty in covering the Provincial courses in the Social Science subjects of History and Geography.\n\nIt is doubtful if the Indian can benefit much from a study of conditions in other countries during periods in the distant past. The subject of Geography must of course be taken up in dealing with History, but in addition there should be definite lessons in Geography and pupil activity in the way of enterprises and projects apart from the History lesson.\n\nIn general the Geography of Grades 3 and 4 should consist of a World Journey taken by the combined Grades. The actual teaching should be mainly by the Story Method. The teacher should make full use of such texts as THE BOOK OF BOYS AND GIRLS ROUND THE WORLD supplemented by extracts from THE BOOK OF NEW CANADIANS. Large poster maps should be drawn to show the course of the class journey. Built up Panel Posters and other posters should be constructed and these should cover life in each country visited and be made while the country is being studied. Such Geography as the above should be taught in short periods of about ten minutes and must be taken each day to enable the class to keep pace. It is quite possible to group all Grades from 3 to 6 inclusive for such a World Journey. Grades 5 and 6 require Instructional in Regional Geography in addition to the above World Journey. Grade 5 should cover North and South America with special reference to the Province in which the school is located, and British North America with the other British possessions in the New World.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nWhen Mr. R.A. Hoey was in Vancouver a few weeks ago he asked me to prepare for him a rough draft of a circular letter which he proposed to send out from the Department in Ottawa to all teachers of Indian schools in Canada.\n\nDuring lulls in the office work here I have tried to carry out Mr. Hoey's wishes, and find that the result extends to some five pages of notes and suggestions. I am forwarding herewith for transmission to Ottawa the rough draft requested by Mr. Hoey. If issued more or less as prepared by me it would form a small pamphlet, which might possibly be of help to the teachers while if considered too long in its present form no doubt Mr. Phelan could extract those portions which he considered likely to be of the most use to the teachers, and inspectors.\n\nMay I say that if so instructed I could still further extend these notes to take in almost all the subjects taught in our schools. The completed work would then form a pamphlet of instructions to teachers in Indian schools. If the Department wishes this attached circular so extended I should be glad to be so informed but I believe that it is detailed enough now to supply at least some aid to teachers taking up Indian work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H.

The Agent is required to keep a record of the progress of each pupil for a period of at least five years. At the end of five years, this form should be sent forward to the Department.\n\n500-657\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES & RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nOttawa, May 15th, 1937.\n\nTo Principals\nof Indian Residential Schools:\n\nIt has been decided by the Department to inaugurate a \"follow-up\" system for pupils graduating from Indian residential schools. We feel certain that we shall receive your enthusiastic cooperation in the promotion of this project.\n\nThe following suggestions are submitted for your guidance: You will note that these refer to pupils who have remained in your school for the usual term of years. It is understood that certain pupils are discharged for medical and other reasons before their education is completed. These regulations are not designed for such pupils.\n\n(1) About one year previous to the discharge of any pupil, the Indian Agent concerned should be advised. Full particulars should be given regarding the reserve from which the pupil comes and, if possible, the names of his or her parents. This will enable the Indian Agent to consider what is the best advice to give a pupil on discharge, regarding his future welfare.\n\n(2) One month before a pupil is actually discharged, one of the enclosed forms should be completed for each pupil. These should be forwarded to the Indian Agent from whose agency the pupil comes.\n\n(3) If there is a missionary belonging to your Church on the reserve to which the pupil is going, you should also advise him regarding the name of the pupil.\n\n(4) When pupils are being discharged, they should be advised that the Agent is being requested to report on their future progress and they should be urged to make proper use of the instructions they have received.\n\nIt is\n\n500-659.\nIt is understood that these regulations will apply to students leaving residential schools at the end of the present academic year. Notices also should be sent out this year in respect to pupils who will graduate at the end of the academic year 1938.\n\nFor your information, I enclose copy of a letter which is being directed to all Indian Agents. You will note that we are endeavouring to interest all those directly or indirectly connected with our work in regard to the future welfare of ex-pupils. In this manner, we hope to assist them during the critical years following their departure from our educational institutions.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\n500-659.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES & RESOURCES\n(INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH)\n\nOttawa, May 15th, 1937.\n\nTo Indian Agents:\n\nIt has been decided by the Department to inaugurate a \"follow-up\" system for pupils graduating from Indian residential schools.\n\nEnclosed, for your information, is a copy of a letter which is being directed to the Principals of the residential schools, also a copy of the form which will be used for report purposes.\n\nThis year, you will receive from the Principal of each residential school, a list of the pupils who will be discharged in June, 1938. This is intended to give you an opportunity of discussing the welfare of the graduates with those interested and deciding on the best plan to suggest to the graduating pupil.\n\nYou will, also, receive this year a form from the Principal giving the necessary information regarding each pupil from your agency who is being discharged at the end of the current academic year, namely, June 30th. Immediately on receipt of this form, you should get in touch with the farm instructor or other official on the reserve to which the pupil is proceeding with a view to assisting the pupil during the critical years following departure from residential school. The forms which you receive should be carefully filed in your office and, at the end of the first, second, third and fourth years, you should briefly record on them the progress made by the pupil. At the end of the fifth year, you should report more fully and forward the form to the Department.\n\nYou will appreciate that this attempt is largely experimental. Success will depend almost wholly upon the willingness of the Indian Agents and those associated with them in Indian work to cooperate in an endeavour to assist the graduates from our residential schools.\n\nThe Department will be glad to receive suggestions from time to time as to the manner in which you consider the methods employed could be improved.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nVanderhoof, B.C., January 11th, 1939.\n\nSir:\n\nI would respectfully direct your attention to Circular letter No. 500-658 dated May the 15th, 1937 and directed to Indian Agents, as well as one directed to Principals of Indian Residential Schools, same date and No. 500-659.\n\nIn discussing this phase of the school work with the Rev. Principal of the Lejac Indian Residential School a few days ago, I remarked that so far I had not received any of these follow up forms from him for the pupils who were discharged during 1936. The principal informed me that he did not know anything about these forms, he didn't have any of them and hadn't seen any reference to them on any of the files taken over from his predecessor, Rev. Father Grant.\n\nUnless this system has been changed recently I would respectfully request that a supply of these forms, with the necessary Circular letter, be sent to the Rev. Father Simpson at the Lejac Indian Residential School at your convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 27, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant no change has been made in the circular letter dated May 15 addressed to Indian Agents and Principals of residential schools.\n\nI cannot understand why the Lejac school did not receive a supply of the necessary forms and a copy of the letter of instructions as our records show that these were forwarded to all Indian residential schools in Canada.\n\nA supply of these forms is being sent under separate cover to the Rev. Principal of the Lejac school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B. C.\nTHE CANADIAN INDIANS\u2014THEIR ORIGIN AND DESTINY\n\nPART I. THEIR ORIGIN\n\nHow far the antiquity of man on the American continent reaches back into the preceding ages, it is impossible to say, but Dr. Stephen Leacock in his book \"The Dawn of Canadian History\" (Chronicles of Canada Series) furnishes some notable evidence to show that he was in North, South and Central America \"during the remote changes of the Great Ice Age\", and \"long before the gorge of Niagara had begun to be furrowed out\".\n\nWhen Europeans came to this continent at the end of the fifteenth century, they found it already inhabited by races of men very different from themselves, and because they thought they had found an underlying race or Eastern Asia on the sides, they called these people \"Indians\". In the course of time when this geographical misunderstanding was removed, thinking men began to look for an explanation for the seemingly isolated position of this section of the human race, separated as it was from the rest of mankind by boundless oceans.\n\nAfter a brief reference to some of the earlier and \"certainly naive\" theories which were propounded on the subject, Dr. Leacock proceeds to deal with the evidence that man had appeared on the earth long before the shaping of the continents as they are today, had taken place. \"Both in Europe and America\", he says, \"the buried traces of primitive man are vast in antiquity, and carry us much further back in time than the final changes of earth and ocean which made the continents as they are; and, when we remember this, it is easy to see how mankind could have passed from Asia or Europe to America\". He speaks of the connexion of the land surfaces of the globe as being different in early times from what it is now, and suggests, after mentioning the proximity of Siberia to Alaska, \"it may well have been that farther south, where now is the Pacific ocean, there was formerly direct land connexion between Southern Asia and South America. The continuous chain of islands that runs from the New Hebrides across the South Pacific to within two thousand four hundred miles of the coast of Chili is perhaps the remains of a sunken continent. In the most easterly of these, Easter Island, have been found ruined temples and remains of great earth-works on a scale so vast that to believe them the work of a small community of islanders is difficult. The fact that they have some resemblance to the buildings and works of the ancient inhabitants of Chili and Peru has suggested that perhaps South America was once merely a part of a great Pacific continent.\"\n\nFrom the time the writer of this article became interested in the origin of the American Indians, and that was in the year 1896 when he took up his work as a missionary among the Longan and Suhin Indians in the Paraguayan Chaco, he has never been satisfied with the simple explanation so widely accepted in Canada, that they come from Mongolian stock. If some connexion can be traced between the Mongols and some of the tribes of Alaska and the British Columbia Coast, no such connexion has been traced between them and the Indians who inhabit the rest of the vast North American continent, or Mexico, or Central and South America.\n\nTo quote Dr. Leacock again, he says:\u2014\"Of one thing we may be certain. If there was a migration (to America) there must have been long ages of separation between mankind in America and mankind in the Old World; otherwise we should still find some trace of kinship in language which would join the nativos of America to the great radical families of Europe, Asia and Africa. But not the slightest vestige of such kinship has yet been found\". While he considers it \"a very notable circumstance\" that we cannot connect the languages of America with those of any other part of the world, he points out that affinities and relationships may be traced in some fifty-five groups of Indian languages in North America.\nbetween the Arctic and Mexico, and adds that the speech of the natives of North America may easily be connected with that of the natives of Central and South America. \"Even,\" he says, \"if we had not the similarities of physical appearance, of tribal customs, and of general manners to argue from, we should be able to say with certainty that the various families of American Indians all belonged to one race.\"\n\nA few years ago the writer took time while in Cambridge, Mass., to read in the Harry Widener library at Harvard University, some forty volumes of American history, with a view to collecting the ideas of others who had studied the subject of the origin of the American Indians, and he was interested to learn that a goodly number of them expressed their conviction that they came from the Malay Archipelago. They point out that the Rockies and Andes are comparatively young mountains among the mountains of the earth, and advance the theory that the great convulsion of nature which threw them up was responsible for the submersion of the Pacific continent, the remains of which we can now see in the multitude of islands and islets lying off the southeastern part of the Asiatic coast. When that mighty convulsion took place, no one ventured to state, but it was their opinion that the forerunners of the present Indian races of America were here before that time, and were related to the inhabitants of the last continent.\n\nWhile the question of the origin of the American Indians affords a tempting theme to the speculative antiquarian, those who are not impressed by the Mongolian theory have cast about for another take its place, and some have found it in the decidedly interesting one just mentioned. In support of the Malay origin of this remarkable people, they point out that when the Spaniards under Cortez and Pizarro came to the Americas in the 16th century, they found two great civilizations\u2014one under the Aztecs in Mexico and the other under the Incas in Peru. They ask where these civilizations came from. They point to the older civilizations of the Mayas of Central America, \"whose ruined temples are still to be traced in the tangled forests of Yucatan and Guatemala,\" and inform those who wish to see replicas of those temples that they do so by visiting the Peabody Museum in Cambridge, Mass.; and they wish to know where that superior civilization came from. They point to the fact that the interest of the Mayas in astronomy led them to discover the lunar year of twelve months of thirty days, and wonder if this knowledge came to them by intuition, or was bequeathed to them from a still greater race that had gone before, just as their own culture formed the basis of many successive cultures in both Central and South America. They point to such things as the blow-pipe in use by the Indians in Peru as being almost identical with that used in Borneo, and they rightly ask if this is merely coincidence. They point to the striking resemblance between the totems of the Maoris of New Zealand and those of the Indians of the northwest coast of Canada; to the resemblance between the communal or \"long-houses\" of interior Borneo and those among the Indians in different parts of the Americas; to the striking similarity between many conventional designs and decorations of the native tribes of the South Sea Islands and the Indians of Puget Sound; they point to the ruined temples on Easter Island already mentioned, and to various other things which are germane to the subject, and ask if these do not furnish pretty clear and reliable indications that the earliest races which occupied the American continents came from the Malay Archipelago.\n\nThat mankind occupied these continents at a remote age of antiquity, Dr. Leacock in the book already mentioned, furnished some \"notable evidence.\" Amongst other things he mentions the finding of the imprints of human feet, deeply buried over twenty feet below the surface of the soil in Nicaragua, in Central America, and reasons that such impressions must have been made in soft muddy soil, subsequently covered by some geological convulsion.\nwhich occurred long ago. He refers to the still more striking discovery of rude implements of stone, and ornaments of gold, and bits of broken pottery, along the Ecuador coast in South America, buried in a stratum of sand and loam such as might once have been surface soil, but now resting below an approximately eight foot layer of marine clay.\n\nTurning to North America he refers to the discovery in the drift of the Mississippi and Missouri Valleys of chipped implements of stone and broken fragments of quartz buried or lying beside the bones of elephants and animals unknown in this continent \"since the period of the Great Ice\". From such evidence he reasons that the Americas were inhabited by human beings at a remote period in the past, much more remote than most people conceive, and if those human beings were the progenitors of the American Indians, those in Canada included, then we are living in the midst of one of the most interesting people in the whole world today.\n\nPART II\n\nTENIA DESTINY\n\nAs the second part of this article deals with a much more vital question concerning the Indian peoples of this country than the preceding one, the writer trusts that it may be found correspondingly more interesting. Until he himself became closely associated nearly twenty years ago, with the work of Indian education in Canada, the horizon of his personal knowledge of the Indians domiciled here was almost entirely limited to those he had read about, or contacted in the province of Ontario in which he was born. In his journeys up and down and across the country, however, since 1920, and in the discharge of his administrative duties as Secretary of the Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission of the Church of England in Canada, his knowledge of these people has expanded a good deal, and he has been in touch with tribes or bands whose existence was unknown to him before.\n\nAccording to the last census as published in the Report of the Indian Affairs Branch of the Dominion Government, the Indians in Canada now number 112,510, which is an increase of over 4,000 over the last previous census, and it should be of interest to your readers to know of their location across the country. The following figures are taken from the Report just mentioned:\n\n| Province               | Number in Province |\n|-----------------------|--------------------|\n| Alberta                | 10,900             |\n| British Columbia      | 23,528             |\n| Manitoba              | 12,959             |\n| New Brunswick         | 1,734              |\n| Northwest Territories | 3,854              |\n| Nova Scotia           | 2,000              |\n| Ontario               | 50,631             |\n| Prince Edward Island  | 2,224              |\n| Quebec                | 13,295             |\n| Saskatchewan          | 11,878             |\n| Yukon                 | 1,359              |\n| **Total**             | **112,510**        |\n\nIn the above list it will be noted that Newfoundland is not included. This is partly because it is not part of the Dominion; and partly because there are no Indians left there. When the early settlers arrived a tribe known as the Beothuks lived there and along the rocky coasts of the strait of Belle Isle, but these have all disappeared. As \"they smeared their bodies with red ochre, bright in colour\", it is thought that this gave rise to the name \"Red Indian\" by which the race is generally known to the present day.\n\nOf the three major groups into which the Canadian Indians are divided, those of Algonquin stock are mostly to be found at\nvarious centres all the way from the Eastern Maritimes to the Great Lakes, but there are some scattered settlements farther west.\n\nIn Ontario and around Lake Huron are the Huron-Iroquois, and to the north and west of these two groups, and living at various centres in the broad spaces between Hudson Bay and the Rockies and the Arctic Ocean are to be found the numerous tribes which are of Athapascan stock.\n\nThe Indians west of the Rockies are quite distinct from those of the Plains, apart from those tribes of Athapascan stock which have penetrated into British Columbia. While it is true that there are many distinct languages among the Indian tribes living along the Pacific coast all the way from California to Alaska, their physical appearance, and characteristics show such a similarity throughout that they are thought to belong to one kindred stock.\n\nIn order that your readers may have a clearer understanding of the difficulties which confront the Dominion Government and the different Church Societies who are, and have been for many years, cooperating closely in the work of Indian education, it may be helpful if further details be recorded here regarding the numerous tribes and communities of these people included in the major groups just mentioned.\n\n(1) Beginning with those of Algonquin stock, we find the Micmacs in Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario; the Malecites in New Brunswick and Quebec; the Montagnais and Abenakis in Quebec; the Ojibwas, Pottawatomies, and Delaware in Ontario; Ojibwas and Swampy Croes in Manitoba; Ojibwas, Swampy Croes and Plains Croes in Saskatchewan; Blackfoot, Blood, Peigan and Plains Croes in Alberta; Saulteaux and Croes in the Peace River Block in British Columbia.\n\n(2) Of those of Huron-Iroquois stock we find both Hurons and Iroquois in Quebec, and the Mohawks, Onondagas, Senecas, Oneidas, Cayugas, and the Tuscaroras, otherwise known as the Six Nations, in Ontario. There is also a Band of Iroquois in Alberta.\n\n(3) Of those of Athapascan stock we find the Chipewyan in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and the North West Territories; the Sarcees in Alberta; the Slave, Hare, Loucheux, Sekani, Dogrib, Yellow Knives, Copper Mines and Caribou Eaters in the North West Territories; the Takudah, Slave, Nahani, Tlingit and Stick in the Yukon.\n\nIn addition to these the Report of the Indian Affairs Branch of Government for 1936-37, from which the above details have been taken, states that in British Columbia:\n\n\"The Indians of the Bella Coola, Cowichan, Kamloops, Lytton, New Westminster, Nicola, Vancouver, and Okanagan Agencies belong to the Salish tribes. The Kootenay tribe is located in the agency of the same name. The Kwakiutl-Wooden tribe is located in the Kwawkweith and West Coast Agencies; the Haidas, in the Queen Charlotte Islands; the Tlingits, in the Stikine; and the Tsimsians in the Skeena Agency. The Indians of the Babine, Stuart Lake, and Williams Lake Agencies belong to the Athapascan race.\n\nThe Indians of the Peace River Block are Athapascan, with the exception of a small group of Saulteaux and Croes at Moberly Lake who are Algonquins.\"\n\nAs the Indians of Canada are the wards of the Dominion Government, some conception may be had from their widely separated locations across the country and their different ways of obtaining\na living of the difficulty of the problem of formulating a system of education suitable to all. In all fairness to the Government and to the Church Societies cooperating with it it must be said that this problem has been squarely faced, and not without an encouraging amount of success. In keeping with the terms of the treaties made with the various Bands, no less than 375 schools have been provided for the benefit of their children. Of these 80 are of the Residential class, with an enrollment in 1937 of 2,040 pupils; 275 are of the Day School class with an enrollment of 9,227; 10 others are known as Improved Day Schools, where a meal is served at midday; and 10 more are Combined White and Indian Day Schools, having an enrollment of 230.\n\nIn the earlier days the Government prescribed its own curriculum of studies, but of more recent years a decision was reached whereby the courses prescribed by the Departments of Education in the Provinces or Territories in which the various schools were located, should be adopted, and all such schools inspected, where the Government did not have its own Inspector, by the Provincial Public School Inspector. These arrangements are being followed at the present day, and, in the opinion of the writer, they are working sufficiently well to justify their maintenance.\n\nIt would, of course, be a comparatively simple matter to formulate a uniform system of education for these people throughout the Dominion, provided their locations, their living conditions, and their own philosophies were not so varied as they happen to be. In almost every group or settlement will be found at least three distinct lines of thought.\n\n(1) Those who feel that it is a good thing to be a ward of Government, and look with disfavour on any move which might threaten that old established order. To them it is a secure and comfortable feeling to know that a great and kindly White Father will forever take care of them. As psychiatrists tell us that many people must have this sense of security in one form or another, this section of the Indian peoples appears to have that sense developed to a very marked degree.\n\n(2) Then there are other Indians who prefer to grow up. They feel that wardship is a deeply humiliating experience, and keenly desire to escape from it at any cost. Some have even gone so far as to ask to be \"turned loose\", declaring they would rather lose everything and starve than face a condition of dependency forever.\n\n(3) Differing from these two classes is a third, comprising those who know nothing except wardship, and have no apparent desire to know anything else. They appear never to have heard of cooperation, and wouldn't give it a moment's thought if they had. The people of this class spend their days in brooding over old wrongs and nursing old wounds which refuse to heal. This is generally the attitude of mind of those who are oldest in years, those who are wilfully ignorant of the new forces of life all about them, and refuse to consider the possibilities which such forces have to bring a new vigour and growth into the life of their race.\n\nThese three different philosophies or lines of Indian thought are mentioned in order that the magnitude of the problem of working out the best possible system of education for those numerous and valiant people may not be underestimated. With startling rapidity they have been irresistibly pressed into the current of civilization, and any system of education devised for them, if it is to succeed, must enable them to adjust themselves to the new conditions in which they now find themselves. Today they stand on the threshold of a new life from which there is no turning back. Their traditional life of bygone days will never\nreturn, and whether they or their descendants desire it or not, they are destined to become a part of the new social order which has been built up around them. They cannot continue forever, nor even for many years longer, to live a segregated life, and must either be merged into the White life of this country, cease to exist, and if it be taken for granted, as the writer of this article does, that they are destined to share the responsibilities as well as the privileges of full and unrestricted citizenship, then the educational systems devised on their behalf must be shaped and controlled with this objective always clearly in view.\n\nSo far as the Indian himself is concerned, he has already seen with his own eyes that many of the Whiteman's ways are superior to his own. He has seen, for instance, that the Whiteman's methods and education have given him control over many of the forces of nature, and over many of the circumstances of life. Even many of the older generation of Indians are now no longer impressed by those who, whether Whiteman or Redman, who disparage the Whiteman's standards and who fail to continue to Indianize the Indian by extolling the indigenous culture which existed before the Whiteman came. Having seen the benefits and advantages of the Whiteman's education, they are demanding it for themselves and for their children, and they are demanding it as their right.\n\nThose who hold to the view that the Indians must, as at present, remain in wardship, and grow up as a segregated community by themselves, do not appear to the writer to show a proper respect for these people, nor does their view tend to develop any feeling of self-respect within the people themselves. While wardship may be necessary for a considerable time, varying in different localities according to prevailing conditions, such wardship should always be looked upon as temporary, and every encouragement given to the wards themselves to work with the Government and the Churches for their complete civil liberty and their economic independence.\n\nIt is assumed that Canadian citizenship will not be granted either hurriedly or indiscriminately as it was to the Indians in the United States by Act of Congress in 1824, but will be based on a standard of competency. The process has already begun, with considerable numbers being enfranchised in recent years, and although progress may for some time be slow, the manifestation of a spirit of patience, good-will, and mutual understanding on the part of all concerned will result in the achievement of ultimate success.\n\nIn taking cognizance of some of the endeavours already made in that direction, mention has been made of four different types of schools which have been established, and during the summer of 1938 the Church Societies engaged in Indian educational work gave careful consideration, at the request of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs (the Hon. T.E. Gr\u00e9gar) to the question as to whether these schools are sufficient to bridge the gap between the tribal homes of Indian childhood and the demands of the new way of life, or whether they should be modified and supplemented, or entirely superseded. As the result of the careful attention given to the subject, the Church Societies were unanimous in their opinion that the four classes of schools now in operation were making a valuable and worthwhile contribution to Indian education. In the districts where the Indian homes are stable and reasonably compact, the Day School type is particularly suitable for the younger children, as it helps to preserve the home life which is just as sacred to the Indians as it is to any other people, and it does not deprive the parents of the responsibilities of oversight and maintenance which rightly belong to them. Indian children, especially those of tender years, are very dear to the hearts of their parents, and the Government of this country has recognized this fact through the establishment and maintenance of such a large\nnumber of schools of the Day School class. During these earlier years while the children are constantly under the supervision of their parents, except when in attendance at the Day Schools, they are able to learn the history of their own tribe, and how to conduct themselves as members of that tribe. They can also learn the songs and legends of their tribe, the ethics of tribal citizenship, the duty and technique of self-control, and many other useful things which a child should know. As they grow older, however, say when they reach their teens, steps should be taken to teach them to evaluate their position as a unit in the overwhelmingly large and complex world around them; to teach them how best to develop their own personal assets in relation to that world's needs, and to liberate all the finer assets of their racial heritage for the benefit of those they contact from day to day.\n\nAnd it is at this stage of their development that the writer feels convinced the schools of the Residential class are indispensable. He freely concedes that the Indian Day Schools are well adapted to the education of the younger children under prevailing conditions, but they lack the capability of engendering the initiative, ambition, resourcefulness, and power of productivity which the older boys and girls must have if they are ever to take their rightful place as independent and self-supporting members of the community. In support of his conviction that the Residential Schools are indispensable, not only as homes for orphan and neglected Indian children, for children from destitute and immoral homes, for children who are physically below par but capable of being invigorated, as well as for children from settlements where no Day Schools exist, he may state that he finds better academic results than being secured in the Residential than in the Day School. The Report of the Indian Affairs Branch of Government for 1937 embodies the following information in this connection: Out of total enrollments which are approximately equal at the 80 Residential Schools and the 275 Day Schools, 212 pupils attained Grade VIII standing in the former, while only 146 reached the same Grade in the latter; that while 87 attained Grade IX in the Residential Schools, only 15 got so far in the Day Schools. Such figures, and more of the same kind, which could be quoted, appear to indicate the advisability of having all pupils transferred from the Day Schools to those of the Residential class when they attain either a certain standard or a certain age.\n\nFor the Indians in the remoter parts of Canada almost all of whom are nomads, the only kind of School that will prove beneficial is the Residential. The necessity resting on the parents of securing a living by hunting and fishing, makes the Day School impossible except for a few months at a time. As the School building and equipment could not follow them, and as they would be certain to take their children with them, the building, equipment and teacher would all be idle during the greater part of the year.\n\nAnd the superior benefits which the Residential Schools confer on the Indian children are not confined to the intellect only, for they extend to their physical and spiritual welfare as well. The sanitary conditions under which they live in those institutions, the regularity with which they receive wholesome meals, the suitable clothing with which they are supplied, the nursing and medical care always available for them, and the careful supervision of all their activities under experienced and competent supervisors, all help to build up their physique, while their daily contact with the devout Christian men and women who make up the staff, go a long way towards shaping hundreds of them from year to year into the best type of Canadian citizen. The discipline, the ordered life and the general cultural benefits of the Residential School system can scarcely be exaggerated, while the associations which these schools make possible, frequently for children from widely separated locations, help to broaden their outlook and to form new friendships, as scarcely anything else could.\nWe are told in the Holy Scriptures that a tree is known by its fruit, and the Indian Residential Schools may safely be submitted to the judgment of public opinion according to this standard. Space is not available to mention even a fraction of the graduate boys and girls who have lived up faithfully to the high traditions of the Residential Schools they attended, and those who have since married and have children of their own express the keenest desire that their children should be enrolled as pupils at the same institutions. Nor is space available to mention the graduates who have qualified as teachers, nurses, ministers of the Gospel, or who are filling positions of trust and responsibility, not only under the Indian Affairs Branch of Government, but in other departments of the country's civic and commercial life.\n\nDuring the Great War over 4,000 served overseas with the Canadian Expeditionary Force, and some of them won their commissions on the field of battle. Those who remained at home contributed over $40,000,000 to the Red Cross, Belgian Relief and other funds, and as the writer is convinced that they would again prove their loyalty to Canada and the Empire under a similar emergency, he does not consider any expenditure too great to assist them in triumphing over their present disabilities, and rising to the highest height possible for redeemed humanity.\n\nAt an important Conference of the Indian Rights Association of the United States, held in Atlantic City last year, the delegates did not hesitate to assert that the Indian must be saved by a process of Christian assimilation to American life, and not by a carefully guarded and subsidized segregation. \"Anything which emphasizes\", they said, \"and makes for separation and race discrimination, militates against the very essence of the Christian religion\".\n\nAnd it is the opinion of the writer of this article that we should aim at the same destiny for our Canadian Indians. That there is inherent value in some of their old cultures and in some of their primitive religious beliefs is undoubtedly true, but to attempt, as some are doing, to encourage them to believe that their old way of life is adequate to meet their needs in these modern times, is neither honest nor hopeful. Rather let us take the sound advice of that great and wise man of the past, the Hon. Alexander Morris, P.C., for some time Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba, the North-West Territories, and Kee-wa-tin, who in March 1880, closed his report on the Treaties which had been made with the Indians, with those words:\n\n\"And now I close. Let us have Christianity and civilization to leaven the mass of heathenism and paganism among the Indian tribes; let us have a wise and paternal Government faithfully carrying out the provisions of our treaties, and doing its utmost to help and elevate the Indian population, who have been cast upon our care, and we will have peace, progress, and concord among them in the North-West; and instead of the Indians walking away, as one of them in older Canada tersely put it, \"as snow before the sun,\" we will see our Indian population, loyal subjects of the Crown, happy, prosperous and self-sustaining, and Canada will be enabled to feel, that in a truly patriotic spirit, our country has done its duty by the red men of the North-West, and thereby to herself. So may it be\".\n\nWinnipeg, Man.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYour letter of the 5th inst. has come to hand, and with it excerpts from Inspectors' Reports which you had received during the month of December, 1938.\n\nAs you state in your letter that a number of principals and teachers in charge of Indian schools had not replied to your circular of January 15, 1937, No. 150-60, I am writing to all our principals today directing their attention to this circular and requesting them to forward to you direct any helpful suggestions they may feel able to make regarding manual training and a follow-up system.\n\nI am also taking the liberty of sending to the principals of our Society's Indian & Eskimo Residential Schools a copy of the excerpts from Inspectors' Reports which you so kindly sent, in the hope that the information embodied therein may, as it should, be of suggestive value to them.\n\nYou will know from correspondence and from our annual List of Requirements that our Society has, for some years past, been stressing the need of some better provision for manual training at the Schools under its control, and as this was specifically mentioned in the list of \"Suggestions for Improving the Prevailing System of Indian Education\" presented to the Superintendent General by the Joint Church Delegation on Nov. 21st last, I am unable at present...\nto add anything to what was therein stated.\n\nI am glad to learn from the closing part of your letter that you have found Inspectors' Reports in recent months so satisfactory and encouraging and trust I may not be misunderstood if I say as I honestly feel I can say, that a very large share of the improvements effected is due to the capable and systematic direction and leadership you yourself have given in these matters.\n\nWith a view to correcting misinformation which is sedulously being sown by ill-informed or irresponsible persons I have responded to a request from the Toronto Star Weekly to prepare an article on the Canadian Indians, and I am enclosing herewith a copy of the article which is going forward today to that paper. Whether it will be published or not remains to be seen, but I, for one, have the satisfaction of feeling that the Government and Church Societies which have taken a very practical interest in every branch of Indian welfare in this country need not be ashamed of their record.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTERW/KH\n\nEnclos.\nTo enable this file to be made available to researchers it has been necessary for IAND officials to exclude some material in accordance with Cabinet Directive No. 46 of 7 June 1973.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6033)\n\nFile 150-44, part 2\nHeadquarters - Health - Dietary Service\nfor Residential Schools. 1929-1947\n\nFile 150-50, part 1\nHeadquarters - Inventory of Government\nProperty at Residential Schools. 1934-1941\n\nFile 150-60, part 1\nHeadquarters - Vocational Training and\nFollow-up System for School Graduates.\n1937-1939\n\nFile 150-60B, part 1\nHeadquarters - Vocational Training and\nFollow-up System for School Graduates.\n1938-1945\n\nFile 150-61, part 1\nHeadquarters - Monthly Reports - Welfare\nand Training Services Division. 1941-1945\nFollow-up\n\nRe: Agents report to pupils occupation & character.\nChapleau Ontario\nDecember 29th. 1943\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe; Pupils discharged from Chapleau School.\n\nIn reply to your letter of December 26th., regarding pupils of the Chapleau Agency discharged from the Chapleau Residential School.\n\nThose referred to are at present occupied as follows;-\n\nNo.228 Lawrence Matchequis, living at Mattice with parents trapping.\n267 John Tangie, working for C.P.R. at Franz.\n0172 Louise Sheshawabic, Domestic servant, Ottawa.\n0175 Emma Candessie Home with parents.\n0234 Mintrude Moore Training at Mothercraft Institute Toronto, doing well, averaged over 80% in last examinations.\n\nTo be added to the list is one girl who was discharged later in the fall;-\nNo. 0157 Helen Kitchebrah, working as a Domestic servant at 145 Richmond Rd.

This is the first that I have heard of this boy having been returned to this Agency and I have not seen or heard of him since his discharge. His father was, I believe, Ingersol Ashkewe of the Cape Croker Band, formerly residing on the Parry Island Reserve, but I have not seen this man for a couple of years. It may be that the boy is living with relatives on Parry Island and I will make some inquiries and endeavour to locate him.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nGolden Lake, Ont.\nDec. 30th, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa, Can.\n\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRE- NO.

Nils.\n\nIn reply to your letter of December 29th, regarding two pupils of this Agency discharged from Residential schools last June, I beg to report as follows:\n\nNo. 0159 Alice Saunders, Katsie Band, discharged from Sechelt Indian Residential School. This girl is an orphan with no reputable near relatives. Upon discharge from school, we placed her as a maid at the Coqualeetsa Indian hospital, where she has been ever since. She has not been particularly satisfactory. Recently she tried to join the Canadian Women's Army Corps, but was turned down. She wishes to leave the hospital, and go to an aunt on Vancouver Island, but I do not think she would come to any good there. However, if she quits the hospital there is nothing we can do with her. In short, she is going to be a problem.\n\nNo. 6. Russell Kelly, Soowahlie Band. This is a good boy. He is home helping his father on his farm.\n\nA.O'N.Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\nI have for acknowledgment Department letter of December 26th with reference to pupils of sixteen years and more who were discharged from residential schools and returned to Cape Croker Reserve.

Her grandmother, Mrs. Margaret French, who was always Madeline's counsellor, recently died. Her grandfather, Mr. Isaac French, who is at present quite sick, is also very interested in her welfare. Madeline visits him occasionally and then returns to her father and brother. I have not heard or received any adverse reports as to her behaviour. However, at some future date when automobile travel is a little easier I will endeavour to locate the family and check on Madeline's conduct.\n\nIn regard to Reginald Sickles, he is the son of Mrs. Christine Antone by a previous marriage. He is of a sulky disposition and whenever corrected on his behaviour shows signs of rebelliousness. He lacks a father's discipline. I had several talks with him and gave him work on the farms during the summer months but he eventually ran away. We located him with a travelling rodeo that visited this district with the Fall Fairs. He became tired of this and came home. I again pleaded with him to be a good boy and help his mother. I also gave him a job helping Mr. Ryckman, the Farm Instructor. At present he is working on a farm near Listowel, Ontario. He has been there two months and his mother reports that he is doing much better.\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nGWD/BC\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources OTTAWA.\n\nAnswering Mr. Phelans letter of Dec. 28, 1943 re the following ex-pupils of the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, Blackfoot Reserve:\n\nNo. 149 Ralph J Young Man is a Dummy and quite a problem. He is a good worker but hard to direct. His parents are separated and he rarely stays with them; he wanders over the Reserve and into the small towns and becomes a nuisance; a brother-in-law is trying to keep him now. He may become a case for an institution.\n\nNo. 126 Alex Scalp Lock lives with his parents; his father is delicate and Alec does most of the farm work; he has also worked in the coal mine. Alex is a pretty good boy.\n\nNo. 129 Clarence McHugh was a problem case until recently. His father is overseas and the mother is dead; the step-mother could not control him. He was employed at the Hospital farm and dairy, but ran off after a few weeks. Then arrangements were made to send him back to Crowfoot School, where he was to learn a trade, but again he ran away. Finally an old-time rancher who needed a boy to do chores agreed to take him. He has been with him now for two months, and it is reported that Clarence is happy and doing fairly well. He is fortunate in getting into a white home where he is treated as one of the family. McHugh is a fair haired Indian.\n\nDear Shirt\n\nNo. 135 James has T.B., but his parents refused to hospitalize him. This was some years ago and he was sent home. He has grown up a husky lad but does not do much work; he lives with a brother and is occasionally employed as a cowboy.\n\nNo. 0120 Rita Running Rabbit lives with grandparents, the Duck Chiefs; she was employed for a short time at the Roman Catholic Hospital, Cranbrook, but got homesick and returned home.\n\nNo. 0240 Theresa Many Guns is the common-law wife of a much older man\u2014Anthony Scalp Lock.\n\nNo. 0111 Margaret Cat Face is at home; her mother has heart trouble and Margaret does most of the housework. She was employed as a domestic in a farm home North of the Reserve for a short time in 1943.\n\nIndian Agent\nG.H. Gooderham\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of December 28th regarding pupils discharged from the schools as at June 30th, 1943 & beg to report as follows:\n\nNo. 101 Jack Buffalo:\nThis is a well behaved boy & during the summer he worked the Chief's farm & after he got through with that he went off the reserve & worked for white men & has only recently returned to the reserve. In another year I would like to start him on a farm of his own.\n\nNo. 118 Alfred Crow Shoe:\nThis boy worked on his father's farm after leaving school & this year his father plans on letting him have a portion of his farm to work for himself. He is marrying a girl from the Blood reserve & if given a little help, I am satisfied he will make good. I have employed him on many occasions on odd jobs & he is a very good worker.\n\nNo. 114 Tony Strikes with Gun:\nThis boy also helped his father on the farm during the summer & later went off the reserve to work. In another year I would like to start him on a farm of his own, but not until I have a piece of land thoroughly cleaned of weeds to start him on.\n\nNo. 122 Bobbie White Cow:\nSince leaving school this boy has worked mostly off the reserve & at present is at the coast, working in a shipyard. He also is a good kid, but at present I am not in a position to recommend what might be done for him. Meantime he is doing for himself.\n\nNo. 217 Gerald Tail Feathers:\nThis is a Blood boy.\n\nNo. 110 Julia Pard:\nThis girl is living at home with her parents. She is well behaved & no doubt will be getting married, in which event I would suggest that she be given some help.\nNo. 0109 Cecile Little Leaf:\n\nThis girl is an orphan & is living at her brother's home. She is an exceptionally fine girl; clever & clean, handy with a needle & a fair cook. I have tried to get her placed in a white home, but so far without success. She herself would like to get work off the reserve & I may yet be able to place her.\n\nNo. 057 Mary Crow Eagle:\n\nThis girl is now married to Charlie Provost Jr. The father of her husband is farming on quite a large scale & has ready for crop this year 237 acres of land. He proposes turning over part of this acreage to the boy to give him a start & in the event of his making good, there is some more good land in the neighbourhood which I propose to turn over to him after I get it cleaned up. The girl has some savings & I am putting through an application for the withdrawal of part of these to carry them through. The girl is an orphan.\n\nNo. 089 Suzette Big Bull:\n\nThis girl is rather unfortunately placed. Her father is dead & her mother is pretty much of an old rip & the only thing she can look forward to, is getting married, unless I can find a position for her off the reserve.\n\nNo. 090 Gertrude Bastien:\n\nThis girl is living off the reserve with her father, who has been working for a neighbourhood farmer for several years. Her mother is dead. She is a good appearing girl & when she left school she was a very good worker, but I have not seen much of her since. She was in a few days ago & made out an application for withdrawal of part of her savings, as she feels that she ought to pay her way as her father has another wife & is raising another family & is having enough to do to make his wages go around.\n\nJ.T.Faunt,\nActing Indian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIn reply to your letter of December 27th in regard to pupils discharged from residential school June, 1943 and No. 391 Henry Shilling in particular, I would advise the Henry Shilling was the only one of that age discharged at that time. Barbara Ingersoll, age fourteen, returned to the reserve and is attending school.\n\nHenry Shilling did not return to the reserve but went direct to his brother Albert Shilling at Pickering, Ont. I have never seen the boy. Albert now reports that Henry worked on a farm for one month and when he received his first pay, went to Toronto and landed in jail. He returned in a ragged condition and took another job on a farm near Whitby. Albert has not seen him since.\n\nH.F. Featherston\nH.F.

Raven was transferred from Elkhorn School to Sioux Lookout March 25/42 then he became enfranchised with his parents last summer and I informed the school Principal that we were no longer responsible for this boy.\n\nRegarding #206 Wallace Johnny, 213 Bill Smith, 214 John Tait, these boys belong to Rosseau R. I.R. and were at Portage la Prairie school and are now working for farmers in the Rosseau River area.\n\nI would point out that with the exception of the SISB Fort Alexander School we are never informed when pupils are discharged and this makes it difficult to keep office records up to date and to keep in touch with the pupils after they leave school. At present I know nothing of their discharge unless I find out when visiting on the reserves.\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, December 27, 1943.\n\nDr. T. J.

Kemano Agency.\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nIn reply to your letter dated the 28th ultimo in connection with the under-mentioned children who have been discharged from Residential Schools.\n\nAll these children belong to the northern Bands. I can only visit these Reserves occasionally and my visits are necessarily of short duration. Even when I do visit the Reserves I see comparatively few of the Indians except at Treaty and then I have so much work to do that it is impossible for me to get acquainted with the Indians individually. The Indians of the North live mostly in small family groups and we rarely see them at other times. It is therefore impossible for me to report on ex-pupils who live on those Reserves or belong to the remote Bands. When they return to their homes on the Northern reserves they generally resume the usual Indian mode of life. There is nothing else for them to do. The boys make their living by hunting and trapping and the girls assist in cooking, making camp or keeping house, helping to skin animals, etc. I have heard nothing detrimental against any of the pupils mentioned. It is therefore to be assumed they are getting along all right.\n\n0453 Caroline Moar\n0168 Melanie Ducharme\n0155 Catherine Benanuni\n091 Melanie Carabou\n02161 Flora Sewap.\n105 Joseph Heud\n136 Mosie Jock\n126 John Bighetty\n119 Alexander Kerasty.\n\nS. Lovell,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines and Resources, Ottawa\n\nYour file; Training Division, December 28th, 1943\n\nYour list insofar as pupils 16 years and over is correct. There are several Residential School pupils in the different villages of the Agency who were discharged at 15 years of age in order to allow them to take part in the fall fishing operations of the B.C. coast. Their names will be ascertained on my next visit to the outside villages and a report made on their conduct and activities.\n\nNo. 649 Clarence S. Martin, Bella Bella, B.C. This young man received his military training call, and proceeded to Vancouver, but on request of his mother and the fishing company, application for a deferment was made on his behalf, and he was given exemption to July, 1944. He is at present engaged in herring fishing, and is doing quite well. He is an industrious lad and well behaved.\n\nNo. 603 George S. Nelson, Bella Coola, B.C. This young man fished all the summer, and did fairly well. For the past three months he has worked with his father, one of the Councillors of Bella Coola, on a construction job for the R.C.A.F., on which he has made $1000.00 in wages, with taxes deductible therefrom. He had one escapade in connection with drinking, but I had a good chat with him, and he signed a temperance pledge and has since been no worry to himself or his people. He is well spoken of by all the people of Bella Coola.\n\nNo. 125, Leonard Paul, Kamano, B.C. Leonard fished for the Canadian Fishing Co. at Butedale all the summer, and is now engaged at the same place fishing for herring and working in the reduction plant where he is steadily and usefully employed. He comes of a steady and industrious family, all the children of which have had a good education at the Residential Schools. He has three younger brothers at Alberni now. There is considerable T.B. in the family however.\n\nF.

Indian residential school, namely; Rosalie Anakons and Harriet Primeau. According to the school records these pupils were discharged June 30th, 1943.\n\nWith regard to their occupations and behaviour since leaving the school, this is very difficult to determine, however, I understand they are both employed as waitresses in local restaurants. At the present time I am unable to check this definitely but as soon as I have any definite information I will be pleased to forward same for your information.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Indian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 26, 1944.\n\nDear Father Rusaux:\n\nWe recently requested Indian Agent Lewis to submit a report on the progress made by pupils who have been discharged from the Ermineskin Residential School within the past year. He has submitted a very interesting letter and, in the case of 18 ex-pupils, expresses the opinion that they are doing reasonably well.\n\nHowever, as regards the under-mentioned 5 children, the reports he submitted are not so encouraging:\n\nNo. 554 Ernest Baptiste\n\" 671 Sam Bull\n\" 586 Howard Buffalo\n\" 590 Maurice Buffalo\n\" 556 Norman Yellowbird\n\nIt has occurred to me that it might be a good idea to have one of the missionaries visit these boys at an early date and encourage each of them to obtain employment and make an effort to make use of the training that they received at the residential school. Possibly you might be able to see some of them yourself. I feel you will agree with me that we should do everything possible to encourage the ex-pupils to get started in life as soon as they are discharged from school. This is to their own advantage and certainly to the credit of the residential school system.\n\nRev. E. Rusaux,\nActing Principal,\nErmineskin Indian Residential School,\nHobbema, Alta.\nI should appreciate your advising what action you feel you can take in the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 26, 1944.\n\nMr. A.G.B.

Possibly you might be able to offer some further encouragement.\n\nI am also writing to the Principal of the Edmonton Residential School, with reference to advising you regarding the discharge of pupils from that school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 26, 1946.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department recently wrote to Indian Agent Lewis, Hobbema Indian Agency, requesting him to report on the ex-pupils discharged within the last year or so from the Edmonton Residential School. In reply he states that he does not receive from you the notice which every Principal is expected to send to the Indian Agent concerned previous to the discharge of a pupil from a residential school. The receipt of this notice gives official information to the Indian Agent regarding the pupils who are to be discharged and the Department then wishes the Agent to make every possible effort to assist the pupil in taking advantage of the education that he has received at a residential school.

In reply Mr. Lewis wrote, in part, as follows:\n\n\"Regarding the pupils of the Edmonton Indian Residential School, I never receive any reports from this school on discharges. I get lots of information regarding absences, but the rest of the school work is a deep, dark secret as far as this Agency is concerned.\"\n\nFor your information I enclose a copy of a letter sent yesterday to the Reverend Principal of the Edmonton School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Pupil #140 James McKay, this name should be Jonas McKay. This boy is trapping with his uncle and is doing alright. Pupil #148, Lazarus Mason, has been trapping with his father and doing well. Pupils #180 and #0120 Alexander Mason and Florence Mason live at Island Lake, and I have had no opportunity since their discharge of finding out what they are doing. Pupil #0141 Maggie Paupanakis, is doing domestic service with the Manager of the Hudson Bay Post at Norway House, and behaving very well. Pupil #0155 Margaret M. Scotch, is at home with her mother. Pupil #0384 Muriel Cline, this name should be Muriel Cline, and I believe was attending Elkhorn School. The parents of this girl have lived apart for many years, the father living at the Norway House reserve and the mother earning her own living in Selkirk. I have never seen any of the children, and it is likely that this girl has gone back to her mother at Selkirk, though I have no information as to this. Pupil #0126 and Pupil #0148, Marie L. Hees\u2014a McKay and Victoria Ross, worked for some time as maids at the Norway House Hospital and have recently returned to their homes on the reserve at Cross Lake.\n\nAll these pupils have been of good behaviour up to the present.\n\nP.

Woodsworth, Principal of the Edmonton School, which is self-explanatory.\n\nApparently Mathew Wesley has been at the Edmonton School until a few days ago, when presumably he was sent to hospital for treatment of a sore foot.\n\nS. Mallinson\nIndian Agent\nMarch 9th, 1944\n\nMr. Mallinson  \nIndian Agent  \nHazelton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Mallinson:\n\nI have your letter of 3rd inst. relative to Mathew Wesley No. 170. I may say that this boy was discharged from school last summer by the Department. Being an orphan he apparently had no definite home to which to go, except that of Mrs. Esther Holland who wrote me regarding him. Mathew has always been a quiet reliable boy around school, so in discussing his future I suggested that he stay at the school for another year and help me with the farm and other work, for which I would pay him a fair wage. He agreed to this and has been with me all winter, doing chores and odd jobs. For the most part he has been quite happy and contented, except that he has at times suffered with a sore foot. I had an X-ray taken and have lately had him in to see the Doctor. In the last examination the Doctor recommended that he be sent to the hospital for treatment and this afternoon I shall take him in. I may say that in the fall he was examined with the other pupils for T.B. and came through clear, so with the exception of this foot he is in good health. When he returns from hospital I shall send him home, as he is now old enough to care for himself.\n\nI regret that I have not kept you informed regarding Mathew, but trust that the foregoing information is satisfactory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n*J.F. Woodsworth*\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 29th, of December last the following pupils discharged from residential schools are living with their parents on the reserve and their behaviour is satisfactory.\n\nNo. 0246 Mary Bird, James Roberts Band, Lac La Ronge.\n   0508 Dorothy Bear, Wm.

It is just possible that in the immediate future steps will be taken to requisition the services of women for assignments in industrial plants engaged on war contracts, while at the same time thousands of comparatively strong able-bodied young men will experience difficulty in securing employment, for the simple reason that they have not developed the skills necessary to serve usefully in a highly mechanized social and industrial set-up. In my judgment, educationists cannot escape responsibility for this condition. Despite the fact that Germany and certain other European countries had in operation toward the end of the last century a well-balanced system of technical and vocational instruction, educational systems in the English-speaking world were so dominated by the classicalists that it has only been in recent years that a feeble attempt has been made to promote vocational instruction and then only in a very half-hearted sense. It has been my misfortune during the last 30 or 40 years to meet a number of so-called outstanding educationists who looked upon any educational enterprise outside the so-called classical course as an enterprise designed only for subnormal or semi-intelligent human beings. We shall be fortunate indeed if we escape the consequences of a mistaken educational policy pursued over a period of years, which simply ignored the growing mechanization of human society, the gradual displacement of man power by steam, electric energy and the internal combustion engine.\n\nIt is significant that the masses themselves rather than our leaders have become conscious of certain weak spots in our educational scheme of things - hence the desire on the part of many to attend youth training\ncentres, enroll in Short Courses, purchase for use as hobbies short courses in electricity, motor mechanics, radio engineering, etc. The Canadian Legion have at this date an enrolment of 20,000 men of the Active Service Forces in correspondence courses, the large majority of which are of a vocational or technical character.\n\nInspector Barry, in his report on the new consolidated Indian day school (Ste. Catherine's) Cowichan Agency, B. C., states:\n\n\"Mr. Patrick J. Corcoran is making a very great success of his work as manual training instructor at this school. In addition to teaching the boys the elementary work in manual training and constructing a number of articles for use in the school, he takes charge of the boys' games and athletic activities.\n\nThe manual training shop was in a perfectly neat and clean condition, as was in fact everything around the school. The tools supplied are in good condition and properly cared for by the instructor.\n\n\"The girls' vocational work has been good. Considerable progress has been made in sewing and work with native wools. The girls have made a number of dresses. In my opinion this school is proving a great success. Its general standing can now be classified as excellent.\"\n\nReverend E. J. Staley, Principal of the Morley Indian Residential School (U.C.) in a letter to the Department dated April 17, 1941, states:\n\n\"You will recall that you were good enough two years ago to start us off in the fur farming business at the school and while as yet it is perhaps premature to begin to get enthusiastic about it, I can say that while it is no gold-mine, it is a paying proposition. This year for the first time we shall be able to carry into account no capital expenditure for supplies or equipment and so I shall be able to furnish you with a much better idea of the situation this fall.\n\n\"Just a few rough figures. Last year we pelleted 75 mink. The grading on these showed a wide range in quality; the prices received were all the way from $8.00 to $15.00. Moreover, we had a profit on the sale of $615. This year we have at the present time 50 breeding stock; all this, with the exception of some more miles we purchased this spring, from the original investment of 6 mink of two years ago.\n\n\"The Indian boys have taken to the work in a very fine way and I believe now that at least a dozen boys could find employment if they so desired among the large fur ranches in the vicinity of Calgary.\n\nWith -\n\"With average fur prices in the next few years the venture is a good one that we have every intention of giving a full and complete trial.\"\n\nMr. D. J. Scoates, B.A., United Church Missionary at Oxford House, Manitoba, has been organizing from year to year a worthwhile exhibition of manual training projects and handicraft at his school. In a letter dated February 21, 1941, sent by Mr. Scoates to the Indian Agent at Norway House, the teacher states:\n\n\"Each passing year the exhibition is better than the one before, not only in the added number of exhibits but in the quality of the work done by the children. Further - and this is the primary object of this manual training course - new children are being introduced to this branch of education. This year there were 127 exhibits. Many of these exhibits were the same as last year but for seniors the work was better accomplished and for new pupils it represented their first attempts. The exhibits included dresses, aprons, handkerchiefs, pot-holders, mats, bedspreads, quilts, sweaters, socks, scarves, mittens, gloves, woollen parka hoods, chairs, tables, towel racks, potato mashers, wooden teapots with hooks for pot-holders, wooden toys, candle sticks, door stops, paper mache dishes, calendars, tin articles, bread, cakes, pies, doughnuts, cookies and canned fruit.\n\n\"It is impossible to give you a full description of the exhibition. To fully appreciate the work entailed and the enthusiasm of the children, it would be necessary for you to visit the school on that very special day.\n\n\"This year there was a good representation of the parents, and that they appreciate the value of what is being taught will be seen in the following facts: some of the adult women have come to my wife and asked her to show them how to make quilts. Last summer more women wanted Mrs. Scoates to help them to can fruits than we had bottles to supply them.\n\n\"A new feature introduced this year is that of working with tin. I think I told you that I had bought Mrs. Scoates a blow-torch. The boys are learning to use this and also the art of soldering. They each had one tin article exhibited.\n\n\"I might add in closing that the health of the children at school has been splendid, some children losing only 3 days so far this year on account of colds.\"\n\nSister Sainte Jeanne, senior teacher at the Pointe Bleue 2-room Indian day school, Quebec Province,\nin a letter dated March 25, 1941, states:\n\n\"We are pleased toward the end of the year to inform you of the activities of our class in home economics.\n\n\"You will notice from the program enclosed that the works performed are proportionate to the age of the pupils in each course. This year, in order to bring the retarded pupils up to date, all of them began at the first year and worked up to their respective courses which entailed for them a considerable amount of work.\n\n\"As supplementary work, the girls, in addition to the regular courses, also learned to manufacture Indian moccasins, which accomplishment will be useful to them in later life.\n\n\"You may, by this, realize that the money you grant for this work is usefully employed. It is our hope that next year you will grant us from $15 to $20.\n\n\"It is also imperative that we should have a sewing machine.\"\n\nReverend A. H. Fleury, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal of the St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School, Mission, B.C., in a recent letter, states:\n\n\"It may interest you to learn that we have started a spinning and weaving class at the school. The boys, too, are competing this year in the provincial calf club and poultry contests. Last year they won several prizes. Our Band is entered again in the provincial musical festival and I hope they do as well as they did in other years. I am enclosing a snap of them, recently taken.\"\n\nWELFARE.\n\nIn my report of last month I intimated that relief and welfare expenditures for the period April 1, 1940, to February 28, 1941, were approximately $136,823.25 less than the expenditure for the corresponding period of the preceding year. We have not at this date received from the Treasury Officials a statement covering the entire fiscal year. The officers in the Welfare Division, however, inform me that when all accounts for the year are paid a substantial balance will remain. This is the first year since I entered the Department that we have been able to meet our accounts in full at the end of a fiscal year.\"\nyear and emerge with a balance.\n\nIt should be borne in mind, however, that a number of commodities supplied by the Department to Indians and used in the repair and reconstruction of schools, Indian homes and other buildings show a tendency to increase in price. Building materials are no longer exempt from sales tax, and this fact must necessarily mean a substantial increase in the cost of materials required for the upkeep and repair of buildings. Tea and sugar have also increased in price, and the burser of a group of residential schools in northern Alberta, Reverend Father Lejote, intimated during a recent visit to the Department that he had paid $750 of a processing tax on the flour recently purchased for his residential schools. Our residential schools use large quantities of gasoline for the operation of engines, lighting plants, etc., and no doubt, the recently announced Dominion tax on gasoline will contribute substantially to the cost of operation of these institutions. It will thus be seen that, despite the efforts we may make to keep our educational and welfare costs down to the lowest possible figures, these costs, for reasons that I have enumerated and for other reasons, are likely to increase somewhat during the year upon which we have now entered.\n\nReports continue to reach the Department with respect to welfare projects undertaken and accomplished by groups of Indian women. These groups of women were organized first in the province of Saskatchewan, by the late Dr. Robertson, and similar organizations have multiplied rapidly in the other provinces during the last couple of years. Inspector Hamilton has forwarded a report dated April 15, 1941, received by him from Miss A. Eaton, teacher at the north end Peguis Indian Day School. Miss Eaton, in her report, states:\n\n\"I still deem it best to carry on with my former procedure, viz.: having the women meet me in school the last Friday afternoon of every month, and the other Friday afternoons I spend visiting. Through force of circumstances during this period (October to April) we only held 2 regular meetings at the school - the last Friday in October and the last Friday in March. At the meeting in October, the first part of the afternoon we were in the school cottage, where I demonstrated how to cook meat and make soup in order to get the most nourishment possible; the rest of the afternoon we spent in the school building doing Red Cross knitting. On the afternoon of the last Friday in March we discussed garden work and I gave out tomato seeds for them to plant in the house, so that they might have early plants and later ripe tomatoes in their gardens. I also sent seeds with the school children to the mothers who could not attend.\n\n\"The keenness shown and the progress made in spinning during this period is most gratifying. An issue of raw wool was made to every school child. If a family has no member who can spin,\nthey have to pay for this service by giving a quantity of yarn. The Indians make these bargains between themselves; I never interfere. Several families who had to pay last year have set about in grim earnest to learn to do their own spinning and have done it.\n\n\"There was another incident which, I think, shows this work is well worth carrying on. Mrs. Colin Pahkoo came last week to borrow the preserving kettle. They had snared a lot of rabbits and she wanted to bottle and preserve the meat.\"\n\nIndian Agent Daunt, New Westminster, B. C., in a letter dated April 19, 1941, states:\n\n\"I beg to forward you herewith the following reports in connection with the Sardis, Chilliwack and Soowahlie Native Women's Organizations. These societies are doing a great deal of good on the reserves and the old and helpless receive, through these groups, assistance which they otherwise would not get. The interest which these Societies have awakened among the Indian women in sewing and house-work cannot fail to have a good influence upon Indian life. I think it would be a good idea if the Department wrote a letter to each secretary, expressing their appreciation of the activities of these organizations, which could be read by the secretaries to their assembled members\".\n\nThe letters suggested by Indian Agent Daunt were sent out to the secretaries of these organizations on April 23.\n\nIndian Agent Spence, Moravian Agency, Ontario, in his April report, states:\n\n\"The agricultural short courses recently held under the direction of Mr. E. Moses proved instructive to those in attendance. There is at this time quite a number of our young men away from the reserve, but 10 or 15 adults and 6 senior school boys made up the attendance. On Monday March 10 Mr. Moses spoke on dairy cattle. On Tuesday Mr. F. J. Hudson, of the Dominion Department of Agriculture, spoke on the growing of and the diseases of potatoes. On March 12 Mr. E. A. H. Banks of Guelph discussed horticulture, and on March 13 Mr. F. Simmons, of the Extension Division, Toronto, discussed re-forestation.\n\n\"Mrs. Monture and Mrs. McDiarmid conducted classes in cooking and sewing, which were exceptionally well attended by the women of the reserve and by...\"\nthe senior girls of the school.\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nMr. D. G. McKenzie, United Grain Growers, Winnipeg, Man.;\nRev. Father S. Lajoie, O.M.I., Grouard, Alberta;\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I., Winnipeg, Manitoba;\nRight Rev. H. Belleau, O.M.I., Moosonee, Ont.;\nRev. George Dorey, D.D., United Church Home Missions, Toronto;\nMr. J. A. Marleau, Indian Agent, Sturgeon Falls, Ont.;\nMr. R. McGregor Watt, Dominion Forest Service;\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, June 8, 1941.\n\nMemorandum\n\nDOCTOR MCGILL,\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended May 31, 1941.\n\nWELFARE\n\nThe last figures received from the Treasury Branch indicate that relief and welfare expenditures for the fiscal year 1940-41 will amount to approximately $265,000.44, compared with an expenditure of $384,770.46 for the fiscal year 1939-40. These figures show a decrease in expenditures of approximately $119,769.11. This is the most substantial reduction that has taken place in these expenditures at any time in recent years.\n\nThis reduction can be attributed to better employment conditions in the Dominions, particularly in Eastern Canada. It is noted that relief expenditures at Caughnawaga, Quebec, are approximately 10% of the amount of last year. This reduction can be attributed in part also to constant revision of the relief lists. In Quebec and Ontario these revisions have been worked out by the Indian agents in cooperation with the inspectors, and it is significant that each revision has resulted in substantial savings. The charges made for certain services have also been very carefully checked during the last year. There was a tendency for a time to charge exorbitant prices for Indian burials. As the result of negotiations carried on for almost a whole year, practically all the undertakers providing this service have now decided to accept a maximum charge for each burial not exceeding $25. For a number of years also a custom existed whereby Indians in certain cases were permitted to ship the bodies of their relatives back to the local cemetery on the reserve for burial. A circular was sent out early in the year, in which it was intimated that in a period as critical as the one in which we find ourselves permission to return the bodies of Indians for burial would no longer be given, unless the cost was borne wholly by the immediate relatives of the deceased.\n\nYou are aware that for a number of years certain Indian mothers in the province of Ontario were eligible for allowances under the Mothers' Allowance Act. When I entered the Department, these allowances were borne by the Dominion and Provincial Governments on a fifty-fifty basis. Later, the province of Ontario assumed full responsibility for the payments, and finally, in response to instructions received from the Minister's office,\nthe cost was borne in its entirety by the Welfare Division. It was learned that these allowances led to almost insurmountable administrative difficulties. A mother receiving an allowance, in some cases for two or three children, would continue to receive the allowance after the children had been enrolled at a residential school. These abuses seemed to creep in despite the exercise of the utmost care on the part of the officials. It was decided during the year to discontinue the payment of these regular allowances, to have each case thoroughly investigated by the Indian agent and a relief allowance necessary to maintain the family made by this Division. It was expected that this decision would meet with a great deal of opposition, but at this date no complaint with respect to this change in policy has reached the Department.\n\nMr. Johnston, at my request, prepared during the month a statement of the live stock population of the Prairie Provinces in the year 1932 and a similar statement for the year 1941. I have had a feeling for some time that conditions on Indian reserves in the Prairie Provinces, from the standpoint of agricultural operations, were not wholly satisfactory. The fears I entertained are borne out by the figures now before me. The live stock population for the three provinces, exclusive of horses, for the year 1932 amounted to 1,343 and for the year 1941, 1,011, or a net decrease amounting to 332, whereas it might have been reasonably expected that a normal increase for the period would have resulted in a population of at least 6,000 head of cattle. It is significant that the greatest reductions have taken place, not in the so-called drought-stricken areas, but in the more northerly sections of the provinces. In the Carlton agency, for example, there was a live stock population in 1932 of 1,648 and in 1941 a population of 902. In the province of Saskatchewan the reduction amounts to approximately 50 for the period. On the Blood Reserve, on the other hand, the population in 1932 amounted to 1,764 and in 1941, 1,175. The Blackfoot also shows a slight increase. The significance of these figures becomes apparent when the cost of the annual supply of meat for these provinces is noted. Last year the cost of meat purchased for distribution in the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan from the welfare vote and from band funds amounted to $9,462.70. The figures for Manitoba are not available. These figures do not include purchases of cattle by the Department from Indians; they represent the purchases made by the Department from the large packing houses only. In addition to these purchases, it will be remembered that a year ago we distributed to the Indians of the Prairie Provinces 94 carloads of elk and buffalo meat, received from the Parks Branch.\n\nThese figures, coupled with the collapse of the export market for wheat, must of necessity prompt us to make a greater attempt than has ever been made before to encourage subsistence farming amongst the Indians. I have in mind an agricultural program designed to encourage the Indians to keep cows (beef and dairy type), pigs and poultry. The average Indian, however, is not at this stage prepared to undertake the task that must be undertaken.\nto feed and care for live stock successfully. Reports reaching the Department from time to time indicate that certain bands have been able or abandoning their herds of cattle during the winter months, with the result that the care of these has to be assumed by the Indian agent and the farming instructor. Subsistence farming, in my judgment, will mean constant supervision by the farming instructor, the Indian agent and the inspector. Unless we can be assured of this, any attempt to increase the live stock population in the Prairie Provinces is likely to end in disappointment. We should face the fact that, agriculturally, we are drifting in the Prairie Provinces and that this drifting tendency has been going on for several years and cannot be attributed wholly to existing economic conditions. The fact that a number of our Indian agents have reached an age when they are no longer as active as they once were contributes to the difficulties standing in the way of a reasonable solution of this problem. I find it difficult to persuade myself that a change in policy in respect to the operation of Indian agency farms is likely to affect conditions in any substantial sense. It is significant that where capable Indian agents are in charge conditions are reasonably satisfactory; where we have less inactive agents, however, conditions appear to be deteriorating steadily.\n\nAn attempt has been made, as you know, during the last two or three years to encourage reforestation on a number of eastern reserves. It is gratifying to report that a number of Indian agents are cooperating very effectively with the Department in the extension of this work. Indian Agent Moore, in a report dated May 12, 1941, states:\n\n\"Over 15,000 trees were obtained and planted this spring to continue the policy of reforesting at the Caradoc agency. We used our truck to secure these trees from the provincial nursery station and delivered them direct to the Indian farms. About 4,000 of these young trees were planted on the Soldier Settlement property of the late Charles Beatty. This farm is now operated under agency supervision.\"\n\nIndian Agent Spence, in his report on the Moravian agency, dated May 7, states:\n\n\"I would estimate that close to 3,000 trees were set out by the Indians from the nursery plot. They were all used for windbreaks and hedges around Indian homes. It seems they cannot at this time see the use of setting them out for reforesting purposes, but perhaps they will realize this in the course of time.\"\n\nReports continue to reach the Department from month to month in respect to the work undertaken and accomplished by native women's organizations in the West. Indian Agent Daunt, in his last report, states (May 1, 1941):\n\n\"The three native women's welfare organizations in the Chilliwack area have functioned well and have undoubtedly improved home conditions...\"\non the reserves. If these organizations continue as they have begun, they will be of the greatest assistance in awakening a spirit of domestic competition between Indian households, the result of which will be vastly improved living conditions and this, too, by the Indians' own efforts.\n\nTRAINING\n\nEarly in April it was decided to have Mr. A. J. Doucet visit the residential schools of Alberta, with the object of organizing worthwhile vocational and manual training courses at these institutions. Mr. Doucet's visit represents the first attempt ever made by the Department to organize courses at Indian residential schools, proportionately balanced between academic and vocational studies and based on the actual needs of the Indian population. For reasons that I find it difficult to explain, our schools in Alberta were, and have been for years, pursuing courses of study almost wholly academic in character. Arrangements were made whereby Mr. Doucet was able to meet Inspector Barry at Kootenay during the course of his trip and thus he had an opportunity to discuss with our Inspector of Schools for British Columbia the details of an Indian educational program that might be encouraged by the Department and adapted to the needs of the period in which we are living. Mr. Doucet at this date has visited a number of the schools in the southern sections of the province and will continue his work in Alberta until the end of the present academic year. Reports received from the Indian agents indicate that his work has been eminently satisfactory. Indian Agent Goderhan, in his report dated May 5, on the Blackfoot Agency, states:\n\n\"The highlight of this month was the arrival of Mr. Doucet, and I think I can go further and say that it is the first real practical move to get some real results for the large expenditure made in the education of Indian children. The program of work which Mr. Doucet has indicated might be followed is excellent and I am sure will receive the endorsement of every Indian agent and principal who is at all interested in this work. The program gets our complete support and the idea of turning our boarding schools into technical institutions for Indians is one that appeals to us and, I believe, will appeal to the Indian parents also. It is hoped that the necessary financial aid to make readjustments will be forthcoming. The writer visited both institutions on this reserve and discussed the program generally with the principals and Mr. Doucet; he was a welcome guest at both schools. Health and general conditions at the schools were normally good\".\n\nInspector Gordon Young, in his report on the\nMount Elgin Residential School (U.C.) dated March 27-28, 1941, states:\n\n\"At this institution, in addition to the academic training, which is my special field for inspection, much valuable vocational instruction is given.\n\n(a) The girls are trained in sewing, cooking, serving meals and general housekeeping. These activities were all inspected. The work is very practical in character, being that required in the management of the institution. All girls appear to have a share in this management. Dormitories, sewing room, kitchen, dining room and dairy are in good condition.\n\n(b) Several older girls who do not attend the academic classes are receiving special training in sewing; very good work was on exhibition.\n\n(c) The boys receive their vocational training in the general management of the farm garden, orchard and barns and in the workshop. In the shop, elementary wood and metal work is practised. A valuable project this winter was the repairing of automobile engines. Under the supervision of Mr. Johnston, the boys took an engine apart, cleaned and repaired it and re-assembled it so that it gives satisfactory service.\n\nIn previous reports the character training, social instruction, musical and literary activities have been mentioned. These continue to form a valuable part of the work of this school.\"\n\nAbout a year ago Bishop Lepellet discussed with the officials the desirability of organizing a vocational course for the senior girls at the Ground Residential School. The Bishop was of the opinion that a number of the girls graduating from the school, usually at the age of 13, were altogether too young and too immature to undertake the responsibilities that life imposes in that northern section of Alberta. The officials here were equally convinced that it would be a mistake to keep girls in school above regular age unless engaged in studies of a vocational character. The result was a compromise whereby the Bishop undertook to provide a vocational course for the senior girls by way of experiment. Indian Agent L'Heureux comments on this work in his report for the month of April. The Agent states:\n\n\"The pupils of the domestic school at Ground are doing excellent work. At the time of my visit they had made 63 complete boys' suits and had them packed, ready to be sent to the Jeussart School. Sister Rustache, who is in charge of this work, told me that these suits had been made within a month's time, in addition to other work. These girls also take lessons...\"\nin cooking, washing, ironing, knitting and all kinds of fancy-work. I was very much interested in the practical cooking lessons given to them. These lessons include meat curing, smoking and canning meat, sausage making, etc. These girls also learn to take care of milk and cream and are given instruction in butter-making. These senior pupils have been picked from Jeausure, Sturgeon Lake, Babasa, Fort Vermillion and Grouard Residential Schools. There are 13 of them.\"\n\nBishop Lavalois is now anxious to undertake a somewhat similar experiment with a group of senior boys. I regret to state, however, that the limited funds at our disposal will scarcely permit him to undertake this experiment for the time being at least.\n\nThe following is an extract from the annual report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1941, from J. M. Burns, teacher of the Chehalis Indian Day School, New Westminster Agency, B. C. This report has been sent forward to the Department by Indian Agent Daunt. I am of the opinion that it should be included in my report for the simple reason that it presents a point of view that is somewhat unusual and emphasizes certain facts that this teacher has apparently learned from his contacts with the Indians - facts that are apt to be overlooked by officials accustomed to dealing with educational problems in the abstract-\n\n\"ques. What community work is done by the teacher apart from regular school work - give details?\n\n\"Ans. Fifteen years ago this reserve was one of the toughest and most degraded, down-at-the-heel reserves in British Columbia. Today it is one of the best regulated in the Province. No drinking, morals fairly good, 15 out of 24 houses compare favourably with the houses of whites throughout the Fraser Valley in regard to cleanliness and furniture. The old Indian customs and way of life are finished here. Indian basketry should be discouraged - it has made slaves of their women and children, ruined their health and encouraged laziness in their men-folk. Here the so-called \"Art\" is fading out rapidly. Basketry work of Indian women who have T.B. should be disinfected as the cedar strands are pulled through the mouth of the basket maker.\n\n\"ques. Do the parents show interest in the education of their children?\n\n\"Ans. None. They have no appreciation for anything they do not pay for. Indian schools will always be a sort of joke with the average Indian until he pays for their upkeep.\"\n\"Ques. Is mid-day meal served?\nAns. No. Indian children are better fed here than white children. It will pay the Indian to remain a parasite while he is hand-fed by the Department. We do not want the 'mid-day meal' racket started here.\n\n\"Ques. Is there a regularly appointed janitor and if so, state name?\nAns. No janitor. Here, we dispensed with janitor service at the outbreak of war. The boys do the work.\"\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nRev. C. F. Hives, Principal, Shingwauk Residential School, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.;\nMr. J M. Farrell, Indian Agent, Golden Lake, Ont.;\nVery Rev. U Langlois, O.M.I., Bishop of Grizard, Alberta;\nJ C Davis, Esq., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nSupt of Welfare and Training.\nOttawa,\nJune 30, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCGILL,\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended June 30, 1941.\n\nWELFARE\n\nThe following represent the per capita welfare and relief expenditures worked out on a provincial basis for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1941:\n\n| Province            | Expenditure |\n|---------------------|-------------|\n| Prince Edward Island| $23.85      |\n| Nova Scotia         | $38.73      |\n| New Brunswick       | $26.64      |\n| Quebec              | $15.76      |\n| Ontario             | $4.20       |\n| Manitoba            | $6.45       |\n| Saskatchewan        | $7.87       |\n| Alberta             | $5.64       |\n| British Columbia    | $4.88       |\n| Northwest Territories| $6.19     |\n| Yukon               | $6.33       |\n\nSomewhat similar figures worked out on an agency basis show a range in expenditures from a per capita outlay of $94.19 in King's County, N.S., to disbursements amounting to 1s per capita in the Cape Croker and Christian Island Agencies, Ontario.\n\nI have, on more than one occasion, expressed the opinion that relief and welfare expenditures in British Columbia had reached a figure that represented, in my judgment, the lowest figure that one might reasonably expect. This expression of opinion is supported by the per capita costs in this province during the last three or four years. Despite a substantial improvement in employment conditions in British Columbia this year the per capita relief costs show a very slight reduction to $4.58 this year as against $4.55 for the fiscal year 1939-40.\n\nRelief costs in the Sioux Lookout and James Bay Agencies, Ontario, remain high and amounted to $51,084.58 out of a total expenditure of $186,471.58 for the province.\n\nThe destructive forest fires that have been raging during the month in certain sections of Northern Quebec and Ontario have no doubt resulted in the impairment\nof a great many Indian hunting grounds and in the destruction of a certain amount of Indian property. Indian Agent A. de la Boissiere, Pointe Bleue, in a letter dated June 14, states:\n\n\"As you are undoubtedly aware, the large forest fires which are now burning in the Lake St. John district have destroyed several Indian camps on their hunting grounds as well as their hunting equipment which they had not time to transport to a safe place. Fortunately, however, I have not received any report so far that anyone has suffered injuries or has disappeared. All the Indians who are desirous of earning money have been hired by the various lumber companies to fight the fires.\"\n\nIn a recent letter received from Indian Agent Daley he states:\n\n\"During May a very large majority of the Indian men and women have been employed in Michigan. For your information I would also like to state that for the past nine months the Indians of Walpole Island have received in wages from the Chris-Craft Corporation $18,985.00.\"\n\nThis represents per capita earnings for this band amounting to slightly over $23.00.\n\nReports reaching this Branch indicate that a sincere attempt has been made by our Indian Agents in the Prairie Provinces to substantially reduce wheat acreage on the reserves. Indian Agent Gooderham, in his report dated June 4, states:\n\n\"Practically all farms were seeded in good time to both wheat and oats. A total of approximately 4000 acres was seeded to wheat, a reduction of over 2300 acres over 1940, with a total of 2500 acres of oats seeded, an increase over last year of 1700 acres. Besides this 50 acres of Alfalfa were seeded, with oats as a nurse crop, and, of course, there is quite an acreage of Crested Wheat Grass and Rye which was seeded last fall. On the whole, the land has been better tilled and better worked than for many years.\"\n\nIndian Agent Booth, in his report dated June 5, refers again to the effective work undertaken and accomplished by the members of the Home-Maker's Club. The Agent states:\n\n\"The Home-Maker's Club on the Assiniboine Reserve is making very good progress and all the members have been provided with garden seeds and in cases where the Indians could not plow their own gardens the Farming Instructor arranged to have this work done for them. In every case the members agreed to plant a large garden. The work accomplished in the club room is of great benefit to all concerned and I am more convinced than ever that a real Home-Maker's Club is a great boon to Indian women and these clubs should receive all the encouragement they can get from every source.\"\nThe Indian Agent concludes:\n\n\"All the seeding operations on the Community Farms are completed and work has now commenced on the summer-fallow. I may say that the work on these farms is first-class and should produce better than the average crop, with a number of the Indians working on these farms at various times and should be able to see for themselves how farming should be carried on and also the results of cultivating and seeding at the proper time. In this way these farms should prove to be a good object lesson to all our Indian farmers.\"\n\nIndian Agent MacCutecheon of Fredericton, in his report dated June 2, 1941, states:\n\n\"As you are probably aware, the month of May is our big fiddlehead month, and this year it has been a huge success. During the past few years I have endeavoured to introduce this delectable green to the large canning industries and most decidedly was rewarded this year. The Macready Pickling Company in Saint John are buying tons of them, also retailers in the Saint John market. The Indians of Oromocto, St. Mary's and Kingsclear are receiving the greater returns. Some families have received cash for the month's picking to the value of from $100.00 to $150.00. The price was good and the supply plentiful.\n\n\"Clothing recently received from the Department, and shoes purchased locally, have been distributed.\"\n\nIndian Agent McPherson, Clamdeboye, in his report dated June 11, states:\n\n\"I spent some time on the Brokenhead Reserve seeing that the Indians put in their crops and they are all taking quite an interest in the land that was broken for them. We have put in half the crop in wheat and half in oats. The wheat which they threshed on the reserve last year kept the Indians who had land in crop in flour all winter but they were short of oats for feed. This year, however, they should have plenty of oats for feed and plenty of wheat for flour. The Indians who had land broken a year ago have been asked to finance their own seed requirements this year and pay all other expenses. When the land was broken last year the department supplied the seed but the Indians have been all instructed that they must finance their farming operations after the first year.\"\nTRAINING\n\nYou may remember that an unusually large number of Indian day school teachers resigned at the close of the last academic year. It was expected that a somewhat similar condition might develop this year. It is gratifying to report, however, that comparatively few resignations from teachers have reached the Division at this date. It is encouraging to report also that we have experienced little difficulty in securing fully qualified teachers for the vacancies that have occurred.\n\nI have expressed the opinion, on more than one occasion, that a large number of our Indian day schools have reached a standard of accomplishment equal to the best one-roomed public schools throughout the Dominion. I make this statement despite the average Indian pupil's limited knowledge of English and the time of enrolment and attendance statistics which have never been wholly satisfactory. Year after year, however, we note from Inspectors' reports a steadily increasing number of pupils who have succeeded in passing their Entrance examinations.\n\nInspector W.J. Greening, in his report on the Goulais Bay Indian Day School dated June 3, states:\n\n\"Miss Fox has had much experience in Indian schools and understands Indian conditions well. She is doing good work at Goulais Bay. If I were asked to mention a school visited by me in which the results of careful teaching of health and personal cleanliness were most apparent, this would be one of the very first schools that would come to my mind.\"\n\nThe Goulais Bay School has at this date an enrolment of 20 pupils.\n\nInspector Greening, in his report dated June 6 on the Garden River senior room, states:\n\n\"I have asked the local High School Entrance Board to consider granting Entrance standing on recommendation to three or four of the Grade VIII pupils of this school. I feel sure that the work that has been done warrants this consideration.\"\n\nThe teacher of this school, Miss Julia Mary Goody, has a first-class Ontario certificate and has had 16 years' teaching experience, 7 of which have been spent in Indian day schools.\n\nInspector Greening, in his report on the Buzwah School dated May 27, states:\n\n\"This is a splendid little school. The teacher in charge is a little Indian lady, the product...\"\nof the Indian schools, and a product that the Department might be very proud of indeed. If she were teaching in a white school I should urge most strongly that she be given an increase in salary as a recognition of work well done.\"\n\nThe teacher of this school, Miss Christina Wakegijig, has a first-class, Ontario certificate and has been in charge of Indian day schools for a period of 6 years.\n\nInspector J.M. Gane, in his report on the Cape Croker No. 1 Indian Day School dated May 30, states:\n\n\"The new teacher is undoubtedly capable and conscientious. The pupils co-operate harmoniously and in general are proficient in their studies. It is most encouraging to the Inspector to find that even with an enrolment of 46, and an organization of 9 classes, much better than average progress has been made at this school. This enrolment constitutes a heavy burden for one teacher and one which no one should be expected to carry for a protracted period of time.\n\n\"The Grade VIII class of three girls was examined in some detail. Two of the pupils are quite outstanding and will be recommended for High School without writing the Departmental Examination. The third was also recommended as she is certainly not weak but a decision on this point will not be made until after the teacher's final examination this week.\n\n\"There is at this school a large Grade VII class which will constitute a good entrance class next year.\n\n\"Splendid work in manual training, sewing, knitting and other types of craft work has been carried on.\n\n\"The pupils are extremely polite and have a very good sense of humour.\"\n\nThe teacher in charge of this school, Miss Louise Cattle, has an Ontario, permanent, first-class certificate and has had 10 years' teaching experience, 9 of which have been spent in Indian day schools.\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nRev. Geo. Dorey, D.D., United Church Home Missions, Toronto;\n\nMr. Martin, East Kildonan, Man.;\nMr. Geo. Wood, M.P., for Brant, Ont.;\nMr. Jack Davis, Winnipeg, Man.;\nMr. J.A. Marleau, Indian Agent, Sturgeon Falls, Ont.;\nRev. C.F. Hives, Principal, Shingwauk Home, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.;\nRt. Rev. H. Belleau, O.M.I., Moosonee, Ont.\n\nH.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMemorandum:\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the welfare and training service for the month ended July 31, 1941.\n\nTRAINING:\n\nDespite the fact that our Indian residential schools are closed during the months of July and August and our Indian day schools during the months of July, August and September, these months are in many respects the busiest months of the year in the Training Division. Supplies are sent out at this period to the 75 residential schools and 28 day schools. These supplies consist of textbooks, supplementary readers, chalk, lead pencils, scribblers, drinking cups, etc., and athletic equipment. Difficulty is always experienced in securing a list of these supplies from certain schools. This is particularly true of schools where there have been changes in the teaching staff. These supplies are purchased through the Stationery Office and usually shipped by freight. Repairs to schools are also undertaken at this season of the year. It is at this time also that we re-engage teachers and a point new teachers for vacancies that have occurred at the end of the academic year. It is perhaps unfortunate, but apparently unavoidable, that this additional work should occur during the holiday season when a number of the members of the regular staff are absent on their annual vacation. With our day schools operating on a 9 month rather than a 10 month basis, it is of the utmost importance that textbooks and school supplies should arrive at our schools prior to the opening of the schools on the first of October.\n\nThe Ontario Horticultural Association and the Provincial Rural School Improvement Association of Ontario have for a number of years sponsored a contest aimed at the general improvement of rural schools and rural school grounds in the province. This competition, it would appear, is organized on a county basis. This year 14 rural schools in Brant County entered the competition. It is very gratifying to be able to report that the first and second prizes were won by Indian day schools on the Six Nations Reserve. The first prize was won by the No. 5 School and the second, by the No. 9 School on the Six Nations Reserve. The teacher at the former school is Miss Nora Jamieson and at the latter, Miss Julia Jamieson. Major Bundle, in a letter dated -\ndated June 26, states:\n\n\"As you will see by the attached cutting from the Brantford Expositor, two of our schools - No. 5 and No. 2 - succeeded in winning the first two places in the County School Improvement Competition. I am sure you will be gratified that our own schools can achieve such splendid results in competition with others, and success certainly does bring credit to Indian administration.\n\n\"It is a pity that you cannot see both of these schools, for really the teachers and the children have done wonders with the grounds, flower beds, etc. The winning school is really a picture of colour, care and tidiness.\n\n\"Many thanks also for your share in our success, as but for your kindly interest when down here last and the provision you made to permit me to obtain paint, shrubs and screenings, much of the improvement carried out so eagerly by the children and the teachers could not have been carried out.\n\n\"Miss Nora Jamieson's school will now be in running for the provincial competition.\"\n\nThe following comment on the closing of our Indian day schools in the southwestern agency of New Brunswick recently appeared in the Fredericton Gleaner:\n\n\"The closing exercises of the Woodstock Indian Day School were held on Friday morning, June 27th. An interesting programme of songs and lessons was carried out by the pupils. A prize for highest general standing was awarded to Reginald Paul, Grade IV. Prizes for the highest averages were awarded to Eugene Polichies, Grade VI; Albert Paul, Grade V; Donna Paul, Grade II; Peter Polichies, Grade I.\n\n\"Each girl was presented with a dress and apron and the boys, with sweaters which were made during the term by the pupils under the direction of Sister Emilliana. A delightful display of weaving materials was on exhibition. Prizes were presented and pupils addressed by Mr. McCutcheon, who congratulated them on the year's work and encouraged them to keep up their good standing and expressed deep satisfaction with the work of the Sisters, not only in the school, but among the girls, and families of the Reserve.\n\n\"At the Kingsclear Indian Day School a delightful programme was carried out, which consisted of a review of lessons, patriotic songs and recitations. In attendance was Mrs. A. Pierce Crockett and Mrs. G. I. Currier of Fredericton, who presented...\"\ntwo books to the school on behalf of the I.O.D.E., Mrs. Crocket making the presentation. Prizes were presented to the following by Rev. Father Harris, parish priest: Norren Tomah, Ronald Tomah, Miles Tomah and Edythe Polchies.\n\n\"The closing of the St. Mary's Indian Day School, near Devon, took the form of a review of the school work and also patriotic songs, which were exceptionally well rendered. The pupils making the highest averages were: Grade I, Shirley Brooks; Grade II, Norma Polchies; Grade IV, Clarence Paul; Grade V, Tina Meuse; Grade VII, Harold Sappier and Billy Brooks. Mrs. MacElligott, the teacher, and the pupils were congratulated on their splendid showing by Mrs. W. F. Blair and Mrs. R. L. MacCutcheon.\n\n\"The closing exercises of the Oromocto Indian School were held on Friday morning, June 27th. An interesting programme of songs, recitations and lessons was carried out by the pupils. A prize for highest general standing was awarded to James Atwin, Grade VII. A prize for perfect attendance was won by Mary Ann Atwin. In the absence of the Indian Agent, Mr. R. Lee MacCutcheon, the school was addressed by Miss Mary McElroy, N.H., who expressed her regrets that Mr. MacCutcheon was unable to attend and congratulated the pupils on their year's work and encouraged them to keep up their good standing. Miss McElroy also made fitting remarks to James Atwin's achievement in winning honourable mention in the recent Forestry Contest for the elementary schools of New Brunswick.\"\n\nMr. Doucet has been engaged since his return from Alberta in the preparation of a course of study designed to meet the needs of the Indian pupils in attendance at our Indian residential schools in Alberta. This program, which emphasizes more fully than the provincial program the importance of manual training and health exercises, will be adopted by the schools at the opening of the academic year on September first.\n\nWELFARE:\n\nThe statement of welfare expenditures supplied monthly by the Treasury Department indicates that there has been a steady reduction in relief expenditures for the period April 1 - June 30 - the net decrease for the period amounting to $118,274.31. I am disposed to think that while a steady reduction in these expenditures has been taking place, the net decrease has been substantially less than this figure. You may remember that at the end of the fiscal year 1939-40 there were unpaid accounts amounting to approximately $70,000, while at the end of the fiscal year 1940-41 practically all our outstanding accounts were paid. This fact modifies to some extent -\nextent the figures appearing in the last Treasury statement.\n\nI am attaching hereto, for your information, a graph showing the total Indian income from all sources for the period March, 1915, to March, 1933, inclusive. This graph, which has been carefully prepared by Mr. Fast, is self-explanatory. It will be noted that Indian income during the year 1933 was less than it was at the end of the fiscal year 1915 and approximately one-half the amount of Indian income in the year 1920. It is gratifying to note that there has been a steady increase in this income during the last three or four years.\n\nMr. Christianson, in his report on the Kinistino Reserve dated July 15, 1941, states:\n\n\"I wish to point out that we have had farming instructors on this reserve for a great number of years. To the best of my knowledge, practically no results were attained. Since Mr. Gardner was appointed school teacher and farming instructor a great change has taken place. The work accomplished by these people is really outstanding and Mr. and Mrs. Gardner should be complimented on the results they have attained during the last 3 years. Mrs. Gardner does a lot of work amongst the Indian women, which is certainly a step in the right direction, and, as I have said before, she also helps with the school and outside work. Regarding sickness, Mr. and Mrs. Gardner have saved the Branch a lot of money in doctoring Indians themselves instead of sending for a doctor for every illness. Now a doctor is only called when actually required. If there is any way of giving Mr. Gardner an increase in salary, no man that I know deserves it more than he does. At the present time he is receiving $1,000 a year, and I am sure if something was done to show that the work he and his wife are doing is appreciated by our Branch, it would bring about even better results.\n\n\"The homes on this reserve are primitive, being regular Indian shacks with mud floors and mud roofs. However, since Mr. Gardner's arrival a number of these shacks have been floored. The Indians took out a number of logs during the winter, to be sawn into lumber for improving the buildings. During my visit the Indians were all living in tents.\"\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nRev. C. F. Hives, Principal, Shingwauk Home, Sault Ste. Marie,\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I., Winnipeg, Man.,\n\nD. G. McKenzie,\n\nRev. Father P. A. Charron, O.M.I., Blood Res. School, Cardston,\n\nA. H. Fleury, St. Mary's Res. School, Mission, B.C.,\n\nMr. V. M. Eastwood, Indian Agent, Peterboro, Ont.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, September 1, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR McGILL,\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended August 31, 1941.\n\nWELFARE.\n\nAn Indian Arts and Craft Exhibit was organized and placed on display at the Canadian National Exhibition under the direction of Miss Kathleen Moodie. This is the third consecutive exhibit that has been organized by the Department and placed on display at Toronto. Miss Moodie, in commenting upon the exhibit of this year, in a letter dated August 28, 1941, states:\n\n\"Our 'Hand-coven' Room is really very effective and appears to attract more attention than our 'Soldier' window of last year. Our little Pottery demonstration is also interesting, and I think Ethel Moses is really going to develop a marketable line of pottery. Several wholesale dealers are already asking for prices and quantities available, including Valentine-Black. A number of American buyers are fairly climbing over the walls in their efforts to pin us down to delivering minimum quantities of basketry and carvings. The possibilities for a tremendous business appear to be in sight. We sold $185 worth of goods the first day and over $300 worth yesterday. This, I consider not bad for the two opening days\".\n\nEmployment conditions throughout the Dominion appear to be such that the average able bodied Indian has experienced little difficulty in securing remunerative employment during the spring and summer months. Mr. H. W. McCracken, Acting Indian Agent, Caradoc Agency, in his report dated August 7, states:\n\n\"Employment such as fruit picking, harvesting of grain and other varieties of work off the reserves is very plentiful. We have been experiencing difficulty in obtaining suitable Indian labourers to assist us in our agency welfare operations. This is due to the fact that the wages we pay do not compare favourably with those paid by white employers. We may be forced to increase our wages during the next month. Relief is now reduced to a minimum; only sick and aged people need assistance\".\n\nIndian Agent Howe, Stuart Lake Agency, B. C., in his report dated August 6, states:\n\n\"A visit was made by me to reserves along the Stuart, Trembleur and Takla waterways, using the agency boat\n\nTakulli -\n\"Takulli\", this being my first visit for the season. These reserves are almost deserted by adult male Indians. Work is plentiful and the Indians are taking advantage of the prevailing high wages. In fact, Indian labour is at a premium. Numerous requests for farm help continue to pour into the agency office; $2.50 per day and board is offered.\n\nIndian Agent Down, of the Sarnia Agency, in a report dated August 7, states:\n\n\"There is a great tendency at this time among our Indians to reduce their agricultural efforts, a natural trend, I suppose, when other industries are offering them from 50\u00a2 to $1.50 per hour. Their motto appears to be to make hay while the sun shines. I am endeavouring to educate our people to the inevitable post-war period and to impress upon their minds the after effects of 1914-18 and that it might be well to retain their interest in agriculture. What effect this instruction has, however, on the Indian mind with its philosophy of \"live today, let tomorrow take care of itself\", one cannot tell. An earnest effort will be made to keep the present acreage under cultivation.\"\n\nCrop conditions on Indian reserves throughout the Dominion appear to vary from exceptionally good crops on certain reserves in Manitoba, to reasonably good crops in southern Alberta and poor crops in certain sections of Carlton, Duck Lake and Touchwood agencies in Saskatchewan.\n\nIndian Agent Davis, in his report dated August 8, states:\n\n\"Crop conditions are very bad, owing to the extreme dry weather. The yield will be very small and is estimated at about 8 bushels per acre for wheat. The Sandy Lake Reserve is, however, an exception. The crop there should yield about 20 bushels. There appears to be an area extending from the Birtle Agency in Manitoba to the Onion Lake Agency in Saskatchewan, approximately 60 miles in depth, which will this year experience its eighth successive crop failure. This area appears to be quite extensive in the Duck Lake agency, where conditions from the standpoint of crop production and opportunities for employment are extremely discouraging.\"\n\nI have expressed regret on more than one occasion at our failure to encourage worthwhile handicraft projects on reserves other than a few reserves in Ontario and Quebec. Reports reaching the Department from time to time, however, suggest that a number of comparatively small worthwhile projects have developed without departmental assistance at certain agencies in the Maritimes. Mr. E. H. Bertho, in his audit report on the New Brunswick Southwestern Agency, states:\n\n\"According to the Agent, some of the Indians are engaged in the making of handicraft articles which in most cases are marketed by themselves. They are not in receipt of assistance by way of advances from the Department. The Agent takes orders at his office for baskets, axe handles, etc., from local people. In such cases the money is collected at the agency and paid over to the Indian producers. During the last year, $301.54 was handled by the Agent and recorded in the cash-book.\"\nTRAINING.\n\nIn my report of last month I intimated that Mr. Doucet had been engaged since his return from Alberta in the preparation of a course of study designed to meet the needs of the Indian pupils in attendance at the residential schools in Alberta visited by him. This course of study has now been completed and will reach the Principals prior to the opening of the 1941-42 academic year. This course of study represents an attempt to extend still further manual training at our schools. Mr. Doucet defines Manual Training as \"All work done by the hands: woodwork, metal work, farm work, gardening, cattle raising, farm mechanics, leather work, sewing, knitting, housekeeping, laundry work, cooking, etc.\" Mr. Doucet, in his general report dated April 13, states:\n\n\"The girls at the schools visited by me are receiving good training in manual arts. If the teachers in charge had clear objectives and the pupils proper motivation, the benefits of this training would be greatly increased. This was apparent in the knitting activities at the school where Junior Red Cross work was organized.\"\n\nReferring to the boys, Mr. Doucet states:\n\n\"The boys are receiving comparatively little manual training and appear to have the wrong attitude toward this particular branch of study. Many of them appear to detest manual training. This work, throughout the activities of the school, should be dovetailed with classroom studies. It would be very desirable to have boys' supervisors and boys' teachers with ability to train their students in General Shop work, to organize sports and to promote physical training\".\n\nEducationists in their comments on the work accomplished by educational institutions on the North American Continent, have frequently expressed regret that few female teachers had been attracted to the teaching profession. Male teachers are indispensable in the senior grades if the pupils in attendance at our schools are to receive an adequate and well balanced education. It is just possible that Mr. Doucet in his report on the schools in Alberta has placed his finger on one of the weak spots in our educational set-up. It would certainly appear that men are necessary to give instruction in what he refers to as Manual Training and to supervise the physical development of the pupils, particularly the boys. There are few branches of educational effort more worth while than well organized and well supervised athletic contests. Such contests, however, without male supervision, are of little value in the development of character. Here we encounter a real problem and a problem for which it will be somewhat difficult to find a solution for the time being at least.\n\nThere has been a steady decline in the number of male teachers at Indian day schools since the outbreak of the war. There are comparatively few young, able-bodied teachers in charge of Indian day schools anywhere in the Dominion at this date. It is likely that we shall experience difficulty -\ndifficulty also in finding fully qualified female teachers to take charge of our schools this year. At this date there are about 15 schools for which teachers have not yet been secured, despite the fact that positions in a number of districts have been offered to married women with professional qualifications.\n\nReports from the West indicate that in view of the prevalence of Infantile Paralysis a large number of public schools may not re-open on the regular opening date on September 2nd. The desirability of keeping our residential schools closed in the Prairie Provinces for the month of September, at least, has been discussed very fully with the Acting Superintendent of Medical Services. It is Dr. Moore's opinion - and with this opinion I am fully in accord - that Indian pupils would be less exposed to the ravages of this disease if permitted to enrol at residential schools, where they can be kept under strict medical supervision and where medical services are readily available. I am now in receipt of a telegram from Dr. Indsor, in which he states that the Public Health Board of the Province of Alberta has issued an order preventing the re-opening or operation of any school in the province, other than educational institutions where the students in attendance are 17 years of age or over. Dr. Moore is now of the opinion that in view of this order Indian day and residential schools in the province should remain closed and has so notified Dr. Indsor. The Principals of our other schools will be notified in due course.\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nDr. G. Fred McNally, Deputy Minister of Education for Alberta.\nOttawa, October 1, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR McILL.\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended September 30, 1941.\n\nI visited Toronto in the week ending September 8 and while in the city Mr. Allan and I visited the Ontario Department of Game and Fisheries and discussed with the Deputy Minister of the Department, Mr. Taylor, ways and means of securing areas suitable for the propagation of beaver and other fur-bearing animals in the Sioux Lookout and James Bay agencies. You will recall to mind that these negotiations formed the basis of a discussion at a conference called by the Minister a few days ago.\n\nI also visited the Canadian National Exhibition and spent the major portion of two afternoons at the Indian Handicraft exhibit, organized and placed on display by Miss Moodie. I was assured during my stay there that the Indian exhibit was again one of the most attractive, if not the most attractive, exhibit on the fair grounds. The attendance during my visits was all that one might desire. I was particularly interested in the number of boys and girls of school age who were in attendance and who appeared to take a keen interest in the Indian dances and in the display of handicraft. I was impressed by the amount of work necessary in the organization and promotion of this exhibit. This year, in addition to Miss Moodie, Mrs. Lockwood, Miss Davis, Mr. Elliott Moses and Mr. W. Atkins, 30 Indians were employed. Miss Moodie informed me that the members of the staff had been called upon to work 15 hours a day for a period of three weeks, Sundays included.\n\nThe Canadian National Exhibition Commission provides excellent space for our exhibit in the National Industries building, facing on the courtyard used by the Provincial Department of Lands and Forests for their wild life exhibit. This wild life exhibit provides an ideal setting for the display of Indian handicraft products.\n\nThe sales at the exhibit this year amounted to $5,300, between $200 and $300 more than the sales of last -\nof last year. Miss Moodie assures me that the number of sales this year was considered greater than a year ago but that many of the people visiting the exhibition this year were of a class who were interested in cheap souvenirs rather than in the better and higher priced lines.\n\nIn view of the fact that the demand for handicraft products is at the present time substantially greater than the supply, it is just possible that the advertising and publicity for which the Toronto exhibit has been responsible may be no longer necessary and that the time required for the organization of this display might be spent more profitably in the organization of handicraft projects on Indian reserves.\n\nAn encouraging report has reached the Department on the handicraft exhibit organized and placed on display at the Vancouver Exhibition. Indian Agent Ball, in his report dated September 3, 1941, states:\n\n\"I have the honour to report that the Canada Pacific exhibition closed September 1. The Indian exhibit was smaller than usual, as the space was limited, but I am pleased to report that it was an unqualified success and was most favourably commented upon. I am advised that approximately two thousand dollars' worth of Indian handicraft products was sold during the 7 days the exhibition was open. This is much more than the sales in previous years, in spite of the smaller display and the atrocious weather most of the week. We were given a better location this year and more people visited our section of the exhibition. One booth was set aside for articles donated by various Indians to be sold for the B.C. Spitfire Fund. Miss Gerry, the travelling nurse, was chiefly responsible for these donations, and if she had been here during the exhibition I think this booth would have been even more successful.\"\n\nReports received from Indian agents indicate that little difficulty has been experienced by Indians in securing employment at good wages during the spring and summer months. Indian Agent Highgate, of the Moravian Agency, Highgate, Ont., in his report dated September 3, states:\n\n\"All available Indians of this reserve are employed in tobacco harvesting at good wages, the average being $4.00 per day.\"\n\nIndian Agent McNaughton, St. Regis Agency, in his report of September 2, states:\n\n\"Employment during the month seems to be at a fairly high level. As usual our Indians are generally employed on the American side.\"\nThe basket shop at Chenaill has shown an increase in the number of workers during the latter part of the month.\n\nIndian Agent Lockhart, Fort Frances Agency, in his report for September, refers to the number of Indians of his agency who have secured employment on provincial lands, cutting and peeling pulpwood. The Agent adds:\n\n\"With the scarcity of white labour in the district, there is plenty of this work available.\"\n\nAlthough crop failures have been very much in evidence on a number of reserves in the Prairie Provinces, reports to hand suggest that work off the reserves has been plentiful. Indian Agent Booth, of the Qu'Appelle Agency, states:\n\n\"All the Indians who are not employed on the reserves are able to find all the harvest work they want at wages around $2.75 per day.\"\n\nIndian Agent McPherson, in his report of August, refers to an attempt made by him to secure employment for a number of his Indians with the Fish Companies operating on Lake Winnipeg, and states:\n\n\"I have arranged with the fish buyers to purchase the entire catch of the Bloodvein Indians. This band of Indians fish on a small commercial scale. A number of Indians from Berens River Reserve have come south for the harvest.\"\n\nWork also appears plentiful on the Pacific coast. Indian Agent Moore, of the Cowichan Agency, reports:\n\n\"Generally speaking, work was plentiful during the month and no unemployment was noticed except in the case of old men who are really past the working age. Many of the Indians did not return from the U.S.A. since they went there picking berries in May last. I understand they got seasonal employment all summer and will stay over for hop-picking. In fact I don't look for them to return before October.\"\n\nIndian Agent Daunt, New Westminster Agency,\nin his last report, states:\n\n\"Employment opportunities have been satisfactory during the month. Many logging camps are operating in the district. Harvesting work has been in progress on farms, commercial fishing fairly active and the various hop-fields opened their season on the 25th of August.\"\n\nTRAINING\n\nWe have found it exceedingly difficult to secure the number of fully qualified teachers necessary to operate our Indian day schools throughout the Dominion. However, we have received valuable cooperation from the churches in securing a number of teachers for the more remote schools in the northern districts of the Dominion. We have at this date failed to secure teachers for the following schools: Christian Island R.C.; Metagami; Mud Lake; River Settlement and Lower French River. In addition to these vacancies, we have been compelled to keep in our service a number of teachers whose services appeared to be unsatisfactory throughout the year. The evidence before us at the moment would indicate that it will be simply impossible to secure male teachers for our schools while employment is available in war industries. The only exceptions will be young men who are prepared to link up their teaching duties with missionary effort under the auspices and direction of one of the churches.\n\nIt is gratifying to report that despite the decision of the Department to operate Indian day schools on a 9 month rather than a 10 month basis, a number of schools opened early in September. The Restigouche (4 room) School opened on September 1, and the Caughnawaga School, on September 15. In addition to these, it is altogether likely that a comparatively large number of our schools opened early in the month and that the reports on the operation of these schools will reach us in due course. The Maria (2 room) School will operate this year under the direction of the Sisters of the Holy Rosary of Rimouski. The Maria Indians are, as you know, one of the most backward groups of Indians in the Dominion. Relief costs at this reserve during the last fiscal year amounted to $86.35 per capita as compared with a provincial per capita cost of $12.78. It is our intention to organize at this school a well balanced vocational and academic course. Two Sisters have been employed by the Department but a third Sister, although not on our payroll, is residing at the school and has assumed responsibility for the teaching of domestic science,\u2014cooking, sewing, fruit preserving, the repair of discarded military clothing, etc. If we succeed in securing the services of a farming instructor it is our intention to organize a worthwhile course\u2014\ncourse in elementary agriculture, gardening, crop rotation, etc., for the boys in attendance at this school.\n\nThe Dominion Council of Education held a conference at the Lord Elgin Hotel early in the month. This conference consisted of the deputy ministers of Education for the nine provinces, certain members of their staffs and the professors in charge of the faculties of education at a number of the universities throughout the country. A number of these deputy ministers visited our handicraft shop-room and were deeply interested in arts and crafts from a pedagogical standpoint. Several of them expressed amazement at the work accomplished by the senior teen-age group of girls at Caughnawaga. This work, as you know, consists in the main of weaving projects for the production of scarfs, ties, etc. Dr. G. Fred McNally, Deputy Minister of Education for the province of Alberta, who was president of the Council last year discussed with me ways and means of strengthening our educational set-up in the province of Alberta. The reports on our schools received by him from his inspectors appeared to him to be in many respects unsatisfactory. He was very much encouraged by the discussion he had with Mr. Doucet when Mr. Doucet visited Edmonton a couple of months ago. Dr. McNally is particularly interested in manual training and in vocational and physical courses. He assured me that we would experience no difficulty in securing the services of men equipped to give special courses in physical instruction at our schools, should we desire their services at any time. In a letter received from Dr. McNally since his return to Edmonton, he states:\n\n\"Yesterday I had a long talk with Fathers Siemard and Gaudette, of the Indian school at St. Albert. We have arranged to have Mr. Bird, of the Edmonton Department of Physical Education, visit St. Albert this week-end and assist the Fathers in putting their physical training on a satisfactory basis. I, myself, expect to have an opportunity of visiting this school early in the year, after the new program has been in effect for some weeks.\"\n\nThe following visitors called at this office during the month:\n\nDr. G. Fred McNally, Edmonton, Alberta;\nDr. Robert Fletcher, Winnipeg, Manitoba;\nInspector Andrew Moore, Winnipeg, Manitoba;\nProfessor D. S. Woods, Faculty of Education, University of Manitoba;\nMr. D. G. McKenzie, Winnipeg, Manitoba;\nMr. Tanchuck, Winnipeg, Manitoba;\nGeorge E. Wood, M.P. for Brant, Ont.\nDr. Cerrigan, Norway House, Man.;\nand the following Indian Agents:\n\nMr. George W. Down, Sarnia, Ont.;\nMr. Herve Lariviere, Abitibi Agency, Que.;\nDr. J. T. Orford, James Bay Agency;\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nOttawa, November 1, 1941.\n\nMemorandum\n\nDOCTOR McILL.\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended October 31, 1941.\n\nWELFARE.\n\nWelfare expenditures for the period April 1 - September 30, 1941, amounted to $828,850.01, compared with expenditures amounting to $490,948.60 for the corresponding period of last year. The Treasury officials inform me that inasmuch as there is usually one month's delay in the payment of accounts, these figures actually represent expenditures for five rather than six months. You will note that the figures indicate a net decrease amounting to $176,258.65.\n\nRelief expenditures show a substantial reduction in all the provinces. The greatest reduction - $54,982.24 - appears to have taken place in the province of Quebec, with the province of Ontario showing a reduction of $32,125.55. On the other hand, relief costs in Manitoba for the period - $64,523.31 remain high. Manitoba, with an Indian population of 14,561, shows unemployment relief costs double the costs for the same period in Alberta, with a population of 12,163.\n\nIt would appear that Indians have experienced little difficulty in securing steady employment throughout the summer and during the early fall. This fact in itself is almost wholly responsible for the savings effected. The supply of discarded military clothing available has also been a factor. It is gratifying to be able to report that Indian women, under the direction of our agents, are making the best possible use of the clothing supplied. Samples of clothing made into blankets, garments for children, etc., have been sent forward to the Department. These garments bear evidence of skill that is really very commendable.\n\nWeather conditions in the Prairie Provinces during the harvesting season have been more unfavourable than they have been at any time within the last 15 or 20 years. The heavy rainfall has not only delayed threshing operations but has resulted in lowering the grades and consequently the value of wheat and oats, particularly wheat. Indian Agent Iredale, of the Stony Agency, in his report for September, states:\n\n\"The weather during the month of September was very bad. We experienced rain and snow on and off for practically the whole month. This\nhampered our normal harvesting operations considerably. The temperature also during the month averaged below normal.\n\nIndian Agent Gooderham, in his report dated October 8, states:\n\n\"The precipitation at Gleichen was 1.45 inches, but at other points on the reserve it is believed that there was more moisture. The weather was unsettled throughout the month and the first heavy frost occurred on the 8th. This did not clear the air however and finally on the 23rd and 24th it snowed quite heavily. The heaviest frost was on the 27th when 13 degrees was registered.\"\n\nIndian Agent Webb, in his report on the Peigan Agency for September, states:\n\n\"Throughout the month, cold, wet, windy weather has prevailed. This has been attended with some frost and snow, which have hampered the fall work\u2014harvesting, threshing, etc., and prevented the Indians from earning the money necessary to support themselves.\"\n\nActing Indian Agent McMillan, in his report on the Blood Agency, dated October 2, states:\n\n\"The weather for this month has been the worst at this time for many years. During the month two light snow storms occurred, and the rest of the month was wet. One severe frost was noticed during the month.\"\n\nIn my report of a month or two ago I referred to an area in northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan where crop failures have been recurring for a number of years. Reports to hand from northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan indicate that the crops of this year are a total failure on a number of reserves. It is somewhat disturbing to note also that the crop failure area is extending south. Indian Agent Booth, of Cut'Appelle, in his report dated October 1, states:\n\n\"All harvesting operations are now completed, and on the majority of the farms the results were very disappointing. Only on the Assiniboine Reserve have the crops been good. On the Pasqua and Sioux Reserves a little grain was threshed, but on the Pinpot and Muscorpetung reserves the crops were a total failure. All our summer-fallow work is now completed and a first class job has been done in most cases.\n\nMr. Holden, Inspector for the Wheat Reduction Board, visited this agency and was well satisfied with the work done. He informed me that...\"\nour summer-fallow was in most fields as good or a little better worked than the fields he had inspected for our white neighbors.\n\nA number of encouraging reports on the work undertaken and accomplished by the members of native women's clubs continue to reach us from month to month. Indian Agent Daunt, New Westminster Agency, in his report for September, states:\n\n\"The Native Women's Clubs at Chilliwack put on a very creditable exhibit of native arts and handicrafts at the Chilliwack Fair, under the guidance of Miss Dynes. It was the cause of much favourable comment, not only at the time but when I visited the area during the following week. A number of prominent citizens expressed their surprise and appreciation of the effort\".\n\nMajor Randle, in his report on the Six Nations Agency, refers to the work accomplished by the tractors. He states:\n\n\"The tractors during the month (September) ploughed 198 acres, tilled 269 acres and sowed 84 acres and by these operations assisted 46 individual farmers. Considerable ground on the reserve has been sown to fall wheat this autumn. As weather conditions, except perhaps some lack of moisture, have been favourable to the farmer, the work is well advanced\".\n\nTRAINING:\n\nEarly in the month Mr. Doucet visited the R.C. and U.C. Indian Day Schools at Caughnawaga, the U.C. Indian Day Schools at Oka and the Indian day school on the St. Regis Reserve.\n\nMr. Doucet discussed very fully with the teachers in charge of these schools ways and means of promoting worthwhile vocational courses for boys and girls. Mr. Doucet discussed the courses also with Inspector Wescott, who is responsible for the inspection of the R.C. school at Caughnawaga. Mr. Doucet informs me that a worthwhile start has been made at the schools visited by him. It is my intention to ask him to visit the school at Caughnawaga again prior to the Christmas holidays, with the object of observing and reporting upon the progress made since his initial visit. I have experienced difficulty in securing the services of a competent manual training instructor at Caughnawaga. It has not been possible this year to secure a man with\na professional certificate. The best we could do was to secure the services of a man who has been until now foreman-carpenter for one of the large industrial firms in Montreal. While this arrangement is in many respects unsatisfactory, Mr. Doucet is disposed to think that insofar as woodworking is concerned the instructor will be able to provide a good practical course for the boys.\n\nA few schools in the province of Ontario have failed to secure teachers and have not yet been re-opened. Two teachers, one at St. Regis and one at Caradoc, resigned during the month.\n\nThe opening of a number of our residential schools in the province of Alberta, which should have taken place on September 1, has been delayed, in response to instructions issued by the Provincial Health authorities, owing to the prevalence of poliomyelitis. However, recent reports indicated that practically all of our schools were in operation toward the end of the month.\n\nMr. E. Leppard, the teacher in charge of manual training at the Morley Residential School, in a letter to Mr. Doucet dated October 6, states:\n\n\"We have been a month late in getting down to work, due to the provincial government ban as a result of the recent floods. However, formal classes are now organized in manual training, sewing, cooking, beading and buckskin. We plan to devote Monday P.M. and Friday A.M. to formal instruction in these activities. The mental attitude of the children this year is a great improvement over that of any other year in my experience.\"\n\nAn encouraging report on the Ste. Catherine Consolidated School, Cowichan Agency, B.C., dated October 20, has just been received from Inspector Barry. Mr. Barry states:\n\n\"Vocational training is particularly good at this school. The girls, under Sister M. Engenia, prepare the midday meal in a most excellent manner. This meal is properly served by the girls, who undertake this task dressed in caps and aprons. These girls look very smart indeed and the meal appeared to me to be as well served, if not better than meals served at most residential schools.\n\n\"The girls also were seen at their wool work, where native wool is carded on the new machine just provided and knit into worthwhile articles. Ordinary wool was also being knit into socks, sweaters, etc. Some beadwork was being undertaken, belts being made on frames. These frames, I should add, were made by the boys in the manual training shop. The manual...\"\ntraining and gardening work at this school is under the direction of Mr. P. J. Corcoran. A number of simple articles of use in the school have been made since my last visit. The manual training shop was perfectly clean and tools supplied were in good order.\n\nThe academic work at the school has also improved and with a large group in Grades 7 and 8 another visit in the spring will be necessary for testing purposes prior to the pupils' graduation.\n\nIn conclusion I may say that the Ste. Catherine Consolidated Indian Day School is a credit to the Department and to the Sisters in charge - the Sisters of St. Ann.\"\n\nInspector Barry's report indicates that the Ste. Catherine School is one of the most successful schools operated by the Department anywhere in the Dominion. It is interesting to note that a group of the pupils have reached Grade 8 and will no doubt pass their entrance examination this year. You are aware that transportation is provided for the pupils in attendance at this school. Despite this fact, however, the attendance has never been wholly satisfactory at any time since the school was first established. I am at this date in communication with Commissioner MacKay, in the hope that the time at his disposal will enable him to make a special inspection of the school and thus be in a position to recommend ways and means whereby the attendance can be improved.\n\nThe following table indicates the enrolment and average attendance at the Ste. Catherine School during the last two or three years.\n\nSte. Catherine Consolidated School - Record of Attendances:\n\n| Enrolment | Average |\n|-----------|---------|\n| June Quarter, 1939 | 53 | 20 |\n| September # 1939 | 50 | 23 |\n| December # 1939 | 66 | 37 |\n| March Quarter 1940 | 107 | 59 |\n| June # 1940 | 102 | 47 |\n| September # 1940 | closed |\n| December # 1940 | 110 | 53 |\n| March # 1941 | 112 | 71 |\n| June # 1941 | 115 | 43 |\n\nThe following -\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nMiss Kenneth Haig, Winnipeg Free Press, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nMr. Leonard Earl, Winnipeg Tribune,\n\nMiss Amy Roe, Country Guide,\n\nDr. D.

Doey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nOttawa, December 1, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCGILL,\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended November 30, 1941.\n\nWELFARE:\n\nRelief expenditures for the period April 1 - October 31 amounted to $872,082.90, compared with an expenditure of $559,750.41 for the corresponding period of last year. These figures represent a net decrease of $112,336.51. The greatest decrease, $57,999.91 - is reported from the province of Quebec. However, for some reason that is not easily explained, relief costs in the province of Manitoba remain comparatively high. Relief expenditures at certain agencies in this province, such as Clandehoye and Fisher River, remain practically the same as last year. The crop harvested in Manitoba, on the other hand, appears to be on the whole better than the crop harvested in the other two Prairie Provinces. A great deal of difficulty was experienced in the harvesting operations as the result of exceptionally heavy rains. It is possible, now that the harvesting operations have been completed, that the results of these operations will be reflected in relief costs in Manitoba during the months immediately ahead of us.\n\nAs the result of a conference held with Mr. Elliott Moses early in the month, a Short Course program has been arranged for the following agencies:\n\n| Agency               | Dates                  |\n|----------------------|------------------------|\n| Six Nations          | January 5 - January 16, 1942 |\n| Tyendinaga           | January 13 - January 30, 1942 |\n| Moravian             | February 2 - February 6, 1942 |\n| Caradoc              | February 16 - February 27, 1942 |\n| Sarnia               | March 5 - March 12, 1942 |\n| Walpole Island       | March 18 - March 20, 1942 |\n| Saugeen              | March 23 - March 27, 1942 |\n| Cape Croker          | April 3 - April 10, 1942 |\n| Christian Island     | April 6 - April 10, 1942 |\n| Wikwemikong          | April 20 - April 24, 1942 |\n\nThis Division will type the programs and assume responsibility for the publicity necessary to make these courses a success. The lecturers will be provided free by the Agricultural College at Guelph, the University of Toronto and the Extension Service of the Provincial Government.\n\nAn encouraging report on what one might term subsistence farming or subsistence gardening has been received from Dr. T. J. Orford; in his report dated October 27, 1941, Dr. Orford states:\n\n\"The potatoes grown during the past season have...\"\nhave all been taken up. Every Indian family living here has sufficient to carry through until next year. Forty bags have been sent to Rupert's House and 30 to East Main for next spring's planting at these places. In addition to this, the present root-house is full - about 225 bags of which in the spring about 50 will be sent to Albany and 40 to Ogoki and Pagwa for seeding purposes. It is estimated that we have grown about 1100 bags of potatoes altogether this year. As I intimated when in Ottawa, it is my intention to enlarge the gardens for next year in order to produce other root crops, such as turnips, carrots and parsnips, and to use Moose Factory as a centre of distribution for other points in the Bay area.\"\n\nLittle difficulty has been experienced by Indians in securing employment throughout the summer and fall months, and work is likely to remain plentiful throughout the winter. Mr. E. S. Noble, managing director of the Spruce Falls Power and Paper Company, in a letter to the Department dated November 17, 1941, states:\n\n\"We, as well as other companies in this district, are very short of pulpwood cutters this season. At the present time we ourselves could use six or seven hundred more cutters, while the Abitibi Power & Paper Company, Limited, tell me that they could use over 3000 more men between this and the Port Arthur section\".\n\nMr. Noble adds:\n\n\"Our camps are excellent; in fact we think they are the best lumber camps in the country.\n\n\"We have work the year round for these pulpwood cutters, although we must admit that for one month in the spring the bush is extremely wet and very few men want to work in it. However, if they do want to work, the work is there for them\".\n\nArrangements have been made whereby twelve men will be sent from the Battleford agency to Kapuskasing by way of experiment. If these men are successful and willing to remain on the job, no doubt other groups will be sent to the Kapuskasing district from time to time, particularly groups of men from certain drought-stricken areas in Saskatchewan.\n\nIndian Agent Todd, in his October report on the Kwawkewlth Agency, states:\n\n\"All the Indians of this agency have been profitably employed in the fishing industry this season, being one of the largest on record, with the result that the able-bodied Indians, both men and women, are in a good financial position. To date there have been more than a quarter million cases of fish canned at the three canneries adjacent to Alert Bay, and I am informed by the Fishery Department that...\"\nbefore the season is over they anticipate half a million cases will have been packed from this district alone. This is the largest pack in the history of British Columbia.\n\nA striking illustration of the results that follow intensive and scientific cultivation of land in certain sections of British Columbia is provided by Indian Agent Strang. In his report for October Mr. Strang states:\n\n\"From approximately 2\u00bd acres of land planted in onions confiscated under trespass, which I employed Indians to cultivate and harvest, there has already been shipped and marketed through the Farm Produce Control Board 26\u00bd tons of No. 2 and 2\u00bd tons No. 3 onions. Returns for this crop have not yet been received, but I expect to receive $40 per ton for the No. 2 and $20 per ton for the No. 3, out of which will be paid, of course, freight and wages for harvesting. This experiment has proved to the Indians that they themselves can grow onions profitably and that the climate in this district is ideal for growing them.\"\n\nIndian Agent Booth, in his report on the Qu'Appelle Agency for October, states:\n\n\"The Indian farmers in this agency have had a poor year as far as crops are concerned, but the Wheat Reduction Bonus proved a boon to them, and I have cheques amounting to $2,751 from the Department of Agriculture for distribution to the 45 farmers who applied for this bonus. This amount has not only relieved the Indian from his current debts, but in most cases I have been able to purchase sufficient supplies to carry him and his family through the winter months.\"\n\nMr. Booth adds:\n\n\"The Homemakers Clubs on the Assiniboine, Pasqua and Standing Buffalo Reserves are all doing good work, not only for their own members but for any destitute Indians who are unable to help themselves. The supply of Air Force clothing sent to these reserves is being remade into the very best of garments for the children of school age and under. I have seen boys' pants and smocks, girls' dresses and waists made from this clothing, which would be a credit to any organization off the reserve. There should not be any reason for any child going without warm garments for this winter.\"\n\nThe Lands, Parks and Forests Branch intend to slaughter a number of Elk in the Banff area during the winter. This elk meat will be placed at our disposal for distribution to Indians and will be distributed under the personal direction -\ndirection of Inspector Schmidt.\n\nThe following exchange of correspondence between the Department and Mr. C. A. Spinney, Indian Agent, Kentville, N.S., illustrates the difficulty experienced by our officials from time to time in administering Indian relief and welfare, in co-operation with a certain type of Indian agent who appears to lack the intellectual capacity necessary to undertake the ordinary duties and responsibilities of an Indian agency. Departmental letter of November 24, 1941, reads in part as follows:\n\n\"This office has approved for Miss Marguerite Ioney $15.00 per month in special relief, together with one (1) dozen eggs per week, and one (1) quart of milk per day. The combined total of the two accounts amounts to $19.00. Your attention is drawn to the fact that this tubercular Indian girl apparently consumed the following during the month of October:\n\n- 4 lbs. of Meat - obtained from G. L. West -\n- 10 lbs. Beef - obtained from Alex Duvno -\n- 4 lbs. Pork -\n- 6 lbs. Codfish -\n- 1 doz. Herring -\n- 2 cans Salmon -\n\n\"I am sure you will agree with me that this girl could not possibly consume this quantity of meat.\"\n\nMr. Spinney, in his reply of November 26, submits the following explanation:\n\n\"Just what do you mean when you make reference to the amount of money this girl is costing the taxpayer, or that I am not concerned what amount of money this girl is costing the tax-payer? What taxpayers are paying into the funds for the upkeep of the Department of Indian Affairs? I am sure there is no tax-payer paying anything toward the Department of Indian Affairs for the province of Nova Scotia. If so, I would like to know this.\"\n\nTRAINING:\n\nAccompanied by Mr. Jackson, and by Mr. Buck of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, I visited Caughnawaga on November 28th. The time at our disposal, while somewhat limited, enabled us to visit the schools, all of which were in operation at that time, and to observe a number of the teachers at work in the classrooms. I am convinced that the courses of study provided at Caughnawaga will compare favourably with courses of study provided at any public school anywhere in the Dominion. I was interested to learn from the Sister Superior, the Reverend Sister\nJean de Dieu, that no attempt is made to teach French at any of the schools on the reserve. Mr. Doucet and Inspector Wescott, who visited the schools at the opening of the academic year, expressed the view that it would be much more advantageous to the pupils if they were given a good course in English and permitted to abandon the course in French. Mr. Doucet took this position largely because the Indian pupils dislike French and because they enter school with a very limited knowledge of English - hence his desire to make their course in English as comprehensive and as thorough as possible. We did not have an opportunity to meet Mr. Wescott, the manual training instructor who, under the existing arrangement, conducts classes three days during the week. However, the principal in charge of the school appears to be well satisfied with his work. It was interesting to learn from her that the boys enjoy their course in manual training more than they enjoy any of the other branches of study. Mr. Doucet will visit Caughnawaga again prior to the Christmas holidays and review the work undertaken and accomplished since his last visit.\n\nReports indicate that the suspension of our building program is likely to result in overcrowded and congested classrooms, both at our Indian day and residential schools, in the immediate future. Inspector MacKenzie, in his report on the Sandy Bay Residential School, dated November 5, 1941, states:\n\n\"I understand that there are close to 150 children on this reserve who should be attending school, if accommodation were available. As it is, the 92 now enrolled have to attend in alternate periods. These attend, in groups, classroom activities and then go down stairs for manual and vocational instruction and training while other groups take their places in the classrooms. The teachers are doing good work in planning and making work-books. The language work-books suggested last year are proving very helpful. These Sisters in my judgment are doing a grand job and are eager to co-operate fully in making their teaching useful and effective.\"\n\nInspector Eldon F. Simms, in his report dated November 3 on the Portage la Prairie Residential School, states:\n\n\"As can readily be seen on looking over the registration figures for these two rooms, it is impossible for these teachers to carry out a proper educational program with such enormous classes. The senior room is not too bad because several of the older pupils attend in relays or half days and work outside otherwise. In the junior grades, however, the overcrowding is such that no teacher could do justice to the class. I suggest, therefore, that another room be opened to take care of the beginners in Grade I. To cover the increased cost it would be necessary to raise the number of pupils for which the school can obtain grants. The Principal assures...\"\nme that he could accommodate several more pupils. At present the situation is such that he has to turn Indian children away.\"\n\nThe Reverend C. F. Hives has now taken charge of the St. George's School at Lytton, B. C. In a personal letter to me dated November 13, he states:\n\n\"I would like to bring the pupilage at this school up to 180 if it could be arranged. There will be no difficulty whatever in getting the children. We have at present 166 and I know the children will be crowding to get in before long. I wish you would keep this in mind and, if at all possible, allow us the 180. The staff, of course, would have to be increased. We have all the farm, dairy and garden produce available for that number, and it would be that much more to meet our financial obligations\".\n\nMr. Hives' reference to the school building is very depressing, in view of the fact that the building was constructed at considerable expense a few years ago. Mr. Hives states that the building itself is a horrible mess compared with Shingwauk. He adds: \"Poor old Gurney Orr sure improved his plans when he built Shingwauk and he sure got a wonderful contractor to execute his plans as compared with the horrible workmanship of this place. However, the building is here and I know if we are careful in the manipulation of money we can greatly improve it\".\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nRight Rev. M. Lajeunesse, O.M.I., Bishop of Keewatin;\nRight Rev. U. Langlois, O.M.I., Grouard;\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I., Winnipeg, Man.;\nRev. Geo. Dorey, D.D., United Church, Toronto, Ont.;\nRev. R. Johnston, Presbyterian Church, Ottawa, Ont.;\nRev. Mr. Clarke, Assistant, Christ Church Cathedral, Ottawa;\n\nMr. Pearson, representing Leckie Company;\nMr. Bonneycaiselt, H. B.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, December 31, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nTO DOCTOR McGUIRE,\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended December 31, 1941.\n\nTRAINING:\n\nThe Caughnawaga Senior School was totally destroyed by fire on December 18th. This school was of solid brick construction. It was built in the year 1927, at a cost of approximately $50,000.00. It is our intention to make provision whereby the pupils enrolled at the Caughnawaga Senior School can be temporarily accommodated in buildings until the end of the present academic year.\n\nThe following schools have been destroyed by fire since I entered the Department in December, 1926\u2014Grouard, Alberni, Carcross, Albany and Ahousaht Residential Schools; the classroom building at the Alberni Residential School; and the Hunter's Point Indian Day School. In addition to these buildings, the staff residence at the Kenora Residential School and the blacksmith shop at the Kootenay Residential School were also destroyed by fire. It is just possible that when times again become normal we may find it advisable to attach to this Branch a building commissioner. I note that public school boards in the larger centres throughout the Dominion have a building commissioner on their staff. This man is definitely responsible for the construction and repair of school buildings and the inspection of such buildings. He is called upon, also, to make an intensive study of the best ways and means of eliminating fire hazards.\n\nIndian day schools in the province of New Brunswick have been inspected until this year by a departmental inspector. The Inspector of these schools, Father Ryan, retired toward the end of the last academic year, and immediately following his retirement an agreement was entered into with the New Brunswick Department of Education whereby our schools are now inspected by the public school inspectors of the province. The first reports of these inspectors reached me a few days ago. These reports are interesting in that they are the reports of men who have not been at any time until now in contact with our Indian educational program or the teachers in charge of our schools.\nschools. Inspector Fox, in his report on the Oromocto Indian Day School, dated November 28, states:\n\n\"This was my first visit to the Oromocto Indian Day School. I was surprised to find such splendid equipment and pupil's attainments. Everything conceivable has been done at this school to make surroundings comfortable, attractive and conducive to progress. It might be advisable to lower one of the blackboards in order that small children might use it.\"\n\nInspector J. E. Debruce, in his report on the Fel River School, dated December 5, states:\n\n\"I think very good work is being done at this school. I was favourably impressed by the general appearance of the school as well as by the work accomplished. There is no doubt that this teacher is an efficient one.\"\n\nInspector Titus, in a recent report on the St. Mary's School, at Devon, N.B., states:\n\n\"I found this school progressing favourably. The girls have been taught knitting and considerable work has been done along this line. The boys have already made coat hangers, tie racks and a book-case.\"\n\nInspector Anderson, in his report on the Kingsclear School, dated November 24, states:\n\n\"This building is in a good state of repair and kept clean and neat. The girls have been taught knitting and sewing, while the boys have made several very useful articles, such as coat hangers, etc.\"\n\nMr. Doucet visited the Maria, Lovette, Restigouche and Caughnawaga Schools early in the month. Mr. Doucet's report to me, dated December 20, 1941, on the work of these schools, is on the whole satisfactory. He had an opportunity, at the time of his visit to Quebec City, to discuss our educational program with the officials of the Provincial Department of Education. There has been a wide-spread feeling in the Province of Quebec for a number of years that the public school program is altogether too abstract and academic in character. The departmental officials are fully aware of this fact and are putting forth a sincere attempt to introduce a program of a more practical and vocational nature. The introduction of this program, however, both in the public and Indian schools of Quebec, will require time and the exercise of a great deal of patience. It should begin with the training of the teachers in the normal schools of the province. It is significant that the officials with whom Mr. Doucet discussed our program were enthusiastically in favour of what we are attempting to do at our schools and promised to co-operate with -\nwith us in the promotion of this program. There is at the present time a lack of fully qualified men capable of giving instruction in woodwork, auto mechanics, electric welding, etc. It is not at all likely that such men will be available at any time until the conclusion of the war. In the meantime, however, an attempt will be made to introduce vocational studies at our schools in Quebec, using to the best possible advantage the instructors that are able to secure.\n\nThe Calgary Albertan, in its issue of November 26, publishes an interesting report on an Indian art exhibition, organized at that time in the city of Calgary. The writer in this report states:\n\n\"The children of the Inkomeen Indian School at Oliver have told the story of the Nativity, as conceived by the Indians. They have painted animal heads, the Madonna and Child, and Palm Sunday, but particularly outstanding are the various Indian figures painted on buckskin.\"\n\nThese children have been encouraged to take up these artistic studies by their teacher, Mr. Anthony Walsh. This article continues:\n\n\"Though only 18 years old, Gerald Tailfeathers displayed at least eight water colours. This Indian boy specializes in landscapes. His Indian portraits, however, far surpass his scenery collection and bespeak a future for this youthful Redskin.\n\n\"In opening the exhibition, Dr. W. G. Carpenter, Director of Technical Education for the Province, commended those responsible for making it possible for Calgarians to see this fine Indian art, which he hoped might bring about a revival of Indian arts and crafts in Alberta.\"\n\nWELFARE:\n\nIt is gratifying to report that despite the approach of the winter season, work suitable for Indians appears to be plentiful throughout the Dominion. In my report of last month I referred to the employment by the Spruce Falls Paper and Paper Company of twelve Indians from the Battleford Agency on their pulpwood limits at Kapuskasing, Ontario. I am now in receipt of a letter from the managing director of this company, in which he intimates that the work of the twelve Indians has been on the whole fairly satisfactory and that he is now anxious to secure at least two hundred additional Indians, preferably from Saskatchewan, and if at all possible, Indians experienced in bush work. We have already communicated with the Indian Agent at Battleford and the General Superintendent of Indian Agencies at Regina, in respect to this matter. It is our hope that we will be able to secure 200 able-bodied Indians for this work.\n\nIndian Agent -\nIndian Agent Burk, in his report dated December 4th, states:\n\n\"I beg to report that a contract has been signed by Mr. F. E. Johnson, President of the Model Mink Farm at Fort William, with the Fort William Band for 300 tons of herring at $28.50 per ton. This price includes freezing and bagging and is f.o.b. Scuaw Bay.\"\n\nIndian Agent Down, in his report on the Sarnia Agency, dated December 8th, states:\n\n\"Our tractors on the Sarnia Reserve have been busy almost every day. In connection with this, I have been out on the reserves in an endeavour to check the acreage ploughed, also fall wheat plantings. I am able to report an increase in fall wheat plantings but a decrease in fall ploughing for 1947 spring planting. This is perhaps a natural trend when one considers the increasing industrial activities with its offer of higher and steady wages, especially among our Indian population. It is difficult to keep them interested in agriculture in normal times and much more difficult when so many other channels are opening up. This is especially so concerning our people on the Sarnia Reserve with its close proximity to the United States. The recession is also beginning to have its effect on Kettle and Stony Point Reserves. I am making no effort to discourage this condition in favour of Agriculture\u2014first because I know it is of no use; second, because the Indians not by any means a natural agriculturist and can only be kept on the land when all else fails. By this do not mean to infer our agricultural efforts have suddenly disappeared, or that we should curb our efforts, but I do say if we, the Indian agents, farm instructors and field staff generally, can hold what we have, it will be an accomplishment and perhaps lead to a more intensive agricultural program when all this world strife and turmoil is at an end. I have great faith in post war conditions for Agriculture and it will be my endeavour to build toward that end.\"\n\nIndian Agent Simpson, in his report on the Duck Lake Agency, dated December first, states:\n\n\"The cattle owners have been engaged in completing repairs to stables and shelters for their live stock. A few have found employment in the camps and with farmers adjacent to their reserves. A number have been engaged in marketing cordwood, for which there is a good demand and good prices. A number have also been engaged in trapping skunk, valued at from $1.00 to $2.50 each, and weasel at 70\u00a2 to $1.10 each. Indians on the reserves have been snaring rabbits, which are more plentiful than they have been at any time for several years. They are dryin'...\"\ndrying the meat and selling the furs at from five to eight cents each. The value of the fur catch for November is reported at $1,060.\"\n\nIndian Agent Jones, in his report on the File Hills Agency, dated December 8, states:\n\n\"Wool and other such materials have been supplied by the Red Cross, and the Indian women are now knitting socks and making up garments. This month a parcel containing 1,000 cigarettes and food was mailed to each of the 11 boys from this agency now serving overseas. Arrangements have also been made to send smokes, etc., to each of the boys from this agency serving in the Army in Canada.\"\n\nIndian Agent Waite, in his report on the Portage la Prairie Agency, dated December 1, states:\n\n\"The season for commercial fishing opened on the 11th and to date very little fishing has been done. The condition is better on Lake Winnipegosis. Ice formed on the 12th of the month and the Indians are fishing close to the shore. The centre of the lake is still open. Pickerel opened at 7\u00a2 per pound and the catch has been the best for some years.\"\n\nExceptionally fine work has been undertaken and accomplished by Indian Agent Young on the Griswold Reserve. In his report dated December 15 the Agent states:\n\n\"On the Oak Lake Reserve the community farm debt was totally paid off last spring. This year we invested in a small combine, which easily paid for itself during the harvesting operations this fall. We have recently traded in our old tractor and purchased a new one and still have a substantial bank balance.\n\n\"On the Oak River Reserve Community Farm we were able to meet our 1940 and 1941 payments and interest this fall, which amounted to $366. We still have a good bank balance.\n\n\"The Indian farmers on these reserves were all able to save their feed for the coming year, to pay their current year's expenses and purchase a good supply of flour for winter use. I feel that the Indian farmers on my two community farms have had a very successful year.\"\n\nIndian Agent Taylor, in his report on the Williams Lake Agency for November, states:\n\n\"Indians have been busy cutting Christmas trees - some families have earned two to three hundred dollars for little more than one month's work. Many are now hunting squirrels and making as high as $20.00 per day, with skins worth $5.00 each. There is a dearth of labour in the district and the Indians reap the benefit. Most of the bands should be in very good shape for the winter, which so far gives every indication of being a mild and open one.\"\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nReverend J. O. Plourde, O.M.I., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nRev. Father LaBelle, Missionary, Cape Croker & Saugeen Reserves.\n\nMr. D. A. Macdonald, Assistant Dominion Forester\n\nMr. Watt, Parks Branch.\n\nRight Rev. U Langlois, O.M.I., Bishop of Grouard, Alberta.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, February 2, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR McILL.\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended January 31, 1942.\n\nWELFARE:\n\nRelief costs for the period April 1 to December 31, 1941, amounted to $469,171.58, compared with an expenditure of $653,729.80 for the corresponding period of last year. These figures represent a net decrease amounting to $184,158.77. The most substantial reduction - $61,165.03 - has taken place in the province of Manitoba where able-bodied Indians are experiencing little difficulty in securing employment, even in the winter months. Relief costs for this period in the province of Ontario amounted to $57,444.82. Of this amount approximately $25,000.00 has been expended in the Sioux Lookout and James Bay agencies. These agencies have a population (last census) of 8,380 as against an Indian population of 30,145 in the whole of the province. It will thus be seen that approximately fifty per cent of our relief expenditures in Ontario are incurred in the two northern agencies. However, relief costs even in these two agencies, are substantially lower than they are in the northern agencies of Manitoba.\n\nI have noted that relief costs in the James Bay Agency, with a population of 4,014, for the period April 1 to December 31, this year amounted to $18,527.15, while relief costs in the Clandebone Agency for the same period, with a population of 2,463 Indians, amounted to $16,226.17.\n\nInspector Hamilton, however, appears to be of the opinion that relief costs in Manitoba represent the minimum expenditures that we can expect if the old and incapacitated Indians in his province are to escape hardship and suffering. In a letter dated January 19, 1942, in which he comments on economic and relief conditions throughout the province, he states:\n\n\"In my opinion the relief allowed is altogether inadequate and does not begin to supply the bare necessities. The general public would, I believe, brand it as disgraceful\".\n\nI am personally of the opinion that the refusal of the Indians in northern Manitoba to go in more extensively for subsistence gardening and the construction of root-houses explains -\nexplains to a large extent the high costs of relief in the province.\n\nAn interesting comment on departmental relief allowances and the effect of these allowances on the character of the Indian population comes from the Yukon. The Missionary in charge of the St. Barnabas Mission at Moosehide who, it would appear, is himself an Indian, in the last issue of \"Northern Lights\", a magazine published in the interests of the Diocese of the Yukon, states:\n\n\"Many of our menfolk work on an equal footing with whites during the summer and they are beginning to realize that if they are to receive respect and equality from fellow citizens they have to put their own house in order. A new spirit of co-operation, however, is abroad and we are trying to live without relief, that most shattering climax ever devised by a white man for a native. As Moosehide natives have been allowed relief since gold rush days, it is going to be some time before it becomes a custom of the past. Prayers supported by hard work are bound to bring success\".\n\nIllegitimacy on Indian reserves remains one of our most acute and most disturbing problems. This problem has been very forcefully brought to our attention during the month. Indian Agent McMullen, Colchester Agency, N. S., reported five cases in a single letter. The Trusts Division report that 120 Indians, all of whom had been refused admission to the Band because of illegitimacy, were recently admitted to membership, when Mr. McCrimmon visited the reserve and discussed their claims with the members of the Sarnia Indian Council. The plight of the illegitimate children on an Indian reserve is in a very real sense pitiful and tragic. Frequently abandoned by their mothers and disowned by the members of the band, they receive care for a time in our residential schools - only to be discharged at the age of 16, literally without a friend in the world. It is just possible that during the days that lie ahead of us an attempt will have to be made to secure maintenance orders from the putative fathers of these children. The fact that maintenance orders are now secured in a number of provinces from such fathers has reduced illegitimacy among the white population very substantially in recent years. A rather encouraging report of an attempt made to safeguard the morality of the girl graduates of a residential school comes from the Principal of the St. Phillips Indian Residential School, near Kamsack, Pelly Agency, Saskatchewan. The Principal, Rev. Father A. Paradis, in his report, states:\n\n\"The Department is interested in having ex-pupils live up to the moral education received at residential schools. May I remark that in spite of our efforts too many of our boys and...\nmost promising girls, after being discharged, soon lose their honor and sense of moral behavior, through immoral influences on the reserves, irresponsible parents, or non-enforcement of existing laws and regulations. When mothers and fathers, young men and women, are left to live unlawfully or to change wife or husband, permanently unmolested, what can you expect of any young girl let loose unprotected? In quest of means to encourage the parents to protect their daughters, and reward our deserving girls, I have in the past year set up special wedding celebrations for ex-pupils who have remained faithful to their good moral standing. They are married in the school chapel, and the ceremony is followed by a banquet. There are from 30 to 35 guests, among whom are the Indian Agent, the Chiefs and their wives, the parents and relatives. The bride is presented with dishes, kitchen utensils, a trunk, etc., as household equipment - this to the amount of $50. We had two of these special weddings this past year. As this is part of the assistance that ex-pupils should receive from the Department, could our school or all schools be given an allowance for such purposes?\"\n\nIn my report of last month I referred to the number of Indians (172 in all) from the province of Saskatchewan who had secured work on the pulpwood limits at Kapuskasing, Ontario. In this connection Indian Agent Ostrander, in his report dated January 20, states:\n\n\"There are now 78 Indians of this agency working in Manitoba and Ontario in pulpwood and lumber camps, none getting less than $50.00 a month and board. A considerable proportion of their earnings is sent home to their families, with the result that conditions are greatly improved on the reserves of the south part of the agency. The outlook now for the winter on these reserves is not nearly as bad as anticipated early in the season. Reports from the points where the Indians are working are to the effect that their work has been on the whole satisfactory to the employers there and there is a probability that work of this kind will become more important as a source of livelihood for Indians for the duration of the war at least. Most of my time for three weeks has been devoted towards assisting and encouraging the Indians to get to these distant points, but I feel that my efforts have not been in vain. The income from this work has been between $6,000 and $7,000 a month to otherwise starving Indians.\"\n\nIn view of existing economic conditions in the Prairie Provinces, it is perhaps too much to expect encouraging -\nencouraging reports from those charged with the responsibility of operating our community farms. However, the reports from these farms on the whole are reasonably satisfactory, with the exception of two or three farms in the drought-stricken area of Saskatchewan. Interest payments to the Revolving Fund will be made this year in full. Indian Agent Young, in his report on the community farms of the Griswold Agency, dated September 16, 1941, states:\n\n\"On the Oak Lake Reserve the community farm debt was totally paid off last spring. We invested in a small combine, which easily paid for itself during the harvesting operations. We recently traded in our old tractor and purchased a new one and still have a substantial bank balance. On the Oak River Reserve Community Farm we were able to meet our 1940 and 1941 payments of principal and interest in full this fall. This payment amounted to $366. We still have a good bank balance.\n\n\"The Indian farmers were all able to save their feed for the coming year, pay their current year's expenses and purchase a good supply of flour for the winter. I feel that the Indian farmers on my two community farms have indeed had a very successful year.\"\n\nTRAINING:\n\nA number of our Indian day schools in the East have undertaken, with enthusiasm, the task of repairing and remodelling a large quantity of discarded military clothing, sent forward to the agencies during the last two or three months. Samples of this clothing, returned to the Department as exhibits, reflect great credit, not only on the pupils, but on the teachers responsible for their instruction. It would appear that a certain amount of this clothing is taken over by the teachers in charge of the schools and assigned as a vocational project to groups of pupils, particularly senior girls. The skill and ability of these pupils to unravel yarn from discarded socks and reknit it into socks and sweaters has been truly remarkable.\n\nMr. Doucet is at present engaged in the organization and promotion of vocational courses at Tyendinaga, Six Nations, Ramo and Rice and Mud Lake Agencies. At the time of his visit to a number of these reserves, Mr. Doucet will also attend the Short Courses that are usually in session at this season of the year. He will report later on what he considers to be the value of these courses and on ways and means whereby in his judgment they can be improved. I should add that the attendance at these courses last year was in no sense satisfactory - hence\nour desire to do everything possible to make these Short Courses more attractive.\n\nThe Vancouver Province, in its issue of December 18, 1941, contains an article entitled \"Dormant Talent Encouraged\". This article reads in part as follows:\n\n\"The Society for Furtherance of B.C. Indian Arts and Crafts contributes to the Christmas season two unique publications, illustrated entirely by Indian children of the province. These little volumes, entertaining and originals, are inspired additions to western art and literature.\n\n\"Meet Mr. Coyote\" is illustrated by boys of the Thompson tribe at the Indian school of St. George at Lytton. This first series of legends of the tribe, gathered by the boys' teacher, Noel Stewart, has a genuine regional note. Both pictures and story have more than a suggestion of that rich flavor or naive contact with the animal people which made 'Uncle Remus' a classic of the Southern States.\n\n\"A handsome reprint of 'The Tale of the Nativity', illustrated by the Indian boy-artist Sis-hu-lk, is undoubtedly destined for considerable public favor as something distinctly of the province. Already a first edition has been exhausted, purchased not only here but far beyond our borders.\n\n\"The Tale of the Nativity\", as told to their teacher, Anthony Walsh, by the Indian children of Inikameep and described in pictures by the boy-artist whose work has been admired in the Art Gallery and even in London, has a simple delightful form which is almost mediaeval in quality and structure.\n\n\"Both drawings and narrative describe the event as if the Nativity had taken place in remote times in the Okanagan Valley. The unexpected variations, bringing the story right home to our doors so to speak, produce an effect of singular and poignant charm.\"\n\nIndian Agent Christie, in his report on the Bella Coola Agency for December, states:\n\n\"The usual Christmas concerts were held by the Indian school children. A small charge was made at the Bella Coola School, realizing $30.00, which was turned over to the Red Cross. Another program that this school put on entirely by the older girls realized $50.00. This was devoted to the same worthy purpose\".\n\nIndian Agent Gooderham, in his report on the Blackfoot Agency, dated January 5, 1942, states:\n\n\"Both -\nBoth residential schools were visited during the month. The writer was particularly impressed by the number of stock at the Old Sun (Anglican) School. There were 55 head of cattle, of which 16 cows are milking. There were three sows with three large litters of young pigs, besides 25 feeders and one boar. Two hundred and one hens were laying an average of five dozen eggs daily. At the Crossfoot (R.C.) School a good start has been made in the organization of a vocational course and the building used for this purpose has been fitted with benches. It is sufficiently large to handle all those who are taking this course.\n\nMore or less as an experiment and also because children have been retained in school almost continuously since the summer holidays, the pupils of both schools got a week's holidays at Christmas. Rations were issued to their parents and it was the first time I ever noted that the parent or guardian realized that he had a responsibility to look after his own. The enthusiasm of getting the children out, however, was not so great when they realized that they would have to feed them and keep them warm and in good health during the period that the Indian normally runs here and there all over the country. The pupils are now back in school and I believe they are mostly in good health. I have noted one thing: that there was less travel to the city and fewer Indians drunk and in trouble than in former years. Possibly this is due to the fact that they had to remain at home and look after their families. At any rate it was good training for the parents.\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nMr. R. C. Brown, Director United Grain Growers, Pilot Mound, Man.\n\nRev. J. P. Mackey, Principal, Indian Residential School, Shubenacadie, N. S.\n\nIndian Agents: Rev. Angus MacNeill, Inverness Agency, Glendale, N. S.\n\nRev. E. F. Chiasson, Pictou Agency, Thorburn, N.S.\n\nRev. D. J. Rankin, Victoria Agency, Iona, N. S.\n\nMr. J. McLaughlin, Penitentiaries Branch, Justice Dept.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, February 28, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCGILL,\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended February 28, 1942.\n\nTRAINING.\n\nThe officials of the Training Division have been reminded from time to time of the waywardness of the graduates of our Indian residential schools and the tendency, on the part of a large number of these pupils, to revert rapidly to a mode of life that reflects little, if any, credit on the institutions in which they have been trained. In my report of last month I intimated that the problem of illegitimacy had become one of the most disturbing problems confronting us on a number of our reserves. It would be a great mistake, however, to conclude that all the graduates of our schools become delinquent or wayward. This month, an unusually large number of reports have reached us from residential school graduates and day school pupils who have really made good.\n\nThe \"Grouard Echoes\", a magazine published by the Grouard Residential School, contains in its last issue a photo of Dom. Povargue, a graduate of the Grouard Indian Residential School, who joined the Air Force shortly after the outbreak of the war and who is now stationed at the R.A.F. Station, Dyce, near Aberdeen, Scotland. It would appear that this boy has recently married an old country girl and is rendering outstanding service in the Air Force. In his letter to the Grouard School he intimates that he spent the Christmas holiday season with his wife's people at Newcastle. He expresses satisfaction that so many Indians from the Grouard district have joined the Army. In the same magazine, there appears a letter from Harry Thomas, O.M.I. This young Indian graduated from the Grouard Residential School a few years ago and later took up a course of theological training at the Lebret Oblate College. In a letter to Sister Jean, of Grouard, this young Priest writes:\n\n\"How did you like Churchill's address to the Senate and Congress? He simply arouses me. I often told you when I was young that he was my MAN, and my liking for him has not decreased\".\n\nThe \"Pine Tree Chief\", a magazine published by a group of young Indians of the Six Nations Reserve, in its issue dated February 13, refers to the first\nIndian girl that has joined the Canadian Women's Auxiliary Air Forces. This girl, Dorothy Montour, is a graduate of the Shingwauk Home at Sault Ste. Marie and a graduate of the Brantford Collegiate Institute. Another graduate of the Shingwauk Home, Nellie R. Oke, of the Oka Reserve, is now employed at the Cocuasteza Hospital. This girl, an orphan, graduated from the Civic Hospital, London, Ontario, a couple of years ago and spent one year as nurse at the Anglican residential school, Carcross, Yukon Territory.\n\nHere is a letter received a few days ago from the Anglican Theological College, University Hill, Vancouver. This letter is from an Indian student and reads as follows:\n\n\"Perhaps it is well to introduce myself first. My name is Frank Calder and I come from the native village of Greenville, of the Nass River Agency, under Agent Gillett.\n\n\"I am at the present time taking my third year in Theology at the Anglican Theological College, along with my Arts course at the university. It is of this latter course I wish to speak to you. For the last four years I have been pretty much on my own so far as my education has been concerned. Until now I have done fairly well with my fees, but for this Easter term I find that I am short about $40. If the Department can make a loan of this amount I would certainly be thankful. I shall repay this amount before the end of August, as I do not want this to be a one-sided affair. I had hoped that I would never have to seek financial support from the Department, but now I feel I must, as the payment of my university fees is now overdue. In closing I want you to know that I appreciate the work and kindness the Department has given me in the past.\"\n\nThe Reverend A. E. Minchin, recently appointed principal of the Shingwauk Home School, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., in a letter dated February 13, states:\n\n\"Stella McDougall, a graduate of this school and a graduate of the Sault Ste. Marie Technical School, has secured a position in the Civil Service at Ottawa. Stella was 17 years old in January and has been informed that her monthly salary to begin will amount to $86.00.\"\n\nThese letters - all of them brought to our attention within the month - suggest that a number of Indian school graduates do succeed in life and that a large number might perhaps follow in their footsteps if we had at our disposal the machinery necessary to give more guidance and direction to our school graduates during that critical period immediately following their discharge from our educational institutions.\n\nInspector Schmidt, in a report on the St. Paul's (C. E.) Indian Residential School, Blood Agency, states:\n\n\"I am pleased to report that a start has been made at this school in the promotion of manual training.\"\nA small outside building has been converted into a work-shop, benches arranged and a start made at woodworking, under the supervision of Mr. A. Doodle. As time goes on and the work becomes organized, this building will have to be enlarged or a new one arranged for. However, now that a start has been made at this work, let us hope that it will be kept up and extended.\n\nInspector Stehelin, in his report on the Grouard Residential School, dated December 1, 1941, states:\n\n\"The introduction of the Youth Training Movement has been of great assistance to the pupils of this school. I have found a great change, especially in the attitude of the boys. It appears that now they have found something in which they can excel. This institution is particularly fortunate in having the services of a man like Father Forcade (physical instructor). A special trip was made by me to Grouard to attend a Youth Training display at this school.\n\nUpon the occasion of my inspection some time was spent in the Home Economics and Home Nursing class, organized by the senior girls. The quality of the work being done by this class is very fine. On display were uniforms for the youth training groups, sewing of all kinds, fabrics and dress materials, hooked rugs, tailored articles, etc. The girls are indeed very proud of their work, and justly so. Through this Home Economics Class it might be possible to organize some local home industry. The leather work and bead industry in the district is not very profitable.\n\nIndian residential schools, to be a success, must bear relationship to the three C's - Correlation, Cooperation and Coordination. Mathematics provide an easy way of beginning correlation. Everything in the school costs how much? Where do these things come from? How are they obtained or manufactured, etc.? Cooperation should enter into work and play. Each pupil should have a certain house detail to do. Coordination will be the direct result of correlation and cooperation.\"\n\nInspector Schmidt, in his report on the St. Mary's (R. C.) Residential School, Blood Agency, dated February 10, states:\n\n\"Good work has been done by the manual training class. It has been found that the work-shop, a separate building from the main school, is cold in winter and rather difficult to heat - for which reason work in this room is not being carried on during cold weather. The principal has prepared plans for enlarging this building, which will double the available floor space. The new building will be properly finished, lined inside and insulated and a proper floor laid. When completed, it will comprise a number of ordinary carpenter's work benches, a forge, anvil, vice and bench, and will have double doors to allow a truck, tractor or other smaller-\nsized farm machinery to be brought inside for repairing or overhauling at any time of the year. The shop is now equipped with an electric welding unit. The tools in use are well cared for and kept in separate lockers. There is a fair supply of materials\u2014boards, planks, etc.\u2014on hand. This is neatly piled in different sizes. Good work is being done in this shop.\n\n\"A new wind-break\u2014a-foot board fence\u2014was built around the winter stock feed plot this summer by the older boys.\n\nWELFARE:\n\nIndian Agent Smith, of the Birtle Agency, in sending forward the annual report on the Homemakers' Club organized by Miss M. E. Buckley, R.N., on the Rolling River Reserve, writes as follows:\n\n\"They do more needlework and also knitting on this reserve than they do on any of the other reserves in this agency. The wool and flannelette supplied by the Department is all made up by the women into clothing, socks and mitts for the old people, and the ones who do the work receive so much material for their own use.\n\n\"On the Rolling River Reserve they nearly all had good gardens last year, more and better gardens than they ever had before since I have known that reserve, and I think the Women's Club should get some credit for these results. When Miss Buckley went to the reserve only two or three of the women could knit and now all the young women can knit.\"\n\nIndian Agent Moore, in his report on the Tyendinaga Reserve, dated February 3, refers to the agricultural Short Course recently conducted on the reserve under the direction of Mr. Elliott Moses. The Agent states:\n\n\"During the period January 12 to 30 agricultural, cooking and sewing short courses were held on the reserve and an exceptionally good class of 21 girls and young matrons attended the ladies' classes. Their sewing and cooking work was very proficient and all in attendance received considerable benefit from the classes. Due to the lack of young men most of whom are in service or working away from the reserve, the men's classes were not too well attended. However, they were present in sufficient numbers to make the class well worth while and some interesting and beneficial discussions took place at the lectures.\n\nMajor MacKay, in a letter to the Department dated February 13, refers to an interesting experiment in agricultural extension work undertaken by Indian Agent Christie at the Bella Coola Agency. The Commissioner in his letter states:\n\n\"I beg to advise that Mr. Indian Agent Christie organized a Boys' and Girls' Potato Club on the Bella Coola\u2014\nCoola Reserve, which has been an outstanding success, and one of the most commendable pieces of work undertaken by any Indian agent in this province during the past year. This Club is organized under the provisions of the provincial Department of Agriculture and the Canadian Council of Boys' and Girls' Clubs at Ottawa.\n\n\"Mr. Christie has submitted the list of prize winners in the club to the Department of Agriculture, and they are paying half of the $21.00 prize list, leaving a balance of $10.50, which Mr. Christie suggests should be paid by our Department. I have no hesitation in recommending that this expenditure should be authorized. I can personally vouch that the work of this club was highly satisfactory.\"\n\nIndian Agent Ball, of the Vancouver Agency, in a letter dated February 11, writes:\n\n\"The women on the Squamish Reserve have now a strong organization. Without any financial assistance from the Department, these women have undertaken all kinds of welfare work on the reserve, besides raising funds for other needs. Recently they received two great bales of worn out army socks, and they have already utilized every bit of wool in them to make clothing. This is only one of many similar activities. Rugs are made from material collected among themselves and white friends. These women also visit the aged and sick Indians, doing housekeeping for them and some home nursing.\"\n\nAgricultural operations on the Six Nations Reserve continue to make satisfactory progress. Major Randle appears to have succeeded in operating his tractors to the fullest extent possible. He appears to have succeeded, also, in persuading the Indians to utilize their own horse power in cooperation with the tractors in working out a very extensive and well-balanced agricultural program on the reserve. Large areas of land, that had become infested with weeds, have been broken up within the last two or three years and are now proving a source of revenue to their owners. Major Randle, in his report dated January 28, states:\n\n\"Weather conditions enabled our tractors to continue ploughing for a few days in December, during which time they ploughed 37 acres at eleven different farms. Then the frost came and since then all land operations have ceased.\n\n\"Our records show that during the farm season - April to mid-December - our tractors accomplished the following work on behalf of the farmers of the Six Nations and Mississauga Reserves:\n\n| Ploughed | 1,329\u00bd acres |\n|----------|--------------|\n| Tilled   | 1,359\u00bd \"     |\n| Sowed    | 131 \"        |\n| Harvested (cut with binders) | 497 \" |\n\n\"In carrying out these land operations during the season, our tractors made trips to 284 farms.\n\n\"Generally...\"\nGenerally speaking, for the Indian farmer it was a good season. Returns from the acreage cropped were good, while prices generally were considerably higher than in 1940. As a result, most of them met their maturing obligations comfortably, with a decent margin left over in grain, fodder and feed for their winter use.\n\nAs in past seasons, both Councils, with departmental approval, purchased considerable coarse grain and grass seed from their own farmers, which seed when cleaned ensures a supply of seed for distribution among those farmers requiring it in the spring.\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nMrs. Hertzberg, Ontario Commissioner, Girl Guides, Kingston, Ont.\nMr. J. L. Bryant, Indian Agent, Pelly Agency, Kamsack, Sask.\nMr. R. W. Milliken, Regina, Sask.\nRev. Canon A. Dixon, M.A., Acting Secretary, M. S. C. C.\nRev. H. Belleau, O.M.I., Vicar Apostolic of James Bay, Moosonee, Ont.\nMr. Cliff Murchinson, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, April 1, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR McILL.\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended March 31, 1942.\n\nTRAINING.\n\nIt is encouraging to learn from a number of sources that groups of young Indians, particularly teenage Indian girls, are displaying a keen interest in organized movements such as the Girl Guides Association. Mrs. H.F.H. Hertzberg, Commissioner of Girl Guides for Ontario, called at this office toward the end of February. Mrs. Hertzberg, in her interview, indicated that one of her field officials had expressed the opinion that she had at the Birch Island Indian School, Manitoulin Island Agency, one of the best girl guide groups, if not actually the best, in the province of Ontario. Immediately following Mrs. Hertzberg's visit, I communicated with the teacher of this school, Miss Eva L. Fortin. Miss Fortin, in her reply dated March 14, states:\n\n\"I have been working with this group of girl guides ever since I began teaching here 6 years ago. I am quite satisfied with the results of the Guide movement in this village. The girls have entered several contests and always with good results. I feel sure the school work has been promoted a great deal by the work of the Guides.\n\n\"As soon as the little girls of the village attain the age of reason, I invite them to come to Brownie meetings. These meetings are conducted by one of my Guides who I have trained to assume the responsibility of organizing the younger set to become Guides. This helps the little ones very much when they reach school age. When these Brownies have learned the Guide laws and grasp their significance I enroll them in the Guide Company. From then on we follow very closely the rules and regulations of the Girl Guide organization.\"\n\n\"The Victorian\", a weekly newspaper published at Perth, New Brunswick, in its issue of March 19, 1942, published an article relating to a movie show organized by the Girl Guide group of the Tobique Indian Day School. This article reads:\n\n\"Over three hundred children came from Perth and Andover and outside districts, Kilburn, Tilley, Carlingford, Tobique Narrows and Lower Perth, on Tuesday to attend a movie, 'Baby Sandy', and five shorts, which were shown at the Capitol Theatre in Andover by the Maliseet Girl Guides of Indian Point, for the benefit of the Andover-Perth Red Cross Society. The children in the local...\"\nlocal schools were given the afternoon off to see the picture. The sum of $44 was realized from the show.\n\n\"The Maliseet Girl Guides used their own movie machine, which they bought and paid for with money raised in their weaving and knitting club, and it is a splendid machine. They also used their own films and ushered at the theatre, with the help of the Andover and Perth Girl Guides. The management and staff of the Capitol Theatre were in attendance and gave freely of their help and time.\n\n\"The Maliseet Girl Guides, under the direction of the Sisters of Charity, have been doing much valuable work for the Red Cross. Last year, besides donating $25, they knitted many babies' garments for the layettes which were sent overseas.\"\n\nIndian Agent Phillips, Queen Charlotte Agency, B.C., in a letter dated March 6, refers to the Junior Red Cross that has been organized at the Massett and Skidegate Indian Day Schools. The Agent in his letter states:\n\n\"Last year, the Massett and Skidegate Indian Day Schools were organized as branches of the Junior Red Cross, under the name of the 'Haida Juniors'. Meetings are held periodically and at these news letters are read and discussed and the purposes and responsibilities of the membership stressed. Health rules are discussed and kept as closely as possible. The girls knit and make squares for woollen blankets. The boys in the meantime are making scrapbooks for a hospital. These pupils have been and still are collecting the following commodities: rubber, aluminum, glass, silver, paper, tinfoil, rags, newspapers, magazines, and tooth paste and shaving cream tubes.\n\nThrough the aims of the Junior Red Cross we hope not only to help Canada's war effort but to raise the tone of the schools and to arouse in the children a desire to serve the community and their own homes whenever an opportunity arises to do so. The children are already planning to hold a program of school sports around Easter time and to sell ice cream at the sports grounds on May 24th. The proceeds from these undertakings will be sent to the Junior Red Cross Funds.\"\n\nI am personally of the opinion that organizations such as these should be encouraged and greatly extended. They provide the Indian youth with valuable lessons in the art of self-government. They encourage him, too, to assume responsibility for the accomplishment of tasks that he can carry out better and more economically for himself than any other agency designed to help him.\n\nThe Public School Inspectors in their reports are constantly reminding us of the difficulties experienced by Indian day and residential school teachers in providing instruction to Indian pupils who enter school without a working knowledge of the English language. Inspector Ferris, in his last report on the Ahtahkskoops Day School,\nCarlton Agency, Sask., states:\n\n\"The most marked progress has been made during the past year in the pupils' command of conversational language. A good working vocabulary of words and expressions in common use has been developed. The pupils have been trained to answer questions in complete sentences.\n\n\"In the field of arithmetic, the pupils show speed and accuracy in the number facts. The drill in this activity is so organized that the weaker members of the group get extra practice. The higher grades showed skill in the formal processes as well as a fair measure of ability in the solution of problems.\n\n\"In reading, particular attention was given to the achievement of the Grade One group. This group is made up largely of pupils who entered school after the summer vacation. They had mastered at the time of my visit a vocabulary of from 60 to 100 words. The practice is followed of building up such a vocabulary before the Primer is placed in their hands. This is a sound practice. An improvement was noted too in the reading of the senior grades, more particularly with regard to fluency and expression. Mr. Bigge, who is a fully qualified teacher, holding a first class permanent certificate, conducts his school on sound psychological and pedagogical lines, adapting his methods to meet the peculiar needs of a school of this type. Mr. Bigge has continued and extended the manual work begun by his predecessor, Mr. Goodman.\"\n\nThe Ontario Department of Education, working in close cooperation with the Toronto Public and Separate School Boards, have been outstandingly successful during the last 10 or 15 years in the organization of classes for subnormal children, usually referred to as auxiliary classes. This work is under the immediate direction of two psychiatrists, Dr. Amos and Dr. Stothers. A representative of the Ontario Department of Education, who visited this Branch during the month, informed me that 80% of the girls who have passed through these classes during the last five years are now gainfully employed. This percentage does not include a number of the girls who have married during this period. The work undertaken and accomplished at these classes has received very favourable comment in American and English educational journals.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that an I. O. survey of a number of our residential schools in Ontario has been undertaken recently, under the immediate direction of Dr. Amos. A representative of the Department has already visited the following schools: Spanish, Mohawk, Shingwauk, Chapleau, Cecilia Jeffrey, Kenora and Fort Frances. A full report on this survey will be submitted to the Department immediately following the Easter holidays. In addition to this report, the first of its kind submitted to the Department, it is my intention to have Mr. Doucet visit Toronto with the object of attending the teachers' conference usually held during the Easter holiday period, to visit the auxiliary classes and to discuss with the psychiatrist attached to the Ontario Department of Education ways and means whereby our courses of study might be adjusted and brought into stricter conformity with the mental standing of the pupils in attendance at the schools where surveys have been completed.\"\nI am particularly anxious that Mr. Doucet should discuss with the officials responsible for the survey the suggestion already made to me that teachers in Indian day and residential schools should receive special training for the work in which they are engaged. It would appear that when the auxiliary classes are first organized, teachers with the ordinary academic and professional standing were employed. It was soon learned however, from experience, that these teachers were incapable of providing worthwhile courses of study, with the result that the teachers now in charge of these classes are teachers who have spent at least one year in special normal school classes. The Ontario officials are of the opinion that if we cannot provide such training for our teachers in the immediate future, we might seriously consider the advisability of providing a special summer school course for a selected number of our teachers my way of experiment.\n\nWELFARE\n\nRecent reports from Saskatchewan indicate that of the 249 men sent to Kapuskasing for work at the Spruce Falls Paper and Paper Company, approximately 84 have either returned to Saskatchewan or are at this date on the way back to the province. It would appear that none of these 64 men worked for a full month and consequently were unable to pay for their transportation costs back to the reserves. The transportation costs of 80 were authorized by Mr. Christianson, who did not feel like accepting the responsibility for allowing 20 men to remain idle in the Kapuskasing district, in view of the severe climatic conditions prevailing at that time. The other 44 appealed to both Mr. Christianson and to this Branch for the funds necessary to pay their fares and to buy the provisions required to maintain them while en route. This request has been refused. I did not feel that we were under any obligation whatever to pay transportation costs for able-bodied Indians who refused to remain at work until the end of April. Had they remained on the job until April 30, the company was prepared to pay their return fares to Saskatchewan. I must say that despite the refusal of this group of men to continue at work and the refusal of others who may have left the job since our last report was received, the experiment on the whole has been worth while. Conditions in the Battleford Agency, the agency in which most of these men were recruited, were such that had they not been sent to Kapuskasing a great many of them would have been compelled to apply for relief rations. It is quite possible, also, that a number of them have really made good and will experience little difficulty in securing work in pulpwood operations next fall.\n\nIndian Agent Simpson, in his report dated March 2, states:\n\n\"A number of Indians have been employed in hauling firewood to market for sale. Thirty-one are still employed in the pulpwood camps in Ontario, one having returned home as the result of illness. About 20 are at present...\"\npresent employed in the and lumber camps adjacent to their reserves. The fur catch reported this month was only $300.00. On the whole, however, the Indians have enjoyed a much better standard of living so far this winter than they have up to this date in any of the preceding six winters that I have been here. There has been no appeals from them for assistance in the way of food and clothing. There has been less sickness during the winter months.\"\n\nIt is somewhat disturbing to receive reports from time to time of a certain amount of lawlessness on a number of our reserves. This condition has been created, no doubt, through lack of proper police supervision, particularly R. C. M. P. patrols. I have never been able to convince myself that the ordinary Indian constable is of much value on a reserve from the standpoint of proper law enforcement or in persuading the Indian parents to send their children regularly to school. The Principal of the Anglican School on the Blood Reserve, who visited this Branch about a year ago, was greatly agitated at the time about what he termed the lawlessness and insolence of the Blood Indians. A few days ago a somewhat similar complaint was received from the Principal in charge of the Anglican School on the Blackfoot Reserve. It is regrettable that these complaints are usually embodied in confidential letters or in confidential statements that cannot be quoted. Unless the men registering these complaints from time to time are prepared to courageously support them in court, if necessary, it will be somewhat difficult to correct the condition. I note that Indian Agent Goocherham, in his report dated March 5, 1942, states:\n\n\"A nasty undercurrent, which might appear to be subversive, has been noted among the Blackfeet. I really do not think they are disloyal; I think they are just spoiled; it is a case of too much money and little or no responsibility. Some policy must be devised to make these people more self-reliant. Possibly they are no worse than any other thousand people who had been given what they receive. It makes one wonder if the much vaunted scheme of living even the ample food, shelter and clothing would not be ruined. After all, civilization shows that people only survive when they have to struggle and fight for their existence. This brings up another point - Blackfoot Indians on active service apparently do not realize their responsibility and have by every means imaginable tried to get their discharge. In fact, they are even flouting the Military Authorities at this time by being A. W. O. L. from their unit. Surely these Indians must be made to understand that in such serious times they will not be allowed to get away with this sort of thing.\"\n\nI have referred to the encouraging tendency on the part of younger Indians to join worthwhile organizations. It is encouraging, too, to be able to report that the older Indians, particularly the older women, are\n\ncontinuing -\ncontinuing to do good work in the Homemakers' Clubs. Indian Agent Booth, in his report dated March 8, states:\n\n\"The Homemakers' Clubs are doing very useful work and continue their meetings regularly. Some of the work is really good. I think that some of the Indian women have shown more pride in their homes since these clubs were inaugurated; bed sheets, pillow cases and quilts are now in evidence in many homes; curtains are appearing on the windows and the Indian women have been raising house plants successfully. Generally speaking, the homes have greatly improved.\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nRev. J O. Plourde, O.M.I., Winnipeg, Manitoba;\nRev. George Dorsey, Associate Secretary, Board of Home Missions, United Church, Toronto;\nCaptain Cummins, Manitoulin Island;\nMr. Askew, Valentine Black Co.;\nMiss De Leporte, Department of Education, Toronto.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\"\nOttawa, May 1, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR McGUIE:\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended April 30, 1942.\n\nWELFARE:\n\nA circular letter and garden chart was sent out to Inspectors and Indian Agents early in the month. The letter is designed to stimulate interest among Indians in the cultivation and care of subsistence gardens. A copy of this letter, sent to representatives of the Roman Catholic, Presbyterian and United Churches, has resulted in requests for additional copies of the chart. We have been assured by the churches that the missionaries working under their direction on Indian reserves will do everything possible to cooperate with us in the organization of garden projects and in the promotion of a worthwhile agricultural program this year.\n\nAn extensive gardening program will be undertaken on the Eskasoni Reserve, Nova Scotia, by Mr. Alex. Macdonald, who has been transferred from the Pocomaugh School to Eskasoni for this purpose. A somewhat similar program is already under way at Shubenacadie, under the nominal direction of the Reverend Father Wesley and under the supervision of the farming instructor in charge of the farm at the Shubenacadie Residential School. It will thus be seen that both these programs will be well under way prior to the appointment of an Indian agent and clerk at each reserve. This program in Nova Scotia, if climatic conditions are at all favourable, should result in substantial reductions in our relief costs throughout the winter months.\n\nA number of encouraging reports on the Short Courses conducted under the direction of Mr. Elliott Moses recently reached the Department. Indian Agent J. T. Daley, in his report on the Walpole Island Agency, dated March 31, states:\n\n\"Possibly the most outstanding thing on the reserve this month was the Short Course held in the council hall. The men's study course was in charge of Elliott Moses and the women's and girls' classes under the supervision of Mrs. Donald and Miss Elsie Cameron. Personally, I do not believe that too much stress can be laid on these courses. It is my opinion that a great deal of encouragement and inspiration has been furnished Indian farmers on this reserve by these studies. Our Indians are certainly interested when they walk a distance of 4 miles in stormy weather to take part in the discussions.\n\nIndian Agent Featherstone, Rama Agency, in his report dated April 2, states:\n\n\"During...\"\nDuring the week March 23-27 Mr. Moses, assisted by Miss Cameron and Mrs. Monture, conducted a Short Course on this reserve. This was the first time that a Short Course of this kind had been conducted at Rama. Twenty attended the women's classes and everyone was quite pleased with the results. Most of the Indian men being away working, their meetings were not so well attended but resulted, I hope, in some stimulation to the gardening efforts.\n\nAn interesting experiment in what one might term immediate post-school instruction has been undertaken on the Woodstock Reserve by Sister Emilia. In her quarterly report dated March 31, 1948, she states:\n\n\"I am pleased to report that these classes have been very successful, both boys and girls taking a keen interest in all their work. They have taken special pride in the domestic science kitchen, especially since we have the kitchen painted and repaired last spring. In the sewing class the girls have recently each completed a dress, apron and towel. They have also made curtains for the sewing room hall and function rooms. We hold cooking classes regularly once a week and the classes meet by those in attendance are often served with milk as refreshments. We have also helped a number of the married women to make quilts with odds and ends left over from different pieces of material. A number of nice quilts have already been made on the reserve by the women.\"\n\nIndian Agent McPherson, in his report on the Clandeboye Agency, Manitoba, dated April 1, refers to the herd of goats at Berens River and the benefit of this herd to the members of the band. Mr. McPherson states:\n\n\"We have approximately 20 head of goats on the Berens River Reserve. These goats have all wintered well and have been of great benefit to the band. Some of the Indians on the Fort Alexander Reserve are also going in for raising goats and sheep. One family on this reserve have for a number of years spun their own wool and were able to supply themselves with socks, sweaters, etc., made from wool procured from their own sheep.\"\n\nThe first reference to an Indian potlatch that has been brought to my attention since I entered the Department has been sent forward by Indian Agent Todd, Kwakwaka'wakw Agency, B.C. The Agent, in his report for March, states:\n\n\"Most of the Indians of this agency have been profitably employed during the past month. Some have been engaged in clam digging while others have been working at various occupations such as logging and unskilled labour at the new Air Port now under construction at Fort Rupert.\n\nThroughout the year practically all the Indians of this agency have been engaged in the fishing industry and I should like to report that 1941 was the best year financially, for the Indians since I have been agent. Some of them have used their surplus money in improving their homes, while others purchased boats and fishing gear.\"\nregret very much to report, however, that with this surplus cash some of the Indians have returned to their old Indian custom, carrying it on to a greater extent than for many years past. It has been reported to me that some Indians were giving potlatches this winter and giving away large sums of money as well as goods. I have personally discussed this matter with some of the leaders and suggested to them that they should put their money into Victory Bonds and thus help the war effort and give up this custom. This practice seems to be so deeply rooted here that it comes first over everything.\"\n\nA number of Indians on the Tyendinaga Reserve entered into contracts about a year ago for the production of vegetables for certain canning factories. It would appear that the contractual obligations entered into at that time have been carried out in a manner satisfactory to both parties. Indian Agent Moore, in his report dated April 1, states:\n\n\"A large number of contracts are being taken by reserve residents, to plant canning crops of peas, tomatoes and corn. There has been considerable competition among local canners in obtaining these contracts from Indians. A large quantity of literature has been secured by this office from the Ontario Forestry Branch and distributed among the Indians. It is our hope that this will encourage the people to acquire and plant young trees. A number of applications for trees have already gone forward.\"\n\nTRAINING:\n\nMr. Doucet is at present engaged in the organization of vocational courses at residential schools in Saskatchewan. These courses are somewhat similar to the courses organized at the residential schools of Alberta about a year ago. In addition to the organization of these courses, Mr. Doucet has been asked to undertake an educational survey of a number of Indian reserves, with the object of determining whether or not Indian day schools or improved Indian day schools would, if established, supply the educational needs of these Indians. He will also, while in the West, visit one or two residential schools and one or two improved Indian day schools in North and South Dakota.\n\nA report on the destruction of the classroom building at the File Hills Residential School reached us early in the month, and a second report from the Superintendent of Indian Agencies at Regina indicates that this building may have been deliberately destroyed by two or three Indian pupils. These pupils have already been arrested and will come up for trial in due course.\n\nAn interesting and encouraging report, dated April 8, has been received from Miss Bessie French, Principal of the Port Simpson (United Church) Indian Residential School. Miss French states:\n\n\"Your letter which arrived with the report form made me want to sit down and tell you all about us. I sometimes think that the only information the Department officials...\"\nofficials ever get about Indian schools is a tale of discouragement, want and woe. I think, however, that there are bright spots in most of our Indian work. We certainly have our share of encouragement here.\n\nWith reference to organizations for ex-pupils, Port Simpson is organized to cover every age group within the church. With the exception of a young men's group, all are effective organizations. We have a group for all unmarried graduates of this school and older girls of the village of about their age and with similar interests. This same group forms my Sunday School class. We meet twice a month, once for study and worship and once for music and handicraft work. The members of the group seem to enjoy these gatherings and I believe they have an influence for good.\n\nWith reference to the girls who have graduated since 1939, 4 are nicely married. Three of these live on the Nass River at Kincolith. These girls always visit us here when they come to Port Simpson. I hear from them often and they seem to be a part of the church life on the reserve. One graduate sings in the choir and helps with Sunday School work.\n\nThe five unmarried girls are also doing very nicely. One works for the local doctor, one works here in our school laundry, one is employed at the cannery in Prince Rupert, and two are at home, living with their parents. All are clean, respectable looking girls. They attend church regularly and Sunday school, sing in the church choir, attend my midweek meetings and take an active part in all the activities of the village.\n\nOne very encouraging feature of our work is the spirit of the girls this year. I believe for the most part that they are here to learn and are trying hard. The parents and guardians have shown their appreciation by donations of fish to the school and have provided practically all their girls' clothing. This is a big help to us and good for them as well as the girls. I wish it were possible to tax each parent or guardian who has a child in this school, if only a little, to encourage a spirit of giving rather than getting.\"\n\nInspector W. MacMillan, in his report on the Chapleau (C. E.) Residential School, states:\n\n\"The work of this school is progressing very favourably under the direction of Canon Vale, the Principal. The two members of the staff are outstanding teachers. The results obtained by the pupils in the written tests compare favourably with the best results obtained recently in the public school tests of the Inspectorate. The boys and girls are neat and clean in appearance and seem to be well cared for. A fine spirit of cooperation is evident in each of the rooms. The work is well organized and discipline is excellent.\"\n\nYou will remember that Mr. D. S. Pitts, who had been for a number of years assistant principal at the\n\nMohawk-\nMohawk Institute, became principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey (Presbyterian) Residential School about a year ago. Mr. Pitts is a fully qualified teacher and is not a clergyman.\n\nInspector R. S. McBurney, in his report on this school, dated March 23, states:\n\n\"Mrs. Douglas (Second Class Permanent, Saskatchewan) is an experienced teacher and has been at this school for a number of years. Her results in writing and in \"r\" are remarkably good. The pupils are quite proficient in spelling and reading and have considerable information gleaned from social studies. They are quite good at memorizing. The classroom register is carefully kept. Grade 2 has school all day and the other grades have school half time and work half time. The Principal, Mr. D. S. Pitts, has the cooperation of his staff and has a school that is doing remarkably good work. It was to me an education and a real pleasure to visit this school.\"\n\nThe Inspector continues:\n\n\"Mr. Rusaw (Second Class, Ontario) is an excellent teacher and is doing exceptionally good work. He is an enthusiast in manual training and as a result the pupils of the school are making many interesting things. His basketry is good. I was quite interested in the rustic chairs and beds that he is having the pupils make. He is also an enthusiast in horticulture and throughout the building are several potted plants in bloom. The presentation of his lesson material is excellent. He is putting forth a great effort to have some individual response and is succeeding. The classroom is clean and bright.\"\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nMr. J. S. Watt, Hudson's Bay Company, Rupert's House, Que.;\nMr. Justice Robson, Winnipeg, Man.;\nHonourable W. R. Clubb, Winnipeg, Man.;\nReverend J. O. Plourde, O.M.I., Winnipeg, Man.;\nRt. Rev. Jos. Guy, O.M.I., Bishop of Gravelbourg, Sask.;\nRt. Rev. H. Belleau, O.M.I., Vicar Apostolic of James Bay;\nInspector of Agencies, C. P. Schmidt, Calgary, Alberta;\nMr. Askew, Valentine Black Co.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, June 1, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR McILL.\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended May 31, 1942.\n\nWELFARE:\n\nIt will be necessary to exercise considerable care when comparing relief and welfare expenditures for the present year with somewhat similar expenditures for the fiscal year 1941-42.\n\nThe cost of certain farming operations, the purchase of machinery, gasoline, etc., on a number of reserves, which were until about seven months ago paid from fund funds, are now paid from the regular welfare appropriation. The Medical Services have until now purchased the clothing necessary for inmates of hospitals and mental institutions. Dr. Moore has on more than one occasion discussed with me the advisability of having the cost of this clothing borne by the welfare rather than the medical division. He is of the opinion - and I am disposed to agree with him - that this is a legitimate charge on the welfare appropriation. The most serious encroachment on our welfare appropriation, however, will result from certain services, the cost of which has been until now charged to the cost of general administration. It would appear that farming instructors in the Prairie Provinces are used as teamsters by the agents to deliver supplies such as flour, bacon, lard, discarded military clothing, etc., to destitute Indians instead of such supplies from time to time. In view of the fact that the horses and wagons at agency headquarters have not been distributed to Indians, it will be necessary to hire teams when such teams are available to undertake this work. Just what the actual cost for the year will be is somewhat difficult to determine at this date. Vouchers that have already reached the Department would indicate, however, that the costs are likely to be substantial.\n\nIndian Agent Waddy, in a letter dated May 5, 1942, states:\n\n\"Regarding your letter, 48-121, of May 2, last, asking for more details on voucher No. 18, for trucking supplies, this is as good a time as any to get this business explained, as you will have a lot more similar items and they have nothing whatever to do with the serious times we are experiencing. The fact is, we have taken teams away...\"\nfrom farming instructors and told them that the remaining team should be used for administration only. Therefore they cannot haul freight as they did in past years. No Indian on the destitute list is equipped to haul freight from the station, or he would not be on the list of mine, and no other Indian will haul government freight free. Your best system, in my judgment, is to make your purchases for delivery at the reserve. Most flour mills have trucks and would bid on these terms; then you would not see the freight bills and would not worry about them. Of course, the freight would be charged just the same but under cover. There will be more freight bills from time to time, in fact I have some here right now, but you may be assured I am keeping them down to the minimum.\"\n\nIn other words, it would appear that in the past farming instructors were not in reality farming instructors at all but teamsters and general labourers at agency headquarters, and that the task of delivering supplies from the point of delivery on the railway to agency headquarters and from agency headquarters to Indian homes on the reserve kept them fairly busy employed throughout the year; not only were they called upon to haul flour, bacon, etc., for destitute Indians, but they were called upon as well to haul and deliver wood and in many cases water. In my judgment it will be necessary, therefore, at the close of the present fiscal year, to carefully estimate the cost of such deliveries under the new policy and determine at that time whether or not it would be more profitable to maintain teams and engage labourers for this work.\n\nThe demand for Indian girls for domestic work in homes and at hospitals appears at the present time to exceed the demand. We have had requests this month from a large number of women in Ottawa who are anxious to secure Indian girls for domestic employment. We have also had urgent requests from the Ottawa General Hospital and the Tyndale Inn. We have succeeded at this date in securing employment for about eight girls. The reports on the work of these girls, so far, have been reasonably satisfactory.\n\nIndian Agent Waite, in his report on the Portage la Prairie Agency, dated April 30, states:\n\n\"One thousand nine hundred and ninety-six pounds of alfalfa seed was sold to the A. E. McKenzie Company for seed and netted $436.26. This sum has been credited to the Lake Manitoba Farm Account. Messrs. Lang Brothers bought 600 sacks of potatoes from the Long Plain Home Farm at 55 cents a bag, netting $320.00. In addition to this, sufficient potatoes have been kept to furnish all the Indians of the Long Plain Reserve with first class seed.\"\n\nInspector Hamilton, in commenting upon this report, in a letter dated May 4, states:\n\n\"The sale of alfalfa seed, amounting to $436.26, is a real achievement and a line of farming very desirable at the present time. You will note also that...\"\n$320.00 was obtained for 600 sacks of potatoes. The price of $5.00 is low, but even at that the returns more than paid for the work, and our land is clean and in good shape as the result of the crop.\"\n\nMiss A. Eaton appears to be doing exceptionally good work, not only at the North Peguis School, where her classroom work appears to be very satisfactory, but also on the reserve. A report for the period of January to Easter, sent forward by Inspector Hamilton, reads as follows:\n\n\"It is with great pleasure I begin this report, first noting what has been done in spinning; as in this craft real progress has been made. Three women have bought spinning wheels of their own, and two other women are getting them in the near future.\n\n\"Mrs. John Manningway, as well as getting her husband to buy her a wheel, has also got him to buy a sheep. They are exceedingly proud of these possessions, and I am very pleased as the getting of them was done entirely off their own bat. I hope they are fortunate in their venture as I am sure others will follow. Two of my families now have started in with sheep.\n\n\"The spinning wheel in school was put to good service being used practically every evening the last two weeks in January and the whole of February. Some women who cannot spin are beginning to do something about it themselves.\n\n\"All the school children this winter have had good warm stockings and mitts made from wool spun and knitted on the Reserve.\n\n\"In home economics I have kept in mind the matter of cooking for economy and nutrition, trying to wean them from the extensive use of the frying pan and to go in more for soups and stews.\n\n\"Gardening time is at hand and I have every hope that the women will rise to the occasion. They are becoming more conscious of the health value of vegetables, and I know many of them are intending to put in larger gardens.\n\n\"Mid-March we started a gardening project in school, putting in tomato seeds; our object being to get early plants and so try to get ripe tomatoes on the vines.\"\n\nIn his report for the month of April, Acting Indian Agent McMillan refers to the proposal to employ Japanese in the harvesting of sugar beets and the effect that this employment is likely to have on the Indian population. Mr. McMillan states:\n\n\"May I have the privilege of drawing to the attention of the Department the fact that I am going to\nlose a considerable amount of outside work for my unemployed Indians, owing to the fact that an effort is being made by the Beet Growers' Association to place about 500 Japanese families now being moved into this district. This number of Japs will practically take over all the beet contracts. This has always been a place where the Indians have been able to make enough to purchase their winter clothing and also bring back money to the reserve in the Fall. I am bringing this point forward at the present time for the reason that if the work in the beet fields is lost I will have heavier destitute expenditures next winter.\"\n\nTRAINING.\n\nReports reaching the Department indicate that an unusually large number of Indian day school teachers will resign from their positions at the end of the present academic year. It is altogether likely that we shall experience the utmost difficulty in securing the number of teachers necessary to conduct our schools during the academic year 1942-43. Representatives of the United Church, with whom we have discussed this matter, intimate that they, too, are experiencing difficulty in securing qualified teachers for the residential schools. They inform us, also, that it is almost impossible to secure domestic help and farm hands for these institutions.\n\nInspector Gordon Young, in his report on the Mount Elgin residential School, Muncie, Ontario, dated April 29 and 30, states:\n\n\"In previous reports the vocational work at this school has been mentioned. Only changes or variations from the regular routine will be enumerated in this report.\n\n\"The girls are doing considerable knitting, in addition to the regular work in sewing, cooking and household management.\n\n\"The dining room and kitchen have been brightened up with a new coat of paint. These rooms have a much more cheerful appearance now. The dormitories and sewing room are in good condition. Three new sewing machines have recently been added.\n\n\"Weaving has been discontinued for the duration of the war. This has led to the loss of one teacher.\n\n\"Since Mr. Johnson, the vocational instructor, left, Mr. Strapp, the Principal, has had to take the major portion of the shop and general hand work. Under his efficient leadership, the boys have overhauled all the farm machinery, constructed a cold storage bin, painted the dining room and kitchen and have made many repairs to the woodwork about the buildings. This work has given the...\"\nboys practical training in woodwork and in cement mixing.\n\nMr. Richardson - the farming instructor, and the boys look after the lawns, shrubs and flower beds.\n\nIn the matter of cultural training, considerable progress is made out of regular school hours by the organization of group games, under the leadership of different members of the staff. Instruction in music is under the direction of Miss Sibbald and Miss Morris and choir work is under the direction of Miss Smith.\n\nThis institution gives these young people a very desirable type of education. While economic pressure has led to a reduction of the staff, the remaining members have assumed the responsibility of carrying on and appear to be giving good service, even though they are carrying heavy loads.\n\nSome of the suggestions respecting individual needs of pupils and provision for promotion and advancement have been adopted. It is not easy, however, to apply these suggestions in view of the large classes.\n\nI have noticed in the Indian day schools on this reserve several new primary reading books, particularly the basic readers sold by J. J. Gage and Company. These are particularly good for children having difficulty in learning to read English. A supply of them would be valuable in your primary room at the residential school.\"\n\nI might add that the Mount Elgin Institute is one of the oldest Indian residential schools and is operated by the United Church of Canada. It is the only residential school operated by the United Church in the province of Ontario. It is exceedingly difficult, in view of the age of the buildings, to keep it in a state of repair, but the present Principal, the Reverend O. B. Strang, who is himself a very skilled mechanic, has succeeded to an extent that is worthy of commendation.\n\nThe Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School, Lloydminster, Sask., has been for a number of years fortunate in having in charge of its classrooms two teachers both of whom were university graduates - Miss Helen V. Parsons, B.A., and Miss Margaret R. Armitage, B.A. The last report received from Inspector A. R. Brown, however, suggests that these teachers are no longer in charge. Instead, the teachers employed are Miss Eleanor P. Fiddler - no professional standing - and Miss Jessie R. Phoenix, who it would appear, had a first class Saskatchewan Interim, which has now lapsed. The report of the Inspector on the work of these two new teachers is interesting and significant. In his report on Miss Fiddler, the Inspector states:\n\nAn impossible situation is created by placing 45 Indian children in charge of an inexperienced, untrained teacher. Miss Fiddler does exceptionally well, considering her deficiencies and the enrolment. Grade I consists of a high percentage of pupils who do not understand English. Twenty\nsuch pupils would be a maximum for a teacher skilled in teaching non-English pupils.\"\n\nThe Inspector adds:\n\n\"Miss Phoenix, while willing, is out of date in her methods. She follows rigid academic procedures. She has not developed a complete program as laid down in the Saskatchewan curriculum. I doubt whether she can make a successful adaptation to better methods and the requirements of Indian work.\"\n\nThe instruction given at Indian residential schools has never been, in the judgment of many, wholly satisfactory, and reports such as these are very disturbing. To place an untrained teacher in charge of a large group of Indian pupils, few of whom have even an elementary knowledge of the English language, is in my judgment a sheer waste of public funds. Just what can be done to remedy the condition, however, is a matter in respect to which I am not in a position at the moment to express an opinion. The acute shortage of teachers no existing; the over-crowding of classrooms and the work at our residential schools, generally, will be fully discussed with representatives of the Churches, immediately following the conference at the office of the Deputy Minister on June 3. It is just possible, also, that Mr. Doucet, immediately following his extensive visit to the schools in Saskatchewan, will bring back a number of helpful suggestions.\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nRev. B. Reinville, O.M.I., Principal, Wabasca Residential School, Wabasca, Alberta;\n\nRev. J. P. Mulvihill, O.M.I., Principal, Christie Residential School, Kakawis, B.C.;\n\nRight Rev. M. Lajeunesse, O.M.I., Bishop of Keewatin, The Pas, Manitoba;\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I., Winnipeg, Manitoba;\n\nRev. H. B. Cochrane, D.D., Secretary Home Mission Board, United Church, Toronto, Ont.;\n\nMr. Maurice E. Bastien, Lorette Indian Agency, Que.;\n\nMr. Geo. T. Downs, Indian Agent, Caradoc Agency, Muncey, Ont.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, July 1, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCILL:\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended June 30, 1942.\n\nTRAINING\n\nI have referred on more than one occasion to the interest taken in our Indian schools in the province of Alberta by the Provincial Department of Education and particularly by Dr. G. Fred McNally, the Deputy Minister. Dr. McNally has discussed with me during his periodical visits to Ottawa the work being done whereby in his judgment the courses of study at Indian day schools could be improved. He always aims at visiting two or three of our schools during the course of an academic year. It is interesting to note that he and G. H. Ross, Esq., Director of Health and Recreation of the province of Alberta, visited the schools in the Grouard area a few weeks ago. Dr. McNally, in his letter to Sister Jean, immediately following his visit to Grouard, states as follows:\n\n\"I should like you to know how much Mr. Ross and I appreciated the opportunity we had last week of seeing something of the work of the St. Bernard Mission. Not to make my letter too long, I shall confine my comments to two or three matters.\n\n\"First, we were greatly impressed with the neatness and home-likeness of the classrooms of the school. Indeed, I cannot remember when I have seen rooms so spick and span. Coupled with this was the evident happiness of the children. I had formed that opinion of the Mission children from reading the \"Echoes\" but was hardly prepared to find the feeling so general.\n\n\"Then we were so pleased with the Health and Recreation program. The degree of excellence reached by both girls and boys would have done credit to classes which had been in training much longer than those at the Mission. Nor must I forget the splendid baths. These, I am sure, account in large measure for the healthy, happy appearance of all the children. On our way home Mr. Ross commented more than once on the high standard of results which you have attained.\n\n\"And, lastly, I must mention again what I said when speaking to the children. The Mission provides a first-rate opportunity for an all-round education. In addition to the regular school subjects the girls get training in the domestic arts under conditions which...\"\napproach nearly to those to be found in the homes which we hope they are going to have. A similar training on the farm for the boys will make the opportunity complete. I can think of hundreds of boys and girls in Alberta for whom I could wish just such a well-balanced education.\n\n\"Our visit was all too short but left us with a definite desire to repeat it.\"\n\nYou may remember that Sisters were employed for the first time at the beginning of the present academic year at the Christian Island N. C. Indian Day School. Inspector J. M. Bennett, in his report on this school, dated May 6, 1942, states:\n\n\"Under the direction of Sister Black and taught by Sister Daley, work in economics has been well done. Samples of the work in sewing, knitting, stitching, etc., reflect interesting and valuable work. Aprons, mitts, scarfs, etc., have been made. Some instruction in cooking was also given to the older girls. This phase of school work is most valuable to these people. The pupils are also engaged in the remodelling of discarded military clothing.\n\n\"The children sing well, with admirable expression. They showed their capabilities on a range of pieces for me. Two of the older girls have been instructed in playing the piano.\n\n\"I heard all the pupils read; saw their workbooks and writing; gave some lessons in spelling and arithmetic; inspected their art work; and conversed with them to learn their ability in English, since they do not talk much English outside the school. They are progressing quite well in all these studies.\n\n\"Sister Black has given directions to adults in First Aid work. Social work for the sick is also being undertaken.\"\n\nThe following article, by Mildred Valley Thornton, appeared in the Vancouver Sun of June 2, 1942:\n\n\"Interesting news to art lovers in this province comes from the Royal Drawing Society in London, England, announcing the results of their war-time competition.\n\n\"In this competition, which is open to all parts of the Empire, no less than three awards went to children of the Inukseep Reserve in the Okanagan, which has often been in the public eye owing to the success of the Indian artist Sis-uh-lk and of the drama presentations of its children, some of which were broadcast last fall over CBR.\n\n\"In the drawing competition, Johnny Stalkia won a bronze star for 'The Animal Dance', painted on a...\"\nbuckskin; Edith Kruger won a silver star for her illustration of a scene from the Indian Nativity play, and a bronze star also went to Bertha Baptiste, and sister of Sis-uh-lk, for her beadwork design of a deer and fawn.\n\nTen of the most interesting entries from the exhibition were taken to Buckingham Palace for the Queen to see and two of these were the work of Inkamcap children, Johnny Stalkin and Edith Kruger.\n\nThe success of Anthony Walsh, teacher of this reserve, in bringing to fruition the talent of these children, has been nothing less than phenomenal, proving beyond doubt that many of the Indian children have talent and inherent ability equivalent to that which brought fame to their forbears as one of the most original and artistic native races in the world.\n\n\"The inspired and sympathetic guidance of devoted teachers and opportunities equal to our own is all that is needed to give it expression.\"\n\nIn a circular letter dated May 18, 1937, residential school principals and Indian agents were asked to establish a \"follow-up\" system during the ensuing five year period and were supplied with printed forms for this purpose.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that the first of these returns have reached us from Indian Agent Daunt, New Westminster Agency, B. C. The returns give the history of seven pupils, four of whom attended the St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School, and three, the Conualeetza Residential School. The reports on the whole are somewhat encouraging. They cover the progress of the pupil year by year and give details of the work in which he is engaged. The following examples indicate to some extent the progress made by the pupils:\n\nAdolph Felix, No. 382, was discharged at the age of 16 and left school with a good knowledge of gardening and manual training. The first three years he remained at home helping his parents at farming and wood-cutting. At the end of the fourth year he married a girl of the Pemberton Reserve. At the end of the fifth year he is described as a good husband and provider, living at Pemberton.\n\nEvangeline Ambrose, No. 0429, was discharged at the age of 17, at which time her parents were both dead. This girl has been living for the last five years with her grandmother and has been successful in both gardening and housekeeping.\n\nJosephine Williams, No. 0361, was discharged from school at the age of 17; left school with a good knowledge of domestic science, home nursing and handicrafts; and had completed Grade VII at Conualeetza. This girl married immediately following her departure from school and has since her marriage lived on the Scooahlie Reserve. She had a baby son at the end of the fourth year.\nEdith Williams, No. 0409, was discharged from Coqualeetza at the age of 16. Her health is described as \"not very good - had been given special treatment in school preventorium\". This girl married Hugh Kelly two years after her discharge from school. During the third year she and her husband built a new home at Kilgard. A baby daughter was born in October, 1933.\n\nMyrtle Kelly, No. 0506, was discharged from school at the age of 18. She took a special course in Home Economics. She had completed Grade XII, which is equivalent to first year university. This girl married Robert Sepass immediately following her discharge from school. A baby son was born in 1929. The fourth year she and her husband built a new home on the Skulkayn Reserve. The fifth year her husband was admitted to Coqualeetza Indian hospital with tuberculosis. The mother abandoned the home and returned to Sumas Reserve and is now living with her father and mother.\n\nWELFARE\n\nA statement of expenditures just received from the Treasury Office indicates that relief and welfare costs for the fiscal year 1941-42 amounted to $707,356.83, compared with an expenditure of $889,088.34 for the preceding year. This represents a net reduction of $175,731.51. In connection with these expenditures, it is necessary to point out, however, that $40,00 was spent from last year's appropriation for the purchase of Indian reserve lands at Tsaksoni and Shubenacadie. Welfare expenditures, therefore, for the last year, appear to have reached a figure as low as any figure reached at any time in recent years. The following is a table of welfare expenditures for the fiscal years 1930-31 to 1941-42, inclusive:\n\n| Fiscal Year | Expended       |\n|-------------|----------------|\n| 1920-31     | $704,705.68    |\n| 1921-32     | $725,591.24    |\n| 1922-33     | $655,723.83    |\n| 1923-34     | $652,368.49    |\n| 1924-35     | $645,457.71    |\n| 1925-36     | $695,161.68    |\n| 1926-37     | $982,527.84    |\n| 1927-38     | $1,055,791.55-including $195,000 in special welfare |\n| 1928-39     | $979,242.72    |\n| 1929-40     | $984,770.44    |\n| 1930-41     | $885,928.34    |\n| 1941-42     | $707,356.83    |\n\nThe highest expenditures, $124,253.38, as against an expenditure of $200,586.48, were incurred in the province of Quebec. It will thus be seen that while expenditures in Quebec remain high, the reduction has been quite substantial. For some reason that is difficult to explain in view of crop conditions, expenditures in\nManitoba remain higher than in either of the other Western Provinces - $83,250.19 compared with $83,118.48 last year, while expenditures in Alberta have come down from $65,545.75 last year to an expenditure of $56,481.18.\n\nThe Seventh Precipitation Report, published by the Searle Grain Company, Limited, shows that the total moisture condition for the three prairie provinces weighted and averaged for both stubble and summerfallow land on June 15th was 93% of normal, as compared with 87% at this time a year ago. On crops seeded on stubble land, which have reserves of moisture from last fall and this current season, the condition is now 100% of normal compared with 88% a year ago.\n\nThe total moisture condition in Alberta on June 15th was 91% of normal, as compared with 78% a year ago.\n\nFor Saskatchewan the total moisture condition is now 86% compared with 83% a year ago.\n\nIn Manitoba the total moisture condition is now 128% as compared with 126% a year ago.\n\nIt will thus be seen that crop conditions in the Prairie Provinces are on the whole more favourable than they have been at any time in recent years. Acting Indian Agent McMillan, in his report on the Blood Agency dated June 2, 1942, states:\n\n\"The prospects for this year are excellent; the wet weather has brought on the grass and it should be one of the best years for hay that we have had for 10 years. Growth has been prolific. A great effort will be made to have a large hay crop taken off and this should assist many Indians to get along during the winter months.\"\n\n\"Most of the Indians are on the land and not many have left for outside work. However, the Indians that are out working are making a very fair wage - averaging from $30 to $40 per month. I have just been advised that there is a request for 7,000 berry pickers in British Columbia, and I am writing the Mission City Board of Trade for further advice and information.\"\n\nA few weeks ago our Inspectors and Indian Agents were asked to do everything possible to stimulate interest in the salvaging of rubber on their reserves, and the reports to date appear to be very gratifying. Indian Agent Gooderham, in his report for June, states:\n\n\"To date, more than six tons of rubber has been brought in and a great deal of this was tires. Here it comes from, we do not know, but it is here - which goes to show what is possible and what waste there is in this free and easy democratic way of living.\"\n\nA striking illustration of what can be done by Indians to become increasingly self-supporting is supplied\nby Indian Agent Gooderham in the same report. He states:\n\n\"It will be remembered that an attempt was made last fall to start a Calf Club on the reserve. However, only one girl faithfully fed and cared for her calf throughout the winter. This girl was Julia Three Suns, an ex-patient of the San. Julia's calf was permitted in the sale of calves from such clubs at Calgary on the 28th. It was not the best nor the worst calf at the sale, but it brought her a good solid price of 15\u00a2 per pound\u2014a gross price to her of $97.50. It is hoped that the publicity of this will stimulate interest among school children and that a larger club will be started this fall.\"\n\nA number of agents appear to have made a sincere attempt to encourage the cultivation of subsistence gardens. Indian Agent Booth, in his report on the Ku'apelle Agency for June, states:\n\n\"There is more activity in Indian gardens this year. Farming instructors are paying more attention to this phase of their work. On the whole, I consider that we will have an increase of over 50% in acreage sown to gardens this season. There appears to be a steady demand for Indian girls for work in the country and I have found positions for six girls in the immediate vicinity.\"\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nRev. F. O'Grady, O.M.I., Principal, Indian Residential School, Kamloops, B. C.;\nRev. Geo. Forbes, O.M.I., Principal, Indian Residential School, Kootenay, B. C.\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I., Winnipeg, Man.;\nRev. Dr. R. B. Cochrane, United Church Mission Board;\nRev. Dr. George Dorey,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, August 1, 1942.\n\nMemorandum\n\nDOCTOR MOLLIN:\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended July 31, 1942.\n\nWELFARE:\n\nIn my report for June I submitted figures indicating relief and welfare costs for the last fiscal year. The following is a table of per capita welfare and relief costs for the fiscal year 1941-42, by provinces:\n\n| Province          | Per Capita Cost |\n|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Nova Scotia       | $25.10          |\n| Prince Edward Island | $16.95         |\n| New Brunswick     | $19.17          |\n| Quebec            | $6.83           |\n| Ontario           | $2.98           |\n| Manitoba          | $5.35           |\n| Saskatchewan      | $6.28           |\n| Alberta           | $4.75           |\n| British Columbia  | $4.21           |\n| Northwest Territories | $4.26        |\n| Yukon             | $7.90           |\n\nIt will be noted that the highest costs - $25.10 - were incurred in the province of Nova Scotia. The per capita figures by agencies show that the costs in King's County, Nova Scotia, amounting to $77.13 per capita, were the highest agency relief costs in the Dominion. Expenditures in Ontario, amounting to $2.98 per capita, were lower than corresponding costs in British Columbia. This is the first time in recent years that welfare costs in Ontario have been lower than costs in British Columbia. As a matter of fact, expenditures in Ontario, with the exception of the Chapleau, Golden Lake, James Bay, Sioux Lookout and Sault Ste. Marie Agencies, are almost negligible.\n\nEncouraging reports have reached the Division during the month in respect to the attempts made at a number of agencies to organize worthwhile gardening projects. Mr. J. A. Finlay, United Church Missionary at Hartley Bay, Keena Agency, B.C., in a letter dated July 24, states:\n\n\"A copy of your circular letter of April 7th., 1942, was forwarded to me, and, following your suggestion in it, concerning a report on gardens, I am pleased to furnish information on the subject as it affects this reserve.\n\n\"The people here, numbering approximately 140, have on the whole made use of as much ground as is suitable for the growing of vegetables. With two exceptions, every house in the village has...\"\nits garden, in which potatoes, carrots, turnips, beets, and green\nproduce such as lettuce and cabbage are grown. In addition, several\nlarge potato patches have been planted. Raspberries and small fruits\nsuch as raspberries, red and black currants and gooseberries are\nalso being cultivated. The owners of these intend to can them, while\nnearly all the families pick and can huckleberries. Despite the\nunsuitability of the soil, due to extreme sourness, exceptional\nresults have been obtained.\n\nDr. T. J. Oxford, James Bay Agency, who has been\nparticularly successful in his attempts to encourage Indians to\ncultivate vegetable gardens and construct root-houses, in a letter\ndated July 3, states:\n\n\"With last year's success behind us, we hope to do\neven better this season in the production of vegetables and, as you\nknow, we have branched out into garden crops other than potatoes.\nAn encouraging note in this respect is the request of the Albany\nIndians for more tools to prepare gardens. These have been supplied.\nThey also request a chance to grow such vegetables as carrots, turnips,\nparsnips and green vegetables such as lettuce, onions and radishes.\nThe Ogoki Indians have also asked for larger supplies of these variet-\nies of vegetables.\n\n\"Our storage problem is taken care of mainly by community\nroot-houses. At Ogoki this is a simple matter of digging into a clay-\nloam high bank. There is a 10 foot long entrance to the root-house\nwith an outer and inner heavy insulated door. These doors are\ninsulated with dry moss. The walls and roof of the entrance are three\nfeet below the surface. The roof is solid soil upon which is packed\nthe earth removed from the root-house, mixed with moss, making a\ncovering of about 7 feet in depth.\n\n\"At Moose Factory our present root-house, with a\ncapacity of approximately 300 bushels, is constructed somewhat\ndifferently. We require a new and much larger one which will be built\nthis summer on the same principle.\"\n\nYou may remember that Inspector Hamilton was authorized\nearly in May to employ Miss M. E. Buckley, who has been engaged for\na number of years as Missionary on the Red River Reserve, to\norganize the women on a number of reserves in Manitoba with the object\nof having these Indian women organize garden projects and undertake\nthe repair and remodelling of discarded military clothing. Miss\nBuckley spent one week on each of the following reserves: Fairford,\nLittle Saskatchewan, Lake St. Martin and Long Plains. It is her\nintention also, later in the year, to organize the women on the\nBirdtail Reserve, in the Little Agency. Miss Buckley's report on her\nvisit to the Lake St. Martin Reserve is typical of her reports in\ngeneral and reads as follows:\n\n\"On my arrival here I visited several of the homes with\nthe nurses and arranged to hold a meeting in the schoolroom the next\nday, which was well attended by the women, and an I.W.W.S. Club was\norganized, with Mrs. Beechell (the teacher) as President and Mrs.\nGeo. Boardy as secretary. Garden seeds were given out and also any clothing to be made over into garments for the women and children.\n\n\"The aims of the club were explained and the need for better gardens than ever was emphasized, and the women were shown how to utilize the army clothing to the best advantage.\n\n\"Another meeting was held a few days later when the women brought back the garments they had made. The results were very satisfactory and more sewing was given out to them.\n\n\"During my stay here I was able to assist the women a little in their gardens and also to visit them in their homes, which were clean and tidy, but I was shocked to find so many (even children) with T.B., and at our meetings in speaking of the better care of children I explained to the ladies that they were responsible for the health of their families and that it was their duty to do all they could to stamp out this terrible sickness that is so prevalent in their midst.\n\n\"Mrs. Bechell, the teacher, entered whole-heartedly into the work of helping me organize the club, and I hope she will resume her duties in the fall to carry on the good work she is doing, not only among the school children but with the young people of the reserve.\"\n\nIndian Agent Davis, in a report on the Lac La Ronge Indian Residential School and the reserves in the Lac La Ronge district, states:\n\n\"The Indians have advanced greatly in the cultivation of gardens. Most families have sufficient vegetables for their own use and in a number of cases still have sufficient potatoes to carry them over until the new crops have been harvested. Some of the finest gardens I have seen anywhere were seen at Sucker River and Stanley.\"\n\nThe doctors responsible for the nutritional survey in northern Manitoba a few months ago are definitely of the opinion that it is exceedingly difficult to provide Indians with a well balanced diet unless we can secure for them an adequate supply of milk. Dr. Evans informed Dr. Corrigan at the time Dr. Corrigan visited New York that we should do everything possible to encourage Indians, particularly bands in the northern sections of the Dominion, to keep goats. In this connection it is interesting to note that a good start has been made in the establishment of goat herds on a number of reserves. Indian Agent Davis, in his report already referred to, states:\n\n\"The Indians at Sucker River were supplied with goats a couple of years ago by the Department. These goats have increased until there are now 19 in the herd. A number of these goats are milking. I feel assured that this venture has been a decided success.\"\n\nGoat herds have now been established at Spanish, Golden Lake, Beaver River, Island Lake, Norway House and Sucker Creek.\nTRAINING.\n\nThere is little to report on the activities of the Training Division for the month. I have already intimated in one or two of my recent reports that difficulty will be experienced in securing the number of teachers necessary for the operation of our Indian day schools during the ensuing academic year. At this date there are 40 schools for which teachers have not yet been secured, and it is altogether likely that we shall receive a number of additional resignations during the weeks immediately ahead of us.\n\nA number of teachers visited the Department during the month. It is gratifying to be able to report that a number of our teachers are sufficiently interested in their work and in ways and means whereby our courses of study can be improved to visit the Department from time to time at their own expense. I was very favourably impressed by the Reverend A. C. Huston, Principal of the Round Lake Residential School, and the Reverend A. B. Chalco, Principal of the Sioux Lookout Residential School, both of whom visited the Bureau last week. For 8 years prior to his appointment to the principalship of the Round Lake School about 16 months ago, Mr. Huston was missionary in charge of the reserve at Norway House, northern Manitoba. He had heard of the nutritional work that had been undertaken by the Norway House Agency and was deeply interested in the attention we are making to provide the Indians with a well balanced diet. In discussing diet and nutritional problems with Dr. Moore, he intimated that while in northern Manitoba he had on more than one occasion declared that if he and the Indians exchanged \"grub boxes\" he would likely be sent to the hospital in the course of a few weeks and that the Indians would likely become a supermen, physically and mentally. Mr. Huston is a young man, a graduate in Arts of Toronto University, and a man who has devoted the whole of his life to missionary work on Indian reserves. He is likely to make a worthwhile contribution to Indian educational effort in the future. He is greatly handicapped at Round Lake owing to the insanitary and dilapidated condition of the buildings. He has in mind for the future a new building with classrooms for day pupils and a limited amount of accommodation for pupils unable, owing to the location of their homes, to attend as day school pupils.\n\nMr. Chalco, the Principal of the Sioux Lookout School, is also a university graduate in Arts and Theology. This man was missionary in charge of the Moose Lake Indian reserve in the Fox Agency. He recently married a girl who has been in charge of our Pine Falls Indian Hospital for a couple of years. Mrs. Chalco, she accompanied her husband when he visited the Department, is deeply interested in Indian welfare work and is particularly anxious at the moment to organize worthwhile handicraft projects at the school. She is interested also in the establishment of a goat herd at the institution. I have asked Dr. Moore, at the time of his visit to Winnipeg, to discuss with Mr. Hamilton the desirability of securing 6 or 7 goats for this school. Mrs. Chalco is of the opinion that cows supplied to Indian families soon become infected with tuberculosis and prove a menace to the Indian community in the spread of this disease. You will be interested to learn that we offered Mr. Chalco the principalship of the Indian residential school at Lytton. The position, however, did not appeal to him. He is primarily interested in pioneer work and is particularly interested in the betterment of conditions amongst backward bands of Indians.\nMr. Doucet returned from his western trip 2 weeks ago and will leave early in August for Nova Scotia. Mr. Doucet, who met Mr. Doucet at the St. Albert Residential School, was particularly pleased with the course of study outlined by Mr. Doucet and his suggestions to the teachers. Mr. Doucet has visited only two or three of our residential schools in the province of Manitoba. It is interesting to note, however, that his visits stimulated a great deal of interest in vocational instruction. Father Picardo has informed me that the principals and teachers of the residential schools in Manitoba are meeting at St. Boniface on August 18, 19 and 20, to discuss the re-organization of their courses of study in conformity with the outlines sent forward to them by Mr. Doucet. I have suggested to Father Picardo that he should ask Mr. John, Director of Vocational Instruction of the Provincial Department of Education, to address the convention. I have suggested, also, that it might be well to have Inspector Hamilton take part in the discussions.\n\nThe following excerpt has been taken from a letter received by the Principal of the Wabasso R.C. Indian Residential School from an ex-pupil:\n\n\"It is a great pleasure for me to send you my best greetings and appreciation for my education at Wabasso. I see now that what I have been taught is coming in handy. I only wish I had more education. My commanding Officer is very well pleased with my good behavior, and I am doing my best to show him how fast I can learn. I have not been in the Army very long but I am making progress day by day.\"\n\nThis Indian boy enlisted about a year ago and is now stationed at Winnipeg.\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nMr. Bryce, President, Manitoba Farm Bureau;\nRight Rev. U. Langlois, O.M.I., Bishop of Grouard, Grouard, Alberta;\nRev. A. C. Houston, Principal, Round Lake Residential School, Sask.;\nRev. A. D. Graham, Principal, Sioux Lookout Residential School, Ont.;\nRev. Father McKenney, Temiskaming, Ont.;\nMrs. Hillyer, Indian Day School Teacher;\nMr. F. W. Crawford, Comptroller, University of Manitoba;\nRev. G. W. Fisher, Principal, Lac la Barge Residential School, Sask.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, September 1, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCGILL,\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended August 31, 1942.\n\nWELFARE:\n\nThe first statement of relief costs for the present fiscal year was received from the Treasury early in the month. This statement covers expenditures for the period April - July, inclusive.\n\nIn view of existing conditions and the opportunities existing throughout the country for gainful employment, it was my hope that our welfare costs would show a substantial decrease. I was somewhat surprised, therefore, to note that the statement indicates a net increase of $4,038.42. The greatest increase - $6,785.13 - appears to have taken place in the province of Manitoba and the greatest decrease - $2,353.24, in Ontario.\n\nI have, as you know, communicated on more than one occasion with Inspector Hamilton during the last fiscal year in respect to his relief costs. His explanations, while plausible, have never appeared to me to be wholly satisfactory. I still find it difficult to understand why relief costs for the period now under review - April to July, inclusive - should amount in Manitoba to $49,874.20 while relief costs in Saskatchewan for the same period amount to $34,484.59 and in Alberta, $2,456.56. It should be added, also, that the amount of farm machinery purchased this year in Saskatchewan far exceeds the amount purchased in Manitoba.\n\nReports to hand indicate that crop conditions in Ontario and in the Prairie Provinces are more favourable at this time than they have been at any time in recent years. Weed infestation, however, appears to be very much in evidence on a number of our reserves, particularly in Saskatchewan. A teacher from that province, who visited the Department a few weeks ago, expressed the opinion that weed infestation had become so bad on a number of reserves in Saskatchewan that it would cost more than the land is actually worth to eradicate the weeds and bring the land under a proper state of cultivation. In this connection I am disposed to think that our community farms with tractor power have been to some extent remedying this condition in recent years.\n\nIt is encouraging to report that, in Alberta at least, our live stock population appears to be increasing somewhat steadily. Indian Agent Iredale, of the Stony Agency, in his report for July, states:\n\n\"We will be selling the 2 year old steers and some fat cows about the first week in October. We should have...\"\nhave about 125 two-year old steers to sell and perhaps 60 or 70 old cows. We are carrying about 1150 head of cattle over from last winter, and with the natural increase of about 350 to 400 calves, we should sell more cattle this year in order to keep the number down to 1150 or 1200 at the most. \"We are now at the peak as regards the number we can with safety take care of. If we come up against a dry or below normal year we might experience difficulty in providing feed. As pointed out by me several times, if the Department would provide more agricultural lands we could go on increasing cattle herds, but, as things are now, we have reached the limit in the number we can feed, both in regard to pasture and winter feed.\"\n\nThe Indian Agent adds:\n\n\"With regard to the surplus horses on this reserve, I would like to reduce the number of horses, but the situation is not by any means alarming. I have been continually stressing the importance of getting rid of a number of small ponies, and gradually this is being done. About 150 have been disposed of during the last 12 months.\"\n\nInspector Schmidt, at the time of his visit to Ottawa, discussed with us ways and means whereby the Indians might be encouraged to dispose of their surplus horses. He promised at that time that he would undertake a thorough investigation and send forward a report in due course. This report has not reached the Department, but I note in agents' reports from time to time references to the problem created on the reserves by these surplus horses. The Indian Agent for the Peigan Agency, in his last report, states:\n\n\"The horse situation on this reserve is quite a problem. Some of the older Indians seem to place the same value on horses as they did 30 and 40 years ago. I have talked with one or two of the owners of some of the large bunches running on the north side of the river and then got all the Indians together for a fireside chat. The result is that they have asked me to get some buyers. It would appear that they are prepared to sell off the greater portion of these animals for what they can get for them. I think if I can get a few sales made and have the money on hand others will fall into line.\"\n\nDr. Moore informed me a few weeks ago that the Quaker Oats Company were anxious to secure horses for horse meat for the preparation of a dog biscuit manufactured by them. Dr. Moore has communicated with this company in an attempt to discover if they would be interested in the surplus horses available on a number of our western reserves.\n\nTRAINING:\n\nIn my report of last month I referred to the difficulty we were likely to experience in securing the teachers necessary to operate our Indian day schools. Since that report was written we have engaged about a dozen teachers but we have also received three or four resignations. It would appear at this date impossible to secure our full quota of teachers for the re-opening of our schools.\non October 1. It is rather remarkable that we have succeeded in securing the majority of the teachers necessary for schools in the outlying districts while at the same time failing to obtain teachers in the older sections of the Dominion such as the Rama school in the Rama agency and the St. Clair school in the Sarnia agency.\n\nMajor Randle, in a letter dated August 17, reminds us that Miss Sylvia Jamieson won first and third prizes in the competition organized and promoted from year to year by the County and Provincial Rural School Improvement Association. Major Randle states:\n\n\"Four other of our schools entered the contest and although they did not win a prize it was understood from the Judges that the markings were very close and that all our Indian schools were highly rated.\"\n\nI regret to report that the piggery at the St. George's Residential School, Lytton, B.C., was with 22 pigs totally destroyed by fire on August 24. Mr. Hives, the Principal, estimates that a new building will cost approximately $1,000. The destruction of schools and school buildings by fire is one of the most discouraging features of the work of the Training Division. Despite the fact that circulars are constantly going out assuring our Indian agents and school principals to take all the precautions necessary to prevent fires, fires continue to occur with unerring regularity. The explanation in this case was that the fire was caused by a spark from the feed cooker located inside the building. The Principal states: \"This source of fire hazard should never have existed, but, like a lot of other foolish ideas that have been allowed to exist here, it was not adjusted in time.\"\n\nA particularly encouraging letter, dated August 4, 1945, has been received from the Principal of the Ermineskin (R.C.) Residential School. In this letter the Reverend Father Rheaume states:\n\n\"Last April the Department made a special appeal to encourage Indians to cultivate subsistence gardens. With this appeal in view and realizing that gardening is an important item in our training program, we have done our utmost to make our pupils realize the importance that should be attached to gardens, especially in these difficult times.\n\n\"The boys of Grades 3, 4, 5 and 6, following our advice, went so far as to ask their parents to start gardens at their respective homes, promising to take care of them during the summer holidays. We are sending you forward herewith a survey just completed of the gardens of most of the 34 pupils of this school. We wish to emphasize \"Most\" as some of the parents are still too nomadic to able to give their children an opportunity of cultivating a garden. In general, however, we feel proud of the work that has been done. We feel sure that if a trophy of some kind was awarded every year for the best garden on the reserve this would help...\"\nenormously to encourage the Indians to take care of their gardens. Quite a number of Indians have lost much of their produce because they have waited too long before commencing the seeding of their gardens. We are led to believe that stampedes and fairs held here and in neighboring towns are disastrous in that they keep the Indians away from their farms for days, sometimes weeks at a time.\"\n\nI might add that it is our intention, in response to the Principal's request, to provide small prizes to encourage the cultivation of gardens on our reserves in the future.\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nRev. C. A. Primsau, S.J., Principal, Spanish Residential School, Spanish, Ont.;\nMr. F. Matters, Indian Agent, Chapleau, Ont.\n\nMr. Tough, representing Angus Mack Company,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, October 1, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR McILL\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended September 30, 1942.\n\nTRAINING:\n\nIt is gratifying to report that we secured during the month a number of teachers for the vacant positions at Indian day schools. It would appear that of the 280 day schools usually in operation all but 30 will open on October 1. This does not mean that we have succeeded in securing experienced and fully qualified teachers for these schools. A large number of male teachers have enlisted and their places in many instances have been taken by married women, many of whom have not taught for 10, 15 or 20 years. Just how successful these women will be in adapting themselves to the new teaching methods and the courses of study now in force, I am not of course in a position to state. The 9 month rather than the 10 month teaching period has made it exceedingly difficult for us to secure teachers this year. A number of teachers, who have discussed this matter with us personally, have stated frankly that they are not prepared, in a period as critical as the one in which we find ourselves, to remain idle for three months during the summer season. Many of these teachers are actuated by the highest motives and one can readily understand their feelings.\n\nThe large chimney on the recently constructed section of the Sandy Bay Residential School was struck by lightning early in the month and totally destroyed. The destruction of the chimney also resulted in serious impairment to the roof of the school. Steps have already been taken to have this chimney rebuilt at the earliest possible date.\n\nIt is encouraging to learn that Mr. A. E. Caldwell, Principal of the United Church Residential School at Norway House, Manitoba, has entered into a written agreement with the Hudson's Bay Company whereby a number of the male graduates of the school will be taken into the service of the company from year to year. The following letter, received by Mr. Caldwell from Mr. J. W. Henley, the officer in charge of personnel of the Hudson's Bay Company, gives a brief summary of this agreement:\n\n\"I was glad to hear from Mr. Bonnycastle on his return from a recent trip to Norway House that he had had an opportunity of discussing with you the employment of young Indian lads at our trading posts.\n\nYou may -\n\"You may recall your discussion with the writer here last summer, when I outlined briefly the type of employee we want to get and what we are prepared to offer them.\n\n\"I understand from Mr. Bonnycastle that you would like some assurance from us that we can take a certain number of lads each year from your school. I suggest, therefore, for the present, that you count on us taking four each year under the following arrangements:\n\n1. The boys trained by you we would be prepared to take on at not less than 16 years of age and preferably 17 or 18 if you are able to keep them in school this long. I think your suggestion of selecting the likely recruits at 12 to 14 years of age - well in advance of the time they would be employed - is a good one since in this way you may be able to earmark them for special instruction. I believe Mr. Bonnycastle also discussed with you the advisability of giving employment during school holidays to these boys, but that you agreed it would be preferable they return to their families each summer until taken on permanently by the Company.\n\n2. With regard to the type of training these boys should receive while under your supervision:\n\n(a) We should be glad if you could stress particularly good grounding in writing and arithmetic, as, in this way, they will be of greater use at a post, and be able to undertake more responsibility than simply doing chores and odd jobs around the store.\n\n(b) It is also our intention to employ these lads at points which, because of their location or the size of the business, do not warrant the employment of white assistants. In these cases they must live in the same dwelling as the white manager, therefore, I think you should stress the importance of clean personal habits.\n\n(c) Practical instruction in carpentry and mechanics is also valuable, if available in your curriculum.\n\nThe above remarks are intended to serve as an outline of the programme for the next twelve months when I consider the arrangements should be reviewed with yourself, Mr. Learmonth and the Saskatchewan District Manager, R. A. Talbot.\n\n\"Meanwhile, we are asking Mr. Learmonth to consult with you in the selection of two more boys to commence employment at Norway House and Rossville not later than 15th June. About freeze-up we should be ready to take on another two.\n\n\"I am very hopeful that this plan will work to our mutual advantage and that we may continue to take a few boys each year. Any criticisms or suggestions from you on the arrangements outlined here will be most welcome.\"\n\nReports reaching the Department from time to time would lead one to believe that our residential schools -\nschools are not particularly popular with the Indian population. I was myself greatly impressed by the criticism of these schools which I encountered, in my conversations with Indians, at the time of my visit to the Peffley and Pugh offices. However, a recent report from Indian Agent Pugh, Saddle Lake Agency, should tend to convince one that any attempt on the part of the Department to abandon these schools would meet with a great deal of opposition from the Indian population. Mr. Pugh's report, which is dated July 16, 1942, reads:\n\n\"Cuestioned at the council meeting about the schools being taken over by the Government for the use of Japanese, I stated that I had no definite information about the Edmonton school, that in any case education would be provided for the Protestant children, and there was a definite understanding that the Blue Quills R. C. School would not be taken over. Chief Moses stated that he would sooner see the boarding schools retained, in preference to the day schools. Jonas Cardinal stated that he had been to the Blue Quills School, to see if they were closing down, and he had been informed that they were not. He asked that the Indians themselves have a voice in this matter. He wanted the boarding school retained. Councillor Ralph Steinbauer stated that he could scarcely believe his ears. He remembered being at a league of the Cross meeting some three or four years ago and at that meeting the Indians had passed a resolution asking for day schools, and yet today some are hesitating about these day schools. Councillor Jimmy Cardinal stated that a large day school had failed at Cold Lake through lack of attendance. Councillor Jonas Cardinal stated that the children should be able to come home from the boarding schools and help their parents and that it was of great benefit to the parents not to have to feed and clothe their children when attending boarding schools. He doubted very much the ability of the average Indian to feed and clothe his children as well as they were fed and clothed at boarding schools.\"\n\nI have referred on more than one occasion to the course in physical culture and in gymnastics organized at the Grouard Residential School by Father Forcade. It would appear that this young priest has now made a start on the organization of worthwhile handicraft projects at this school. In a letter dated September 25, he states:\n\n\"The more I study these people, the more I see the necessity for us to teach them how to earn their living. To make them feel this, we must create some ambition in them. I am directing my activities towards industries among them. We have begun this in class. One of our activities is leather work and bead work. We show them how to make use of their skill and the value of it in leathercrafts. We are more or less boycotted through lack of material and especially beads. Do you know of some channels through which we could get them? You will hear more about this through our \"Echoes\".\n\n\"We have purchased and are now operating here the Gestetener printing machine for which you have given us an allowance of $50. The Company is forwarding you the invoice.\"\nREPORTS NOW ON FILE ARE SUFFICIENT TO CONVINCE US THAT THE RESPONSE TO OUR APPEAL FOR THE CULTIVATION OF INDIAN GARDENS HAS BEEN MORE ENCOURAGING AND MORE WORTHWHILE THAN ANY APPEAL SENT OUT FROM THE DEPARTMENT AT ANY TIME IN RECENT YEARS. THIS APPEAL, WHICH IS DATED APRIL 7, 1943, WAS SENT OUT TO OUR INDIAN INSPECTORS AND AGENTS, TO THE PRINCIPALS OF RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS AND TO THE REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL THE CHURCHES. NOT ONLY HAS THIS APPEAL RESULTED IN THE CULTIVATION OF VEGETABLE GARDENS, BUT IT APPEARS TO HAVE RESULTED AS WELL IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A GREAT MANY COMMUNITY ROOT-HOUSES. IT IS DIFFICULT, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE, TO OVERESTIMATE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE GARDENS, JUDGED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE HEALTH AND PHYSICAL WELLBEING OF THE INDIAN POPULATION, PARTICULARLY INDIAN YOUTH.\n\nMR. CHRISTIANSON, IN HIS REPORT ON AN INSPECTION OF THE QU'APPHELLE AGENCY, DATED SEPTEMBER 25, STATES:\n\n\"I WAS PLEASED TO NOTE THAT THE INDIANS HAVE MADE A REAL SHOWING WITH GARDENS AND PRACTICALLY EVERY INDIAN IN THE AGENCY HAS A GARDEN. ON THE SIOUX RESERVE I THINK I SAW THE BEST GARDEN I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. THIS BELONGS TO THE MOSES GOODWILL FAMILY AND THERE ARE PROBABLY ENOUGH POTATOES AND OTHER GARDEN TRUCK TO FEED HALF THE RESERVE FROM THIS GARDEN. IT WAS SHIELDED WITH SUNFLOWERS, WHICH MAKE A WONDERFUL PROTECTION, AND THEY REALLY HAD EVERYTHING YOU COULD NAME IN THE WAY OF CORN AND OTHER VEGETABLES. THESE PEOPLE, AT LEAST, WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT TO LAST THEM FOR THE WHOLE SEASON. HOWEVER, THIS WASN'T THE ONLY GOOD GARDEN I SAW. THE FARMING INSTRUCTOR ON THE MUSCOWETUNG RESERVE HAD 26 ROWS OF POTATOES AND THE ROWS WERE PROBABLY ONE HALF MILE LONG. HE HAD THE NAME OF EACH INDIAN WHO IS ON THE RATION LIST AT THE END OF THE ROW AND THE INDIAN CONCERNED HAD TO LOOK AFTER HIS OWN ROW. THREE OR FOUR OF THE ROWS HAD ALREADY BEEN TAKEN UP AND MR. FOX INFORMED ME THAT HE FIGURED THERE WERE ABOUT 40 BUSHELS OF POTATOES TO EACH ROW. THEREFORE 26 ROWS WOULD YIELD OVER 1000 BUSHELS. I ALSO SAW SOME VERY FINE GARDENS ON THE PIAPOT RESERVE, THE BEST, I PRESUME, THEY HAVE EVER HAD THERE, AND I WAS VERY GLAD TO FIND OUT THAT THE CHIEF OF THE BAND HAD WORKED VERY HARD AMONGST HIS INDIANS TO GET THEM TO CULTIVATE GARDENS THIS SUMMER WITH VERY FINE RESULTS.\"\n\nWHILE THE REPORTS ON GARDENING OPERATIONS ARE ABOUT ALL ONE MIGHT DESIRE, THE REPORTS ON CROP CONDITIONS GENERALLY, PARTICULARLY CROP CONDITIONS IN THE WEST, ARE BY NO MEANS UP TO EXPECTATIONS. IT WOULD APPEAR THAT WEED INFESTATION, COUPLED WITH EXCESSIVE RAINS, HAS TURNED MANY OF THE AREAS INTO LIABILITIES RATHER THAN ASSETS. IN THE QU'APPHELLE AGENCY, CROP FAILURES OR PARTIAL CROP FAILURES HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCED NOW FOR A PERIOD OF 12 YEARS. THIS YEAR'S CROP FOR A TIME LOOKED PROMISING, BUT MR. CHRISTIANSON, IN THE REPORT ALREADY REFERRED TO, STATES:\n\n\"The crops in this agency were wonderful, the best I have ever seen there, but what the results will be is more than I know. Last Monday they were practically through cutting the wheat but they still had oats to cut.\"\nWith the rain, etc., people are becoming very much discouraged because the stocks are damp, the ground is wet, and the binders are breaking; in fact it seems almost impossible to get the cutting done. Here and there you find the odd field on the outside that has been threshed and it is now apparent that rust has greatly cut down the yield in spite of the fact we have nothing but Thatcher wheat. Even with that it has rusted badly enough to have the number of bushels per acre greatly reduced. I would like those of you who read this letter to just imagine cutting grain that has been floured to the ground. We can do something with it by cutting it one way but twisted grain is a problem that is pretty hard to get over. Therefore our high anticipations of being able to pay a substantial amount of our indebtedness have gone. What the grain will finally yield if we ever get it threshed is impossible for me to say. So far it has rained every day this week and the ground has been frozen quite hard the last two nights.\n\nThis report and this year's results - again I am speaking particularly of the west - tend to emphasize more and more the desirability of encouraging subsistence rather than large-scale farming on Indian reserves. I mean by subsistence farming the cultivation of vegetable gardens, hog and cattle raising and the establishment of goat herds - in other words, production for home consumption rather than for sale or for export.\n\nA report from Inspector Schmidt on the Blood agency suggests that weed infestation, even on summer-fallow areas in that agency, has become so acute that the seeding down of large areas of land for pasture purposes and grazing is absolutely imperative. In this connection it is interesting to note that the seriousness of noxious seed infestation on Indian reserves in the Prairie Provinces was brought to the attention of the Minister 10 years ago by Dr. Tory, who was at that time chairman of the National Research Council. Dr. Tory was of the opinion at that time that noxious weeds were not only a menace on Indian reserve lands but a menace to the adjoining lands cultivated by white farmers. I am disposed to think that the menace is immeasurably more acute at this time than it was 10 years ago. The excessive rains of this year have, of course, brought the matter more prominently to our attention. In addition to this, large groups of Indians have abandoned their farming operations to work outside the reserves. Indian Agent Young, Griswold Agency, in his report for September, states:\n\n\"The majority of the Indians of this reserve are out harvesting. The wages asked by them for this work is from $5.00 per day up. Even women are scarce on the reserve as they have been out stocking by the acre. The attitude of the Indian seems to be to make all the profit he can out of the apparent shortage of labour which is caused by war conditions.\"\n\nIndian Agent Simpson, in his report on the Duck Lake Agency for August, states:\n\n\"On most of the reserves every able-bodied Indian is being employed by outsiders. The Indians have responded\nvery well to the request to give all available help assisting in the harvest field. Their wives and older children are also assisting.\n\nIndian Agent Ostrander, Battleford Agency, refers also to the tendency on the part of Indians to abandon their work on the reserves in favour of outside employment. He states:\n\n\"The demand for the Indians to go out of the reserves to work in the harvest fields has become so great that we will have trouble getting our crops harvested. Harvest labour means immediate returns in money while, if they stay on their farms for their own harvest, they know that their first sales of grain will not be sufficient to pay the immediate cost of harvest operations, threshing, twine, etc. This makes the offers of work outside the reserves particularly attractive. The Indians are going out - men, women and children. Wages very from $3.00 to $6.00 a day. I estimate that over 200 men and women of this agency are now employed at outside harvest work.\"\n\nIt is pleasing to note that where we have an Indian agent interested in the organization and promotion of worthwhile handicraft projects the Indians of his agency, particularly the older Indians, are still able to secure a certain amount of revenue from this source. Indian Agent Burk, in his last report on the Port Arthur Agency, states:\n\n\"The annual Lakehead Exhibition was held from August 8 to 15. This year a typical Indian village was erected in the fair grounds, consisting of 10 birch bark wigwams. At each wigwam Indians were engaged in the construction of various Indian handicraft projects, making birch bark canoes, beadwork, snow shoes, moccasins, quilt work, rabbit skin blankets, etc. One Indian secured an order for 25 birch bark canoes. Large orders were taken for Indian handicraft for delivery about December 15th of this year. Orders were taken also for 36 rabbit skin blankets.\"\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nVery Rev. Dr. Robert Johnston,\nMr. D. G. McKenzie, Winnipeg, Man.;\nHonourable D. L. Campbell, Minister of Agriculture, Winnipeg;\nSgt. Chisholm, Mounted Police,\nMr. H. P. Ruddy, Indian Agent, Golden Lake, Ont.\nMiss S. Burke, teacher, Garden River R.C. School.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, November\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR McGUIII\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended October 31, 1942.\n\nTRAINING:\n\nIn my report of last month I intimated that we were experiencing difficulty in securing the teachers necessary to operate our Indian day schools. However, it is gratifying to report that during the month we succeeded in securing 18 additional teachers, with the result that all our schools with the exception of 12 are open and in operation at this date.\n\nI have referred in one or two of my recent reports to the improvement and beautification of certain school grounds, particularly on the Six Nations Reserve. I had an opportunity last week of visiting these schools and I feel that I cannot speak too highly of the work accomplished by the teachers, under the direction of Major Hanle. The No. II School on the Six Nations Reserve won third prize in the provincial competition. Another school on this reserve was visited by a school visitant, an Indian in the province of Ontario to cultivate a forestry plot during the last year. When I visited the Extension Branch of the Provincial Department of Agriculture, I was interested to learn from the officials there that they had taken photos of our schools on the Six Nations Reserve and that it was their intention to use these in lantern lectures, with the object of stimulating interest in the improvement of school grounds throughout the province. One official told me that a number of these lectures had already been delivered and that the audiences were amazed at the progress that had been made by the Indian schools.\n\nA somewhat similar program to the one that has been so successful on the Six Nations Reserve has been started at Tyendinaga. Indian Agent Moore in his last monthly report states:\n\n\"A competition was held this year for the improvement of the grounds at the four day schools on the reserve and in May, last, an inspection was made of the schools, with the result that they were given the following standing:\n\nFirst - Eastern; Second - Mission;\nThird - Central; Fourth - Western.\n\nIn the early spring, trees were procured from the Ontario Forestry Branch and shrubs from a nursery. These trees were planted in accordance with the landscape plans provided by Mr. Charles Buchanan, district agricultural representative. Annual plants and flowers were also supplied and planted by the teachers and pupils of the schools.\n\n*On October -\nOn October 14 Mr. Buchanan inspected these school grounds and awarded prizes for the schools showing the greatest improvement since his earlier inspection in May. The following prizes were awarded:\n\nFirst - Central Day School - $5.00\nSecond - Eastern - $2.00\nThird - Western - $2.00\n\nThese prizes were the result of local contributions and have been a great incentive in making this competition a success. Mr. Buchanan states that he finds a greater improvement for the year at the reserve schools than he has found in all the schools in the counties of Lennox and Addington, which form part of his district. Garden tools, lawn mowers, etc., have been supplied the reserve schools and next spring we hope to continue this improvement.\n\nIt would be a mistake, of course, to conclude from these observations that our Indian day schools throughout the Dominion are in a good state of repair or that Indian day school grounds, generally, are attractive. The programs carried out on these two reserves simply represent a start in a program which we hope to gradually extend on other reserves throughout the provinces. We seem to experience the utmost difficulty in securing a good quality of paint. For example, the new school on the Oneida reserve, at Muncey, Ont., which we built about three years ago, is at present urgently in need of paint. I examined this school very closely and convinced myself that the paint used must have been of a very inferior quality. The siding of the school suggests that it received only one coat. I am personally of the opinion that to use an inferior quality of paint on our schools is a sheer waste of money. On the other hand, I discussed this matter with Major Randle, and he does not appear to experience much difficulty in securing a good quality of paint for his schools at Brantford.\n\nI had an opportunity, during my visit to Brantford and Muncey, to meet practically all the teachers in charge of our schools and to discuss educational problems with them. I was very favourably impressed with the interest these teachers are taking in their work and in the problems peculiar to the districts in which they are serving. A number of illustrations regarding this interest might be submitted. Mr. Joseph Hill, the teacher in charge of the No. 11 School, Six Nations, had a very fine set of vitamin charts on display in his room. These charts, illustrating the value of vegetables and the place that vegetables should occupy in a well balanced diet, were the best I have seen anywhere. I was naturally anxious to learn from him the source from which he had obtained them. He informed me that he had been deeply interested in dietetics for a number of years and had purchased these charts with his own money from the Provincial Department of Education. This teacher had six Grade 9 pupils (first year high school) in his classroom. Although these pupils experience a great deal of difficulty in covering first year high school work in 9 months, he was of the opinion that they were making fairly satisfactory progress.\n\nMrs. J. Holdsworth, teacher in charge of the Oneida No. 2 School, had a very fine piano in her classroom.\nDuring the course of my conversation with her she intimated that the piano was almost indispensable in providing instruction in music, in conformity with the revised Ontario curriculum. When I enquired how she had secured the piano she informed me that she had organized a number of concerts and by charging an admission fee had secured quite a substantial sum. With this money in her purse she then approached a family who were moving from the district and who had a piano for sale. When the head of this household learned the use to which she was going to put the piano, it was sold to her at a very reasonable price. This teacher had organized Halloween Party for her pupils and although it was almost 5 o'clock when I visited her school, the children were still in the classroom, taking part in the program and apparently very happy.\n\nIt is somewhat unfortunate perhaps that the relationship between the Department and these teachers is a somewhat impersonal one. Accomplishments such as these - and I might quote hundreds of others - are seldom, if ever, brought to our attention, with the result that the teachers seldom, if ever, receive expressions of appreciation from our officials. The time of the average Indian agent is altogether too fully occupied for him even to notice such matters. They are part of the ordinary daily routine and in the course of time become somewhat commonplace. I learned that a number of our teachers were sufficiently interested in Indian work to remain in our service although they had received tempting offers from white schools in adjoining districts. These teachers do leave our schools from time to time, thus being influenced usually by the thought of qualifying later for the provincial superannuation payments. The failure of our Branch to make provision for superannuation payments to our teachers appears to be a source of worry to a great many of our teachers who have spent a number of years in our schools. In this connection Inspector Moir, of Saskatchewan, in his report dated October 1, states:\n\n\"Your schools suffer severely from constantly changing teachers. There seems to be no way at present by which Indian day or residential school teachers can take advantage of the superannuation plan in the province.\"\n\nWELFARE:\n\nEncouraging reports continue to reach us from Dr. Orford, in respect to his gardening program in the James Bay Agency. In his report dated October 14, Dr. Orford states:\n\n\"Last spring 50 bushels of certified seed potatoes were purchased. Four and a half acres of welfare gardens were planted with this seed and 10 bushels of a locally grown red seed which I had noticed last year to give a high yield of large firm potatoes.\n\n\"Potatoes remaining from last year's crop were distributed for gardens to individual Indians - approximately 100 bushels - and to the group creating a new settlement on the Moose Reserve.\n\n\"Men were employed all summer to tend the gardens and they managed fairly well in keeping them cultivated.\n\n\"In August -\n\"In August we began to use new potatoes from the welfare garden - the Indians all being encouraged to use this garden and keep their own for later use. It is therefore rather difficult to accurately estimate the crop, but after all the Indians had been using these potatoes for a month we dug up and stored in the new root-house 386 bags, all large and firm and without any skin blemish.\n\n\"It is also difficult to estimate the crop from the individual gardens of the Indians who planted them, but those I did check on had an average yield of 6 bags for every one planted, so I would judge that a conservative estimate would be 600 bags. Of these about 200 bags are stored in our old root-house here on the island and the rest have been taken by the Indians to their hunting grounds. The 200 bags stored here are for use next spring and summer for food.\n\n\"In addition to this, the newly created community garden of approximately one acre belonging to the group on the Moose Reserve produced 149 bags of potatoes.\n\n\"An acre was also plated this spring in other garden crops - turnips, parsnips, onions, carrots, radish, lettuce, green beans and soy beans. The soy bean was not a success, as reported in another letter. I had hoped to have some of the produce from this acre for the widows during the winter. However, I am more than pleased that all I have left is a few turnips and parsnips. The enthusiasm with which the Indians ate up the garden simply goes to prove that they appreciated its development for them. They particularly enjoyed the radishes, lettuce and green onions and I had an opportunity a short while ago to taste a stew prepared by Indian women, the vegetable portion of which - potatoes, carrots, turnips, onions and beans - was picked from the locally grown gardens. It was delicious and I can only hope that we can continue to encourage them in the use of such food. What a difference it should make in their general outlook and health to get away from their old customary summer diet around here of pan-fried bannock, day in and day out.\n\n\"Some of our land will require rotation in crop next year, but we have 5\u00bd acres of newly broken ground which was lying idle this summer. However, I think we could use more ground and approval is requested to employ Indians to mark out and clear about 2 acres on the island, adjacent to our present new plot. We could probably have it ready for plowing by the fall of 1943.\"\n\nIn response to a request received from Inspector Hamilton, Miss Edythe Smith-Windsor, the teacher in charge of the United Church Indian Day School at Fisher River, Man., was engaged during the month of September in the organization of women's clubs, in the Grindstone and Clandeboye agencies. Mr. Hamilton, in his report on this work, says:\n\n\"I consider Miss Smith-Windsor has done some excellent work, and already the women of the Fort Alexander Reserve have requested more discarded army clothing. The first shipment of this clothing has all been used and the...\"\nnew garments placed on display by the Sisters at the residential school. I inspected some of these articles and convinced myself that the work was well done.\"\n\nMiss Smith, in her report on the Griswold agency, states:\n\n\"Meetings were held in the basement of the Anglican Church on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. In all, fifteen women attended the meetings. This being the harvest season, all the women were not free to attend.\n\n\"Sample garments that had been made by the Fairfield Club were on display. The women were able to understand the purpose of the organization better after seeing some of the work done by another group.\n\n\"Eight women took work to do. They ripped up garments to be remodelled and stated the purpose for which each was intended. One woman suggested that a child's overall suit could be made from the pockets of two pairs of army pants. Another suggested using the good parts of sock feet for an afghan. Some socks were given out to be re-footed - using unravelled sock wool for the new feet.\n\n\"When I approached Miss Stapleton, the day school teacher regarding carrying on as convenor of the club, she felt she already had too many responsibilities to 'take on' the Club. She suggested, however, that Miss Weller and Miss Wilkins who are at the Anglican Mission with her might enjoy the club work. They were quite willing to carry on.\n\n\"I appreciate the assistance rendered by Mr. and Mrs. Young at the agency in getting word to the women about the meetings, and by Miss Stapleton for the use of the church basement for our meetings.\"\n\nFor a number of reasons that seem somewhat difficult to explain, few Indians appear to be interested in the keeping of poultry. The average Indian has not yet convinced himself that eggs or vegetables are either appetizing or necessary to his health. To convince him that both eggs and vegetables should have a prominent place in a well balanced diet, it will be necessary to undertake a worthwhile adult educational program. A lantern and slides might be used very effectively in this program. In the meantime, it is gratifying to learn, from a report received by Inspector Schmidt, that a number of Indians in the Edmonton agency have made a start in the poultry industry. In his report dated October 14, 1942, Inspector Schmidt states:\n\n\"A large number of the Indians on Alexander's Reserve have chickens, turkeys and geese. A number of these Indians also have hogs and are making a good deal of money from the sale of pork. On Enoch's Reserve the majority of the Indians have chickens and turkeys and a smaller number have hogs. Most of these Indians milk cows and make butter for their own use and for sale to other Indians.\"\n\nWith an acute shortage of labour existing in the country and with work readily available, one might naturally\nexpect a substantial reduction from month to month in our relief and welfare expenditures. As a matter of fact, however, there are expenditures such as those referred to by Indian Agent Lasenby, which we are apt to overlook\u2014expenditures which appear to be necessary and which tend to keep relief costs at a comparatively high figure. Mr. Lasenby, in his report dated September 20th, states:\n\n\"In explanation of the fact that some relief was given to families of Indians who had enlisted, I beg to say that the enlisted Indians left Norway House for Winnipeg without leaving any provisions for their families, and these families came to me for food as they could not get any provisions on credit at the local stores and I knew it would be at least a month or more before these families would begin to receive any assigned pay or dependent's allowance. I therefore gave these families a little that I considered would last them for a month until their pay began to arrive. Since that time, however, several of these families have been back for more food, not having received their pay as yet, but instead of giving further relief I have given them orders against their treaty payments on the understanding that when they receive their cheques they will repay these amounts. The same explanation applies with regard to the families of the Indians who went out to the prairies for the harvest.\n\n\"........... It is quite unnecessary to remind me that these are very serious times and every effort should be made to reduce the cost of relief. I am fully aware of all this and endeavour at all times to practise the strictest economy, not only in the way of relief but in every other way.\"\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nMrs. Lovies, representing United Church Missionary Society;\n\nMost Rev. W. M. Duke, Archbishop of Vancouver (R.C.);\n\nRev. Father T. F.

Ginn & Company.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, December 1, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCGILL,\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended November 30, 1942.\n\nWELFARE:\n\nThe statement of welfare expenditures for the period April 1 to October 31 shows a slight increase - $637.48 - over expenditures for the corresponding period of last year. This figure indicates that relief and welfare expenditures have become somewhat static and are not likely to show substantial reductions at any time in the immediate future. However, we can hope for certain reductions in Nova Scotia when the policy of centralization is completed in that province.\n\nI still find it difficult to understand why welfare expenditures remain so high in Manitoba - $68,572.44 for the period under review as against $68,246.05 for last year - showing an increase of $626.39. This amount continues to be high when compared with an expenditure of $45,678.61 in Saskatchewan and $37,440.27 in Alberta. I am not suggesting that there are in Manitoba physically fit Indians in receipt of relief or that the old and physically incapacitated Indians are receiving too much. I do suggest, however, that for some reason difficult to explain, subsistence gardens in the province of Manitoba have not been cultivated to the extent that these gardens have been cultivated in the other provinces. The Manitoba agencies have also been backward, particularly the northern agencies, in the construction of root-houses.\n\nHowever, two women were employed by Inspector Hamilton during the summer months, with the object of stimulating interest in gardening and in the remodelling of discarded military clothing. It is perhaps too early to expect that the work of these women would be reflected in relief costs.\n\nMr. Morris, of this Division, has taken a personal and active interest in the Golden Lake band of Indians during the summer months and has found it possible to visit this reserve six times during the summer and fall season. A worthwhile welfare program has been carried out on this reserve, under the supervision of Mr. Morris, and a root-house 25' x 16' (inside measurements) has been constructed. This root-house is at the present time almost filled with vegetables, secured from the Kingston penitentiary. A goat herd of 17 females and two males has been purchased. A barn for the housing of these goats has been secured and repaired and a field suitable for pasture has been fenced. Mr. Morris has succeeded also in organizing the women of this reserve for the remodelling of discarded\nmilitary clothing. These women meet at the home of the President, Mrs. Lavallee, monthly. Mr. Morris has already attended two of their meetings. In addition to the remodelling of clothing, the members of this club are taking a keen interest in gardening and in the care of live stock, the improvement of their homes and conditions generally on the reserve. Mr. Morris has succeeded, also, in having the Indians of this reserve prepare 25 acres of land, and this area is ready for cultivation next year.\n\nRev. J. P. Mackey, Principal of the Residential School at Shubenacadie, N.S., has co-operated very effectively with the Indian agent at that point in the organization of a worthwhile agricultural program on the new reserve. In response to a suggestion made by me, Father Mackey placed his farm machinery at the disposal of the agent for use on the reserve early in the spring. This was done on the understanding that we would pay for its use. I am now in receipt of a letter from Father Mackey, attaching a statement showing the machinery used and the hours of labour spent by his farming instructor on Indian lands. The letter accompanying this statement from Father Mackey reads:\n\n\"Enclosed please find a list of the days and hours of work at the Doyle farm on the Indian reserve. This work was undertaken in response to your letters of April 21 and April 29, 1945.\n\n\"You will notice that we began work on May 2 and finished on July 18. Due to many causes, we did not obtain the results we had expected. ..... However, we believe that you have a report of the amount of potatoes, carrots, turnips and cabbage harvested, and the crop will more than pay for the amount expended.\n\n\"We are not asking any compensation whatever for what we have done, as we consider that the school should be willing to do something for the general welfare of the Indians\".\n\nIt is very seldom indeed that we receive a letter from anyone or from any source, indicating that a contribution to the welfare of the Indians is being made without cost to the Department.\n\nA number of very discouraging reports have been received on threshing operations in the Prairie Provinces. It would appear that weather conditions at a number of agencies, coupled with an acute shortage of labour, prevented the completion of threshing operations, with the result that large quantities of grain - wheat, oats - will remain in the stocks throughout the winter months. Indian Agent Ostrander, in his report dated November 8, states:\n\n\"Threshing has been stopped on all the reserves for some time; in fact it never started on the Poundmaker Reserve and little more than started on the Sweet Grass and Little Pine Reserves. The Red Pheasant and Thunderchild Reserves were about half finished. Winter has set in and there is little hope of the grain being fit to thresh for the rest of the winter. The stocks are wet...\"\ninside. Snow and ice has been driven into them by a blizzard which swept the district on the 27th of October. There only remains now the possibility that we can protect the grain from cattle and horses, in the hope that some of it will be worth threshing when spring comes around. It was simply impossible to get threshing machines at the proper time. Another difficulty was the financing of the cost of threshing, with heavy crops and a small quota for immediate delivery, many farmers could not pay it once. Trying to pay the threshing crew and meeting fuel costs was a great worry to many threshing machine owners, who after weeks of fighting bad weather conditions and difficult financing eventually pulled in their threshing machines, even before the weather forced them to do so.\"\n\nIt so happens that a number of the reserves referred to by Indian Agent Ostrander are indebted to the revolving fund for advances made to their community farms. In view of this report, however, collections this year are not likely to be very satisfactory.\n\nIn my report to you on my visit to the Caradoc Reserve, I referred to the organization of a project aimed at the production of willow on the reserve. It is encouraging to note, from a letter received from Indian Agent Down, dated November 20, that this project is now under way. The Indian Agent in his letter states:\n\n\"You will, I am sure, since your recent visit and discussions re the planting of willow be interested to learn of the progress made to date. Not much time was lost in reaching a final decision in respect to suitable land and I immediately requested Mr. Ryckman to prepare the land selected for planting.\n\n\"On Friday November 13 I received a call from Brantford to the effect that a quantity of willow sets were ready. I immediately made arrangements for the trip and on arrival was agreeably surprised to learn that 50,000 sets had been prepared for planting. I at once realized that we had a job ahead of us and the weather did not look too promising; however, I instructed Mr. Ryckman to hire 7 or 8 men and together he and I supervised the planting. This work was entered into and accomplished with a good spirit of cooperation, and I am happy to advise you that 50,000 sets have been planted. If nature will be kind and favour us with a few more days of planting weather, I shall be able to report the completion of this work.\n\nTRAINING\n\nA teachers' convention - the first of its kind held since I entered the Department 6 years ago - was organized at St. Boniface, Manitoba, on November 24, 25 and 26. This convention was made up of residential school principals and residential school teachers in charge of schools operated by the Government in cooperation with the Oblate Order. Principals and teachers were present from the following schools: McIntosh, Fort Frances, Fort Alexander, Sandy Bay, Muscowequan, St. Phillips, Cowessess, Qu'Appelle, Onion Lake, Dusk Lake, Thunderchild, Crowfoot, Blue Quills, Ermineskins, Blood, Sacred Heart, St. Albert, Guy, Beauval, Cross Lake and Grouard. In addition to the\nprincipals and teachers from the aforementioned schools, the convention was attended also by Bishop Phelan; the Reverend Father Southier, Oblate Provincial for Alberta; the Reverend Father Lavigne, Oblate Provincial for Manitoba; the Reverend L. Beuglet, O.M.I., representing the Bishop of Grouard; the Reverend Father Tessier, representing Bishop Guy; and the Reverend J. O. Plourde, O.M.I., who was mainly responsible for the organization of this convention, was also present. This branch was represented by Mr. Doucet and Mr. Phelan. Mr. J. R. Johns, Director of Vocational Education in the province of Manitoba, also addressed the convention and took part in the discussions. Mr. Phelan and Mr. Doucet have returned with very encouraging reports of the proceedings. Mr. Doucet is of the opinion that this was one of the best, if not the best, convention of its kind he ever attended. I was particularly pleased that Mr. Johns was able to appear before these teachers. Mr. Johns is, in my judgment, the most outstanding authority on vocational instruction in the Dominion. A few years ago he refused an offer from the New Zealand Government to organize the entire school system of New Zealand on a vocational basis.\n\nInspector Muller, in his report dated November 25 on the Peguis South, Centre and North Indian Day Schools and the senior and junior rooms at the Fisher River School, states:\n\n\"I enclose herewith reports of Indian schools which I have been asked to inspect. I am very glad to say that the teachers at these schools are not only qualified and experienced but are carrying on their work efficiently. They all show a personal interest in the welfare of their pupils and are putting forth their best efforts.\n\n\"The pupils are receiving practical instruction in health as well as in other subjects of the curriculum. I found the children quite neat in appearance and much better clothed than usual. Their health, too, seems to be much improved and there is a good attitude on their part toward their teachers and their work.\n\n\"Each of these schools has received recently about a dozen library books, attractive in appearance, and of an easy reading level. In my opinion these books are most suitable for the children and I have asked the teachers to endeavour to have all these books read during the course of the year. I feel that the reading of such books by the pupils in the low grades will contribute much towards improving the quality of reading generally found in Indian schools and will help to create a taste for reading. It would be interesting to follow the effect the reading of these books will have on the pupils.\"\n\nIt is gratifying to be able to report that a large number of our teachers appear to be taking a keen interest in the health program of the Department. A number of these teachers assisted last spring in the organization of garden projects on their reserves, and Inspector Waind, in his report on the St. Philips Residential School, states:\n\n\"The exhibits of this school at fairs during the past summer included health posters, Christmas cards, valentines and handwriting exercises. This school won prizes in the work shown including sewing as well as the above work.\"\n\nA few months ago I learned that Dr. Barclay, Superintendent of the Coqualeetza Hospital, was employing\na number of Indian girls as maids at the hospital. In a letter dated September 2 I asked Dr. Barclay to report from time to time on the number of these girls who in his judgment had made good. His first report, dated November 10, states:\n\n\"The above-mentioned maid, (Eleanor Moon) is leaving shortly because of the illness of an aunt with whom, I believe, she has made her home. This girl came from Alert Bay, in Mr. Todd's agency, and attended the Alert Bay Day School and St. Michael's Residential School. She completed Grade 6 in the latter institution. She came to us on the recommendation of the Principal of St. Michael's, Mr. Anfield.\n\n\"Eleanor's behavior here has been exemplary. She seems to have good common sense, has proven very satisfactory with hospital routine and latterly has been in charge of the preventive children as night attendant. We are sorry to lose her but hope she may be in a position to return to our staff later on. From time to time the names of other deserving girls will be drawn to the attention of the Department.\"\n\nI have referred from time to time to the domestic science classes at the Maliseet Reserve, in the New Brunswick Northern Agency. Indian Agent Whalen, in a letter dated November 10, refers to a visit made by him with two of his teachers to the Maliseet School. The Agent states:\n\n\"On October 31st I took Sister Dolores and Sister Balliana, teacher and field worker on the Woodstock Reserve, to visit the school and domestic science room at the Maliseet Reserve, near Perth.\n\n\"The teachers discussed problems and ideas with regard to their school work, the domestic science work and everything in general which would be of assistance to them in their line of work.\n\n\"Both departments of this school were visited in the morning and again in the afternoon, also the domestic science department in the basement of the school building. The domestic science work was wonderful. When the Sister told us the amount of money they took in for their manufactured goods I began to long for such rooms for the Indian schools of my agency.\n\n\"The visit was very satisfactory and much was accomplished. I believe if there were more such school discussions between the teachers of the different Indian schools, such discussions would prove very helpful to both teachers and pupils.\"\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the months\u2014\n\nRev. George Dorey, United Church Home Mission Board, Toronto;\nMr. G. E. Wood, M. P., for Brant County;\nMiss Feker, representing Canadian Press;\nIndian Agent Lariviere, Amos, Que.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\"\nOttawa, January 2, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR McILL\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended December 31, 1942.\n\nIt is difficult to resist the temptation that comes to one at the end of the calendar year to undertake and submit in this report a cursory review of the tasks undertaken and accomplished during the year that has now reached its close.\n\nWELFARE:\n\nIt can be stated that the Indians enjoyed greater earning power and on the whole a higher standard of living during the year 1942 than they have enjoyed at any time in recent years. Throughout the entire year employment was plentiful and wages high. The fur catch was above average and here, too, prices were satisfactory. The elimination of Japanese competition in the fishing industry on the Pacific Coast enabled an unusually large number of Indians to secure gainful employment in salmon and herring fishing. The distribution of huge quantities of discarded military clothing - greatcoats, tunics, windbreakers and boots - and the use made of this clothing by groups of Indian women has enabled the Indian to become decently and comfortably dressed for the first time in many years.\n\nThere have been, of course, a great many discouragements throughout the year. Discouragements, disappointment and an almost constant sense of frustration appear to be inseparable from Indian administration. Perhaps the greatest discouragement of the year was the result secured from our farming operations throughout the Dominion, particularly our farming operations in the three Prairie Provinces. With the exception of the Six Nations Reserve at Brantford and the Blackfoot and Blood Reserves in Alberta, I am disposed to think that there has been a substantial decline in our farming operations. Of course, I have not before me at the moment the statistics for the year, but a number of reports received toward the end of the year from our agents in the West indicate that a great many Indians were induced by the prevailing high wages to abandon their farms, with somewhat serious results. For example, the amount of grain threshed in the Battleford Agency was almost negligible. Large quantities of wheat and oats in this agency are now buried under three or four feet of snow and, prior to the snowfall, were drenched with fall rains. Indian\nAgent Ostrander intimates that an attempt will be made to protect this grain from the encroachment of cattle, field mice, etc. This delay in threshing operations has resulted in a number of requests from agencies for seed grain. A request for seed grain in the Battleford Agency was sent forward by Mr. Christianson a few days ago. He intimates that none of the wheat and oats will be threshed in time for next year's seeding operations and that it is doubtful if this grain would be satisfactory for seed if it were threshed, and so the Indian again turns to a benevolent government to assist him in his agricultural operations.\n\nAs a department we are the largest single land owners in Canada and should be the largest land operators, and yet, despite this fact, we are purchasing seed grain from year to year for Indian farmers and purchasing beef at this time as high as 16\u00a2 a pound for cattle supplies. There seems to be a peculiar lack of policy and direction in our farming operations in the Prairie Provinces, and I am not at all convinced that a change of policy can be effected under the present leadership. Agricultural and field staff seem to be either discouraged or in a rut, or perhaps both. Under the leadership of Dr. Robertson, they emerged from this rut for a year or so in Saskatchewan and, while on the surface, organized a number of worthwhile women's clubs and community farms. Indications at the moment, however, are that the progress then apparent is no longer noticeable. The tendency to lean on the Government appears to be very pronounced, with the result that relief expenditures in the province of Manitoba are almost as high at this date as they were during the depression. The Indian problem in Canada and particularly in Western Canada will demand strong, capable leadership. It appears somewhat astounding that in the area in Canada where the Indians own and control the greatest resources, progress appears to be most difficult. The progress made, however, by the Indians of British Columbia during the last few years affords a striking example of what can be accomplished by capable leadership.\n\nViewing conditions in the Dominion as a whole, however, it can be said that a number of projects have been organized during the course of the year which are likely to contribute to the health and general welfare of the Indians. The most notable of these, in my judgment, is the establishment of a number of goat herds on certain reserves. Purebred goat herds have now been established at Spanish and Golden Lake, Ontario Island Lake, Norway House and Berens River, Manitoba, and Sucker Creek Carlton Agency, Saskatchewan. In addition to this, a number of requests for the establishment of herds have been received from Indians on Lac La Rivi\u00e8r\u00e8, Dr. Orford and a number of Indians at the Cariboo Agency. The keeping of small herds of goats on the part of the Indian is, in my judgment, the least expensive method of providing him with a well balanced diet. The Indians of Berens River, Manitoba, who have been encouraged to keep small herds of goats, by the United Church Missionary at that point, have now learned that these animals provide them with an abundant supply of milk and that the goats can easily be transported by canoe to their hunting and trapping grounds.\n\nThe construction of root-houses has also been a notable feature of our year's work. Large community root-houses were constructed at Eskasoni, Shubenacadie, Lennox Island and Golden Lake Reserves during the year.\n\nIt is also encouraging to report that groups\nof Indian women have been organized for the remodelling of discarded military clothing during the year in Manitoba. It was necessary to exercise a great deal of pressure and secure the services of the Presbyterian missionary from the Battle agency before this work could be undertaken. Reports recently received however indicate that these organizations are now in full swing. If these groups of women can be encouraged to cultivate small subsistence gardens, preserve fruits and vegetables, in addition to the remodelling of military clothing, these activities should be reflected in the relief costs for the province.\n\nTRAINING\n\nA sincere and earnest attempt has been made throughout the year to save our educational institutions from serious impairment. This has not been an easy task. At the outbreak of the war we had in charge of a number of our day schools a fairly large group of fully qualified male teachers. With the exception of a few male teachers suffering from physical disabilities and a number of missionaries who have been exempted from military service, there have been no male teachers now in charge of Indian day schools. This shortage of qualified teachers has remained acute throughout the year, and has resulted in the employment of married women, many of whom have not been teaching at any time in recent years. This failure on our part to secure fully qualified teachers must of necessity be reflected in the progress and general efficiency of our schools.\n\nThe decision to pay our per capita grants to Indian residential schools on a basis of $2.24 has resulted in a substantial reduction in our school enrolment. It is worthy of note that in the year 1937-38 we had enrolled at residential schools 9,523 pupils and at Indian day schools, 9,510 pupils; and yet, despite the fact that our school population has a natural increase of approximately 300 pupils per annum, our enrolment for the last school year amounted in the case of residential schools to 9,249 and at Indian day schools to 8,441. It will thus be seen that our educational policy, for the time being at least, appears to be having such an adverse effect. The payment of per capita grant on a $2.24 basis, our refusal to pay for supernumerary pupils at residential schools, our failure to secure the number of teachers necessary to operate all our Indian day schools and the absence from reserves of a large number of Indian families have all contributed to this decline in our school enrolment. It is significant to note that our educational costs per pupil in 1936-37 amounted to $39.54 but have increased with the decline in enrolment until they appear to be at this date approximately $109.92 per pupil.\n\nThe tendency of the Indian day school teacher to change frequently, coupled with irregular attendance at day schools, is perhaps one of the most discouraging features of our educational program. It was disclosed in a pedagogical survey, undertaken a few years ago in the United States, that the average pupil enrolled at an elementary school will make more progress in three years under the same teacher than he will in four years under four distinct and separate teachers. Practically all the provinces in the Dominion have now a superannuation fund for teachers. The creation of these superannuation funds has arrested the tendency so evident a\nfew years ago on the part of teachers to move from one province to another and has contributed substantially to security of tenure and continuity of teaching service in public schools. The same that are likely to experience a great deal of difficulty in securing fully qualified teachers for our schools in the future unless such teachers are classified as permanent Civil Servants and thus enabled to qualify for superannuation allowances.\n\nOne of the outstanding accomplishments of the year, in my judgment, was an Intelligence Quotient survey of certain Indian day and residential schools, undertaken by Dr. C. E. Stothers, psychiatrist in charge of the Toronto Auxiliary Classes. The report of this survey, a somewhat voluminous document with complete tabular statements, was submitted to the Department on November 30, 1942. A great deal of this work, which was undertaken and completed without cost to this Branch, was accomplished by Miss L. Helen De Laporte, assistant to Dr. Stothers. A survey of the following day schools was undertaken:\n\nTyendinaga Central\nEastern\nMission\nWestern\n\nMud Lake\nKettle Point\n\nand the following residential schools:\n\nShingwauk\nKenora (R.C.)\nFort Frances (R.C.)\nSpanish (R.C.)\nMount Elgin (United Church)\nMohawk Institute (C.E.)\n\nThis report is likely to prove invaluable to the officials of this Division in working out an educational program designed to meet the peculiar needs of our Indian population.\n\nIn the language of the layman it would appear that the average Indian pupil is at least two years behind the average white pupil at any time during his sojourn at school. This discrepancy is due to a number of causes - lack of cultural advantages in his home, environmental disadvantages and linguistic handicaps.\n\nDr. Stothers is definitely of the opinion that it will be necessary to provide a special course of training for Indian day and residential school teachers before we can expect satisfactory results from our schools. The following is a summary of the recommendations submitted in the report for our consideration:\n\nSupervision -\n\nMore supervision by the school inspector is necessary.\n\nIf a group meeting or convention of the inspectors concerned were called, there would be a better understanding of the problems involved in Indian education.\n\nTeaching Staff\n\nA special -\nTeaching Staff\n\nA special course of training is strongly recommended for Indian day and residential school teachers. This course could be given at various centres across the continent or in Ottawa. It is suggested that a special grant on salary be given to both teacher and school to encourage the teacher to take this special course. If the teacher received special training, many of the difficulties which arise could, in our judgment, be overcome.\n\nEquipment\n\nIt is strongly recommended that large additions be made to all school libraries as soon as possible. Each classroom should have reading texts and social study readers both above and below the grade level of the classroom for children more advanced and retarded in reading. Any of the new progressive series of readers with controlled vocabularies would be suitable.\n\nIt is recommended that manual training equipment be installed in all schools to promote greater development of hand work as a hobby and the teaching of finer steps in woodwork which may not occur in practical work outside. The equipment of a household science unit room would enable a household science teacher to correlate the various activities of a household for teaching purposes.\n\nCourses of Study\n\nIt is recommended that instead of one course of study being followed by all schools the course of study be modified to meet the needs of the various communities. The effect of this will be to make some of the schools \"Opportunity Schools\" with the bright children as \"Specials\".\n\nArt and Craftwork\n\nArt work should follow a course of study with emphasis on the portrayal of familiar scenes and experiences. The child should learn the beauty of his own environment and his relationship thereto. Craftwork should be given throughout the entire period of the child's school life and not merely as a by-product of art. It should be an important subject. Craftwork, besides its development of the aesthetic sense, should develop muscular dexterity. It can be an excellent media for improving handwriting neatness and precision and in this way influence both spelling and arithmetic. Nothing restores confidence to the slow learning child who has met defeat as much as the creation of a piece of craftwork.\n\nIn view of the fact that such a large percentage of these children, i.e., 61%, need more than a straight academic course of study, the practical work at an Indian school becomes of paramount importance. In the majority of the residential schools this was essential work in the upkeep of the school itself, cooking the meals, dusting, sweeping, washing dishes, mending stockings and clothing, making uniforms, dresses and overalls. This work was usually under the supervision of the sewing teacher, cook or Supt. The necessities of the school, however, were the controlling factors. There were courses made out within the limitations possible and in some schools a good basic training was received. Each department seemed to be somewhat separate, the school, the sewing, the cooking etc. With closer guidance from someone with authority and training, the departments could be dovetailed and greatly increased in\neffectiveness. Embroidery was taught at St. Mary's (Kenora) and St. Margaret's (Fort Frances). Craftwork in the form of weaving was being taught at Munsey (Mount Elgin) and beaded moccasins at St. Mary's (Kenora). The workmanship and stitchery were well done.\n\nThe practical work in our judgment is being well done, in view of existing limitations of accommodation, money for upkeep, time and other handicaps. Children, however, are young but once, and it did seem pathetic to us to see the little children darnimg huge grey socks instead of making a gay doll's dress.\n\nWe are at present engaged in an intensive study of this report, with the object of extracting from it all that might with profit be incorporated in our courses of study. The suggestion that Indian day and residential school teachers should be given a special course of training is one that merits a great deal of study. In view of the fact, however, that Indian day school teachers remain less than three years on an average at our schools, it would seem to me that before a special course of study is organized and provided, ways and means should be found to encourage continuity of teaching service at our schools.\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nRev. George Dorey, D.D., United Church Mission Board, Toronto.\nRight Rev. G. J. Breynat, O.M.I.\nMost Rev. P. S. Moraud, O.M.I.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, January 31, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCGILL\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended January 31, 1945.\n\nWELFARE:\n\nI have referred on more than one occasion to the work undertaken and accomplished by Indian Women's Clubs in the Prairie Provinces and in British Columbia. Indian women's organizations have been particularly successful in the province of Saskatchewan. The members of these clubs are now engaged in the remodelling of military clothing, the canning and preserving of fruits and vegetables, the encouragement of better attendance at Indian day schools and in tasks of a patriotic character. It is no exaggeration to state that the existence of these organizations is one of the most encouraging features of our Indian welfare program. In view of this fact, it is gratifying to be able to report that a start has been made in the organization of these clubs in the province of Ontario. Indian Agent Down, in a letter dated January 11, states:\n\n\"I do not know how far you have progressed at other agencies in connection with the formation of Homemakers' Clubs, but I thought perhaps you would be interested to learn of the developments, progress and method of approach in forming such clubs at this agency. .......\"\n\n\"Perhaps I was fortunate in being able to retain a projector that had been used by Dr. Moore in presenting a lantern lecture outlining the nutritional value of vitamins in the daily diet; also his presence at my initial meeting. Prestige is always added by the presence of an official from Ottawa. I was also well supplied with a varied collection of very serviceable remodelled clothing, which was on display and used very effectively for demonstration purposes. .......\n\nThe result has been that we have now five groups but only two available sewing machines. This has caused some disappointment and confusion. However, we assigned the machines with promise that the three other groups would be supplied as efforts warranted. At this date four groups have been supplied with material and are functioning very creditably and satisfactorily. Already, children are beginning to appear on the reserve in remade sweater coats and new suits. Shirts are being repaired and being made over for men and boys. Blankets are being ripped and made serviceable. The women are suggesting an interchange of patterns for all types of winter and summer clothing. These women set their own meeting days and work out their own ideas of remodelling clothing and already the response has been far beyond expectations.\"\n\nMr. Down, in a report dated January 9, also refers to this year's farming operations at his agency.\nHe states:\n\n\"This is a service that has perhaps caused more unpleasantness and disunity at the agency within the last five years than any other service. Just why this should be so and wherein lies the fault, I do not know, and if I did, it is past history in any case. Certainly, every effort has been and will be made to correct many wrongs. In this effort, I have and expect to retain the full cooperation of Mr. Hyckman. It is perhaps sufficient to state that the program was started off on the wrong foot.\n\n\"During my regime of 10 months it has been my responsibility to take part in a complete crop season and it is on this 10 months that I wish to report. Crops went in good shape and although we did at times have a little too much rain, the growing season was good.\n\n\"Bushels threshed:\n\nRye - 1135; Wheat - 918; Oats - 2128;\nMixed grain - 1257, making a total of 5435 bushels.\n\nIn addition, we harvested 450 bags of potatoes.\n\n\"This, I understand, is the largest crop by at least 2,000 bushels that has ever been harvested under the local welfare program. Very good, but I am not satisfied. I do not like the scheme under its present system of operation. We are concentrating too much on agency farming for the benefit of the agency rather than the instructional values of general farming for the individual. Unfortunately, I see no immediate prospect of changing the system until a central instructional farm is introduced, whereby we can instruct. No man, no matter how good he is, can instruct in general farming merely by growing grain.\"\n\nIn a reference to relief costs at his agency in this report, Mr. Down states:\n\n\"It is sometimes said that there should be no relief administered these days of mechanical warfare with its attendant industrial and agricultural expansion. To a degree, this is correct, but we still have our aged, unemployables and sick individuals, and it is to these that relief is being extended. A genuine effort has been made within the last year to weed out the dead wood, the parasite who thinks the world and every person in it owes him a living. In this, I think I can claim some success. Your records should provide the answer.\"\n\nAn article in the February 1 issue of Maclean's magazine illustrates very strikingly the innate inertia of the North American Indian. This brief article, on page 40, reads:\n\n\"American soldiers at Fort Nelson, B.C., 250 miles northwest of Edmonton, are beginning to get the notion that certain of the Indians at that outpost are the laziest lugs north of the equator. They regard trapping as sport, make big money at it, but are allergic to all other forms of labor. 'They are what might be called the idle rich,' Morris Brown, U.S. Army, reports to his former colleagues...\"\nof Metropolitan Life. 'One big Indian buck came up to our tents and offered any two soldiers sixty cents an hour to cut wood for him.'\n\nBrown doesn't say what happened, but if the Yanks didn't teach the wealthy buck the ancient game of poker, and send him back to his wigwam sans feathers, they aren't the guys we thought they were.\"\n\nThe statement of welfare expenditures for the period April 1 to December 31 has just been issued. This statement shows a total expenditure for the period amounting to $457,078.46, compared with $469,171.08 for the corresponding period of last year. These figures represent a net decrease of $12,092.62. It is noted, however, that with policy of centralization in force in Nova Scotia, relief costs in that province for the period increased by $10,124.51. These figures are on the whole, in my judgment, reasonably satisfactory. Relief is now extended only to the aged, sick and physically incapacitated. The distribution of discarded military clothing has enabled us to effect substantial savings in a number of agencies. The only way whereby relief or welfare costs could be still further reduced would be by the multiplication of subsistence gardens and the cultivation of community gardens, from which old and physically unfit Indians could be provided with vegetables. An earnest attempt will be made this year to greatly extend our gardening program.\n\nTRAINING:\n\nA conference, arranged by representatives of the Churches with the Minister, which took place on January 9, enabled us to meet again representatives of all the Churches responsible for the operation of our Indian residential schools.\n\nThese representatives, without exception, emphasized the difficulty they are experiencing in securing the wool and woollen fabrics necessary to clothe the children enrolled at our schools. They are experiencing difficulty also in securing farm hands, dishers and domestic help. The representatives of the non-Catholic Churches contend that at no time in recent years have they experienced the same difficulty in securing fully qualified teachers for classroom work. They claim that at this date they are paying substantially higher salaries to both farm labourers and teachers than they were at the outset of the war. It is not at all likely that these conditions will change to any appreciable extent until the end of the war.\n\nA few days ago I reported to you that the Fort George Anglican Residential School had been completely destroyed by fire. Residential schools have been destroyed at the rate of at least one per annum since I entered the Department. The destruction of this school reminds us again that only fully fireproof buildings should be erected for the institutional care and education of Indians. We have\nbeen particularly fortunate in recent years in that, despite the number of buildings destroyed, not a single life has been lost.\n\nAbout a year ago we received some very flattering reports on the work of Anthony Walsh, teacher at the Inkanseep Indian Day School, Okanagan Agency, B.C. Mr. Walsh appeared to be outstandingly successful in the training of his pupils in amateur dramatics and buckskin drawings. He also, in cooperation with the pupils, published a booklet entitled \"The Tale of the Nativity\" or the story of the Nativity, gleaned from Indian legends. Mr. Walsh has recently resigned from his school with the object of joining the Armed Forces. We can only express the hope that his services will be available at the close of the war.\n\nEncouraging reports continue to reach us from the Grouard Indian Residential School, Grouard, Alberta. Inspector Stehelin, in his report dated December 2, 1942, states:\n\n\"In the school 'Adaptation to the immediate home surroundings of the Indian child' is the pass-word. This is especially true in the senior room, where Sister John is carrying on exceptionally fine work. Her quarterly review, the 'Grouard Echoes' is rapidly growing.\n\nAn enterprise is begun on 'Lets Go Indian'. Skilled Indian women come to teach the pupils how to make leather goods. For the boys, experienced Indians come and give demonstrations in birch bark work and other Indian skills. The C.Y.O. is progressing very favourably under the expert guidance of Father Porade. The pupils, boys and girls, are enthusiastic over these activities. The general results have been the development of an Esprit de Corps in the school, and an improvement in the general health and carriage of the pupils. The result of giving responsibility to pupils has been wonderful. The introduction of the Steam Bath has produced results beyond expectation. Skin diseases and vermin disappear as by magic. The teachers report that during the past year the entire school has been free from colds, grippe and contagious disease.\n\n\"The home economics class was visited. The ten girls enrolled are doing very fine work in sewing, rug-making, knitting and weaving. The building equipped as a home centre is very attractive and it provides a valuable opportunity for these girls to familiarize themselves with simple but yet important social graces.\n\n\"The wood-working class was visited. There is accommodation for 8 to 12 pupils. The raising of bees has been suggested by myself as an activity topic in the school. All teachers are very enthusiastic and it is planned to develop an enterprise on Bees, in which mathematics, science, art, social studies and language will be taught. It is planned that during the school years the Indian boys will learn about bees, make their own hive and equipment and on leaving school each boy will have one working hive and the necessary knowledge to carry on.\"\n\nWe have succeeded during the last year in securing positions for a number of girl graduates of the\nMount Elgin, Chapleau and Spanish Residential Schools. There appears to be an acute shortage of domestic help in a number of the larger centres throughout the Dominion and this shortage is very much in evidence in Ottawa. These girl graduates have been placed in a number of better class homes and are rendering satisfactory service. A number of these girls have also been placed at the Ottawa General Hospital. At the present time these girls are brought in from the residential schools and placed in the General Hospital by way of trial. Later, when they express a desire to go into domestic work, positions are found for them. Of the 12 or more girls already brought in, only one has abandoned her work. This girl, a graduate of the Mount Elgin Institute, returned a few months ago to her father, who is a resident of the Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nRev. C. A. Primeau, S.J., Principal, Spanish Indian Residential School, Spanish, Ont.\n\nMr. Maurice E. Bastien, Indian Agent, Lorette Agency, Que.\n\nRev. Geo. Dorey, D.D., United Church Home Mission Board, Toronto, Ont.\n\nMrs. Lovies, Women's Missionary Society, United Church, Toronto, Ont.\n\nRev. Dr. T.B.R. Westgate, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nMr. J. B. Kinney, Manager, Wallace & Tiernan, Ltd., Head Office, 350 Sorauren Ave., Toronto.\n\nHonourable Justice Robson, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nRev. Dr. Woodside, Chalmers United Church\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, March 1, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCGILL,\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended February 28, 1943.\n\nTRAINING:\n\nA year ago we reached an understanding with Lt. Colonel W. G. B. Dailley, Chairman of the Army Salvage & Disposal Board, whereby quantities of discarded military socks were shipped to a number of our Indian residential schools and a few of our larger day schools for processing. These discarded socks are shipped from the nearest Ordnance Depot and the processed yarn is returned to this depot. The response on the part of our school principals has been more than encouraging. The Principal of the Maria Day School, in a letter dated January 17, states:\n\n\"We have sent 500 skeins of yarn to the Military Officer in Quebec, as requested by yourself. Considering that the girls of the junior class are not 20 in number, you will admit that they have been very active.\n\n\"Out of the unraveled soldiers' socks there are remnants that are unusable unless woven for blankets. Nothing is thrown away. Everything, even the smallest clippings of material, have been saved.\"\n\nThe Principal of the Chapleau Residential School, in a letter dated February 22, states:\n\n\"I thought you might be interested to know that we have shipped from this school to date 700 cards of wool, reclaimed from old socks and wound after twisting two threads together.\"\n\nRev. Father Mackey, in his letter of February 16, referring to this work at the Shubenacadie School, states:\n\n\"I beg to inform you that we have made some progress with the wool from the army socks. When this work was begun, an army officer from the Salvage Depot came and looked over the work. He said it would be satisfactory for darning purposes. At that time we sent samples to Colonel Dailley at Ottawa. While waiting for a reply from him we went ahead and had 7,000 cards or skeins ready. Then the report from Ottawa came and said that it was not satisfactory\u2014that two strands should be made into one. However, since the arrival of the spinning wheel we have sent two lots of 1,000 cards each to Halifax, one early in January and one early this month. We hope to send about the same amount every month from now on. We do not know, of course, how this compares with what the other residential schools are doing. We find that the bottle neck is putting the yarn...\"\nthrough the spinning wheel. The wheel can be going practically all day long. A number of girls will put all the yarn thus processed on cards in a very short time. If this salvage work is to be carried on effectively until the war is won, two more spinning wheels will be needed. This work has cut into our Red Cross work and I suppose it is just as important.\"\n\nFather O'Grady, Principal of the Kamloops Residential School, who visited the Department two days ago, informed us that regular shipments of this reprocessed wool were being sent from his school to the Ordnance Depot in British Columbia.\n\nIt is interesting to note that while it was necessary to purchase a number of spinning wheels for this work, a few of the schools have succeeded in reconstructing old discarded sewing machines for this purpose.\n\nYou may remember that Sisters took charge of the Big River R. C. Day school at the opening of the present school year, October 1, 1942. This school had been from the date of its establishment in charge of a lay teacher, James A. Bonneau. Inspector Ferris, in his first report on this school since the Sisters took charge, dated November 27, states:\n\n\"The main feature of lessons observed was that every phase of instruction was made to serve the purpose of a lesson in oral language. In the lower grades especially, games and action songs were made to serve this purpose. In the more academic features of teaching the proportion of correct answers was higher and the responses more prompt than has been observed from any previous visit to this school. Now, it may be said that pupils furnish some evidence of achievement.\n\n\"There is no question that the present arrangement providing for a division of labour and responsibility has many advantageous features. The duties devolving upon the teacher of an Indian day school are too numerous and varied to be undertaken by one person unassisted. Under the able management of the Sisters in charge here, the pupils are not only provided with a wholesome noon lunch each day but they are learning, as well, many useful things in the field of domestic economy. The general tone of the classroom as well as the improved appearance of the children provides abundant evidence of the efficiency of the present management.\"\n\nI might add that Sister Cecilia, who is in charge of this school, has a Saskatchewan First Class Professional Certificate and has had 11\u00bd years' teaching experience.\n\nA particularly good report has been received on the work accomplished in the senior room of the Onion Lake Residential School (R. C.). Inspector Bowes, in his report dated October 21, 1942, states:\n\n\"This classroom is a credit to the institution; the tone of the whole school is excellent. The classes are bright and intelligent. The written work is good and mathematics well above average. Reading is fluent and\nexpressive. Spelling is well taught and the results very good. The pupils take a delight in telling stories. Language and pronunciation are excellent for the time spent by these children in school. Sister Celine du Carmel is a very efficient teacher and organizer. In fact remarkable results are being secured at this school.\"\n\nI have referred so frequently to the somewhat dilapidated condition of a number of our residential schools, particularly the older buildings, that I hesitate to discuss the matter again. Reports constantly reaching the Department, however, indicate that substantial repairs are needed at a number of our schools and that equipment in the case of many schools is in a worn out condition. I refer to the matter now, in the hope that when surplus equipment is available, immediately following the close of the war, the needs of our residential schools will not be overlooked. Indian Agent Gooderham, who is usually very conservative in estimating the needs of the schools in his agency, in his report on the Crowfoot (R.C.) School dated February 9, states:\n\n\"A good inspection was made of the Crowfoot School. The children were well and happy. The class work was well handled with three teachers in charge. The midday meal, too, was exceptionally good. The staff, however, work under certain difficulties. The laundry at this institution is very poor and there is no ironer. The washing machines and extractor are 30 years old and next to impossible to operate. It is hoped that this school can be supplied with an ironer and an extractor, even if the machines purchased are second hand. A new hog-house is urgently needed. During the cold weather litters of young pigs were lost, despite the endeavours made by the staff to save them.\"\n\nWELFARE:\n\nLast year, a circular dated April 7, 1842, was sent out with the hope of encouraging gardening on Indian reserves. The response to this appeal was on the whole reasonably satisfactory. Copies of this circular were sent to representatives of the churches. These representatives communicated with the missionaries on the reserves, with the result that we had the active cooperation of these missionaries in the organization and promotion of gardening projects. An earnest appeal was made by the churches to the Indians to take an interest in their gardens during the growing season.\n\nThis year, a somewhat similar letter was prepared and sent forward to all our field officers. We enclosed with this circular a vitamin chart, in the hope that it would stimulate interest in the production of vegetables from a health standpoint. The response to this circular, although sent forward only a few days ago, has been very encouraging. Indian Agent Lariviere has already requested 100 additional copies of the chart. Inspector Hamilton, in a letter dated February 22, states:-\n\"Please forward one dozen copies of the chart 'Vitamins' which accompanied your letter from Dr. McGill dated February 15. We would like to have some of these on hand to distribute amongst the Indian women's war service clubs in Manitoba.\"\n\nDr. Chas A. MacLean, New Richmond, Que., in acknowledgment of the circular letter and chart, states:\n\n\"I wish to thank you for the vitamin chart I recently received from you. It is the most concrete and practical chart of this sort of information I have ever seen.\n\n\"The nutritional condition of the Indians of Maria, P.C., is now at a higher level than at any time since I have had anything to do with them. In a great measure this can be explained by the fact that most of the families have men in the Armed Forces on account of whom the families receive an allowance. This provides more than enough money for the expenses of living. The wisdom with which some of this money is spent is faulty, but on the whole their buying power is greater and they have more food to eat. ....... The soil on the reserve seems to be a poor sort and such as it is, is impoverished. There would be sufficient pasture for the summer months for some cows but they could not raise enough winter feed for them.\"\n\nA very wide distribution of this letter and chart has been made. It has already been sent out to inspectors, Indian agents, medical health officers, farming instructors, nurses, and to the principals of Indian day and residential schools. Copies have been sent also to representatives of the churches for their information. The only unfavourable reaction to this letter and chart has come from Mr. Christianson. Mr. Christianson, with a great many years of service in the Department, seems to resent very bitterly any advice or direction from this Branch. His letter of protest, dated February 20, reads in part as follows:\n\n\"As far as I know at the present time, there are no able-bodied Indians on the ration list in Saskatchewan. The old people who are on the ration list are being cut down to the bone as it is, without having someone use the same old threat over and over again, that is that they will not be able to provide any sustenance for the Indians. These old people are not in a position or able to raise pork or poultry. Why do these officials keep harping on the same threat? I feel that when our Indian agents receive a statement of this nature they are placed in a rather peculiar position. After all, they see the conditions of the Indians and know that they are only getting a very meagre allowance. At the same time they are anxious to satisfy our Branch and they really do not know what to do.\"\n\nThe promotion of a gardening or any other worthwhile program among Indians at any time is an exceedingly difficult and exacting task, even with the active and loyal cooperation of the field staff. When this cooperation is lacking, the task simply becomes an impossible one. The agricultural resources of the Indians in Saskatchewan are greater than the resources of the Indians in any other province, and yet the progress we appear to be making in\nrecent years is far from satisfactory.\n\nThe following excerpts, taken from two letters recently received, I pass on without comment. Mr. Christianson, in a letter dated January 30, states:\n\n\"A few days ago Mr. T. B. Prince, Acting Agent at Carlton Agency, called me on the telephone and advised me he had received a letter from the Chief and Council of the James Roberts Band in Treaty No. 10, asking that the goats they were to receive this spring be cancelled because the Sucker River Indians informed them that the goats had not been of much help to them. Mr. Prince also stated he had received a letter from Mr. Moses Ratt, Councillor at Sucker River, objecting to keeping the goats they have there. I informed Mr. Prince that if these Indians did not want them there was no use sending them there. I also instructed him to see that the goats they have there were looked after, and you will note by Mr. Prince's letter that he has written to Moses Ratt, asking him to look after the animals personally and do his utmost to save the ones remaining.\"\n\nThe other excerpt is taken from a letter addressed to you from the teacher of the Spanish River Anglican Day School, Massey, Ont. The teacher in this letter states:\n\n\"Apropos the circular received today from the Indian Agent, which says 'the use of dairy products should be stressed; the Department will assist in establishing herds of goats' (circular #1254) may I respectfully state my case.\n\n\"Realizing that the people, especially the children in this locality, are milk-starved, I had done what little I could to remedy the lack. Out of my own funds I began serving a portion of hot milky cocoa to the children in school during the lunch hour, shortly after my arrival here in January, 1941. When I could possibly afford to, I have given cans of milk to those who badly needed it. Of course, out of my salary as teacher I could not afford to do very much of this sort of thing.\n\n\"Then, last October, I acquired four female goats. Three are Loggenbergs and one a Saanen. I acquired these goats with two objects in view. First, I wanted to augment the diet of the school children and their families by distributing milk to them. Secondly, I planned to give the young kids as they came along as prizes for improvements in living conditions.\n\n\"As soon as the goats were brought here I had the interest of the people. On my plan becoming known, one man began to build an addition to his house in the form of a kitchen. Another put a new floor in his house. Another is planning to build a new house.\n\n\"My wife and I have modestly re-furnished the school apartment at our own expense and have shown the people here what can be done with a moderate outlay. We want them to copy us and doubtless they will.\"\nThough this is an Anglican school and many of the Indians are Roman Catholics, no religious distinctions are drawn or will be.\n\nMy wife and I remain on the reserve during the summer. We are thus enabled to tend the goats ourselves all the year round and do our own gardening. In the former task the school children are very willing helpers, as they are very fond of the goats. In the second venture our gardening is of interest and an encouragement to the people.\n\nUnfortunately, in my efforts with the goats I have hit two snags. First: the billy goat that I had lined up for breeding purposes was strangled only a few days before I was to borrow him. I have not been able, though I have made numerous enquiries, to locate another. This is unfortunate as two of the goats should be bred before the end of March of this year. The other two should be bred next November or December, thus giving a constant milk flow. Second: One of the Indians, on promise of a kid to raise at home, helped me erect a log shelter for the goats. This proved to be too small and far too cold. I therefore, am having to board the goats out during the severe weather, at my own expense.\n\nFor advice on raising goats I wrote to the Departments of Agriculture, both Provincial and Federal. Along with pamphlets, Mr. L. E. O'Neill wrote from Toronto:\n\n\"I hope that your experiment with goats at your school will prove successful. Undoubtedly, your idea of having a better milk supply for the people particularly the children is a good one.\" From Ottawa, Mr. James A. Telfer sent pamphlets and in a letter said, \"I wish to congratulate you on your initiative in regard to the establishment of a supply of wholesome and nutritious milk for the use of Indian children...... I trust that you will be very successful in your undertaking and that splendid results with regard to the feeding of the children may accrue.\"\n\nIt would indeed be a pity if the two snags mentioned above were to bring to naught previous efforts. I was therefore overjoyed to read the above quoted paragraph from your circular No. 1234.\n\nWould the Department of Indian Affairs assist in procuring a billygoat for breeding purposes and the materials necessary to build a barn as described on page 12 of publication No. 634, Farmers' Bulletin No. 67 - Goat Husbandry in Canada? If the materials for building the barn are provided I would build the barn myself. I personally built a kitchen on to the school building, which is quite livable and comfortable. With a billygoat available I could build up a herd for the benefit of the people amongst whom I work.\n\nThanking you for any assistance you may render to enable me to continue to serve the Indians of this reserve, may I remain, respectfully yours - Charles G. Kehler.\"\nThe following visitors called at the office during the months:\n\nMr. George Black, M.P., for Yukon;\nMr. Eady, of Valentine Eady Company;\nMr. D.

Requests for additional copies of the Vitamin Chart, which accompanied the letter, have been received from Indian Agent Lariviere, Inspector Hamilton, Major D. M. MacKay and the Hudson's Bay Company.\n\nArchbishop Sinnott, in his letter of acknowledgment, states:\n\n\"The ideas expressed in this letter are excellent. If we could only induce the Indians to cultivate subsistence gardens and grow vegetables, it would be a distinct advance. As you suggest, I shall ask the missionaries in my jurisdiction to talk on this subject some time during the early spring season\".\n\nI have referred on one or two occasions to the welfare program organized at Golden Lake by Mr. Morris. A notable feature of this program was the purchase of a goat herd. The progress of this herd has been fairly satisfactory, although three goats were lost this spring. The Agent, in a letter dated March 17, states:\n\n\"In my report submitted March 1, 1943, I stated that 13 goats had kidded and that we have now 18 kids. I am sorry to state that since that time we have lost three kids, due to diarrhoea. Seven of the kids took this disease. We immediately isolated them from the rest of the goats, reduced their feed and gave them medicine as per instructions in publication No. 634 (Goat Husbandry in Canada). Four of the goats got better but three died. We have them in with the rest of the kids now and they appear alright.\n\n\"We now have six female and nine male kids, two old billygoats, one young billy and sixteen female goats. I have inspected this herd frequently during the winter and spring. The Indians are milking them and are using the milk. The goats milked well after freshening but are not milking so well now. However, I believe that as soon as they get on the grass their production will come back again.\"\n\nReports reaching this Branch from time to time indicate that the Oak River and Oak Lake Community Farms have -\nhave been exceptionally successful. This success cannot be attributed wholly to the fertility of the soil or to favourable climatic conditions. I am disposed to think that the success is due to a large extent to careful management on the part of the Indian agent. Both these farms have now met their obligations to the Revolving Fund in full and both have at this date a substantial surplus. This surplus will enable them to continue this year's operations without assistance from the Department. The Indian Agent, in his report dated February 25, states:\n\n\"Our Oak River and Oak Lake Community Farms have been very successful during the past few years, particularly this past season. This year we grew 25,310 bushels of grain and 500 bushels of potatoes. We have been able to dispose of most of our barley, which graded malting, realizing 60 cents per bushel, net. We have also disposed of half our wheat and at present we are feeding crushed wheat and oats to 45 head of community farm cattle, two department bulls, 6 horses, and 50 head of Indian cattle which would otherwise starve if we didn't take them in and feed them. This gets rid of considerable grain.\n\n\"We plan to summer-fallow more land this year and grow more coarse grains and flax.\n\n\"I am not in favor of raising pigs here. My labourer runs the tractor part time and operates the threshing machine all fall. It would be necessary to hire Indian labour to feed and care for the pigs and as Indian labour is in such demand I doubt if we could depend on hiring one capable of this work. In fact, I am not sure that I will be able to engage Indian labour to operate the tractors on our community farms. Personally I feel that I have all that I can handle under the present set-up here. I also feel that we are doing our bit towards the war effort by feeding our 45 head of community farm cattle and fifty head of Indian cattle.\"\n\nIt is particularly gratifying to note that they are feeding 45 head of community farm cattle and 50 head of Indian cattle at these farms.\n\nRelief expenditures for the period April 1, 1942, to February 28, 1943, amount to $544,170.94 compared with $565,872.99 for the corresponding period of last year. These figures indicate a net decrease of $19,702.05. Reductions during this period have taken place in all the provinces with the exception of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Manitoba. The increases in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island can be easily explained by the purchase of machinery, lumber for housing construction, etc. It is somewhat difficult, however, to explain fully the increase in Manitoba. Relief costs in Manitoba for the period under review amount to $79,211.37, compared with an expenditure of $59,083.37 in the province of British Columbia, where the Indian population is almost double that of the population in Manitoba. An itemized statement of welfare expenditures in Manitoba indicates that the higher expenditures take place amongst hunting and trapping Indians. There has been, for example, an increase of almost $5,000 in the Norway House Agency and over $1,000 in The Pas Agency.\nTRAINING:\n\nA great deal of enthusiasm is being displayed by the pupils of a number of our Indian residential schools in the processing of yarn for the Armed Forces. The following excerpt is taken from a recent issue of the Edmonton bulletin:\n\n\"Indian children of the Ermineskin Residential School at Hobbema are doing their part to help in Canada's war effort.\n\n\"In army camps throughout the province, soldiers are darning their socks with wool prepared by the Indian children from condemned socks which were discarded by the troops and returned to the salvage depot of the Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps at Calgary.\n\n\"When the 'condemned' socks - that is socks no longer fit for use by the troops - are received at the salvage depot from various units, they are packed and shipped to the Indian school at Hobbema of which Father P. Pheaume, O.M.I., is principal.\n\n\"The young Indians wash and disinfect the socks, then unravel the uppers and card the wool in skeins for darning purposes.\n\n\"The skeins of wool are then returned to Ordnance and distributed to the various Army units.\n\n\"The plan of having the students at Indian schools perform this worthwhile work is being carried on across the Dominion\".\n\nA number of reports received recently from public school inspectors and from one or two of our own inspectors deal with conditions that are far from satisfactory at a number of our Indian residential schools. With a substantial increase in the cost of living in recent years, coupled with the difficulty experienced by the church authorities in securing certain supplies such as woollen garments, etc., it is perhaps too much to expect satisfactory reports from these institutions. Conditions at one or two of the schools have a tendency to contribute to truancy. Inspector Coleman, who made a special inspection of the Alberni School, to determine the cause of truancy, in his report dated March 4, states:\n\n\"When I visited the school I attended at the noon meal in the children's dining room and observed that the food was served up on the tables 15 minutes before the entrance of the children. It consisted of boiled fish, potatoes, a piece of cake and water to drink for beverage. This did not appear to be a very interesting meal, as it did not appear to contain the necessary elements for maintaining the health of the children, although it might have some fattening value; I asked to see the menu for the week in order to ascertain the food balance for the day. I was informed by the Principal that he did not have one, the planning being left to the woman in charge of the kitchen. It was evident that the Principal was not conversant with the meals served, as would be expected. I would point out...\"\nthat, under existing circumstances, great care has to be taken with such diets, due to shortage of certain foods, and that the absence of planning is liable to lead to serious results, so far as the health of the children is concerned.\"\n\nMajor MacKay, in sending forward Inspector McArthur's report on the St. George's School, Lytton, B.C., states:\n\n\"Lack of properly qualified teachers is no doubt the fundamental cause of the low standard in the academic work at St. George's. It will be noted that Inspector McArthur found the teaching in three of the four divisions unsatisfactory and in one of the four divisions, wholly worthless. This, to say the least, is a disturbing state of affairs, but when one examines the qualifications of the present teaching staff, it is what might well be expected. It is evident that there has been a gradual deterioration in the academic work at St. George's since the resignation of Mr. Norman Stewart, which occurred shortly after Mr. Hives took over. It will be recalled that Inspector Barry reported quite favourably on this school in September, 1941. The four teachers on the staff at that time were fully qualified and all but one had considerable teaching experience.\n\n\"The question of salary has probably contributed to the difficulty of getting certificated teachers but in my opinion not to the extent suggested by Mr. McArthur. There has been, and continues to be, a scarcity of teachers, but apart from this and the question of salary, I am afraid that there continues to be a tendency on the part of some of our principals to feel that qualified teachers are not essential for work in Indian schools.\"\n\nInspector McArthur himself, in commenting upon the work of the teachers at this school, states:\n\n\"I found it impossible to rate three of the teachers on some of the points listed, largely because they are not teachers at all in the ordinary sense of the word. For instance, they do not know what preparation entails, despite the fact that they are conscientious. At the present time this condition is not by any means confined to Indian schools.\"\n\nA disturbing report on the prevalence of tuberculosis amongst the Indian pupils enrolled at the Morley (United Church) Residential School has been sent forward by Inspector Schmidt. In this report Dr. Baker, of the Central Alberta Sanatorium, states:\n\n\"Nine pupils have become positive reactors to the tuberculin test since November, 1941.\"\n\nDr. Baker in his report continues:\n\n\"I wish to point out that these children were not only X-rayed but given a physical examination by a member of our staff on March 9. There seems to have been a most unfortunate serious outbreak of tuberculosis in connection with this school and hospital, and I think your...\"\nDepartment should take steps to have another survey made before long.\n\nThis is a matter that comes directly under the supervision of the Acting Superintendent of Medical Services. I feel it my duty and responsibility, however, to state that in my humble judgment there is a vital and direct relationship between such outbreaks and the grants made by this Department for the upkeep and maintenance of our residential schools. I am convinced that with the limited funds at our disposal we should again seriously consider the abandonment of a number of our insanitary dilapidated residential schools. This would enable us without increasing our appropriation to increase the grants to a number of schools that appear to be unable to function effectively under the existing financial arrangements.\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nRev. George Forbes, O.M.I., Principal, Indian Residential School, Kootenay, B.C.;\nRt. Rev. J. Trocellier, O.M.I., Coad. to Bishop of Mackenzie;\nMr. J. G. Burk, Indian Agent, Port Arthur, Ont.;\nMr. Johnston - Canadian Industries, Toronto, Ont.;\nMajor McKeand,\nDr. T. J. Orford, Indian Agent Moose Factory, Ont.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, April 30, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCILL\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended April 30, 1943.\n\nWELFARE:\n\nIn response to an invitation received from Mr. Arnell, I attended a conference of Indian agents organized by him and held at the King Edward Hotel, Toronto, on April 2 and 3.\n\nThis was in my judgment one of the best conferences of its kind that I have attended at any time. The speeches delivered were brief and informative, the discussions relevant and well directed and the proceedings during the entire two day period of more than ordinary inspirational value. I am convinced that serious consideration should be given to the desirability of holding such conferences annually or semi-annually. Two of the speeches delivered appeared to me to be outstanding. One was delivered by Mr. Rush, of the Ontario Department of Agriculture Extension Branch. Mr. Rush is a vegetable grower on a large scale and he devotes a limited part of his time to the delivery of lectures for the Department of Agriculture. He has been engaged in the production of vegetables for half a century or more and informed us that last winter he shipped out 80,000 head of cabbage without losing a single head. Mr. Rush discussed up-to-date methods of soil cultivation, the selection of vegetable seeds, planting seed eradication, spraying as a means of insect control, the dehydration of vegetables, the construction of root-houses, the storage of vegetables generally, the effect of war on vegetable imports and in fact almost everything related to practical gardening. The discussion of Mr. Rush's address extended far into the night. The second address was delivered by Dr. Moore. It is exceedingly difficult to sum up in a sentence or two the impression created on the minds of the agents by Dr. Moore's illustrated lecture. Despite the fact that a great many of the terms used by Dr. Moore were technical, the lecture as a whole was followed very closely. The fact that the subject matter of the lecture and particularly the relationship between production of vegetables and health was discussed in the rooms by the Indian agents until the early hours of the morning is a striking tribute to the lecture itself and to its effectiveness in stimulating interest in the matters discussed. The delivery of this lecture at Toronto and at points in the West, Dr. Moore has already resulted in a number of requests for departmental assistance. These requests consist of additional demands for vegetable seeds, requests\nfor pigs, milch cows, poultry, goats and farm equipment. Should these requests continue\u2014and I am disposed to think they will\u2014it is altogether likely that this conference, if I may refer to it as such, may result in an additional expenditure of welfare funds that may exceed $100,000 for the present fiscal year. This money, however, will be well spent if it contributes to the health and physical wellbeing of the Indian population and should ultimately have the effect of substantially reducing hospital costs.\n\nAnother interesting result of the conference at Toronto is supplied in the number of requests for Dutch willow slips. Mr. Down of Munsey delivered a brief address at the conference on the cultivation of willow at his agency. His remarks seem to supply the answer to a number of questions that have recently been reaching the Department in respect to an adequate supply of raw material for basket making at reserves such as St. Regis, Pierreville, Maria, and Prince Edward Island. These willows not only make a substantial basket, and one which is likely to be much more durable than the Black ash baskets, but are admirably suitable for the construction of wicker furniture. You will be interested to learn that arrangements have already been made for willow plots at St. Regis and the other reserves where Indians are engaged in basket-making already referred to.\n\nIndian Agent Down, in commenting upon the agents' conference, in a letter dated April 10, states:\n\n\"I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the opportunity given of meeting with the senior departmental officials and officials of the field staff in a round-table conference. I left the conference with a spirit of complete satisfaction and the knowledge that our problems are not insurmountable. Much credit is due to the departmental officials for the close, friendly co-operation. A great measure of credit is due also to Inspector Arnsil for his untiring efforts to make the conference the success it was.\"\n\nLetters, indicating a wide-spread interest in our gardening program of this year, continue to reach this Division. The minutes of the meeting of the Enoch Band (Edmonton Agency) held March 8, read in part as follows:\n\n\"Agent Laight then spoke on Indian gardens. He told Council that it was the wish of the Department that every Indian on the reserve should have a garden. He explained that by growing enough vegetables the Indians would have a large part of their food. He also explained that it would not be enough just to grow vegetables for summer use but that every Indian should be expected to grow enough for both summer and winter use. Agent Laight informed Council that there was now a good root-house at this agency, where the Indians could store their vegetables for winter use, and that he expected to see the root-house filled with potatoes and vegetables this fall. The Chief and Councillors agreed to give Farming Instructor Boorse all the assistance they could in having good gardens cultivated on the reserve this year.\"\n\nAn illustration of initiative on the part of an agent, coupled with real co-operation between him and\nthe officials of the Provincial Department of Natural Resources, is supplied in a report from Indian Agent Pugh, Saddle Lake, dated March 31. In this report the agent states:\n\n\"I was successful in obtaining a crate of fish eggs from the Alberta Provincial Fish Hatchery at Canyon Creek, through the good offices of Fish Inspector M. Heron, of Lac la Biche, Alberta. In company with Farming Instructor Carrie, we put these into Saddle Lake, approximately 2 million whitefish eggs - on March 18. The co-operation of the Indians was excellent and they seemed to appreciate this action\".\n\nWe have been constantly emphasizing in our correspondence of late the desirability of having Indians who are now employed at high wages spend at least part of their earnings on the improvement and reconstruction of their homes. The response, while not as satisfactory as one might expect, in a few agencies at least, is rather encouraging. Indian Agent Ashbridge, of the West Coast Agency, in his last report, states:\n\n\"New houses have been built on Sheeshatht, Opitsat, Hesquiat, Mooshaht, Chlet and Ucluelet Reserves. All these houses are of more modern design than the ones formerly built by Indians on the Coast and all have been built without departmental assistance\".\n\nLetters received from hunting and trapping Indians are usually somewhat discouraging. Relief costs remain high in these regions. In view of this fact, the news contained in a personal letter received a few days ago from Mr. J.A.C. Watt, Rupert's House, by Mr. R. Conn, is exceptionally gratifying. Mr. Watt states:\n\n\"The beavers are rolling in and more mink than we have ever had here. Indians have very little in the way of debts and over $4,000 in credit balances. Rats are a better price than last year and if they get some they should be well away. The Indians have contributed almost $200.00 to Red Cross work this year. The relief account is confined to old widows.\"\n\nTRAINING\n\nFor the second year in succession, a special grant, amounting to $10.00 per pupil, was sent out early in the month to our residential schools. Audit reports recently received indicate that in a large number of cases this grant was urgently needed. Mr. W. R. Butchart in his audit statement on the Alberni Residential School (U.C.) dated March 29, 1942, states:\n\n\"The total revenue for the 24 months was $75,270.40, and includes per capita grants received from the Department through the Board of Home Missions, Toronto, amounting to $67,903.50. The grants for manual training for the period totalled $2,087.32, and other grants from Ottawa amounted to $287.56. Farm revenue from the sale...\"\nof live stock amounted to $1,118.11, while sale of candy and sundry refunds totalled $1,276.51.\n\n\"The expenditures amounted to $76,436.79 and are $3,766.39 in excess of the revenue for the period. As a whole, the expenditures compare very favourably with other schools of comparable size in the province. The salaries are about equal to those at St. George's School, Lytton, the only other large Protestant school in British Columbia. Power and fuel costs at $6,686.78 are somewhat higher than at other schools. Transportation costs for pupils at $4,556.42 are also high, and will probably continue as more pupils are drawn from such distant and scattered small areas. Included under 'Miscellaneous' are bank charges of $126.80, interest on overdraft.\n\n\"The Principal has had much difficulty in attempting to keep his expenditures within the income. The church authorities have guaranteed an overdraft of $2,000.00 but the Bank has asked that this guarantee be increased to $4,000.00. Besides the deficit of $4,354.95, the liabilities at the end of February included merchants' accounts of about $1,500.00 (including February accounts of about $1,000.) and the February salaries of about $1,100.00.\"\n\nYou may remember that immediately following the resignation of Inspector Barry we entered into an agreement with the Provincial Department of Education in British Columbia, whereby our schools are being inspected, this year, by the public school inspectors. The reports of these inspectors on the Indian schools visited to date have been somewhat critical. Their criticisms have been directed particularly against the employment of teachers lacking professional qualifications. The report of Inspector H. H. MacKenzie, dated March 31, on the St. Mary's Mission Residential School, and the report of A. F. Matthews on the Kamloops Residential School appear to be the most satisfactory yet received. The Inspector in his report on the St. Mary's School states:\n\n\"The classrooms at this school are large, well lighted and comfortable.\n\n\"Children spend half of each day in classroom work in the academic subject-fields taught, and the remainder of the school day is occupied by the boys in technical work or out-of-door activities, and by the girls in home economic activities, including sewing, cooking, laundry, etc. The boys have the benefit of a manual training instructor for three half days weekly.\n\n\"These Indian children display unmistakable evidence of being exceptionally well cared for. They are well fed and well and suitably clothed - the girls being taught to make practically all their own clothing. Dormitories and dining rooms are commodious, bright, sanitary and well kept.\n\n\"The work of teaching in all classrooms would be facilitated by furnishing a supply of supplementary reading and source material for the different grades enrolled.\"\n\"There is a very fine tone displayed throughout the school. Pupils are genuinely happy and seem to appreciate the kindly care and attention accorded them. The staff of teachers display unfailing interest in and enthusiasm for their work and are rendering a very fine teaching service.\n\n\"To Reverend Father Superior Fleury, principal of the school, however, whose optimism, energy, broad-mindedness and kindly and charming personality pervade the whole atmosphere of this institution, must go the credit for the truly sound and practical training given to these Indian children.\"\n\nInspector A. F. Matthews, in his report on the Kamloops Residential School, dated March 30, 1945, states:\n\n\"A good deal of attention is given to the matter of the vocational training of the pupils. The school day is divided into two main periods. In the case of the boys, one of these periods is spent in practical work on the farm, and the other in classroom instruction. When the new manual arts building is completed, the vocational training will be extended. At present there is not much integration, if any, of this work with the actual instruction in the classes. It appears to me that the classroom instruction in certain subjects, and particularly in Science, should be correlated in a large measure with the agricultural and mechanical art work carried on by the pupils.\n\n\"The girls appear to be getting a good practical training in domestic science and kindred subjects. Training in the domestic arts, such as cooking, fruit preserving, needlework, spinning, etc., is stressed. The pupils make their own uniforms and dresses and appear to be proficient in knitting, mending and fancy needlework. They are well supplied with equipment for carrying on these various activities and this material is well utilized.\n\n\"The school in general appears to be well conducted. Its condition reflects much credit on the business management and organizing ability of Father O'Conry. As principal of the school he keeps in close touch with all its various activities and is active and progressive in his work of administration and in his efforts towards providing a worthwhile training for the pupils. All records covering the school life of each pupil and the general business administration of the school plant are kept on file in the principal's office.\n\n\"The auditorium is a large building with a well equipped stage and a large central floor for games and general recreational purposes. It is equipped, also, with a moving picture machine. During my visit to the school the pupils staged an evening entertainment consisting of instrumental selections from the school band, vocal numbers by the girls and an exhibition of physical exercises by the boys. The colourful and becoming uniforms worn by the girls and boys were made by the pupils. The various items on the program were well rendered and...\"\nthoroughly enjoyed by the audience as well as by the performers themselves. The program presented by the pupils reflects much credit on the teaching and organizing ability of the teachers who trained them for this performance.\"\n\nThe following excerpt has been taken from the quarterly return sent in by Mr. Joseph M. Barre, teacher of the Pemberton Indian Day School, B. C.:\n\n\"School activities organized in the past have been continued with renewed vigor. The Junior Red Cross is active and sponsors the salvage drive. Radish, pumpkin and other seeds were harvested from the school garden. The visual course in Tuberculosis Education has been successfully covered in this quarter.\n\n\"A film slide of Indian basket weaving and commentary was made by this teacher for the Extension Department of the University of B. C.\"\n\nThe following visitors called at this office during the month:\n\nMr. R. J. Johns, Director of Vocational Instruction, Manitoba;\n\nIndian Agents -\n\nJames E. Daly, Charlottetown, P.E.I.\nJ. A. MacLean, Eskasoni Chapel, N. S.\nHarry C. Rice, Shubenacadie, N. S.\n\nMr. MacDonald Jacobs, Caughnawaga, Que.\n\nRev. H. Routhiers O.M.I., Provincial, Edmonton, Alta.\n\nMr. Cheshire, Hudson's Bay Company,\nMr. Crogg, Globe & Mail, Toronto.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\"\nOttawa, June 1, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCGILL,\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended May 31, 1943.\n\nWELFARE:\n\nDespite the fact that a number of weeks have passed since the visit of the Nova Scotia agents to Ottawa and the meetings of agents in Toronto, the Prairie Provinces and British Columbia, references to these meetings appear in agency reports and in general correspondence, almost daily. Indian Agent Rice, in his last monthly report on the Shubenacadie Agency, states:\n\n\"To have been to Ottawa for a week, in close contact with the officers of the Branch, was a much appreciated revelation. Names that were once identified only by signatures and titles have now become personalities with their own backgrounds. With these impressions comes a more vivid realization and understanding of the tremendous amount of work which these officials continually accomplish in their respective fields. Our labours here, on these individual reserves, are dwarfed by comparison. With the proper perspective comes a keen appreciation and a whole-hearted respect for the men with whom we work. To have been to Ottawa meeting our officers and to have been welcomed so cordially and treated so royally while there will always be greatly appreciated. I want to sincerely thank each and every one who in any way contributed to the success and enjoyment of the conference.\"\n\nIndian Agent Howe - Stuart Lake Agency - in his last report states:\n\n\"During my visit to Vancouver to interview Stephen Poole (accused of the murder of his wife) I was extremely fortunate to attend a very interesting and enlightening lecture on Nutrition, delivered by Dr. P. E. Moore, Acting Superintendent of Medical Services. May I respectfully suggest that at some future date similar lectures, accompanied by slides, be shown in this agency, where the Indians can attend, and particularly at the Lejac Indian Residential School.\"\n\nAgents in their monthly reports indicate that this spring has been the most backward experienced by them at any time in recent years. Indian Agent Gooderham, in his report dated May 12, on the Blackfoot Agency, states:\n\n\"Very little spring work has been done on the farms. Some cultivating was started, but the weed crop\nwas so slow that this was held up. Seed grain has been distributed, cleaned and treated, and machinery has been put in pretty good shape to rush in the crop. It is now the 15th of May and there is not 10% of the crop seeded. This is the latest season in our experience and it is hoped that nothing will hold up the spring work longer and that there will be a good rapid growing season.\n\nThe backwardness of the spring is likely to result in a substantial increased oat and barley acreage and a corresponding reduction in the wheat acreage. In view of the existing wheat surplus, however, this may result in better balanced agricultural operations and lead to greater dependence on mixed farming and stock raising.\n\nThe response on the part of agents and school principals to our circular letter on gardening continues to be encouraging. Indian Agent Ostrander, in his report on the Battleford Agency, dated May 5, states:\n\n\"The special effort put forward towards gardening, hog-raising, the production of milk, eggs and poultry is already bearing fruit. Many Indians have been able to buy a few chickens and have already made arrangements to increase their gardening efforts for the year. With authority from the Department, 30 breeding sows have been purchased and there were also a few sows purchased by Indians with their own funds. I think that in all there will be about 50 litters of young pigs this spring, which should make a substantial difference to the pork production of the country as well as a considerable revenue to the Indians. There is a large quantity of feed grain available on the reserves where these sows are located and little doubt exists that the effort will prove successful.\"\n\nIndian Agent Daunt, in his report on the New Westminster Agency, dated May 1, states:\n\n\"On April 20 we attended a very interesting lecture on Nutrition by Dr. P. E. Moore, Acting Superintendent of Medical Services. The Reverend Principal of St. Mary's Indian Residential School and two Sisters were also present from this agency. As the lecture was to be repeated at the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital, Sardis, we instructed the members of the local Indian women's club to attend.\"\n\nThe work undertaken and accomplished from time to time by the Society for the Furtherance of B. C. Indian Arts and Crafts continues to receive widespread publicity in the province. The Victoria Times of May 2, in an article entitled \"Indian Art Exhibit\" states:\n\n\"At 3:30 p.m. Monday, May 17, in the Provincial Museum, Mrs. Walter C. Michol will open the exhibition of the work of B. C. Indian children, which has been arranged by Dr. C. Carl, with the assistance of A. E. Pickford. The exhibition is being sponsored by the Society for the Furtherance of B. C. Indian Arts and Crafts, which was founded by Miss Alice Ravenhill and of which Major L. Bullock-Webster is now president. This society was responsible for bringing to the notice of the general public the paintings of Francis Baptiste of the Inkameep Reserve and...\"\nentertained the Indian children brought here by the community drama branch of the Provincial Department of Education for the opening of Thunderbird Park.\"\n\nDr. J. Melling, of the Athabasca Agency, in his last report, refers to the decision of the Department to supply Vitamin B flour to Indian agencies. Dr. Melling states:\n\n\"I am pleased to see that Vitamin B fortified flour is to be ordered for Indian use. I have seen what would appear to be signs and symptoms of thiamin deficiency in both Eskimo and Indians during the past four years. It would be interesting to run a series of blood levels for this substance in our local Indian population. It would be interesting also to compare the population of one of our primitive bands - solely meat eaters - with one of our more advanced bands whose diet is generally more varied and which is particularly high in flour and potato carbohydrates... I have noted particularly with the Eskimo that those individuals that took their food in the characteristic fashion - uncooked - were a healthier lot from the point of view of the B complex deficiencies.\n\nThe introduction of fortified flour would seem to be very commendable, providing a blanket order were issued to all traders dealing in this commodity. I recall that while I was at Chesterfield Inlet the Hudson's Bay Company, in co-operation with the Lands, Parks and Forests Branch, introduced a variety of whole wheat flour. The opposition trader at that point was stocked with the standard white flour. The stores of the latter trader were soon consumed as against a marked drop in the flour sales of the Hudson's Bay Company. Eventually the natives resorted to using pieces of silk or satin to sift the flour element from the Company flour so that the resulting bannock would be white. It is not easy to introduce new ideas to our native population especially if those ideas involve some alteration in the dietary habits.\"\n\nTRAINING.\n\nYou may remember that Miss E. Smith-Windsor, teacher at the Fisher River Indian Day School, was employed for a month of the holiday period of last year in the organization of homemakers clubs on a number of reserves in Manitoba, and permission has already been granted Inspector Hamilton to employ her for a similar period in organization work this year. It is gratifying to note that this teacher has been outstandingly successful in the organization of women's clubs on her own reserve. Inspector Hamilton, in a letter dated May 21, states:\n\n\"Miss Smith-Windsor, teacher on the Fisher River Reserve, reports the result of a Red Cross drive at that point. The W. A. and Women's Clubs held a joint sale of goods which netted a total sum of $260.00. This was certainly a worthwhile effort and the women of the different organizations are deserving of hearty congratulations. Perhaps you might see fit to write Miss Smith-Windsor, Koostatak, Man., a letter of appreciation.\"\n\nA letter expressing appreciation has already been sent forward to this teacher.\nIt would appear that steady progress is being made in the organization and extension of vocational courses in the province of Alberta. You may remember that Mr. Doucet visited the schools of this province about two years ago. Indian Agent Iredale, in a report on the Morley (U.C.) Residential School dated May 14, states:\n\n\"I would like to mention that excellent progress has been made at the school in the manual training classes. The older boys are showing wonderful response in the making of various articles (household things) such as medicine cabinets, etc., but what struck me most were the kitchen cabinets, of which there were seven, all completed, with the exception of three which still need the small handles and the glass in the doors.\n\n\"They are all the same size and style, measuring 42 inches by 24 inches by 68 inches high in the lower part. There are two cupboards and two drawers and above the table top there is another cupboard with glass doors opening in the middle, with hooks for hanging cups and small basins inside near the back to set plates on their edges. These cabinets are very well made and are attractively painted in various colours. I would estimate them to be worth at least $25.00 each.\n\n\"The boys are very proud of their work and they will be allowed to take them home at the end of the school year. In my opinion this line of training should be encouraged. I would suggest that further materials should be furnished for next year's manual training, but I think they should get their supplies during the summer vacation, in order that they can commence immediately in the new school year and also in time to allow the lumber to become properly dried out (most of the lumber purchased now-a-days is very green).\n\n\"I cannot say that the progress in the classroom is anything wonderful. The majority of the children are just mediocre, but there seem to be a few bright pupils.\n\n\"The sewing classes are doing very good work, repairing clothes and making over old clothes into various useful garments. This is very good training. There is also a beadwork class one afternoon each week, when the girls are shown how to make leather goods, gloves, mitts, moccasins and the like, with bead trimmings. Some of the work is very good, both in design and workmanship.\"\n\nA number of schools have been particularly successful in reclaiming wool from discarded military socks. The Sisters in charge of the Pierreville Indian Day School are in receipt of the following letter from Major L. A. LaCroix:\n\n\"Reverend Sisters: - This will acknowledge with thanks receipt of 14 pairs of socks together with 540 cards of darning wool made from condemned socks.\n\n\"This office would particularly like to emphasize the high standard of work performed by your pupils in making new socks from condemned socks. Several pairs...\"\nof these socks are being forwarded to the Army Salvage and Disposal Board for their information.\n\nYours truly - L. A. LeCroix, Major,\nD. O. O., MD. No. 5.*\n\nMrs. Winifred E. Faison, teacher of the Boothroyd Indian Day School, Lytton Agency, British Columbia, in a letter dated March 31, states:\n\n\"The pupils of this school are all members of the B.C. Junior Red Cross and complete their health charts each morning. They have sent parcels of knitted goods to the Red Cross for bombed out children overseas and have also sent donations to the Prisoner of War fund.\n\nWith reference to a circular recently sent out by the Department on Nature Study, I would like to state that my pupils, like myself, are great nature lovers. We keep a daily record of everything we observe - the arrival of birds and their migration, arrival of insects, flowers of every season, etc. We make good use of 'Canadian Nature' and 'Forest and Outdoor' magazines.\"\n\nTwo fully qualified teachers are regularly employed at the Coqualeetza Hospital. The salaries of these teachers are paid from the Indian Education Appropriation. In the employment of these teachers we are following a practice that has become general at the larger sanatoria throughout the country. Mr. H. H. MacKenzie, public school inspector, in his first report on the work of these teachers, dated April 1, states:\n\n\"All children are inmates of the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital and receive their instruction in their hospital cots, either in the preventorium or in the regular wards of the hospital. Thus there can be no classroom activities in the usual sense of that term. In the preventorium, pupils receive instruction two hours daily for five days per week. In hospital wards A and B (younger children) daily instruction continues for approximately one hour; in ward C, one hour on alternate days and in wards D and E, for one and one-half hours daily.\n\nA really noble experiment is being attempted here, and I am persuaded that a very fine service is being rendered to these invalid Indian children. As must be obvious, the work is beset with many real difficulties but admirable patience, genuine sympathy and understanding and indefatigable energy in, and enthusiasm for, their work on the part of both teachers engaged in this service are assurances of sound and successful work being accomplished.\"\n\nMiss Bertha Blue, teacher at the Songhees Indian Day School, Cowichan Agency, B.C., in a report to the Indian Agent dated May 9, states that a Homemakers' Club has been organized recently on the reserve. She writes as follows:\n\n\"At present some of the members are knitting for our Armed Forces while others are sewing articles for the needy in Russia. Another item stressed at some of the first meetings was the necessity of planting gardens. The\nmajority of the members have already done so. For our next meeting we have been fortunate in procuring a guest speaker. The subject of her lecture will be 'Proper Nutrition and Good Health'. This, I feel sure, will prove not only interesting but enlightening to our members.\"\n\nIndian Agent R. H. Moore, Duncan, B.C., in commenting upon the work of this teacher, states:\n\n\"I might say in this regard that Miss Blue has already shown her ability as an organizer among the women of the reserve in many ways. There is quite an active Junior Red Cross Unit at this school.\"\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nMr. J. A. Marleau, Indian Agent, Nipissing Agency, Sturgeon Falls, Ont.\n\nMr. D. M. Stephens, Deputy Minister of Mines and Natural Resources, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nVery Rev. J. Scannell, O.M.I., Provincial of Oblate Order in B. C.\n\nRev. Dr. Geo. Morey, Associate Secretary, Board of Home Missions, United Church, Toronto, Ont.\n\nMr. F. Brisebois, Indian Agent, Caughnawaga, Que.\n\nMr. Rodolphe Leduc, M. P.\n\nRepresentative of Office Specialty Co.\n\nRev. Father Cashen, Nova Scotia.\n\nMr. Kelly, Chief, Salvage Division.\n\nDr. Coady, Director of Extension Service, St. Francois Xavier University, Antigonish, N. S.\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A. Hovey\nSupt. of Welfare Training.\nOttawa, June 30, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCGILL,\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended June 30, 1943.\n\nWELFARE:\n\nI am now in receipt of the final financial statement showing welfare and relief expenditures, by provinces, for the fiscal year 1942-43. This statement indicates a net decrease in expenditures amounting to $59,379.25 when compared with expenditures for the preceding fiscal year. Decreases appear to have taken place in all the provinces with the exception of Prince Edward Island, which shows a net increase amounting to $443.08, and British Columbia, with an increase of $1,619.76.\n\nA particularly gratifying feature of this statement is the net decrease in relief expenditures in the province of Nova Scotia and in New Brunswick. The decrease in Nova Scotia amounts to $15,020.25. This net reduction in expenditure has taken place despite unusual expenditures made for the purchase of trucks, sawmills and a limited acreage of land at the Shubenacadie and Eskasoni Reserves. The salary of Mr. Robb, Construction Foreman, and the wages of a group of men engaged in the construction of Indian homes has also been charged to the Welfare Appropriation.\n\nRelief expenditures remain high in the northern Agencies - Seven Islands, Abitibi, James Bay, Sioux Lookout, Clandecope, Torrey House, The Pas, Battleford, Athabasca, and Lesser Slave Lake. The smallest decrease - $386.37 - appears to have taken place in the province of Manitoba, and the greatest, apart from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, already referred to - $19,282.22 - in the province of Saskatchewan.\n\nThe reduction in expenditures appears on the whole reasonably satisfactory. Certain lands were purchased from the welfare appropriation during the last fiscal year in Nova Scotia and Bear Island, Ontario. These expenditures would ordinarily be charged to the Reserves and Trusts Division and are scarcely a legitimate charge on welfare funds. However, no provision has been made in recent years for the purchase of lands in the Reserves and Trusts appropriation.\n\nThe following excerpt, taken from the annual report of the Secretary of the Interior of the United States, is interesting, in view of the decision of this Department, in 1941, to purchase additional lands and centralise the Indian population of Nova Scotia on the Shubenacadie and Eskasoni Reserves:\n\n\"Essentially the Indians are a rural people and services in their behalf have had to be aimed at their economic rehabilitation, largely through various forms of agriculture, forestry, livestock and other uses of natural resources. Studies conducted during the past four years...\"\nof graduates of Indian schools show unmistakably that the majority of Indian young people, upon completion of their schooling, either remained at home permanently or returned there within a short time after graduation. Even the young people who had been trained in vocational and industrial pursuits as a rule did not pursue their trades, but found their way back to their home communities. The depression and the continuing unemployment in skilled trades and other forms of wage work made it extremely difficult for young Indians to secure employment in cities. Hence, it became the policy of the Indian Service to make available to Indians every possible opportunity to secure a livelihood through the use of reservation resources.\n\n\"This policy found expression in a program characterized by land acquisition and consolidation; extension of credit facilities; conservation of soil and moisture; education of Indian youth in the intelligent use and conservation of their resources, and by other activities designed to conserve, enlarge and properly to use the natural resources of the Indians.\n\n\"These efforts toward economic adjustment of the Indians on the land and the conservation of their resources are now being supplemented with programs to aid the Indians in taking their part in the defense program.\"\n\nI have referred on more than one occasion in these reports to the urgent need of repairs at certain Indian day and residential schools. In recent weeks I have had an opportunity to review reports dealing with the condition of agency offices, the houses of Indian agents and agency buildings in general. These reports have convinced me that the funds available for the repair and upkeep of these buildings during the last 10 or 15 years have been wholly inadequate, to keep the buildings in good condition. Mr. Christianson, in a lengthy report on the Touchwood Agency, dated June 10, 1943, under the heading \"Government Buildings\", states:\n\n\"As you are aware, no exterior painting has been done at this agency for years. The sidings on the buildings are becoming loose and need repainting. The furnaces are giving out and a great deal of expenditure will have to be made to put the buildings in shape. The furnace at the agency office is burnt out; the furnace at the agency house is burnt out and the furnace at the farming instructor's house and fishing lake is burnt out. Therefore, you will see it will take a lot of money to put things in shape. On the outside the buildings appear to be alright but they are in poor shape when examined from close range.\"\n\nIt has occurred to me that an officer might be employed by this Branch and charged with the responsibility of making the best possible use of the surplus materials and equipment that are likely to be available from time to time at military camps. I find it difficult to persuade myself that Indian agents and field officers, generally, can render satisfactory service while they remain dissatisfied to the extent that a number of them appear to be dissatisfied with housing conditions on our reserves.\n\nA sincere attempt has been made during the last two or three years to increase the number of live stock,-\ncows, goats, pigs, etc., on our reserves in the Prairie Provinces. The response on the part of agents has been somewhat dilatory, but with the disappearance of drought conditions, recent reports have become more encouraging. Indian Agent Ostrander, in his report dated June 6, 1943, on the Battleford Agency, states:\n\n\"Cattle have wintered with minimum losses. The calves are coming along satisfactorily. Nine well-bred Hereford heifers were bought for the Founder's Reserve at the request of the Indians. Goats are being purchased where needed and are being requested for milking purposes. However, only four have been bought so far and goats are hard to get. Seven more will be purchased just as soon as they can be found. In an effort to increase hog production, 20 sows, in pig, have been purchased with departmental authority. Another 25 have been purchased by Indians with their own resources. A few of these have farrowed and the average litter is slightly over eight, which, with fair luck and good attention, should give us around 400 hogs for market early in the winter. The Indians appear to have become quite interested in the hog industry and it should develop, unless it receives an unexpected setback by disease or accident.\"\n\nThe reafforestation program, started in Ontario four years ago, has been retarded somewhat by the acute labour shortage existing on reserves. It is encouraging to note, however, that the Indian agents concerned remain interested in these projects and encourage their extension wherever possible. Indian Agent McNaughton, St. Regis Agency, in his last report, dated June 4, states:\n\n\"Two acres of land were leased in the Chenail for the purpose of planting willows and 16,000 sets were put in at this agency. In addition to this, 1,000 pine were planted, some for agency purposes and the rest distributed amongst Indians. A number were planted at three of our schools, the latter being done to improve the site as well as to provide a windbreak. A small number of fruit trees were also distributed.\"\n\nTRAINING.\n\nExcerpts from two letters received by Canon S. Middleton, Principal, St. Paul's (C.E.) Residential School, Blood Reserve, Alberta, have been published in a recent issue of the Lethbridge Herald. These letters indicate that these boys are continuing with their studies and seeking to improve their educational standing while serving with the Armed Forces. In part, this ex-pupil, now in England, writes:\n\n\"I am taking a course at an English School and the instructors really know what they are doing. Most of them saw service in the Battle of France. It is quite odd to be amongst English fellows. They are very reserved but we get along fine. There is a sharp contrast between them and the Canadians. The Canadians are usually loud-voiced and more confident than the English. Yesterday I went for a walk in a part of England I used to read about in ancient history, never dreaming that some day I would be sitting in that spot. The Salisbury Plains look like the prairies. At Petawawa 40 of us were in the same class; now there are only 4 of us taking advanced survey work,\u2014a very small percentage, considering that the Petawawa...\"\nclass had the highest average of any class to take the course. If you are not mathematically inclined, however, you simply cannot keep up the pace. I would like to form an all-Indian regiment, but I am afraid it is an idle thought.\"\n\nThe other ex-pupil, Stephen Wadsworth, writes:\n\n\"I am getting along very satisfactorily in school. I am up in the filing and fitting department and will spend one month there before moving on into the woodwork department. I am getting quite proficient with a file and other tools.\"\n\nSpeaking of his family at home, he says:\n\n\"I am here so that they and their children may go on living in a world that is really worth living in. I have often heard the phrase 'A country worth living in is worth fighting for', and I quite agree with it. I am happy and proud to be able to say that the graduates of good old St. Paul's have contributed so much toward the realization of a final Allied victory.\"\n\nRecent audit reports received from the Treasury office indicate a rather disturbing increase in the cost of operating residential schools. These increased costs would appear to be due to a reduction in the average attendance at a number of our schools and the increased salaries paid to teachers, coupled with the higher wages paid to farm help. Mr. E. H. Berthe, in his last report on the Mount Elgin Institute, dated May 26, 1943, states:\n\n\"The cost per pupil per year shows an increase of $34.19 over the previous year. This increase is due to the reduction in the average attendance from 141.15 in 1941-42 to 127.78 in 1942-43.\n\nMr. Berthe adds: - \"Although there were no extraordinary purchases at this school during the year, the financial condition is worse than one year ago. According to the Principal, he cannot see any improvement in sight, as the general cost of operation appears to be steadily increasing\".\n\nMr. W. R. Butchart, in his report on the Sacred Heart (R.C.) Residential School, Peigan Agency, dated May 7, 1942, states:\n\n\"The cost of operation per day was up by $4.38. The cost of operation per pupil per year was quite high at $24.30 - an increase of $28.56. This increase may be traced to the increased farm costs. The cost of clothing at $7.41 is very low and is down by $8.56. The cost of food at $31.57 per pupil per year is up $1.56.\"\n\nThe per capita grant allowed at this school is $165.00.\n\nThe Auditor, Mr. Butchart, in his report on the Blood (R.C.) Residential School, dated May 28, states:\n\n\"The cost of operation per day is up by $12.21 and the cost of operation of $205.28 per pupil per year shows an increase over the preceding year of $22.76. The cost of clothing at $18.95 is $5.70 higher and the cost of food at $28.21 is $3.24 higher. The children appear...\"\nto be well dressed. The low food costs are due to the fact that all meat, vegetables, milk, butter and eggs are produced on the farm.\"\n\nThe per capita grant allowed at this school is $165.00.\n\nYou may remember that, immediately following the retirement of Inspector Barry, provision was made for the inspection of our Indian day and residential schools in British Columbia by public school inspectors, under the direction of the Provincial Department of Education. Reports of these inspectors have been reaching the Department from time to time during the last 6 or 7 months. While a few of the reports submitted by these inspectors have been somewhat critical of certain teachers who lack professional standing and of others too old to adopt new teaching methods, the reports on the whole have been satisfactory and somewhat encouraging.\n\nInspector T. F. Robson, in his report on the Lejac (R.C.) Residential School, Stuart Lake Agency, states:\n\n\"The program of vocational work provided at this school is comprehensive and varied. Provision is made for differences in age, sex, physique and talent. Training tasks are rotated so that children obtain variety of experience in home activities, the school farm, gardens and workshops.\n\n\"Boys were observed actively employed in the care and feeding of farm stock, wood and metal work, shoe repairing, gardening, slaughtering and preparation of animals for food consumption, and various aspects of repair work and maintenance.\n\n\"A hot-house has recently been constructed by the boys for the acceleration of plant production. Improvised power tools, initiated by the instructor of vocational training - a graduate of the school - are a feature of the wood-work establishment. The butchers' and cobblers' shops are giving valuable training. Some of these buildings are too small and the scope of the work is thereby restricted.\n\n\"Girls are well trained in homemaking activities and develop responsibility in house-work - care, preparation and service of food, dormitory service, laundry, bake-shop and dairy practice. They take an active part in butter and cheese making and in the cleaning and grading of eggs. Training in needlework is exceptionally good; much of the pupils' clothing is made and maintained by the girls; the art needlework is excellent and the knitting, noteworthy. Spinning is practised and the provision of hand-looms would be a worthwhile addition to this phase of pupil training.\n\n\"With respect to general conditions, I may state this institution is effectively supervised and economically and efficiently administered. Offices, stores and warehouses were inspected and found to be in good order. Careful planning and direction is reflected in an orderly work routine.\n\n\"The farm is a notable feature. Power machines and horses are both used in soil cultivation. A dairy herd of Holsteins, a beef herd of Shorthorns, Sheep, Swine, and poultry bear evidence of good husbandry and provide\nvaluable training. Numerous field crops are grown.\n\n\"The children are particularly well dressed, clean and tidy and appear to be happy and healthy. The staff take a keen personal interest in their welfare and, in my opinion, these children are most fortunate in their environment. The uniform dress of both boys and girls is both attractive and economical. Clothing of a practical character is worn for outdoor activities.\n\n\"Constant upkeep by repairs and paintwork, apart from sound economy, enhances the attraction of this institution\".\n\nIn view of the fact that a certain proportion of our time is spent in dealing with delinquent Indian girls and wayward Indian boys, it is gratifying to be able to report the case of an Indian girl who is making a real success of her work, Miss Christine Wakegiijig, teacher at the Burwash Indian Day School, Manitoulin Island Agency. Miss Wakegiijig has been in charge of this school for the last 5 years. She has a first class Ontario certificate and has completed Part I of a special elementary course in Home Economics. She is a graduate of the Spanish R.C. Residential School and of the North Bay Normal School. Inspector W. J. Greening, in his report dated May 8, states:\n\n\"The privilege of visiting this school is a genuine treat to an inspector. There is no other school in this whole inspectorate in which more efficient work is being done. As I remarked last year, this is a splendid little school with an equally splendid little teacher, an Indian maiden of whom the Department may be justly proud. I have met few teachers her superior and all too few her equal\".\n\nTwo years ago the Christian Island R.C. Day School was taken over by Sister Agnes Black, S.O.S., Sault Ste. Marie. Sister Black, who has visited the Department since taking charge of this school on two occasions, appears to be doing particularly good work at her school. She is a teacher with a Quebec Superior Certificate and has had 14 years' teaching experience. Inspector Bennett, in his report dated May 28, states:\n\n\"I examined all pupils in reading, spelling, arithmetic, writing and language. I found their progress and proficiency quite good. In fact, this teacher has produced real results. The pupils are interested in community singing and sang five school songs for me. Two pupils played the piano. Real results in sewing and knitting are in evidence. I viewed quite a few articles made by these pupils\u2014towels, mitts, parkas, pillow slips, knitting bags, neatly done, and other sewing.\n\n\"The health of the children is the concern of the teacher as well. Individual cups and tooth brushes are neat and clean at the rear of the school, provision being made for cleanliness of hands and face. The equipment of this school is in good order. The classroom is most attractive and neatly 'dressed' with children's work and suitable pictures for language purposes. When one compares the appearance of this room with other similar schoolrooms, one is impressed with this school\".\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nRight Rev. M.

In her report to Inspector Hamilton on the work accomplished in The Pas Agency, Miss Smith-Windsor states:\n\n\"Mr. Lovell had arranged for suitable homes at Big Eddy and The Pas, where our meetings were held. A woman interpreter and leader had been chosen at each place. Sewing machines were also available at these homes. Announcements of my gatherings Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday at Big Eddy and Thursday and Friday at The Pas had been made at the churches on the preceding Sunday. Mr. Lovell's hearty cooperation, in fact, went a long way towards making my meetings a success.\n\n\"Attendance at Big Eddy was very good and a tremendous amount of work was done by the women there. Thirty women and older girls attended the meetings and 82 articles were completed.\n\n\"The Indian women were told the purpose of the women's clubs and shown some garments that had been made by the Fisher River club. Most of the women stayed to do their work at George McMillivary's home. They ripped out the garments, cut and sewed them right there. A few who had small children at home took work with them and returned for more as each garment was completed.\n\n\"At The Pas meeting fewer women attended because many of the women are working in the potato fields at present. Those who did attend were the younger women. Their interest will draw others, I am sure. Twelve women, however, attended and five articles were finished in the two days spent with them.\"\n\nA number of encouraging reports on the condition of Victory Gardens have reached the Branch during the month. Indian Agent Rice, of Shubenacadie, in his last report, states:\n\n\"Although we were late getting the crops in, I believe the yield should be a good one. The great amount of moisture and a few really hot days made the growth almost...\"\nmushroom-like over night. All told we put in about five acres of potatoes, one of turnips and one of smaller vegetables\u2014chiefly carrots, parsnips, beets, beans and peas. It was necessary to send a tractor around to help some of the families on the reserve, as the local farmers were too busy struggling with the weather to bother much with the Indians. This privilege was kept to a minimum, however, and enjoyed chiefly by the old folks. In addition to this community effort, practically all of the Indians, both old and young, have very good and fairly large family gardens. Due to the widespread shortage of commercial fertilizer, most of the Indians were caught flat-footed. Fortunately, I knew a farmer who had purchased more than he needed and the Indians were able to buy almost a ton. For our community garden I bought 15 truckloads of stable manure. This, with a sprinkling of the more refined variety, should give the garden the little extra boost that is needed.\n\n\"On the 7th instant we moved a family into the last of the six houses constructed last autumn. All the occupants of the new buildings have large gardens. One house in particular was built right in the middle of a large growth of alders. After working hours and during idle days this Indian has cleared, stumped, ploughed and seeded a plot which is already large enough to supply him with his winter vegetables.\"\n\nIndian Agent F. H. Moore, in his report on the Cowichan Agency, dated July 1, states:\n\n\"The crops and gardens in this agency are looking exceptionally good. Vegetable gardens on the various reserves are more numerous and better cared for than I have ever seen them before. This helps to prove my theory about the Indians and vegetable gardens, which is that necessity and inability to buy what they need will make them grow more.\"\n\nIndian Agent Down, Muncey, Ont., sent forward with a letter, dated July 27, a number of snapshots showing the progress that has been made in the cultivation of a community potato patch. Commenting upon these snapshots, the Agent states:\n\n\"I enclose snaps of the cutting and preparing of seed potatoes for our 1943 twenty-three acre planting. This was quite an undertaking, with the scarcity of seed and without proper machinery. Although weather conditions were bad, we preserved and today we are the proud possessors of what promises to be a profitable venture, not so much from a financial standpoint but from the standpoint of supplying our Indian people with one of their staple foods.\"\n\n\"I am also enclosing snaps of a make-over storage building which is being constructed to facilitate the storage of discarded military clothing. When this building is finished it will give us approximately 1000 square feet of floor storage space at an approximate cost of $600.00.\"\n\nOn July 9, accompanied by Mr. Morris, I visited the Golden Lake Indian Reserve. This was the first opportunity I had of visiting this reserve in several years. If I remember correctly, my last visit was early in July, 1937. At that time the entire population of this reserve were in\nreceipt of relief or departmental assistance of some kind.\n\nYou are aware that Mr. Morris has taken a personal interest in this reserve during the last two years, with the result that there has been an astonishing improvement in general conditions. The Indians, who at the time of my last visit were cynical and very critical of the Department, appeared to have developed a co-operative spirit and are displaying an anxiousness to work with the Agent that is really amazing. I saw a community patch of potatoes on this reserve, of approximately three acres, that appeared to me to be the best patch of potatoes I had seen anywhere in the district. This patch of potatoes, by the way, had been sprayed the preceding day by the members of the women's clubs.\n\nFifty-five young pigs have been distributed amongst Indian families on this reserve, on the understanding that in each case the Indian will raise one pig for the Branch and one for himself. In the fall, the pigs owned by the Branch will be slaughtered and salted down and thus made available for the old and physically incapacitated men and women, who are ordinarily in receipt of relief allowances. A Yorkshire boar has also been purchased from the Experimental Farm, for $10.00. This animal is now at the reserve and will in a short time be ready for breeding purposes.\n\nDuring my inspection of the reserve I visited the home of an Indian Angus Vincent. This man had a brood sow that farrowed on July 9, the day of my visit; it had a litter of 11 pigs. Although Vincent is a man in his middle seventies, he informed me that this was the first time that he had ever owned a brood sow and the first time that he had ever attempted to raise pigs.\n\nThe goat herd at this reserve is in excellent condition. There are approximately 30 goats in the herd. At the time of my visit, arrangements were being made by the Agent to send one billy and five nannies to Dr. Orford, Moose Factory. One billy and three nannies had already been sent to Manawan, in the Abitibi Agency. A purebred Saanen billy, 11 months old, had just been received by the agent from the Spanish Residential School.\n\nPractically all the families visited had small gardens in a good state of cultivation. The following trees, sent in by Mr. Morris, had been planted: 100 rhubarb; 100 gooseberries; 12 plum; 60 currant; 120 apple; 1000 strawberry plants; 82 raspberry canes. Nine hundred and seventy-five (975) Barred Rock chickens had also been shipped in to the reserve - 500 on May 21 and 475 on June 25. One hundred of these pullets, in due course, will also be sent to Dr. Orford.\n\nReal progress has been made, under the direction of Mr. Morris and Indian Agent Ruddy, at this agency. In fact, I feel that I cannot speak too highly of the work already undertaken and accomplished. The response of the Indians has been most gratifying. Moral conditions on the reserve have improved to such an extent during the last two years that I found it at times difficult to convince myself that this was the same reserve that I had visited five years ago. These results are due almost wholly to the personal interest taken by Mr. Morris in this group of Indians and to the splendid work accomplished by the members of the women's clubs, under\nthe leadership of Mrs. Lavallee.\n\nI came away with the impression that, despite the progress made, these Indians will require a great deal of careful supervision for a number of years. Our experience at this agency, however, would indicate that even the most backward groups of Indians can be made comparatively self-supporting with little cost to the Department, provided we have on the reserve itself the leadership necessary to give intelligent direction to a worthwhile rehabilitation program.\n\nTRAINING\n\nAn unusually large number of Indian day school teachers resigned at the close of the academic year - June 30, and it is just possible that an additional number will resign from our service prior to the opening of the schools on September 1. At this date there are 32 schools for which we have not yet succeeded in securing teachers. The higher salaries that are being paid this year in public schools, coupled with the large number of teachers who have joined the Armed Forces, are largely responsible for this condition. It is not at all likely that teachers will become more plentiful at any time during the years immediately ahead of us. It is a matter of regret that we have to call upon a large number of teachers, particularly women, who lack professional training, to take charge of our schools. The employment of these teachers is likely to act as a retarding influence in the progress ordinarily made by Indian pupils.\n\nYou may remember that immediately following the destruction of the Carcross Residential School by fire, on April 17, 1939, two private homes were rented by this Branch for residential school purposes. This arrangement was never wholly satisfactory and the buildings themselves were condemned as insanitary and unfit for occupation about 8 months ago by the Indian Health Officer for the district. Bishop Geddes, who visited the Department a few months ago, was of the opinion that the pupils enrolled at Carcross might very well be transferred to the old R.C.M.P. building at Dawson, provided that this building could be secured for educational purposes. It would appear, however, from recent correspondence, that the obstacles standing in the way of operating the building at Dawson as a residential school have proved insurmountable. Dr. H. A. Alderwood, Secretary of the Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission, in a letter dated July 27, states:\n\n\"Our Commission has explored every possibility of effecting the transfer of our residential school work from Carcross to Dawson. We have been in continual correspondence with Bishop Geddes and the Principal of the School, but the many difficulties and uncertainties surrounding the question seem to make the transfer impossible. The matter was thoroughly reviewed at the July meeting of our Commission, and in view of the lateness of the date now reached it was felt that a definite decision must be arrived at. The following resolution was eventually adopted: - 'That in the face of the impossibility of carrying on a school effectively at Carcross under existing conditions and in view of the many uncertainties connected with the suggested...\"\nremoval to Dawson, we are regretfully compelled to recommend that the school be closed temporarily. Pending the construction of a new building at Carcross or some other point, we urge the establishment of a day school to provide for some of the children concerned.\"\n\nDr. Alderwood continues: \"We deeply regret that we are forced to recommend the cessation of the work of the Chootla School even for a time, as its reputation in the Yukon for valuable service over a long period of years is something we treasure. We are also convinced of the need of such an institution and it is our hope that arrangements may be made for a number of the children to be provided for at one or more day schools.\"\n\nIt is our intention, this year, to make a wider distribution of the biscuits specially prepared for use at Indian day schools. The distribution this year will include practically all the Indian day schools in northern Manitoba, northern Saskatchewan and northern Ontario. It is our hope that, in addition to the value of these biscuits from a nutritional standpoint, their distribution will tend to encourage more regular attendance at our schools. Lack of attendance at Indian day schools still remains one of the most perplexing problems in the Training Division.\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nRev. Dr. R. B.

These officials of the United Church agreed to have a representative of the Church, the Reverend R. E. Joblin, of Nuncy, accompany Inspector Arneil and Mr. Gordon Young when these men visit the agencies.\n\nOn Monday, August 30, I visited the Ontario Department of Education and interviewed Mr. V. K. Greer, Chief Inspector of Public and Separate Schools with the object of securing from him the name of an educationist who might undertake this survey. Mr. Greer, with whom I had been in correspondence, had given this matter a great deal of careful consideration and expressed the opinion that Inspector Gordon Young, of Strathroy, Ont., was the only man of whom he could think, with the qualifications necessary to undertake such a task. Mr. Young has taught public schools and high schools in the southwestern district of Ontario over a period of years and has been a public and high school inspector since 1930. He is Chairman of the Victory Loan Campaign Committee for the London district and is President of the Boys' and Girls' School Fairs Association for Western Ontario. In response to Mr. Greer's suggestion that I personally interview Mr. Young, I visited London on the afternoon of the 30th ultimo. I met Mr. Young at the London Hotel. At the outset he hesitated to undertake this survey, in view of the additional duties for which he had become responsible in connection with the Victory Loan campaign. He was, however, seized with the importance of the task we had in mind and seemed to have somewhat deep-seated convictions in respect to Indian education. He has on another occasion inspected the Mount Elgin Institute and Indian day schools on the Caradoc and adjoining reserves. He finally agreed to undertake the work and intimated that he would begin the survey at Caradoc on Tuesday, September 14. I am personally of the opinion that the information obtained during the course of this survey and the recommendations made by Mr. Young should prove invaluable to us in working out a worthwhile educational policy, not only at the Caradoc agency, but at a number of agencies in Western Ontario.\n\nMr. Greer informed me during the course of our interview that he has been approached from time to time by\nteachers employed at Indian day and residential schools, all of whom were anxious to get his advice and assistance in securing recognition from the Department for superannuation allowances. Mr. Greer pointed out that practically all the public and separate school teachers of the Dominion now qualify for superannuation at a certain age or at any time during their teaching career, if suffering from physical disability. He personally found it difficult to convince himself that we could secure and retain in our service fully qualified and conscientious teachers unless some provision was made in the future for retiring allowances. He expressed the opinion that in the province of Ontario it might be possible to work out an arrangement whereby the Dominion would contribute to the Ontario Government Superannuation Fund, on the understanding that teachers employed in Indian day and residential schools would contribute a similar amount. This, in my judgment, is a matter that should be given careful consideration and a decision with respect to it reached, just as soon as times become normal.\n\nA great deal of difficulty has been experienced in securing the number of teachers necessary to open our Indian day schools on September 1. Dr. Dorey informed me that despite the efforts put forth by the superintendents of missions in the provinces and by himself, personally, there were still a number of schools for which he had not succeeded in securing teachers, and, in addition to this, a number of the teachers recommended by him lacked full academic and professional standing. At this date there are 25 day schools for which teachers have not yet been secured. It is particularly regrettable that we have failed to secure teachers for schools such as the Rama two-room school. Our failure to open and operate a school such as this, with a large enrolment, is likely to contribute to waywardness and delinquency on the reserve.\n\nThe Indian agents at Shubenacadie and Eskasoni were notified early in the month that it would not be possible to proceed with the construction of schools at their agencies during the present fiscal year. Both Mr. Rice and Mr. Maclean, in letters now received, have expressed the opinion that our failure to proceed with this building program will not seriously retard the centralization program. Both agents believe that extensions can be made to the existing day schools at very little cost and that in any event there are a great many elderly Indians in receipt of relief who can be moved into the houses that are being constructed on the reserves.\n\nWELFARE:\n\nEconomic conditions throughout the country are such that able-bodied Indians are experiencing little difficulty in securing employment. A large number of Canadian Indians have found employment in American war industries. The wages paid in these industries are substantially higher than the wages received by Indians at any time in their history. Teen-age boys and girls in a number of cases are receiving wages at the rate of\n$200 per month and one Indian, a resident of the St. Regis reserve, who is a foreman in a munitions plant, earned a little over $8,000 during the last year.\n\nRelief expenditures are at the present time confined to the purchase of supplies necessary for aged and physically incapacitated Indians. There are a number of factors, however, that tend to contribute to our relief and welfare costs. Illegitimacy and general waywardness appear to be steadily on the increase. Reports indicate that comparatively few Indians are taking advantage of the wages received to improve their home buildings and home surroundings. Indeed, in a great many cases, these Indians have temporarily abandoned their homes or shacks on the reserves and taken up residence in the cities, towns and villages. The financial statement of welfare expenditures from April 1 to July 31 - a four month period - indicates a decrease of $21,624.53. The greatest decreases have taken place in the provinces of Manitoba and Quebec. In Manitoba the decrease amounts to $15,767.61 and in Quebec to $11,056.92. This, I should point out, is the first substantial reduction in relief expenditures that has taken place at any time in Manitoba during the last 10 year period. It would appear that a large number of the Indians in that province have secured employment with farmers and in cordwood and lumbering operations.\n\nIn response to a request received from the Department of Labour, a circular letter was sent out early in the month to all Indian agents. In this circular letter, Indian agents were asked to state approximately how many Indians from each of the reserves might be available for pulpwood, cordwood or lumbering operations for the period October 1 to April 30. These agents were asked to send their replies direct to the Department of Labour. A number of them, however, ignoring instructions, sent their returns to this Branch. These returns indicate that there will be comparatively few Indians for work of this character during the coming winter.\n\nI embraced the opportunity extended to me at the time of my trip to Toronto to visit the goat farm operated by Mr. Cole at Markham, Ont. Mr. Cole, from whom we purchased a male goat a few months ago, has operated this farm for a period of 30 years. He specializes in the Saanen dairy type of goats and has won hundreds of prizes at exhibitions in Canada and the United States. A few months ago he sold a one-year-old pedigreed Saanen male goat to a resident of London, Ont., for the sum of $100.00. Mr. Cole, with whom I had a lengthy discussion, expressed the opinion that the demand for goats during the last six month period has been greater than it has been at any time in the last 30 or 40 years. I was interested to learn from him that he imported his first goats from the State of California and imported them with the object of securing a milk supply for his wife, who was then an invalid. The fact that his wife had gone on a diet of goat's milk, in response to instructions received from her physician, and the fact that she recovered\nrapidly convinced Mr. Cole that goat's milk possesses unusual curative elements. He feels that it is his mission in life to encourage the farmers and the town dwellers of Ontario to go in more extensively for goat herds. I was gratified to learn from Mr. Cole that good grade milking goats can still be purchased at prices ranging from $15.00 to $25.00.\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nRev. Father Lacouture, St. Regis, Que.\nMr. Brown, Department of Labour, Ottawa\n\" Palmer,\nDr. Jill J. Cossley Batt, New York City\nRev. Father G. Forcade, Grouard, Alberta.\nMr. J. W.

Mr. Neil, member of the committee who returned to Ottawa yesterday, informs me that the following reserves have been visited: Cape Croker, Saugeen, Kettle Point, Sarnia, Walpole Island, Caradoc, Six Nations and New Credit. Inspector Gordon Young, chairman of the committee, has suggested that two additional days be spent at the Caradoc agency, prior to the preparation of the final report. It is expected that this report will reach the Department in the course of a few weeks.\n\nYou may remember that a couple of years ago a number of letters appeared in the Press of British Columbia, in which criticism was directed against the educational policy of the Department in the province of British Columbia and particularly the educational program provided at a number of our schools in the Cowichan agency. I regret to state that during the last six or seven months a number of somewhat similar letters have appeared in the Family Herald and Weekly Star. I find it somewhat difficult to understand the motives by which the writers of these letters are actuated. Copies of the papers containing these letters appear to be distributed to a number of Indians throughout the Dominion. For example, Mrs. Monture sent forward a few days ago a newspaper clipping containing an article by Mrs. H. Haylen-Ward, R.R. No. 4, Victoria, B.C., which states that with the exception of a few mission schools, maintained by the church, no provision has been made for the education of the Indians of British Columbia. Mrs. Monture seemed quite disturbed over the subject matter of this letter. It is just possible that provision should be made by the Department for the amount of publicity necessary to keep the general public informed regarding the work undertaken and accomplished from time to time by the Government on behalf of our Indian population.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, this excerpt, taken from a letter recently received from Indian Agent Moore, of the Cowichan Agency, is somewhat interesting. The agent states:\n\n\"With reference to the present setup at the Tsartlip Indian day school, I may say that under date of\n\nthe third -\nthe third instant I made quite a lengthy report to the Indian Commissioner, directing his attention to the improved conditions at this school and the splendid spirit which now exists over what we found previously, in fact, ever since I came to the agency. The Sister in charge, Sister Maureen Regan, has done an excellent job in the short time she has been there, and the attendance, even at this early date, has been much higher than at any time during the past year. I feel extremely confident that the future of the school is most promising. Since I came here I have never found the children so clean, attentive, well managed and happy as they were at the time of my visit. Altogether, I believe that insofar as this school is concerned, the Department made a wise move to engage the Sister, particularly one so well qualified as Sister Maureen Regan is. This particular school, pupils and teachers alike, have been a headache to me for years, but I really feel now that we will make progress.\"\n\nA three-room Indian day school was established at Restigouche in the fiscal year 1926-27. This building, however, proved to be wholly inadequate to provide the classroom accommodation for the steadily increasing Indian pupil population at that agency. The decision reached early this year to construct a full basement under the existing building was, in my judgment, a wise one. This work, which was undertaken under the supervision of Mr. Doucet, is now completed. We have now, in addition to the three original classrooms, four spacious classrooms in the basement, admirably adapted for vocational instruction. The total cost of this addition is not likely to exceed $7,000.00 - approximately $1,750 per classroom. The principal of the school and the Indian agent, in a joint letter dated September 27, referred to the reconstruction of the school and stated:\n\n\"The wonderful improvement made at the Restigouche Indian Day School is now in evidence. It is a delight to the members of the teaching staff to express to the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch their sincere gratitude for the beautiful work accomplished. Please accept our heartfelt thanks for having sent into our midst Mr. Doucet to direct and control this laborious undertaking. Sincere congratulations are due Mr. Doucet for the cleverness with which he overcame all the difficulties inseparable from such a task. Our school has been not only enlarged but made more comfortable. You have every reason to be proud of it and I might add that this school has been admired by all who have seen it. Roomy and well equipped classrooms are now at our disposal for vocational instruction. Each one of us will do our utmost to prove to you that you have not co-operated with us in vain.\"\n\nI have referred so frequently to the substantial repairs that appear to be necessary at a number of our Indian day and residential schools, that it is a real pleasure to me to be able to refer to a school the actual condition of which leaves little to be desired. Mr. Christianson, in his report on the Onion Lake R.C. Residential School, dated September 16, states:\n\n\"The exterior of this building was painted in 1938 and is in excellent shape; in fact, everything around the institution appears to be in first class condition and in the very best of order. The provincial boiler inspector\nhad just completed his inspection. The only remark he made was that there were signs of pitting in the tubes of the boiler. I went over the laundry machinery, the lighting plant, the batteries, etc., and found everything in a fair shape. The plumbing is also in good order. The barns are also in fair shape, having been painted last fall by the members of the staff. This school owns 100 head of cattle and were milking 18 cows at the time of my visit. They have also 12 horses, 125 pigs and 235 chickens.\n\n\"I noticed that the school had two fine gardens, which are a splendid example to set before the Indians of the reserve. These gardens appear to be as well kept as any one could find on an experimental farm. The lawns and hedges in front of the school were beautiful.\"\n\nIn my last report I referred to the number of schools - approximately 25 - for which teachers had not been secured. Since that date, six additional teachers have been appointed to day schools, and a letter just received from the Secretary of the Home Mission Board of the United Church suggests that there is a good possibility of getting a fully qualified teacher, with B. Ed degree, to take charge of the Rama two-room day school, at Longford Mills, Ont. In view of the acute shortage of teachers throughout the Dominion, particularly in the western provinces, I consider we have been very fortunate this year in securing the teachers necessary to operate our Indian day schools. In this connection a great deal of our success is due to the splendid co-operation of the churches. A number of missionaries with full normal school training have volunteered for service in our schools. It is very doubtful if these men would be available were it not for the close co-operation that has been maintained between the Department and the Churches in the operation of our schools. Bishop Geddes, who visited the Department a few days ago, informed me that a young man, a graduate of Cambridge University, and his wife had offered their services for the operation of an Indian day school in the Yukon.\n\nWELFARE.\n\nThe following report of the launching of the destroyer \"Micmac\" appeared in the Halifax Herald of September 20th:\n\n\"Five full-blooded feather-festive Indian chiefs almost 'stole the show' from their namesake, H.M.C.S. Micmac, Canada's largest home-built ship of war, at her launching at Halifax shipyards, Saturday.\n\n\"Stoically, they posed separately and with rear-admirals and other high officers of the armed forces, as if such things happened to them every day.\n\n\"When the Press received a baptism of champagne, which a wind blew in their direction, the workers who had a half hour to watch their masterpiece go down the ways, the guard of honour composed of Nelson Sea Cadets and all officials burst into laughter. But not the Chiefs; they did not even bat an eye.\"\n\"Not until they saw the towering sharp-nosed glistening bow of the Micmac slide smoothly away from them after Mrs. Macdonald had snipped the launching ribbon, did the tribal chiefs give forth even an 'ugh'.\"\n\n\"Then, they did themselves proud\u2014they chanted for all they were worth the prayer to Saint Anne, their patron saint, into the microphones. So impressive were they that newsreel men asked them for encores. They graciously obliged.\"\n\nIt would appear that a number of Indian bands in the Prairie Provinces are making a substantial contribution to the meat supply of the nation. Acting Indian Agent McMillan, in his last report on the Blood agency, states:\n\n\"Our annual sale of Indian cattle was held on the 30th of the month, when approximately 518 head of cattle were sold. These included 93 dry and 325 steers with a few canner cows. Prices were very good indeed, No. 1 steers bringing $11.85; No. 2 steers $10.85; heifers under 1050 lbs. bringing $11.85 and over 1050 lbs., $10.50. Cows sold at $9.25 with no No. 2 cows offered, and canner cows brought $6.25. It was noted that the prices received that day compared favourably with the market price at Winnipeg at that time. The amount of cash received was approximately $60,000 for the cattle sold.\"\n\nIndian Agent Kerley, in his report on the Crooked Lake Indian agency, dated September 4, also refers to cattle sales recently held at his agency. The agent states:\n\n\"Cattle sales were held on all reserves during the month, with an average price of $80.00 per head received. The top steer brought $125. The cattle are all in very good condition.\"\n\nIndian agents continue to refer to the success of their Victory Garden campaign. Indian Agent Bryant, in his reported dated September 6, states:\n\n\"There are some very creditable gardens on all the reserves of this agency and nearly all the Indians have at least a patch of potatoes. During the month gardens were judged and prizes awarded on all four reserves. We had an expert gardener from Kamsack to judge the garden plots on Cote and Keesekoose. This gardener remarked that several of the Indian gardens would compare favourably with the white gardens in the neighborhood.\"\n\nThe following is an excerpt from the Victoria Daily Colonist of August 3, 1943:\n\n\"Indians in many of the settlements on the west coast of Vancouver Island are extremely interested in A.R.P. work and are making a fine showing also in the Pacific Coast Militia Rangers, it was learned by Attorney General Maitland and Commissioner T.W.S. Parsons of the B.C. Police, who Saturday completed a tour of Vancouver Island.\n\n\"The Indians, Commissioner Parsons stated, act...\"\nin the A R P organizations as fire-fighters and wardens and in this work have become closely associated with the Police.\"\n\n\"The following is a quotation from a letter received from Air Vice Marshall of the Western Air Command, in connection with the daring rescue by a West Coast Indian of a pilot whose parachute held him suspended in a tree 75 feet from the ground:\n\n\"This action on the Indian's part is considered to be a very courageous and commendable feat and, needless to say, is thoroughly appreciated by the Royal Canadian Air Force and the pilot concerned.\"\n\nIndian Agent Asbridge, in a reference to A R P organization work, states:\n\n\"Drills and instruction in connection with A R P work are being carried out at all Indian day and residential schools. Gas masks have been issued to the residential school at Alberni and to reserves in the vicinity of air ports and encampments.\"\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nRev.

With an abundance of discarded military clothing available, it is in our judgment of the utmost importance that the women on our reserves should be organized for the purpose of making the best possible use of this clothing by remodelling and by undertaking necessary repairs. It has been our experience also that where homemakers' clubs have been established the women usually take an active interest in the promotion of gardening and in the improvement of home conditions, generally, on the reserves.\n\nMr. Thibault, in his report on the meetings held at Oka and St. Regis, states:\n\n\"Nineteen women were present when the meeting opened at the Oka Village School. The teacher of the school, Miss Diabo, was present, as well as John Angus, the teacher in charge of the Country School at Oka, who acted as interpreter. Ten men were also present, some having accompanied their wives. The meeting was very quiet, no questions being asked. John Angus repeated in the Indian language the explanations given by Mr. Morris. The women agreed to meet again on October 15, to elect their officers and to notify the Indian agent of their choice.\"\n\nMr. Thibault adds: \"Knowing this particular group to be to some extent prejudiced against the Department and not always willing to co-operate, it is our hope that our work will be of some benefit to them. No such proposal having been previously offered to them, they were anxious to talk the matter over between themselves before accepting or rejecting it. I am pleased to say, however, that their response exceeded my expectations. The teacher, Miss Diabo, herself an Indian, promised full co-operation.\n\n\"There were 15 present at the meeting held at the Oka Country School. The ladies agreed to meet a few days later to elect their president and secretary. The result will be given to the Indian agent upon his next visit and then forwarded to the Department. The teacher,\"\nJohn Angus willingly acted as interpreter during the meeting and promised his full cooperation.\n\n\"Our first meeting at the St. Regis agency was held on Thursday, October 14, at 2 P.M. The women were somewhat slow in coming. However, we were able to make up a list of 27 names, including Miss Terrance, the teacher, as well as Miss Foisy, who is teaching at the Chenail School. All were interested in the exhibits of clothing and of the enlarged photographs exhibited by us. They appeared to listen with interest to the explanations given by Mr. Morris. These women elected their president and secretary and an organizing committee of six.\n\n\"Our second meeting was held at the St. Regis Village School on Friday the 15th at 10 o'clock A.M. There was a satisfactory attendance at this meeting, despite the fact that many Indian women are at present employed in the United States, helping to harvest vegetable crops. These women leave every morning, by truck, and are returned home the same way. The presence of the two teaching Sisters at this meeting added to the interest. The Sisters appeared to be quite friendly with all the women present and they assured us of their full cooperation in promoting the new organization.\n\n\"Our third meeting was held on the afternoon of the same day at the Cornwall Island West School. This meeting was held at 2:30 P.M. While waiting to open the meeting, the ladies upon their arrival looked over the clothing exhibits and were very much interested in the photographs displayed around the classroom. They listened very attentively to the explanations given by Mr. Morris. The teacher, Mrs. White (an Indian) was kind enough to repeat all that was said in the Indian language for the benefit of a few older women not familiar with English. Mrs. White is a very active person and, I was informed, a good organizer. She will be given a chance to show what she can do now in the setting up of this project on this particular section of the reserve.\"\n\nMr. Thibault adds: \"May I conclude by expressing my opinion that the St. Regis Indians can be expected to go ahead quicker with these organizations than the Oka Indians. The members of the St. Regis Band do not show that suspicion which is apparent when one meets the Oka Indians. However, I will be pleased to see the progress made at Oka. These Indians have fine land and many advantages over other Indian groups in Quebec.\"\n\nMr. Morris also visited the Maniwaki reserve on October 27. While I have not yet received a formal report from him, he assured me personally that the response of the Indians of Maniwaki was encouraging and satisfactory in every sense. It is our hope that we shall have an opportunity at an early date to discuss more fully with Mr. Gendron a comprehensive welfare program that might be promoted on the Maniwaki reserve.\n\nA number of encouraging reports continue to reach the Department from month to month with respect\nto successful gardening projects, organized on Indian reserves. Indian Agent Buddy, in his last report on the Golden Lake Reserve, states:\n\n\"In June we sowed the following vegetables in the two community plots; 35 bags of potatoes (approximately 5 acres), 2 lbs. of turnips and a quantity of corn. This was a community project and groups were organized during the summer months to do the weeding. On September 24, 25 and 27 we dug the potatoes with a digger and had a yield of 250 bags. These potatoes are now stored in the community root-house. We expect to have about 2\u00bd tons of turnips for human consumption and about the same amount for feed for our live stock. We have 12 loads of hay and green feed for our goats. This feed was also grown on the community plots. In addition to these community projects each Indian had a garden at his home and these turned out to be very good. The Department this year allowed $25.00 in prizes for gardens and the improvement in the gardens on the reserve this year was remarkable. Bags of flour rather than cash were given as prizes. The Indians dug approximately 200 bags of potatoes from their individual gardens.\"\n\nThe Indian Agent at the Caradoc Agency, Mr. G. W. Down, secured permission early in the spring to proceed with the cultivation of an area on the reserve suitable for the production of potatoes. Mr. Down refers to the results of this project in a letter to the Department dated October 18. The Agent states:\n\n\"After our spring discussions on potato growing, you will, I am sure, be interested in the subsequent results. Although we were handicapped without the services of an efficient sprayer, we have grown and harvested one of the largest crops of potatoes grown from one block in the district - 1500 bags of good quality potatoes. We think this is an accomplishment to be proud of, especially with the adverse weather conditions which we have had to fight. Storage facilities were inadequate, but we overcame that difficulty by pitting 500 bags.\"\n\nThe Agent adds: \"We were more than satisfied with our potato venture and I feel, without going into the figures, that I have again been able to prove that the cost of essential machinery for the growing of a crop is very negligible when proper methods are used. However, it must be understood that I cannot undertake another year of potato growing on such a scale without proper efficient machinery at my disposal at all times. The fact that we did not have this machinery is not, of course, the fault of your efforts in securing it. We understand that the Government has already decided to release more agricultural machinery in 1944\".\n\nIndian Agent Featherston, of the Rama agency, in his report for September, states:\n\n\"The gardens have been judged and prizes awarded. The gardens have been good, some remarkably good. The fourth prize went to Mrs. Annie Benson, mother of Chief Benson, a woman of 75 years. This woman, by her own efforts, grew a large garden with nearly all the...\"\ncommon vegetables and plenty of potatoes. There are more vegetables and potatoes on this reserve now than I have ever seen before. This is remarkable, considering that the able-bodied men are mostly employed off the reserve.\n\nSchool gardens, that is, gardens cultivated on the lands adjoining Indian day schools, are seldom a success. This fact can be attributed to the absence of the average teacher during the months of July and August. However, where we have secured a married man, who is prepared to remain at the school during the summer months, the results are usually somewhat encouraging. Indian Agent Waite, in his report on the Swan Lake (U.C.) Indian Day School, states:\n\n\"The school garden at the Swan Lake Indian Day School this year produced the following vegetables:\n25 bushels of potatoes, 61 lbs. of white beans, 7 bushels of carrots, 14 bushels of turnips, 2 bushels of onions and 2 bushels of tomatoes.\"\n\nThe Agent adds: \"The teacher, Mr. Schellenberg, makes request to have an additional portion of the garden broken so that more vegetables can be produced next year.\"\n\nVegetables produced at Indian day schools are usually used in the preparation of noonday lunches. Reports from the Prairie Provinces indicate that considerable difficulty has been experienced by our agents in the operation of community farms. With high wages prevailing in the adjoining districts, Indians cannot be easily persuaded to take up agricultural operations on their own reserves. We do feel, however, that a very vigorous attempt should be made to keep these farms in operation, despite the difficulties we are at present encountering. The operation of these farms is desirable, from the standpoint of production; but in addition to this, we may find it very desirable and very helpful to divide certain areas now under cultivation amongst young Indians returning from overseas service. This excerpt, taken from a report submitted by Indian Agent Ostrander, is well worthy of serious consideration:\n\n\"The work of the community farms of this agency has been slowed up this year by the fact that most of the working Indians were away from their reserves earning good wages. This does not suggest to me that the community farming project has been a failure. It is only a reminder to me that at a not far distant date the war will be over and the Indians whose labour is now much in demand will then be still needing a means of livelihood but will be again in competition with thousands of able-bodied white men returning from the services and war factories and in this competition the Indian falls miserably and has to return to his reserve and procure a miserable livelihood for his family by trying to sell wood at very low prices, or in a manner equally discouraging and degrading. I would not only like to see our present community farms continued, but I would like to see them on all the reserves fitted for agriculture, as they have proved successful under not the best of conditions as regards price of grain and occasional poor crops, and...\"\nhave furnished a means for able-bodied Indians to earn thousands of dollars by honest effort, where they would have had to be fed by other means if the community farm had not been operating. Before and during the period of re-establishment resulting from the end of the war, the Department will have to face the question of how the Indians will make their living when all the able-bodied white men are again in competition with them for the available jobs. I have found no more practical way than in the development of the resources which the Indians have on their own reserves, by community farms started through revolving fund loans. I am certainly in favour of the repayment of these loans at the earliest possible date, as the actual repayment has a good moral effect upon the Indians, but the importance of the repayment of the loans should not completely submerge the great benefits which can be derived from the operation of these farms, and a community farm which is being operated in a thriving condition, furnishing work and a living for a large number of Indians, should not be closed out and rented to white men, just because the payments to the revolving fund have slowed up.\"\n\nTRAINING\n\nAudit and other reports now reaching the Department indicate that principals of residential schools are experiencing difficulty in operating these institutions with the funds available from per capita grants and from other sources. Mr. W. R. Butchart, in his audit report on the Sandy Bay Residential School, dated October 25, states:\n\n\"The cost of operation per pupil per year works out at $206.85, an increase of $26.03 over the operating costs of the preceding year. The rate of increase is even larger than this figure would indicate as the average pupilage of 26.8 is up 9.2. The only apparent liabilities, other than August accounts, were arrears in salaries. At the end of August $1,250 was owing to the Oblate Fathers on account of the principal's and assistant principal's salaries. There was also the amount of $440.00 owing to the Sisters, of which $330.00 was paid in September\".\n\nThe authorized enrolment at this school is 95 and the per capita grant, $165.00.\n\nThe auditor, in his report on the Pine Creek Indian Residential School dated October 6, states:\n\n\"The cost per pupil per year was $180.01, an increase of $8.36. The attendance shows a decrease of 4.9%.\n\nThis school has an authorized enrolment of 120 and the per capita allowance is at the rate of $165.\n\nThe Norway House (United Church) Residential School has at this date an authorized pupilage of 105 and a per capita grant allowance of $175. The auditor in his report on this school dated October 7 states:\n\n\"The revenue at this school for the period amounted to $22,883.09 and includes the per capita grant of $14,711.81 and a special 1942 grant of $968.50.\n\nThe United Church allows a grant of $4,000 per\nyear to this school, which was received in full. The expenditures totalled $25,780.99. The cost of operation per pupil per year works out at $264.95, an increase of $13.17. The cost of food was $73.25 per pupil per year, an increase of $18.75.\n\n\"The goats supplied this school have not as yet proved a source of revenue, as most of the kids have been males\".\n\nReverend J. Camirand, S.M.M., Principal of the Kuper Island School, Vancouver Island, in a letter to the Chief of the Training Division dated October 21, refers to the problems confronting him at his school and states:\n\n\"I must admit that the bonus received in the past two years has helped considerably to tide over these conditions, but I must also say that previous to receiving that help much of our personal salaries was used from month to month to make purchases and that to date we still owe $500 of back salaries to members of our staff\".\n\nThis, I may say, is the only residential school operated by the members of this particular Order.\n\nAn interesting and somewhat encouraging report on the Thunderchild (R.C.) Residential School has been received from Mr. Christianson. He states:\n\n\"This is one of the old church schools and a very bad fire trap, just the same as the old school at Hobbsma. Everything around this institution, however, was in first class shape and well kept, just as in all Catholic schools. Since arriving there, Father Angin informs me he has lined the school inside with V-joint and tar paper because the plaster was all falling down, etc. I also noticed that some new floors have been put in, but I do not know whether this was done by the Department or the school authorities. I then went around the outbuildings and they are all in fair shape.\n\n\"There were 92 children in residence at the time of my visit to the school and Father Angin informed me the quota was 120, but I believe there were a few children who had not returned after the holidays. Then, in all probability, he will be able to recruit a few more children because I have three in mind for him from Battleford.\n\n\"During the afternoon of my visit to this school I was in the classrooms and the teachers all had the children go through their lessons, etc. I came to the conclusion that the senior teacher there, one of the Reverend Sisters, was the best teacher I had ever come across in an Indian school. I found out when I was talking to her that I had met her previously at Hobbsma some years ago. Therefore, I would say that the teaching in this institution is excellent, which is borne out by the way the children responded in the classroom.\"\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nRev. Canon S. Middleton, Principal, St. Paul's (Blood C.E.) Indian Residential School, Cardston, Alberta;\n\nRev. Father Beuglet, Administrator, Grouard, Alberta;\n\nRev. H. Routhier, O.M.I., Provincial of Oblate Order for Alberta and Saskatchewan, Edmonton, Alberta;\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I., Winnipeg, Man.;\n\nRev. I. Coudert, O.M.I., Co-adjutor, Yukon; and Prince Rupert.\n\nMr. G. Swartman, Indian Agent, Sioux Lookout, Ontario;\n\nMr. G. E. Hurl, Acting Indian Agent, Christian Island, Ont.;\n\nMr. Johnson and Miss Fitzsimmons, Labour Supply Branch of Department of Labour;\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, December 1, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCGILL,\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended November 30, 1943.\n\nWELFARE\n\nOur records indicate that there is invariably a substantial increase in relief and welfare costs during the interval between the resignation, death or retirement of the average Indian agent and the appointment of his successor. Not only is there substantial increase in relief costs, but in the western agencies we frequently lose a comparatively large number of our live stock. A striking illustration of the increase that usually takes place is furnished this year in the case of the Carlton agency. Relief and welfare costs at the Carlton agency for the period April 1 to October 31, 1942, amounted to $5,782.53, and this year, with Mr. Prince and later with Mr. Jones in charge, the costs amounted to $9,735.94. It is somewhat difficult to understand this increase, in view of the economic conditions prevailing in this agency. I have in mind the ability of the Indians to secure gainful employment on farms or in cordwood operations. A breakdown of these expenditures has been made. It would seem that the increase has taken place almost wholly in the item classified as \"provisions\". The expenditure for this item during the period under review, this year, amounted to $6,366.34, compared with an expenditure of $5,492.61 for the corresponding period of last year. It is just possible that the average temporary agent, who is usually a clerk, finds it somewhat difficult to resist the pressure of the Indians for increased relief allowances and, in view of the temporary position he occupies, may not desire to antagonize the Indians of the agency. Consideration might well be given to the desirability of having an agent appointed to an agency at least two months prior to the resignation or retirement of the outgoing agent. I have given this matter a great deal of serious thought and I feel confident that such an arrangement would result in substantial economies to this Department.\n\nThe goat herds, referred to from time to time in my monthly reports, are being gradually extended to a number of reserves throughout the Dominion, where the need for milk appears urgent. Indian Agent Down, of the Caradoc Agency, in a letter dated November 15, states:\n\n\"It will be of interest to you to learn that all goats purchased during the summer and farmed out to individual Indians have been collected and placed in winter quarters. I have recently added five to the herd, making a total of 10 females and one male. This is somewhat short of the number I was authorized to buy, but the locating and buying of milk goats is not an easy proposition. However, I hope to increase this herd before the spring of 1944. The billy shipped from the Spanish School has done splendidly. He has, since we received him, grown twice his size and we have renamed him 'Spanish River'. Our program for the next year will be an endeavour to place a goat wherever there are young children needing milk. Providing our increase in...\"\nfemale goats is average, we should have within a year or two a sizable herd at this agency.\n\nIndian Agent Taylor, of the Kamloops Agency, in his report for October, states:\n\n\"The two milch goats recently purchased have already proved their worth. One was given for the use of the family of Eddie Michel of the Adams Lake Band. His small daughter was in hospital for months, a very bad case of malnutrition. I saw her recently and the change in her appearance and health is unbelievable. This family are now fully converted to the merits of goat's milk. The children of T. Casimir have also benefited considerably from the milk of the other goat. There is a T.B. history in this family and we hope to avoid further inroads, with milk as an important part of the family diet.\"\n\nIndian Agent Taylor also refers to his gardening program at the Kamloops agency. In this connection he states:\n\n\"I beg to advise that our request for increased garden acreage has met with very favourable response and the results are gratifying, particularly in view of the fact that a large number of the Indians are engaged in seasonal employment, removed from their reserves, for a large part of the growing season. Our latest check-up reveals some 235 separate gardens, comprising a total of 286 acres. This is an average of 1.22 acres per garden and 5 persons per garden, based on the total population. The gardens have been quite equally divided among the different bands. The produce was varied and the quality good and there was a noted increase in the growing of green stuffs, which would indicate an appreciative understanding of our advice regarding vitamin values. Without exception, the growers have adequate facilities for winter storage of vegetables and from present indications there should be no lack of these foods in any Indian home during the coming winter.\"\n\nIt would appear that a reasonably good start in the cultivation of gardens has been made at Lennox Island. Indian Agent Daly, in his report for November, states:\n\n\"From October 1st to 6th was spent at office work and on the 6th I went to Lennox Island to get the potatoes dug and stored. The crop was not a heavy one but was of good quality and should be sufficient to take care of all the Indians' needs during the coming winter. Carrots, beets and parsnips were exceptionally good. Turnips were large but not numerous. Most of the onion crop was used during the late summer and autumn. Peas and beans were only a light crop. Soy beans, however, did well and will be of some value as a protein feed for cattle. There was a large crop of cranberries on Hog Island this year. These berries were of good quality. Many of the Indians made money picking and selling them.\n\n\"We are hoping to procure a carload of Black Ash for the Indians of Lennox Island, to be distributed during the latter part of the month.\"\n\nAn interesting and encouraging report has been received from Indian Agent Spence on the successful\nagricultural Fair held this year at the Moravian Reserve. The Agent states:\n\n\"The members of the Moravian Agricultural Society held their annual fall fair October 11 and 12. We had excellent weather and 2400 paid admissions. The baking, sewing and canned vegetable exhibits were of good quality but none too plentiful. The school had a fine exhibit of manual training articles\u2014woodwork, sewing, knitting, writing and painting. Fourteen head of cattle were exhibited and these were of good quality. John Huff, a Moravian soldier settler, has a herd of extra good Hereford cattle.\n\n\"Several Indians have been interviewed with a view of using discarded army clothing for children. Some progress is being made.\"\n\nA number of striking illustrations of the average Indian's lack of frugality have been reaching the Department in recent months. The latest is supplied in the last report of Indian Agent Lewis, of Hobbema. Mr. Lewis states:\n\n\"Most of the Indians returned to the reserves during the month, threshing in the white settlements being completed. They all look good and fat but otherwise the large wage they have been getting is not very apparent. One Indian, who acknowledged that he had been earning $7.00 a day all fall, came into the office and asked for a pair of boots, explaining that the ones he was wearing were broken and that he had no money with which to buy new ones. We will now have to try to get our able-bodied Indians out in the lumber camps for the winter.\"\n\nIndians of the Prairies Provinces continue to dispose of their cattle at prices which appear to be very satisfactory. Indian Agent Fredale, of Nopley, reports that we sold our steers and cows early this month in the usual manner. About 20 cows were sold earlier in the summer. These animals are included in the following statement:\n\n| Item       | Price     |\n|------------|-----------|\n| 144 Steers | $13,539.49|\n| 64 Cows    | $5,186.21 |\n| **Total**  | **$18,725.70** |\n\nAverage price per steer: $96.11\nAverage price per cow: $81.22\n\nIndians are not likely to experience much difficulty in securing gainful employment during the winter months. Indian Agent Lovell, of The Pas, in a report dated November 6, reports that \"there is a big demand for Indian help of all kinds. Fishermen, especially, are at a premium and some of the companies are offering our men $125.00 per month and board for fishing. This is the best rate of wages I have ever seen offered for this type of work. There is also a good demand for men to cut wood and work on the various construction crews. There appears to be plenty of work to keep everyone busy during the winter\".\n\nTRAINING\n\nInspector Moir, in his report on the Gordon's (C.E.) Residential School, Punnichy, Sask., refers to the difficulty experienced at this time by residential school\nprincipals in securing fully qualified teachers. Inspector Moir states:\n\n\"On the day of my visit to this school two letters were received from two former students, now overseas. In one of these letters 39 was given as the number of boys serving in the present war. This is a commentary on the influence of the school and should be reason in itself for doing everything possible for these children. The staffing of this school remains a problem. One of the reasons seems to be lack of superannuation for teachers who would like to specialize in Indian work. Once these schools have a permanent staff of well trained teachers, good progress will result. Radio, moving pictures, well illustrated magazines - these must become part of the classroom equipment.\"\n\nI have had an opportunity to discuss educational matters generally and the operation of our residential schools in particular with representatives of the Roman Catholic, Church of England and United Churches, during the last two or three days. These representatives have assured me that the principals of residential schools, with a few rare exceptions, are experiencing the utmost difficulty in financing their schools. This difficulty, I should state, is reflected in audit statements recently received by this Division. Indians appear to be vigorously opposed to the return of senior pupils to these schools. This refusal on the part of Indians can be easily understood and is due, no doubt, in part at least, to the fact that boys of 16 and 17 and girls of the same age are experiencing little difficulty in securing gainful employment. In the Prairie Provinces - so I have been informed - a large number of the senior pupils were kept out of school for harvesting operations.\n\nAnother difficulty confronting residential school principals is the securing of fully qualified teachers. I have been making a somewhat close check of reports received from public school inspectors on classroom work at residential schools and the qualifications and academic standing of the teachers in charge of these rooms. I am disposed to think, although I have not at the moment the exact figures, that approximately 65% of the teachers now employed at residential schools lack professional training. This, to me, is a rather serious condition and may be to some extent responsible for the lack of popularity of our residential schools in certain sections of the Dominion. In any event, this is a condition that should be remedied at the earliest possible date.\n\nRepresentatives of the Churches, while deeply interested in the three year vocational course of study prepared by Mr. Doucet, remind me that they lack the accommodation and facilities to promote such a course of study with any hope of success. They remind me also that it is simply impossible, for the time being at least, to secure male teachers qualified to give such instruction. They have assured me, however, that an attempt will be made by the female teachers to do all that is humanly possible to give this instruction insofar as they are equipped to give it.\n\nThe following telegram has just been received from the Secretary of the Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission of the Church of England:\n\n\"Regret inform you our Society's school main buildings at Onion Lake completely destroyed by fire this\nmorning. Staff and pupils safe. Outbuildings intact. Children being sent to homes. Will advise further when full report received from Principal.\n\nThe Onion Lake Church of England School is a government-owned institution and had at the date of its destruction by fire an authorized enrolment of 100 pupils. There was an actual attendance of 127. The following schools destroyed by fire in recent years, have not yet been rebuilt: Alberni classroom, File Hills classroom, Caribou senior school, Carcross residential school (C.E.), Fort George residential school (C.E.), Onion Lake (C.E.) residential school and Back Settlement Indian day school, Carcross agency. Unless provision can be made for the rebuilding of these schools at an early date, the problem of finding sanitary and adequate accommodation for our steadily growing Indian school population will become increasingly acute.\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nRight Rev. J. Trocellier, O.M.I., D.D., Edmonton, Alta.;\nMost Rev. J. G. Breynat, O.M.I., Edmonton, Alta.;\nRev. H. A. Alderwood, D.D., Secretary, Indian & Eskimo Residential School Comm., M.S.C.C., Winnipeg, Man.;\nRev. Canon L. A. Dixon, M.A., General Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n604 Jarvis St., Toronto, Ont.;\nRev.

Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, February 1, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR McILL.\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended January 31, 1944.\n\nWELFARE:\n\nA campaign of criticism - one might refer to it as a campaign of vilification - has been directed against the administration of Indian affairs with steadily growing intensity during the last three or four year period. The records before me indicate that this campaign began in British Columbia, when articles signed by Mrs. Glynn-Ward (Mrs. Howard) appeared in the daily and weekly papers of that province. These articles became so scurrilous that the R. C. M. P., without direction by this Department, investigated the activities of Mrs. Howard, with the result that a number of the B. C. papers refused to publish her articles on Indian administration. Mrs. Howard then began an attack in the Montreal Herald and Weekly Star and in a number of Old Country publications. It would appear that copies of her letters and articles appearing in the Montreal papers were distributed to certain prominent Indians throughout the Dominion and have been taken quite seriously. More recently, it would appear that this campaign has been taken up in the province of Alberta by one John Laurie, Principal of the Crescent Heights High School, Calgary. Mr. Laurie appears to have written a special article entitled \"Any old clothes for the Indians\" which appeared in the Calgary Herald on January 7. In addition to this article, Mr. Laurie has appeared before the members of the American University Women's Club in Calgary and delivered an address, a summary of which appeared in the Calgary Albertan of January 11, under the heading \"Cites horrible conditions under which Indians live\". Mr. Laurie has also appeared before a local group of Canadian university graduates in Calgary and delivered the same address.\n\nMajor MacKay and Inspector Schmidt, with whom I have discussed these articles and this unfair publicity have pointed out that it is comparatively easy to attach too much importance to such articles. I have a feeling, however, that misleading information supplied to Indians in this way, with no corresponding attempt on the part of the Department to correct the impression created, has a tendency to shatter the faith of the Indian in our educational institutions, in our Indian agents and generally in the work of the Department. It is significant that during the last two year period we have experienced the utmost difficulty in persuading Indians to send their children to Indian day and residential schools. Is it possible that the faith of the Indian in the schools provided by the Department - never very strong - has been somewhat weakened, if not wholly shattered, by this propaganda? Mrs. Howard, for example, has directed her attacks\nparticularly to conditions on Indian reserves and Indian schools in the Cowichan agency, and during the last year the attendance at the Ste. Catherine Consolidated School has been so unsatisfactory that we have on more than one occasion seriously considered the desirability of closing this school, the largest and best equipped Indian day school in the Dominion.\n\nI have referred on more than one occasion to the difficulty experienced in securing from Indian agents worthwhile reports on fishing operations in their agencies from year to year. You will be glad to learn that a number of reports have been received during the present season and that these reports are, without exception, satisfactory and encouraging. Indian Agent Swartman, in a letter dated January 8, 1944, states:\n\n\"I have recently been in communication with Mr. F. W. Bowman, of Hudson, regarding results of commercial fishing operations conducted by our Indians at Lac Seul and Osnaburgh during the present season. I believe the Department would be interested to have some of the details.\n\n\"The principal catch was taken on Licenses held by the Lac Seul Band and Indians of Treaty 9, residents of Lac Seul, and also the Osnaburgh band at Lake St. Joseph. The Lac Seul Indians caught a total of 506,675 lbs., for which they received $49,259.64. The catch this year included jack fish, tulibees and eel-pouts as well as 69,399 lbs. of suckers, which were previously discarded. During the season ten more of the Lac Seul Indians fitted themselves out with small gas boats, which now makes a total of 30 gas-powered boats owned and operated by the members of the Lac Seul Band.\n\n\"In addition to the above $12,000.00 was paid to the Osnaburgh Indian fishermen. No exact record of the Indians' catch at Lake St. Joseph is obtainable at present, as their fish were shipped out along with those operating on other licenses. This sum, however, was divided amongst about 15 or 20 families, fishing regularly during the summer months\".\n\nMr. A. J. Goodman, in a report on fishing operations at the Fisher River Agency, submits figures indicating that 17 Indians, fishing on Lake Winnipeg, had a fish catch amounting to 64,905 pounds, for which they secured $5,604.55.\n\nMr. Goodman has also submitted a report on fishing operations in The Pas Agency. In this report he states:\n\n\"There was some fish put up and frozen during the late fall at this agency but none cured to keep for any length of time. To do this curing, Mr. Lovell suggests that a full-time man would have to be employed to instruct and demonstrate and encourage the Indians for a long time. This emergency stock of fish should be put up and cured in early spring and late fall only when the weather is at least very cool. If the fish at these seasons is properly cured, salted, smoked and dried, it would keep for an indefinite length of time. I am reasonably certain that if we can get the Indians started at curing fish and meat for themselves, it will not only save money for the Government, but to a great extent...\"\nraise the standard of living and health of the Indians themselves. Wherever I happen to be during the early spring and late fall, I will demonstrate to Indians and half-breed settlers how best to cure fish and meat and at the same time demonstrate to them how to treat nets in and out of use, mending them and storing them properly between seasons.\n\nWe are frequently critical of certain groups of Indians for their refusal to assume the duties and responsibilities ordinarily associated with right living and democratic citizenship. In this connection a somewhat encouraging report has been received from Indian Agent Anfield, of Bella Coola. In this report Mr. Anfield states:\n\n\"It is thought that the Department would be interested in seeing how well these Indians handle their band projects. The secretary and treasurer are both graduates of the Alert Bay Residential School, and it was a pleasure to check their accounts and find everything so well kept.\n\n\"These Bella Coola people have a grand community hall, which they are constantly improving and in which they take tremendous pride. They elected new officers at the annual meeting and the most interesting feature of the evening was the keen election fight among some of the youngest men to be at the top of the poll as janitors. This tribe start the young men of 16 or 19 as janitors, on the understanding that they will work their way up through the other offices such as floor manager, stockkeeper, ticket collector, secretary, treasurer and hall president\u2014a real example of democratic living. In recording the votes, I was impressed by the fact that in every instance the older men would cast their own ballot for some other than their own son or younger brother\u2014a rather fine gesture.\"\n\nIt is encouraging to be able to report that despite the large number of Indians employed by white farmers during the last two crop years, enlistments and the number of Indians who have secured employment in war industries, there has been a substantial increase in the acreage under cultivation on our reserves and a substantial increase, as well, in the actual amount of grain, vegetables and live stock produced. Last spring and early summer, a number of brood sows were purchased and distributed to a number of agencies in Saskatchewan, on the understanding that Indians receiving these sows would contribute an amount of pork or bacon equivalent to the value of the sow received, for ration purposes. The first report on this experiment, dated December 29, 1943, has been received from Mr. Christianson. This report reads as follows:\n\n\"I have asked for a statement in this regard from every agency that was supplied with hogs, and am now in receipt of one from the Crooked Lake Agency, setting forth the following information:\n\nWhite Bear Reserve\u20145 sows were supplied at a cost of $185.00; 4 sows farrowed and 27 young pigs raised.\n\nOkanagan Reserve\u20143 sows were supplied at a cost of $90.00; 2 sows farrowed and 12 young pigs raised.\n\nKahkewistahaw Res.\u20141 sow was supplied at a cost of $30.00; and 8 young pigs raised.\n\nCowessess\u2014\nCowessess Reserve - 2 sows were supplied at a cost of $60.00; both farrowed and 12 young pigs raised.\n\nSakimay Reserve - 2 sows were supplied at a cost of $60.00; neither farrowed, consequently no young pigs were raised.\n\n\"Pork returned for ration purposes amounted to 1935 lbs. The total number of young pigs raised in the agency amounted to 59. The sows that did not farrow this year have been bred again and there will be 900 lbs. of bacon to be delivered next year from those who had no increase this year. From the 13 sows purchased 9 farrowed and raised 59 pigs. Therefore, for a beginning in this agency, we did not do badly\".\n\nIt will thus be seen that the project has been reasonably successful in the Crooked Lake Agency and is likely to result in a substantial reduction in the amount of ration bacon for this agency.\n\nTRAINING:\n\nI have, on more than one occasion, expressed the view that teachers in charge of Indian day schools should be classified as welfare and training officers and should be employed, not for a 10 month, but for a 12 month period, less the 15 days regular holiday period granted members of the Civil Service. It is interesting to note, in this regard, that Inspector Tomlinson, one of the most experienced public school inspectors in the province of Saskatchewan, in his report dated November 26, 1943, supports this proposal. The Inspector states:\n\n\"The good effect of the earlier opening (September 1) is quite evident. When times get back to normal, it would seem desirable to consider the teacher's job as a twelve-month one, with the usual Civil Service vacation. The many opportunities for service on the reserve, by the teacher, are always in evidence\".\n\nI can only add, by way of comment, that it is particularly regrettable, in view of the production campaign we are seeking to promote this spring, that we shall not have the assistance and leadership of our teachers during the two important months of the crop year.\n\nThe following excerpt has been taken from the \"Indian Missionary Record\", published in Saskatchewan:\n\n\"Since the outbreak of the war, we have recorded the number of 55 men and women, ex-pupils of the Duck Lake (R.C.) School, who have volunteered in His Majesty's Services - 47 men and 8 women. It was realized that 9 out of the 47 men were rejected on account of their health by the Military Medical Board. Thirty of the boys are now overseas, serving in various countries, and one girl, Pte. Mary Greyeyes, who served with the C W A C for the past two years five months. Letters are received from these ex-pupils regularly, in which they state that their general health is good.\"\n\nEvidence, in respect to the difficulty experienced by residential school principals in securing qualified teachers and in financing these institutions, is steadily\naccumulating. The St. George's (C.E.) School, at Lytton, B.C., has at this date an enrolment of 180 pupils and receives a per capita allowance of $460. In addition to the per capita grant, it receives approximately $5,000.00 annually, as a special grant from the New England Company, London, England. There are 14 residential schools in the province of British Columbia, and only two others, in addition to Lytton, receive a per capita grant as high as $180. The Lytton School is in charge of the Reverend C. F. Hives, who has had 30 years' experience in the administration of residential schools, at Lac la Ronge, Sask., Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., and Lytton, B.C. In a letter dated December 26, 1945, Mr. Hives, in an outburst of discouragement, writes:\n\n\"We have just disposed of Christmas Day, with 70 pupils in bed with the Flu. No nurses available, in spite of all our efforts to secure one. We have no laundress, and last week I had to personally take charge of the laundry work, with two girls to help. At present we have one cleaner. Our man went down with the Flu and since his recovery left for Vancouver, where his wife is very seriously ill. I have had to be up at 4 and 5 o'clock in the morning to look after the heating of the building, which at present resembles a hospital. We have no farm manager and I have had more outside supervision work to undertake. I do not like to sound so much like a one-man orchestra. How long one can stand the strain, I don't know, but conditions cannot get much worse. The chances are they may improve.\n\n\"In reply to your anxious letter of the 21st instant, I beg to report that owing to illness, pressure of work and shortage of staff, I was late in making out my October financial statement. It is the first time I have ever been late, and anyone who has the faintest idea of what I and others have been going through since the commencement of the term, in the matter of epidemics of measles, whooping cough and Flu, will recognize some justification for the delay.\n\n\"You state in your letter that the Department are showing some concern over the financial situation of our school. I admit it is not at the present time a paying concern; but at least we are not in debt, if one takes into consideration our current surplus. When I took over the administration of this school, there was not only no current surplus - there was a large indebtedness.\n\n\"In regard to the salaries being in arrears, I have never been later than the third or fourth day after the end of each month. I used to pay salaries before the end of the month, but so many of the staff held their cheques over that I had to carry them as cheques outstanding. I have had considerable difficulty in securing staff workers, who are generally of an unreliable type. They come and stay for a week or so and leave as soon as they hear of higher wages elsewhere. I have had to raise all salaries twice during the present year, and still they are low, compared with the general rate of salaries in the province, and we are short-staffed.\n\n\"I feel sure the Department realize that the present financial assistance we receive is quite inadequate to meet the needs of present day demands. The only way I\nknow of to make that financial assistance suffice is to cut down on the food and clothing received by the pupils and put more boys to work instead of hiring extra labour; but we should not do these things. At least I would rather leave than do them. Fifty cents per day, which we receive as our per capita allowance, seems altogether too small, compared with two dollars per day, allowed at the hospitals; and yet most of these children require a great deal of care and certainly more nourishing food than they now receive.\n\nThe chaplain himself, in his statement some time ago, along with the information regarding the diet these children should be receiving, are all very fine and, I have no doubt, required a great deal of time and expense to produce; but we cannot carry them out simply because our per capita grant allowance is not sufficient to enable us to do so. Our school is not unique in this respect. If a survey were made of all the schools, I have no doubt one would find that very few schools come anywhere near to what the pupils should be having in the way of nourishment. Several times, staff members have come here from other schools and I have enquired of them about the way Indian children have been fed at schools where they were employed. The diet we supply is, if anything, a little better than at the majority of our schools, because we have the advantage of tomato juice and fruit; but I would certainly like to see our regular meals improved.\n\n\"I assure you, sir, it is not my intention to be disrespectful, and as the Department are inclined to be critical of our financial situation and worried about matters, it is just as well if they hear my views on the subject. I have been in this work for 30 years and know pretty well what I am talking about. A careful survey should be made of all the schools, if possible, by people who have a thorough and practical knowledge of what is best for the welfare of residential schools\".\n\nIn view of the difficulty we have experienced, and are still experiencing, in securing teachers and janitors at Indian day schools, and particularly men for janitor service in British Columbia, we are, as officials, perhaps somewhat fortunate that the Churches and not the Department are called upon to operate our residential schools in this crisis. One case was the resignation of Mr. MacKenzie, whose principalship has retired as the result of ill health during the last two years. Three outstanding principals have retired during the present academic year: Reverend M. de Bretagne, Principal of the Cu'Appelle School at Lebret, Sask.; Reverend R. C. Scott, Principal of the Alberni School, B.C.; and Reverend J. P. Mackey, Principal of the Shubenacadie School.\n\nEverything considered, the outlook for our residential schools is in no sense encouraging.\n\nOn the other hand, Indian day schools, despite the difficulty we have experienced in securing fully qualified teachers, appear to be doing reasonably good work. The following excerpt is taken from the Vancouver Sun, January 3, 1944:\n\n\"St. Catherine's School at Duncan, Christie Indian School at Kakawis (west coast of Vancouver Island) and the Inkaneep School at Oliver (Okanagan Valley) have each received awards for entries submitted through the Society for the Furtherance of B. C. Indian Arts and Crafts and displayed...\"\nat the Canadian Handicrafts Guild annual exhibition held this fall in Montreal and Quebec. First prize for applied work was awarded to Inkameep School for excellent paintings on buckskin, some of which had already received awards in the Royal Drawing Society's exhibitions in London, England.\n\nFirst prize for design and second for applied work went to Christie Indian School for examples of native designs and fine beadwork. A special prize was awarded St. Catherine's Consolidated Indian School for unusual examples of woodwork. Individual prizes were won by Madeline Charlie of St. Catherine's School for a beautifully knit sweater and by Mrs. Johnny Jackson of Kakawis for a finely woven basket.\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nMiss Amy Roe, Editor, Woman's Section, The Country Guide, Winnipeg, Manitoba;\n\nColonel Carmichael, Veterans' Allowance Board;\n\nMr. Askew, Valentine Black Company; Toronto;\n\nDr. T. J. Orford, Indian Agent, James Bay, Ont.;\n\nMr. E. J. Whalen, Indian Agent, Fredericton, N. B.;\n\nMadame Couson and Miss Fitzsimmons, Clothing Section, Wartime Prices and Trade Board;\n\nMr. J. H. Connor, Ottawa;\n\nReverend Sisters from Pierreville, Que.;\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I., Winnipeg.\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, March 1, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCGILL,\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended February 28, 1944.\n\nWELFARE:\n\nI have referred on more than one occasion in my recent reports to the attempts made by this Division, during the last two-year period, to encourage hog production on a number of reserves. In this connection the reports received during the last two or three weeks from Saskatchewan indicate that the experiment undertaken at a number of agencies in the production of hogs has been reasonably successful. Mr. Christianson, in a letter dated February 22, 1944, reporting on the raising of hogs at the Qu'Appelle Agency, states:\n\n\"Regarding the sows that were furnished Qu'Appelle Agency last Spring, as you know Mr. Booth is without a clerk and looking after two agencies, but I have at last been able to get a statement on the hogs that were supplied to his agency last spring.\n\n16 sows were supplied last Spring, as follows:\n\nAssiniboine Reserve - 6 from which there were 37 young pigs raised;\n\nPasqua Reserve - 4 from which there were 29 young pigs raised;\n\nMuscowpetung Reserve - 2 from which there were 15 young pigs raised;\n\nStanding Buffalo - 4 from which there were 27 young pigs raised;\n\n\"To sum up, there were 16 sows supplied to the Agency from which 106 young pigs were raised. 4,303 lbs. of pork are being delivered to the Agency and there are still 429 lbs. of pork to be delivered.\n\n\"THIS IS IMPORTANT. The 1,008 lbs. of bacon in the estimates for Pasqua need not be shipped. The same applies to the 1,008 lbs. for Muscowpetung and the 1,050 lbs. for Carry the Kettle. The Agent claims he has enough to carry on at the present time for these three reserves, but the bacon for Piapot and Standing Buffalo is to be shipped as requested in the estimates. When more bacon is required for the three reserves which are not getting any in the first shipment, you will be advised. We want to make as\nbig a saving as we possibly can. Personally I think that this venture at Qu'Appelle Agency has been very satisfactory because the Indians themselves have sold a lot of pork and they have sold some young sows to other Indians. Some of them have also kept another sow for breeding purposes from the young pigs that were raised.\n\n\"In talking to Mr. Booth he informs me for the present they have all of the pigs they can handle until the Indians become more hog minded but for the first year I think you will agree with me that the Indians have done mighty well because evidently they sold 160,000 lbs. of pork. There are, also, of course, a few Indians who purchased hogs themselves.\n\n\"I hope I have made myself quite clear.\"\n\nInspector Hamilton, in his report dated February 1, on the Peguis Reserve (Fisher River Agency) states:\n\n\"The cattle returns show 354 head. The cattle seen were in good condition and the Indians claim to have enough feed.\n\n\"Pigs are now kept by 10 people, turkeys by 8 and chickens by 45. Those who have no grain purchase it at the agency from the community farm crop. The supply of surplus grain available at this farm has already stimulated a desire on the part of the Indians to keep more poultry.\"\n\n\"One Indian who had three ewes last summer raised 6 lambs. ..... A few years ago we purchased two spinning wheels and paid a teacher to give the Indians lessons in spinning. Today they have five additional wheels, all purchased by individual Indians. Already, they have knitted up all their raw wool and are hoping to have more next year. Our venture on this reserve with sheep has proven helpful and the flocks are increasing slowly. There are others anxious to get a start, and if funds are available in our 1944-45 estimates I would like to purchase 12 head. The cost will amount to approximately $145.00.\n\n\"This band of Indians purchased 50 good work horses during the summer months. There are at least 15 Indians driving good teams who never before owned a horse. These horses have greatly added to the earning power of the Indians. They can now haul their own wood instead of paying others to do the work.\"\n\nThe Peguis Reserve has at this date a population of approximately 1039.\n\nInspector Hamilton in this report also refers to conditions at the Fisher River Reserve. He states:\n\n\"The stock returns on this reserve show 280 head of cattle, all in good condition...... Two Indian families have pigs, eight have chickens and one has five ewes. Of those having chickens, three have over fifty.\nThe others have flocks of from 20 to 40. The Indians on this reserve, however, are practically all fishermen. They reported a good catch for the early part of the season, but the run has now slowed down and many were lifting their nets at the time of my visit. The Indians have requested permission from the Provincial Government to fish in Lake St. George and two other nearby lakes for jackfish. Jackfish are now worth from five to six cents per pound.\n\nTwo seasons ago a machine for the baling of straw was purchased at the Caradoc Agency. The baler was purchased in the hope that a market would be found for the surplus hay and straw produced on the reserve. Reports received from the agent to date indicate that this purchase was amply justified. In a report dated February 4 Mr. Down states:\n\n\"Another phase of agriculture during the month of January has been the pressing and baling of straw and hay. I have been able to keep four or five Indians working and more than 100 tons of straw and several tons of hay have been already baled. When one considers that a little over two years ago most of the straw grown on the reserve went up in smoke, I think that our initial expenditure for the baler has been justified. Certainly, the lessons taught suggest sound agricultural practice and not without profit.\n\n\"Our willow plantation during the month received some attention by way of cleaning out rows and the spreading of barnyard fertilizer. The young canes look strong and healthy, although I would prefer to see a blanket of snow covering the roots, especially during the months of February and March.\"\n\nIt is particularly gratifying to report an actual increase of cattle at the Battleford Agency. Indian Agent Ostrander, in his last report, states:\n\n\"There is a slight increase of cattle on all reserves, with a resulting fairly good increase for the whole agency. There is also a considerable increase in work horses on most of the reserves. A fairly large number of Indians have good work horses at the present time. All live stock have had a good winter as the weather has been very favourable. There will be many breeding sows carried over for breeding this year, and the whole project of hog raising, which was started last year, has been reasonably successful. This project has been the subject of a special report.\"\n\nTRAINING\n\nThe utmost difficulty has been experienced throughout the year in securing the number of teachers necessary to keep our Indian day schools open and in\noperation. Despite the fact that we have employed a number of elderly teachers, lacking both professional and academic standing, we have at this date 12 schools for which we have not yet obtained teachers. We did succeed, however, during the course of the month in securing a fully qualified teacher for the St. Clair School, Sarnia Agency. This school will re-open on March 1. We were fortunate in securing a teacher at this particular time, especially in view of the fact that a number of Indian parents were urgently requesting us to make provision for the transportation of their children to the public schools in Sarnia. If this provision had been made, it would have been necessary also to pay substantial tuition fees to the Sarnia School Board.\n\nOne of the teachers in charge of an Indian day school at the Caradoc Agency submitted her resignation during the month. It is significant and somewhat difficult to understand why we have experienced so much trouble in securing teachers at this agency during the last two or three year periods. The reason is, as you know, comparatively close to the city of London and is in no sense isolated. Residences, however, are attached to the schools and teachers are expected to live in these houses. The majority of teachers appear reluctant to live and work steadily amongst Indians when other schools are available.\n\nI have already referred to Inspector Hamilton's report on the Fisher River Agency. In a reference to the Indian day school, Mr. Hamilton states:\n\n\"In this school we have Miss Smith Windsor in charge of the senior room with 33 enrolled, and Miss MacCall in the junior room with 43 pupils. The attendance has been fair but there is room for improvement. A number of Indians have been camped with their families near the lake where they are fishing and consequently the children were unable to attend school. Most of these people, however, have now moved back, so that the attendance should improve.\n\n\"The pupils are well along in their respective grades and the work seen was well done and neatly set down. I am certain the children are making good progress. The pupils were all well dressed, many with dresses, skirts, coats and windbreakers made from army clothing. These were all neatly remodelled, and the average person would never know the material was from old army clothes. The sewing club, under the direction of Miss Smith-Windsor, has done excellent work.\"\n\nInspector Bowes, in his report on the Onion Lake R.C. Residential School, dated November 25, 1945, states:\n\n\"Primary Room - Beginners are making satisfactory progress. This is a typical primary room and is well equipped with primary material. The pupils are divided into three groups. The Grade One class has been in school a year and progress is satisfactory. These pupils were making progress equal to that of a foreign child with one year in this grade. In all divisions, discipline was good.\"\nThe pupils were polite and industrious. Number work was far beyond the work required in the usual Grade One class. Sister Louise Margaret, who has a certificate from the Nicolet Training College, is a valuable addition to the staff of this school.\n\n\"Intermediate Class - General progress in this class is very satisfactory. Spelling was above average. Language was good. Reading was clear, distinct and each word carefully pronounced. Singing, excellent. Pupils were orderly. Sister St. Hippolyte, who is also a graduate of the Nicolet Training College, continues to do efficient work in this room.\"\n\nSenior Room - Sister Celine du Carmel, a graduate of Nicolet, acts as principal of the school as far as the academic work is concerned. She is very capable and the Indian pupils in her room were making excellent progress. Reading and language work were well advanced. Pronunciation was above expectation. Mathematics was good in all grades. The general tone of the classroom was excellent.\"\n\nThe Onion Lake School has an authorized enrolment of 100 pupils.\n\nInspector Campbell Innes, in his report on the Thunderchild Indian Residential School (Battleford Agency) of December 13, 1943, states:\n\n\"Kindergarten - Sister Loretta - This teacher has a fund of excellent ideas which effectively rouse her pupils to put forth their best efforts. Steady progress is made in improving the language. These children are learning the language through socialized activities. The classroom plays are most helpful. This kindergarten classroom should furnish a splendid foundation in the basic habits. Physical education - Socialized games are well developed and carried out in an orderly manner. Art is quite well correlated and has a large place in the program.\n\n\"Primary Room - Sister Colette - This teacher appears anxious to improve her classes. She is ready to explain and to drill. The drill may be more challenging with an understanding of her pupils. The instruction should be natural and influential. The lessons may be developed a little more to secure more understanding and observation. Oral reading is quite good in word recognition and in articulation. A variety of songs are sung. There is good tone. Health exercises are given to interpret rules. Work books are generally neat. Pupils are covering the course in arithmetic. They are drilling for accuracy.\n\n\"Intermediate - Sister Saint Cyr - First Class certificate. This teacher appears quite capable of preparation of material to meet the needs of her pupils. I found them quite courteous, interested and fairly responsive. A good effort is made to cover the course. This teacher is responsible for the subjects of arithmetic, spelling, reading and physical education.\n\nSenior Room - Sister Marie de Galilee - Here is a very interesting and pleasant classroom in which\nthe pupils are trained to live and think together in order to accomplish a definite purpose. All subjects have received equal attention. Every effort is made to understand the needs of the pupils and to train them to work with initiative, originality and self-reliance. I was pleased to note that language is stressed at all times - reading, reciting, debating. I was also pleased to note that the activity work is so effectively used to encourage the real meaning of the subjects. The new program for Indian schools now includes cooking, leather work, knitting, housekeeping, gardening, sewing, wood work, poultry, metal work and dairying. The pupils have a number of lessons in each. They have an opportunity to earn certificates and badges covering three years' work. I was pleased to see at this school a good open-air rink, toboggan slides and swings. The pupils have the use of a radio.\"\n\nThe Fishing Lake Indian Day School (C.E.) has been in charge of the Reverend Alex. J. Lawes since 1922. Mr. Lawes' wife is also an experienced teacher. Inspector R. E. Sparkes, in his last report on this school, states:\n\n\"The improvement noted in my last report has been continued. It seems to me that Mr. Lawes should be encouraged to attend another refresher course during the next year or two. It would provide him with the assistance he so badly needs.\n\n\"Simple and interesting songs are rendered with all the children taking part. Good use is made of the blackboard for making essential assignments for seat work.\n\n\"Reading - By the use of simple readers it should be possible to secure greater fluency and expression in rendering the selections. The pupils appear to have some idea of the meaning of the pieces studied, but the response is poor. The children seem restrained as though afraid to speak out plainly. Phonics, however, continue to be successfully drilled. Penmanship is very good. These children write quite legibly. Construction work is partly under the control and guidance of Mrs. Lawes, who is an experienced teacher. The type of work presented was excellent, but a greater degree of self-determination should be provided.\"\n\nReverend F. O'Grady, Principal of the Kamloops (R.C.) Residential School, in a letter to the Indian agent dated February 19, 1944, refers to the vocational courses undertaken by the pupils at the school. The Principal states:\n\n\"While the technical training of the boys consists chiefly in the proper use of hand tools, the older boys are very anxious to learn the operation of power tools, the knowledge of which will be very useful to them after school. This year the boys, under the direction of the manual trainer, have undertaken the project of making 20 spinning wheels, which will be given to the senior girls...\"\ngraduating in June. The girls have become very proficient in the carding and spinning of wool and it is felt that if they are given spinning wheels to take home with them they will make good use of such equipment and will thus benefit by the training they received at school.\"\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nMajor D. L. McKeand\n\nMr. J. G. Perdue and Mr. A. Baxter, Publicity Division;\n\nD. McIvor, Esq., M.P.\n\nRev. Dr. H. A. Alderwood, Secretary, Indian & Eskimo Residential School Comm., M.S.C.C., Winnipeg, Man.;\n\nRev. Dr. Geo. Dorey, United Church Home Mission Board,\n\nRev. Dr. R. B. Cochrane,\n\nMrs. Lovies, Women's Missionary Society, - Toronto.\n\nRev. Canon Dixon, Church of England Missionary Society,\n\nToronto, Ont.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Josephine, Pierreville, Que.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, April 1, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCGILL,\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended March 31, 1944.\n\nWELFARE:\n\nIt is difficult to resist the temptation that besets one in the preparation of this, the last monthly report for the fiscal year 1943-44, to compare conditions on Indian reserves as we have come to know them throughout the year with conditions prevailing on these reserves prior to the outbreak of the war. It can be said that Indians have enjoyed a greater measure of prosperity throughout the year than they have experienced perhaps at any preceding period in their history. Indians have found little, if any, difficulty in securing work at satisfactory wages; in fact, the demand for Indian labour far exceeds the supply. The prevailing prices of farm products, the high prices being paid for furs, the extension of fishing operations by Indians on the Pacific Coast and the rabbit cycle, which this year appears to be at its peak, have all contributed to the prosperity of the Indian.\n\nThere are still a few districts, however, where relief costs at this date are practically as high as they were during the depth of the depression, in 1936. These districts consist in the main of northern agencies, such as Abitibi, James Bay, Sioux Lookout, Norway House and Lesser Slave Lake. It would appear that the Indians at these agencies have not the skill, training or temperament to take advantage of employment conditions. They are usually referred to as hunting and trapping Indians and are likely to remain so for a great many years. Relief costs in such areas are not likely to be reduced until provision is made by the adoption of long-term policies for the replenishment of wild life, upon which these Indians have depended until now for a livelihood. It is somewhat difficult to escape the feeling that the administrators are devoting altogether too much time to the Indians who are living in the southern sections of the country and who, for the time being at least, are capable of looking after themselves, and not enough to the hunting and trapping Indians, who undoubtedly have a greater and more legitimate claim on the assistance we are in a position to render. For example, it seems difficult to justify free education, free medical care and hospitalization for Indians such as the group at Caughnawaga when one learns that large numbers of these Indians are earning $20.00 a day or more in war industries.\n\nThe prosperity to which I have referred in my opening sentences does not appear to be fully reflected\nin our relief and welfare costs. Relief and welfare expenditures for the period April 1, 1943, to February 28, 1944, amounted to $547,741.36, compared to an expenditure of $544,170.94 for the corresponding period of last year. This represents an increase of $3,570.42. I attribute our failure to still further reduce relief expenditures to a number of factors the significance of which is apt to be forgotten. We made, last year and this year, substantial expenditures from welfare funds in the purchase of land. The purchase of this land represents capital outlay and should in my judgment be charged to the Reserves and Trusts Division. Again, we have taken over the operation of community farms that were financed until 18 months ago from trust funds. In addition to these expenditures, the program of tuberculosis control, promoted in recent years by the Medical Division, has resulted in additional expenditures from the Welfare Vote. Patients discharged from sanatoria throughout the country require, for a year or two after discharge, food supplies such as milk, eggs, fruit, etc., that do not ordinarily appear on our relief schedules. These are granted in each case on the recommendation of the local medical officer. To withhold such supplies from Indians during their period of convalescence would undoubtedly retard their recovery and thus result in their return for hospital treatment. Finally, we have, during the last two year period, spent more money on the purchase of livestock, particularly purebred bulls, in the West, and herds of goats in the East. We have spent substantial sums, as well, in the purchase of pigs in Saskatchewan, in the construction of brooder houses and the purchase of poultry in Ontario and Quebec. It is gratifying to note that despite the large number of Indians who have found work in the United States and an equally large number who have found work in our own war industries, production on Indian reserves throughout the country was substantially increased during the year. Reports recently received from Indian agents, missionaries and teachers indicate that field officials, with few exceptions, are responding with enthusiasm to the plea made in our circular letter on production, sent out with the accompanying chart on February 15.\n\nIndians continue to take a keen interest in the work of the Red Cross Society. Inspector Hamilton, in a letter dated February 25, sent forward an excerpt from a communication received by him from the teacher at the Little Saskatchewan Indian Day School. In this excerpt the teacher states:\n\n\"I thought you would be interested to know what some of our Indians are doing in regard to the war effort. Our Women's Organization has sponsored several little sales, Saturday evenings, with the result that we have donated $10.00 and $15.55 to the Red Cross, $18.00 to the starving Indian (Hindu) Fund and today I am sending $100.00 to the Red Cross, the net proceeds of a social evening held on the reserve\".\n\nThe following summary is taken from the Regina Leader Post of February 7, 1944:\n\n\"Indians of the Pelly Agency, near Kamsack, raised $279.00 during 1943 for philanthropic purposes. Of\nthe $279.00 raised, $84.00 went to the Red Cross, $15.00 to the Greek War Relief, $15.00 to the Milk for Britain Fund, $35.00 for Soldiers' Christmas boxes and $110.00 was raised to send cigarettes to men of the reserves who are in the Armed Forces. Fifty knitted articles and 36 articles of clothing were made by the Homemaker's Club for overseas parcels. Another phase of the Indian war effort is seen in the $900.00 worth of Victory Bonds purchased on the reserve during 1943.\"\n\nYou may remember that a few months ago Mr. Arneil and Mr. Morris organized two or three Homemakers' Clubs on the Iyendina Reserve. The Anglican Missionary on the reserve, the Reverend Herbert Pringle, in a letter dated March 21, states:\n\n\"The Homemakers' Clubs are already a great success on the reserve and the members look forward to the meetings and take great delight in remaking garments. I have been in several homes where the clothes from the clubs have been received and the parents are most grateful. Every Friday during Lent we go to the Eastern School for a special service for the children at 6 P.M. The Homemakers' Club meets at 6 o'clock each Friday and the members will stay for this service. When I suggested a Homemakers' Sunday service in the Church with Corporate Communion for the members and a special sermon relating to homemaking, the members took up the idea with enthusiasm and have chosen the first Sunday in July as their day.\"\n\nIndian Agent Down, in his monthly report dated March 3, states:\n\n\"You are aware, of course, that we have five Homemakers' Clubs organized at this agency. All have been visited during the month and the continued interest and appreciation of the material supplied by the Department is very pleasing. The useful purpose to which it is being put must be seen to be appreciated. One class alone has made and distributed more than 50 bed quilts, another 20, and so on, and all these quilts are made from small cuttings. In other words, the leaders of these clubs are making use of every piece of material. Other types of clothing of every description are made for children of all ages. Teachers report that they never saw the children so well dressed. This is certainly a credit to the expert needlecraft of the women. During the month many finished articles were brought to the office for inspection and at times the office resembled a clothes store, but I am always interested and the women are always proud to show their work. There is another interesting point that must not be overlooked and that is that these classes are teaching young girls to sew and remodel every type of discarded garment. In many instances young women have made complete dresses with very little help or instruction from their parents. As I watch these women work and note their interest in producing something for themselves, I cannot help but visualize the\npossibilities behind these organizations. With proper guidance and a good selection of leaders, their efforts can be guided into many channels of usefulness and education.\n\nI have referred on one or two occasions to the attempts we were making to encourage the raising of hogs on a number of reserves in Saskatchewan. This experiment to date has been all that one might expect. Indian Agent Simpson, in his report dated March 1, states:\n\n\"John P. Sanderson & Son, Gilbert, shipped 17 hogs to the market recently and realized $500.00 from the sale thereof. These Indians expect to have 8 more ready for market within a fortnight. Two other members of this reserve expect to have 16 or 19 hogs fit for market about the same time.\"\n\nTRAINING:\n\nEarly in the month Mr. Doucet inspected the Indian day schools on the St. Regis, Caughnawaga, Pierreville, Restigouche and Maria Reserves. Mr. Doucet is, as you know, primarily interested in the encouragement of vocational studies at our schools. During the course of this inspection trip, however, he made scientific tests on reading and other related subjects. Mr. Doucet is definitely of the opinion that the courses of study provided are more suitable for girls than for boys and that girls on the whole appear to make greater progress in classroom work. This is a condition that can only be corrected by the employment of more male teachers and it is not at all likely that such teachers will be available until the end of the war. Mr. Doucet will undertake the inspection of schools on a number of reserves in Eastern and Northern Ontario immediately following the Easter vacation. It is his intention, also, to attend the Provincial Conference of Teachers, held in Toronto during the week ending April 15.\n\nAn unusually encouraging report was received from Inspector W. J. Greening immediately following his inspection of the Kenora (N.C.) Residential School on March 5, 1944. The Inspector stated:\n\n\"This school has inaugurated this year a new system whereby the very young pupils are enrolled in a special class and given an opportunity to secure practice in oral English. I think this is an improvement as last year the junior teacher had too much to do.\n\n\"It is noted that two new teachers have come to this school this year from Crooked Lake. As both of these teachers have professional certificates from the province of Quebec, all three teachers on the staff have full professional standing - something of a record for schools in my district west of the Great Lakes.\n\n\"I do not think that I have ever before been so pleased with the work being done at this school,\"\nespecially so in the senior class. A great deal of attention to written English must have been given to her classes by the Sister teacher, Sister St. Janvier. I was able to demonstrate for the benefit of this teacher some ideas in the correcting of mistakes in written English, something that I am not too sure previous teachers in this grade would have been able to appreciate.\n\nThe following news summary has been taken from the Calgary Albertan, February 15, 1944:\n\n\"Loyalty was again intensified when St. Paul's Residential Indian School (C.E.) (Blood Reserve) won the January prize in the savings stamp drive open to all schools in the Cardston district and fostered by the Cardston Rotary Club. Far in excess of the allotment, somewhere near 600\u00a2, was the amount sent to St. Paul's School. This followed a similar prize won by the St. Mary's (R.C.) School in the month of December. The two Indian schools have been the main winners throughout the district. One of the Indian Chiefs at the celebration, on Friday, said: 'Red Indians; red blood; win the war and Indian help a lot'. The rest of the district salute the two Indian schools for their splendid achievement.\n\nThe school cadets, under the leadership of Lieut. Charles Middleton, gave a demonstration of their gun handling. In the school music room, after the flag was dropped by the bomber which circled the school and dipped its wings, a program was rendered under the direction of Ven. Archdeacon Middleton. Eighteen Rotarians sat on the platform with Chief Cross Child and Chief Percy Crighton, Chief Cross Child in a speech interpreted by Chief Freighton, said he welcomed everyone and hoped that the Indians' efforts will help win victory soon. The Rotary president, Sterling O. Low, officially presented the flag to Canon Middleton. Gordon S. Brewerton, one of the Rotarians having charge of the Indian School Campaign, gave a message of appreciation and congratulation. Father Charron, of St. Mary's School, gave a short address. The Indian Agent, Mr. McMillan, thanked both schools for their achievements.\"\n\nThe resignation of Miss A. McGinty, teacher in charge of the Shubenacadie Indian Day School, was received during the month. It is not at all likely that a teacher for this school can be secured at this comparatively late date in the academic year. The closing of this school is likely to create a certain amount of dissatisfaction amongst Indian parents who moved to the reserve on the understanding that educational facilities would be available for their children. We can only express the hope that immediate steps will be taken toward the construction of the new day school on this reserve and that the building will be ready for occupancy at the beginning of the next academic year.\n\nFather J. W. Brown, who was appointed principal of the Shubenacadie Residential School immediately following the resignation of Father Mackey toward the end of the last calendar year, visited the Department early in the month. Father Brown assured us that he would be glad to provide\naccommodation for at least two teachers at the residential school, should it be found possible to proceed with the construction of the building during the summer months.\n\nThe following visitors called at this office during the month:\n\nRev. J. W. Brown, Principal, Indian Residential School, Shubenacadie, N. S.;\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I., Winnipeg, Manitoba;\nMr. F. Matters, Indian Agent, Chapleau, Ont.;\nMr. C. J.

McKenzie, Winnipeg, Man.\nDr. Simes, Qu'Appelle Hospital, Sask.\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, May 1, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCGILL,\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended April 30, 1944.\n\nWELFARE:\n\nBrief reports from Mr. Morris, who has already visited the Peigan, Blood, Blackfoot, Sarcee and Stony Agencies, indicate that spring operations on these reserves have been delayed as the result of unfavourable weather conditions. Mr. Morris was particularly impressed with the herds of livestock on the southern reserves. It would appear from his reports that there has been an abundance of feed throughout the winter, with the result that the cattle are in splendid shape.\n\nIt is just possible that in my reports to you during the last two or three years I have not dealt as fully as I might have dealt with live stock production at our Indian agencies, particularly live stock production in the Prairie Provinces. The fact that I have not done so was, in part at least, due to our emphasis on the organization of goat herds in the East and the purchase of pigs for distribution, particularly in Saskatchewan, and such matters as the organization of Homemakers' Clubs, etc. May I state, however, in this report, that there is no phase of our welfare work to which I have given as much attention during the last eight years as I have given to the promotion of the live stock industry on our Indian reserves. The large acreage on a number of reserves, particularly in the West, lends itself to the expansion of this industry without involving us in much capital outlay. I have already referred in a special report to the organization of a special herd at the Blood Agency. A somewhat smaller herd was organized at the same time at the Peigan Agency and is doing reasonably well. Mr. Christianson, in a letter dated April 11, refers to the revenue derived throughout the year from the sale of live stock in Saskatchewan. In this report Mr. Christianson states:\n\n\"As for live stock sales, the revenue from cattle was $76,200.00 for the year, compared with an amount of $70,000.00 for the preceding year. Including cattle beefed, the total value of cattle disposed of by the Indians was $84,150.00, which was a substantial increase. The cattle sales averaged $62.50 per head. The cattle population on the reserves during the year has increased considerably. For instance, the Black Lake Agency reports an increase of around 80 head within the year and the Touchwood Agency, 110 head. Financial assistance was given, either from government appropriation...\"\nor band funds, in the purchase of pigs, with the understanding that the Indians getting this assistance were to turn in pork from pigs raised, value for value. The reports have been very satisfactory and many Indians participated in the venture. The Duck Lake Agency, in their live stock statement of March 31, report that 25 hogs were butchered and 275 sold. The Carlton Agency have raised over 500 hogs, and although I have not the exact figures from the other agencies, I know this project has been a success.\"\n\nIt is interesting to know that the value of cattle alone disposed of during the year in Saskatchewan was equal to $6.47 a head of the Indian population.\n\nI have referred on more than one occasion to the work accomplished by Miss Edythe Smith-Windsor, teacher at one of our day schools on the Fisher River Reserve, in the organization of Homemakers' Clubs. In her last report to Inspector Hamilton, dated April 8, 1944, this teacher states:\n\n\"I herewith submit a report on the work done by the Fisher River Indian Women's War Service Club for the first quarter of 1944. Fifty-four women have been engaged in this work. We have had 7 meetings. Following is a list of articles produced by the members of this Club:\n\n| Articles          | Quantity |\n|-------------------|----------|\n| Parkas made       | 17       |\n| Windbreakers      | 12       |\n| Trousers          | 19       |\n| Elderdawn covers  | 12       |\n| Mitts             | 5 pr.    |\n| Workbags          | 15       |\n| Shirts            | 6        |\n| Slippers          | 1 pr.    |\n| Aprons            | 5        |\n| Dish towels       | 2        |\n| Ski trousers      | 3        |\n| Shirts, made over | 34       |\n| Overalls          | 15       |\n| Waistcoats        | 2        |\n| Dresses           | 1        |\n\nARTICLES MADE 148\n\nUsing the grey flannel shirts, the women have made and donated the following articles for display purposes, hospital use and for the local Red Cross sale:\n\n| Articles          | Quantity |\n|-------------------|----------|\n| Slips             | 22       |\n| Bloomers          | 31       |\n| Shirts            | 1        |\n| Undershirts       | 2        |\n| Dresses           | 16       |\n| Coats             | 2        |\n| Jackets (baby)    | 1        |\n\nTOTAL 115\n\nThe women of the Club joined the W.A. of the United Church to hold a sale of sewing and a supper for the Red Cross. The sum of $127.89 was realized. In addition the young people held a Pie Social, at which\nor band funds, in the purchase of pigs, with the understanding that the Indians getting this assistance were to turn in pork from pigs raised, value for value.

The sum of $127.89 was realized. In addition the young people held a Pie Social, at which\n$242.25 was raised. These sums, totalling $370.14, have been sent to the Red Cross Society, Manitoba Branch. This is over a hundred dollars more than we raised last year, so we feel every one was 'behind' the drive.\n\nThe interest taken in our circular letter, emphasizing greater production, dated February 15, has been very encouraging. Archbishop Sinnott, in a letter dated February 28, states:\n\n\"I have written to all the Indian missionaries under my jurisdiction to back and support by every means in their power the campaign on Indian reserves. The idea is such an excellent one that we must all get behind it. I hope that next year it will meet with still more satisfactory results.\"\n\nDr. H. A. Alderwood, Secretary of the Indian & Eskimo Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C., in a letter dated February 26, states:\n\n\"I have to thank you for your letter of February 15th and have taken note of what you write. I have also studied with interest the chart sent out by the Department to all field officers. I may say that in my visits to our schools I have been very pleased with the efforts being made to increase production and assist in meeting the expenses of the school in this way. ...... You may rely upon me to get this matter before our agents and to stress the aspect of attention in the matter of self-support.\"\n\nA few weeks ago Mrs. Irene V. Gougeon, assistant supervisor of the conservation program directed by the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, interviewed us with the object of securing samples of military and R.C.M.P. clothing remodelled by the members of our Homemakers' Clubs. Mrs. Gougeon expressed the opinion at that time that a display of this clothing would go a long way to stimulate white women to undertake somewhat similar tasks. In a letter dated April 18, 1944, Mrs. Gougeon states:\n\n\"You will be interested to know that I have taken your display to several places in Ontario and Quebec and have found that the women were most enthusiastic and interested in the work you are doing. It is indeed surprising to find that so many have never heard of the work being done to organize Indian women. I expect to have finished with the garments toward the end of May and will return them to you. I found them very helpful in rounding out my demonstrations.\"\n\nIn this connection I was interested in a report which appeared in the evening edition of the Ottawa Citizen about two weeks ago. In this report the writer stated:\n\n\"More than 100 interested women attended the Remake Revue in St. Mathias Hall, Fairmont Avenue, on Friday evening, which was under the auspices of St. Agnes Guild.\n\n\"This was part of a nation-wide program, sponsored by the Consumer Branch of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, under the direction of Mrs. Irene Gougeon, assistant supervisor of clothing conservation for Canada. The keen...\"\ninterest displayed by the women attending was ample proof that these remake centres are filling a long-felt need on the part of young mothers for advice and help in making over used and partly worn garments for growing children as well as adults. A special display from the Department of Indian Affairs attracted a great deal of attention. These garments were made from discarded uniforms and included several hand-made quilts.\n\nIt is regrettable that despite the influence of our schools and the conscientious service rendered by missionaries, reports received from time to time indicate that conditions on certain reserves are profoundly discouraging to anyone interested in the cause of Indian betterment. Dr. J. P. Harvey, of Fort Norman, N.W.T., in a recent letter, states:\n\n\"I have long been aware of conditions at Good Hope and have several times in the past mentioned these conditions in my reports. Between snuff and chewing tobacco, there has been nearly a ton used there for each of the past few years. The use is universal. I can name some of the people who customarily empty two cans of snuff per day. The children begin smoking and chewing at extremely early ages. I have seen them barely able to walk, toddling along with a cigarette in their mouth - not cigarettes picked up on the trail but given them by their parents. I cannot help but attribute some of the extremely high mortality among the children to this cause. At various times the possibility of invoking Chapter 129 C.C.C. or a health ordinance has been discussed with the local policeman, but the opinion is that it would have to include the entire band and is hence deemed difficult.\n\n\"I miss no opportunity when in Good Hope to stress the evils of chewing tobacco on pregnant women or nursing mothers and on the young, but there is absolutely no response. I am quite satisfied that if we are to try to stop it, this will have to be done by Order in Council, prohibiting the sale of these commodities completely. The use of chewing tobacco is prevalent along the river, slightly less being used further north. The use of snuff is centred pretty well at Good Hope, but the use of both is increasing at all posts.\n\n\"Had I my own way, I would prohibit the traders from handling snuff, chewing tobacco and also factory-made cigarettes. I would also notify wholesale houses who fill Indian orders in the territories that the sale of these commodities is prohibited to Indians.\"\n\nMrs. Dewdney, wife of the missionary at Fort McPherson, N.W.T., in a letter dated March 1, states:\n\n\"We have no police here and the police at Red River pay actually very little attention to this place. We have what constitutes a very serious health menace and I would like some advice. When the people are away from the fort, there are main centres where they gather. The first one is for fishing at the mouth of the Peel River, about 25 miles down from here. There are dozens of tents and a number of small houses in a very small area on top of the river bank. In summer it is a village in...\"\nitself, but a village with no regulation at all. Hundreds of dogs are tethered down the bank and around the tents and houses. Dog excrement lies all over the place and on any trail you may take into the bush the place is utterly filthy. I have asked and asked the Red River police to do something, but nothing is ever done. The mouth of the Peel is the chief breeding ground for tapeworm. The dogs are the hosts and I believe that sooner or later almost everybody living there gets it.\"\n\nFor the first time since I entered the Department, 74 years ago, I received this month a letter of appropriation from an Indian. I was so surprised and startled by the receipt of this letter that I decided to incorporate it in my monthly report. I may explain that a few months ago Mr. Arnell and Mr. Morris succeeded in organizing a number of Homemakers' Clubs on the Tyendinaga Reserve. At the time of their visit, they learned that Mrs. Margaret Brant had lost her son as the result of military action overseas. Mr. Morris extended his sympathy on behalf of the Branch and brought back with him a photo of the deceased soldier. This picture was a small and indistinct snapshot, and we decided to have it enlarged, as a token of our appreciation to Mrs. Brant for her leadership on the reserve, and Mrs. Brant received the enlarged picture in due course. In a letter dated April 8, 1944, she states:\n\n\"First, I would like to thank you very much for the picture you so kindly sent us of our son Lloyd. We are all so pleased to have it, and as time goes on it will be all the more valued. Our family appreciate your thoughtfulness and kindness in sending it to us.\n\n\"I am leaving my monthly report of the Homemakers' Clubs with Mr. Moore, to be sent to you. I am pleased the Clubs are doing so well. All the members work harmoniously together and we greatly enjoy our weekly meetings. The members will continue to meet weekly until the busy season starts. Kind regards and many thanks for all your help.\"\n\nTRAINING:\n\nThree residential school principals and two Indian day school teachers resigned during the month. I have already dealt somewhat briefly with the resignations of the residential school principals in memoranda to you during the last two week period. The resignation of the teacher in charge of the Rama Indian Day School was particularly unfortunate in that she had in her class three pupils proceeding toward their Entrance Examinations in June. In view of this fact, we decided to amalgamate the two classes at the United Church Indian Day School on the Caughnawaga Reserve and transfer the senior teacher of that school, Miss Daly, to Rama. Miss Daly has reported for duty at the Rama agency.\n\nSo many discouraging and depressing reports have been received recently from the principals of residential\nschools, that it is a real pleasure to be able to submit excerpts from a report that appears to be satisfactory in every sense. The Public School Inspector, Mr. A. F. Matthews, in his report on the Kamloops Residential School dated April 10, states:\n\n\"As stated in my previous report, the main building of the Kamloops Indian School provides adequate accommodation for the staff and the 256 pupils enrolled at the school. The building is clean, comfortably heated, well lighted, and well ventilated. The classrooms are large, bright and airy and contain adequate seating accommodation for all the pupils.\n\n\"The instruction carried on in the girls' classes is particularly effective. The teaching Sisters in charge of these classes have had professional training and successful experience in their work. Their pupils are alert and responsive and are making good progress. The training given in manual arts and in industrial activities, generally, is well conducted and practical in its application. The teachers in the boys' division are without professional training or previous experience in this work. Father O'Grady is finding it extremely difficult to obtain experienced, qualified teachers and is obliged to accept whatever he can obtain in the way of instructors.\n\n\"The various classrooms are fairly well supplied with equipment. However, science equipment is lacking for experimental and demonstration work in the upper grades of the school. Additional supplementary reading material, suited to the various grade levels, would be very helpful.\n\n\"The school grounds are large and well adapted for playing fields and are well equipped for recreational purposes. Under Father O'Grady's direction, improvements to the grounds are continuing. The farm in connection with the school appears to be well managed and conducted with business efficiency. This farm is well stocked with herds of beef and dairy cattle, horses, pigs, hens, etc., and is the main source of the food supply for the school. The produce of the orchard and small fruits and vegetables are canned in large quantities for use at the school.\n\n\"As reported last year, vocational training is receiving a large measure of attention at this school. In the case of the boys, one-half the school day is spent on vocational work and the other half in the classroom. The new manual training building, built by the boys, is well equipped for technical work and is a decided asset to the school equipment. The boys are now being trained under a competent vocational instructor in wood and machine work with definite objectives, such as the making of spinning wheels and other equipment for the school. Training of a practical nature is given also in shoemaking and repairing, dairy work, care of dairy animals, cattle and farm work generally. The girls are getting a good practical training in domestic arts and kindred subjects. They make their own uniforms and dresses and are proficient in knitting, fancy needlework, sewing and spinning. A very practical side of their training is the practice given them in cooking, fruit preserving and ordinary household duties. The dining rooms are clean and well cared for. There appears\nto be a plentiful supply of good, wholesome food. The tables are clean and artistically arranged.\n\nThe utmost difficulty has been experienced this year in securing certain equipment at a number of our schools. The teacher of the Caughnawaga R.C. Day School, in a letter dated April 14, states:\n\n\"This is a personal plea. As you are aware, the meter on our oil furnace at the teachers' residence burned out on March 19. Since that time we have been using wood to heat up the house, but with poor results. Yesterday and today have been miserable days, the temperature in the residence being between 54 and 58. Mr. Bush, the caretaker, is doing all he can, but we cannot ask him to be on the job 24 hours a day. Therefore, a Sister fills up the furnace every hour or so. Couldn't you possibly do something to help us out? We can assure you that we would appreciate heat, since all this year has been a year of suffering from lack of heat, either at the school or at the residence. I feel that the Sisters' health is suffering from this. Nearly all of them have had severe colds and sore throats and one at this date is suffering from double pneumonia. Please come to our rescue.\"\n\nThe records indicate that a requisition for a No. 36-72 AE Gurney steel steam heating boiler was sent forward to the Purchasing Division on January 17, 1944. Attached to this requisition was a quotation from the Gurney Foundry Company to Mr. Brisebois. It is my understanding that the Gurney Foundry Company, Limited, in a letter dated December 29, 1942, intimated that they were prepared to supply a boiler suitable for this school approximately one month after the receipt of the order.\n\nYou may remember that immediately following the opening of the Coqualeetsa Hospital the desirability of providing part-time instruction for the younger patients receiving treatment at the institution was carefully and sympathetically reviewed. It was finally decided to employ two fully qualified teachers at this hospital. We are now in receipt of the first inspector's report on the educational work provided for these patients. Public School Inspector H. MacKenzie, in his report dated April 1, 1944, states:\n\n\"A very great experiment in educational effort is being successfully carried on at the Coqualeetsa Indian Hospital. Children who are hospital cases and not permitted to leave their cots are being taught to make normal progress in the fundamental school subjects. Ordinary classroom procedure is of course precluded. Very thorough work is being done by Mrs. Robertson in Reading, Language Development, Arithmetic, Spelling and Writing and, so far as source material makes possible, in the Social Studies. Mrs. Robertson's teaching is characterized by very genuine kindness and sympathy as well as energy and enthusiasm. Miss Flynn, the junior teacher, displays a good knowledge of modern techniques of teaching and is moreover kindly, sympathetic, of buoyant manner and thoroughly energetic in the conduct of her work. . . . .\n\n\"To broaden the subject fields in teaching and to ensure greater progress and efficiency, I would recommend the following:\n\n1. Movable framed blackboard. Where cots are\nplaced along more than one wall, it is impossible for the children in the cots to see a fixed blackboard.\n\n2. (a) A much greater supply and variety of readers and textbooks;\n\n(b) A reasonable supply of textbooks on Health, Elementary Science, History and Geography;\n\n(c) Materials for manual and graphic arts;\n\n(d) Radio, so that these children may benefit from the Provincial Department of Education broadcasts in Music, Social Studies, Health and Science;\n\n(e) A gramophone with suitable records especially leading to music appreciation;\n\n3. Visual Aids. A motion picture machine, 16 mm projection film or one of the many smaller less expensive types is of vast assistance in classroom teaching. To these Indian children the visual appeal makes the strongest impression, and visual aids by means of one of the many types of machines would be exceptionally helpful in this splendid work you are carrying on at the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital.*\n\nThe following visitors called at this office during the month:\n\nRev.

I have in mind the purchase of the woodlot, a few weeks ago, at Oka, at a cost of $14,000; the erection of a school at the new Calstock Reserve, Ontario, at a cost of $6,500; and an addition to the Kettle Point School, Ontario. This addition is urgently needed to provide for the pupils formerly enrolled at the day school on the Stony Point Reserve, now leased to the military authorities. In addition to these expenditures, we have now under consideration the desirability of purchasing a reserve for the Brunswick Band of Indians in northern Ontario. However, no funds have been provided for this purchase and I am very doubtful if the amount can be provided from the welfare vote. Teachers' salaries will likely show an increase during the academic year ahead of us. As a matter of fact, we have now before us recommendations from two inspectors in Ontario, suggesting that we fix a minimum for our Indian day school teachers of $1,200.00 next year. Whether or not we fix such a minimum, I am convinced that unless salary increases comparable to the salaries now being paid in the public schools are paid by this Branch, it will be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to secure the number of teachers necessary to keep our schools in operation. A number of our teachers have already intimated that it is their intention to resign at the end of the present school year.\n\nI am bringing these matters to your attention early in the year, as I am naturally anxious to avoid any misunderstanding with respect to Welfare and Training expenditures toward the close of the present fiscal year. In the meantime, the greatest care will be exercised in working out our welfare program. As a matter of fact, we have already reduced our expenditures on the purchase of live stock, goats, pigs, etc., and the purchase of farm machinery, which is exceedingly difficult to secure. As against this, however, Mr. McCrimmon has recently taken into treaty six or seven hundred Indians at Rocky Mountain House, Alberta, and has already wired for the machinery necessary to start the members of this band in farming operations. It is just possible that the additional expenditure required to provide for the needs of this band during the present fiscal year will amount to\napproximately $8,000.00.\n\nA disturbing report on the loss of 64 head of cattle at the Alexander's Reserve, Edmonton Agency, has recently been received from Inspector Schmidt. The Inspector, in his report dated May 23, states:\n\n\"Farming Instructor Conway was sick in hospital at Edmonton and off duty entirely for 25 days during the months of December and January last. He is still not well and says he cannot now ride horse-back for any length of time. When this man was admitted to hospital I asked Indian Agent Laight to give Alexander's Reserve especial attention and asked him to make a very careful count of the live stock and to carefully check all departmental property.\"\n\nIt would be interesting to trace, if we could, the relationship between the farming instructor's absence from the reserve and the loss of the cattle. In addition to the inspector's reference to Mr. Conway's illness, there are other features of his report which are far from satisfactory. The Inspector states:\n\n\"Mr. Conway says that he thinks all the cattle are branded 'I.D.' The last round-up was made on October 15, 1942, but very few Indians - two or three only - were there to help with this work, and apparently all the cattle were not rounded up at that time. A proper round-up and check of the cattle has not been made during the past winter, 1943-44.\"\n\nAnyone familiar at all with the live stock industry in the Prairie Provinces and particularly in Alberta, realizes fully the importance of branding. When we are careless in this regard we are simply inviting disaster. The brand is the only means we have of identifying either departmentally-owned or Indian-owned cattle. Inspector Schmidt's reference to the fact that the census of cattle made in recent years may have been somewhat faulty is not wholly convincing. The evidence now before us certainly indicates that there has been gross neglect in the administration of affairs on this reserve, and the loss of 64 head of cattle, at an approximate value of $8,400.00, is certainly a serious blow at a time when we are putting forth a supreme effort to increase live stock on our western reserves. I have a feeling that the absence of the farming instructor from the reserve was in no small way responsible for the disappearance of the cattle. I suggest that serious consideration be given to the advisability of extending to our inspectors in the Prairie Provinces the right to make temporary appointments or to employ temporary help without reference to Ottawa, when farming instructors are absent from their reserves as the result of illness. The old contention that long distance farming invariably leads to bankruptcy is likely to be borne out in the case of our farming operations in Western Canada. You may remember that a few years ago we lost 160 head of cattle at Hobbema as the result of our delay in the appointment of the Indian agent now in charge at the agency.\n\nYou may remember the difficulty experienced by this Division a few years ago in securing from undertakers throughout Canada a reasonable rate for Indian burials. In this connection it is encouraging to learn, from a\nreport recently received from Indian Agent Bonnah that\nthe Indians of St. Regis, under his direction, have organ-\nized for the burial of Indians on reserves on a co-\noperative basis. The Agent in his report states:\n\n\"We have in active operation two Casket Lodges,\nviz.: Chenaill Casket Lodge and Cornwall Island Casket\nLodge. A trustworthy and aggressive member of the Band\naccepts the responsibility of raising the cash and looking\nafter the general business of the Lodge. At Cornwall\nIsland, Mr. Peter Thompson is the business manager; while\nin the Chenaill, Mr. Richard Sunday conducts the business\nfor the Chenaill District, St. Regis Village, St. Regis\nIsland and other islands in Lake St. Frances in the\nProvince of Quebec.\n\n\"Both Lodges are non-profit cooperative enter-\nprises, managed, owned and operated entirely by the Indians.\n\n\"Voluntary membership is accepted by both Lodges\nand at the death of a member of the Lodge, the living\nmembers contribute, what we might term, a death per capita\nassessment. In the case of the Chenaill Lodge, the death\nassessment is fifty cents (.50) for each active member.\nOn Cornwall Island (Ontario) where the membership is small,\nthe per capita is slightly higher; seldom exceeding seventy-\nfive cents (.75). The only time a levy is made is at the\ndeath of a member.\n\n\"In cases where a member has lapsed in his per\ncapita assessment for a period of from one to five years,\nand if death intervenes, his relatives have the privilege\nof paying up back assessments, thus putting the deceased\nin good standing as a participating member of the Lodge.\n\n\"A casket to the value of forty-five dollars\n($45.00) is supplied for each deceased member. In the case\nwhere a relative of the deceased desires a more decorative\ncasket, he or she is at liberty to purchase the same through\nany undertaker, and, in this event, a cash amount of $45.00\nis contributed by the Lodge. The overcharge is paid by the\ndeceased's relatives and is not the responsibility of the\nLodge.\n\n\"It must not be construed from the above that\nour Lodges purchase the finished casket through any outside\nfirm. In fact, it is very seldom that one of our Indians\nwould even consider a \"hand-me-down\" casket for one of their\ndeceased. As a result by far the greater majority of\ncaskets are made right on the reserve by Indian labour. It\nis the Lodge Manager's duty to see that sufficient dry\nlumber, outside, covering, satin lining and hardware are\non hand at all times for the completion of at least eight\nhigh quality caskets. Such materials are purchased whole-\nsale through reliable firms and, in accordance with true co-\noperative principles governing service organization, are\npaid for in cash when delivery is made.\n\n\"It is my hope that in the near future both our\nLodges can be united and an intensive membership campaign\nput over to obtain new members. Upon completion of this\ncampaign an accurate survey will be made and if found\nnecessary a request will be forwarded for a small advance\nto enable us to enroll these destitute cases, within\ncertain age groups, in lieu of departmental contribution\ntowards complete funeral costs for destitute Indian burials.\"\nMr. Christianson refers in his report on the Assiniboine Reserve, Qu'Appelle Agency, dated May 2, to a speech delivered by Dan Kennedy, a member of the Assiniboine Band. This speech was delivered at the time of Mr. Christianson's visit and is described by him as the highlight of the meeting. This Indian, Dan Kennedy, pointed out that his family, which consists of himself, his son and several sons-in-law, produced last year 12,000 bushels of grain. He claimed that he was not quite satisfied with this and that the members of his family should really have produced more. He reminded the Indians that a lot of them were out stocking and working at harvesting and threshing for the white man whereas the white man should be working for them. He declared that the Indians had a gold mine on their reserve right at their feet, for which they paid no taxes, and in addition, received education and medical care. This should enable the Indian, he declared, to produce cheaper than the white man, and he was convinced they could do it if they would only buck up.\n\nMr. Christianson adds: \"Naturally, some of the Indians did not like this lecture, but everything Dan Kennedy said was true. These Indians have a very fine reserve if they would only buckle in and take advantage of their heritage.\"\n\n**TRAINING:**\n\nMr. Phelan visited the Sarnia and Six Nations Agencies during the week ending Saturday May 27. While at Sarnia he undertook a survey of the educational facilities at Kettle Point and in his report recommends that a one-room addition be built to the Kettle Point School. Mr. Phelan intimates that this work can be undertaken during the vacation period by Indian labour at an approximate cost of $8,500.00. It is our intention to proceed with this work.\n\nWhile at Six Nations, Mr. Phelan discussed very fully with the recently appointed public school inspector, Mr. Webster, our educational program on the Six Nations Reserve. The Inspector expresses the view that it would be a mistake to provide high school instruction at our schools with the exception of Grade 9, that might be provided for a limited number of pupils. It is the Inspector's opinion that Indian pupils who pass Grade 8 should be encouraged and assisted to take up high school courses at the public, high and vocational schools in the adjoining white communities. A large proportion of the Six Nations pupils, in his judgment, should be attending high school at Brantford or the Brantford Vocational School. In the estimates of this year we have an additional $5,000 with which we hope to assist a larger number of the more promising pupils at Brantford and at a limited number of our other reserves. Mr. Phelan, in his report, states:\n\n\"Inspector Arneil, Superintendent Randle and myself arrived on the Six Nations Reserve at 9:30 on the morning of May 24. The children from the different schools on the reserve, together with the teachers, were already there and a lengthy program of competitive sports...\"\nwas started immediately. This program was under the direction of Mr. Joseph Hill, one of our teachers.\n\n\"The competitions were held on the fair grounds and we remained there until 5:30 in the evening.\n\n\"There was very keen competition in all the events on the program, and during the whole course of the day I heard no complaints from any of the competitors regarding any decision that was made.\n\n\"The holding of this sports day was inaugurated some years ago by Superintendent Randle and very great interest is apparently taken in it by all the Indians. Late in the afternoon there were approximately 2,000 people on the grounds. Refreshments were served in the Agricultural Hall at noon by the members of the Six Nations Council and their wives.\"\n\nEarly in the month Dr. Moore and I interviewed Mrs. Allan Stevenson, National Director, Nutritional Services, Canadian Red Cross Society, and discussed with her somewhat fully ways and means whereby the Red Cross Society might assist in a nutritional survey at a number of our residential schools. It was finally agreed that Mrs. Stevenson would suggest to the members of her committee at their annual meeting on Tuesday June 6 that the Red Cross in co-operation with the Department become responsible for a nutritional survey at six representative Indian residential schools, with the object of determining the adequacy of the diet now supplied, from a nutritional standpoint. It was agreed also that she would suggest to her committee that a survey be undertaken at an Indian day school with the object of determining the best ways and means of providing a noonday lunch without encroaching unduly on the time of the teaching pupils. We adjourned the discussion on the understanding that Mrs. Stevenson would report back to us in due course. In this connection it is somewhat encouraging to note, in Mr. Christianson's last report on the Assiniboine Day School, a reference to the health and general appearance of the children in attendance. Mr. Christianson states:\n\n\"The children all looked well and appeared to be well dressed. I was informed by the teacher, Miss F. Hodgson, that the vitamin biscuits that are being furnished now by the Department are real good. A mid-day meal is given at this school. The teacher told me several of the children who were below weight when they came in the fall had gained during the winter time.\"\n\nYou may remember that about a month or six weeks ago a very critical report on conditions at the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School was received at the office of the Minister. The matter was very thoroughly investigated by Inspector Hamilton, who expressed the view that the charges were groundless and that good work was being done at the institution. I am now in receipt of a report from the Public School Inspector, Mr. R. S. Burney, on this school. This report is on the whole satisfactory, indeed one might say, rather encouraging. In reporting on the senior room, the inspector states:\n\n\"Mrs. Douglas this year is teaching Grades 5, 6, 7 and 8. Mrs. Douglas is doing good work. She is greatly interested in her work and is quite enthusiastic that two\nof her pupils will be writing the Entrance examinations this year. Her pupils have been working at Health Posters, which are being done very neatly and carefully. The writing and art work is remarkably good. In my opinion it is the influence of Mrs. Douglas that produces such wonderful results in Art throughout this school.\n\n\"The pupils are making good progress in their studies. They speak and read well for Indian children and do well in Arithmetic. The pupils are clean, healthy and neatly dressed. There is every indication that they are being well looked after in this school. The classroom is clean and bright and the classroom material is put to good use. This year there are no men on the teaching staff. The manual training equipment is not being used because there is no teacher qualified to provide instruction in this work.\"\n\nI have referred to the Caradoc Reserve, Munsey, Ontario, on more than one occasion, as the problem reserve of the Dominion. In making this comment I had uppermost in my mind welfare matters such as relief, housing, sanitation, drainage, noxious weeds, etc. I am convinced that we are rapidly reaching a time when this reserve will also become recognized as the problem reserve of the Dominion from an educational standpoint. It is unnecessary to refer to the condition of the residential school, ordinarily known as the Mount Elgin Institute. This school remains one of our most acute fire hazards. It has long since outlived its usefulness. We have, however, a number of well built, fully modern day schools on the reserve. Inspector Gordon Young, in his last report on these, dated May 25, states:\n\n\"Unfortunately, the schools on this reserve have had a very discouraging experience. Mrs. Schuyler and your agent disagreed so entirely that Mrs. Schuyler retired in the fall. Mrs. Gillespie succeeded her but has also retired, leaving the River Settlement School without a teacher.\n\n\"Mrs. Batesman was in charge of the Bear Creek School during the fall. I called several times on this teacher as I visited public schools in the district and got the impression that she was doing good work. Family reasons, however, forced her retirement at Christmas and Mrs. Gould, the present teacher, was not secured as her successor for several months.\n\n\"These difficulties have been greatly aggravated by a scarcity of qualified teachers. Just now the salaries paid to Indian day school teachers are so much lower than those paid to teachers of public schools that I believe conditions on this reserve will be worse in September. I therefore recommend that salaries of Indian teachers be raised to a minimum of $1,200.00 per year at once. This should certainly be done in the case of Mr. Richardson and Miss Sibbald. In addition to this, the agent and the inspector should be directed to get together at once on this educational problem. Neither one alone can cope with the problem as it is at present, nor can the two of us do much if salaries are not increased.\"\n\nAn interesting item on a graduate of the Chapleau (Anglican) Residential School appeared in the Chapleau Post of April 29. This article reads:\n\n\"John Jeffries, a graduate of the St. John's Indian Residential School and Chapleau High School,\"\nspent last week end in town, visiting his people and the Indian school. He is on his way West to take up work for the summer as a Student Missionary. He has been invited to return to the work he started last summer and will soon be on his way to Loon Lake, Saskatchewan.\n\n\"He has completed his third year at Wycliffe College and passed in all his subjects this spring. Shortly before leaving college he was presented with a very nice Cassock and Surplice as the student chosen by his college as the one most helpful in the general student life of the College, especially in the spiritual side of college life. John Jeffries will be honoured as the boy chosen as one of two Indian boys in Canada to represent the Indians of Canada at the Coronation of King George VI.\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nReverend Canon L. A. Dixon, M.A., O.B.E., General Secretary, M.S.C.C., Toronto, Ont.; Rev. Dr. Townshend, Chancellor of the Diocese of Huron, London, Ont.\n\nReverend Dr. George Dorey, United Church Mission Board, Toronto, Ontario;\n\nDr. H. A. Alderwood, Secretary Indian & Eskimo Residential School Commission, R.S.C.C., Winnipeg, Manitoba;\n\nRev. Gilbert Thompson, Principal, Moose Fort Residential School, Moose Fort, Ont.\n\nMr. Close, Ration Board;\n\nMr. Cory, Legal Division, Mines & Resources;\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, June 30, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR McILL.\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended June 30, 1944.\n\nAn event of the month was the convention of so-called Indian Chiefs, held at Ottawa during the week ending June 10. This is the second attempt made within the last two year period by Jules Sioui, of Lorette, and Andrew Paull, of Vancouver, to organize an Indian convention at the Capital. Indian delegates to the convention of this year informed me that the attendance was greater than the attendance at any preceding convention.\n\nOne could put up a convincing argument, I feel, for the organization of Indians. Indians, like other racial and minority groups, in this age of organized effort, may require an organization for defense and for legitimate aggression. I have a feeling, however, indeed I might say a conviction, that the Indian organization, the officers of which were recently elected at Ottawa, can do little, if anything, in the interests of Indian advancement but can cause the Department endless trouble and annoyance. Indeed it can be said that we are already witnessing or experiencing certain repercussions from the last convention. A request comes for the payment of a tuition grant refused by the Department but now recommended by Jules Sioui. A letter reaches the Minister from the Port Arthur Agency, asking for fulfillment of his recent promises. Mr. Down, of the Caradoc Agency, visits the Department and expresses surprise that the Indians were granted official recognition, in view of the circular letter sent out to agents, repudiating the convention and the leaders who were attempting to organize it.\n\nI have learned from experience that it is not easy in a democracy to withhold recognition from certain groups, particularly certain racial groups. It would appear, however, that even a semblance of recognition tends to shatter the prestige and authority of our Indian agents. The Superintendent of United Church Missions in British Columbia, Mr. Bunt, who visited the Department a couple of months ago, informed me that the Native Brotherhood in that province had passed almost out of existence until the report appeared in the Press that Andrew Paull had been received by the Acting Minister at Ottawa. Immediately following this announcement, there was a regular stampede, so he informed me, on the part of the Indians to join the Association. Incidentally, he received a telegram from the Coast, while here, informing him that Andrew Paull had been\nsuspended from the organization, allegedly for the misappropriation of funds, and asking him to permit the Reverend Andrew Kelly (an Indian) to take over the secretoryship. Would it not be possible to come to an agreement whereby Indians would not be received by the Government unless accompanied by Indian agents or Indian inspectors? If this is considered impossible or inadvisable, I am definitely of the opinion that letters, denouncing these conventions and repudiating the leaders, should not be sent out.\n\nWhy are the Indians anxious to visit Ottawa? The answer to this question will largely depend on the Indian to whom the question is put. John Ioctocosis, of the Battleford Agency, a young and fairly intelligent Indian, who visited this Division, came to Ottawa, so he assured me, because Indian agents had lost all power and authority. The Indian agent, so he said, has not as much power or authority as the average Indian. I informed him that if Indian agents had lost all power and authority, the Indian had the right to appeal to the provincial inspector. \"But the provincial inspector,\" he replied, \"has no power; just talk.\" No Indian agent or inspector had exercised power or authority in Saskatchewan since the days of Commissioner Graham.\n\nChief Eagle Chief Mosquito, of the Battleford Agency, an elderly Indian, who could not speak English or at least who did not speak English, in his interview with me, was very much interested in a bronze Indian head that he observed on my desk. This Indian head has a hollow centre, designed for pen nibs. Gazing on this Indian head, he burst into uproarious laughter. When I enquired what he was laughing at, he replied, through the interpreter: \"Now I have discovered a perfect model of what the Department thinks of an Indian - just head - no brains!\" and while he said this he put his index finger into the cavity of the model. Then he was quite somber for a moment and again burst into laughter. When I enquired again for an explanation of the laughter, he replied: \"I am a very old man. I have only a few years to live. I should spend these years in search of a model that will illustrate what the Indian thinks of the Department. I know now what the Department thinks of the Indian\".\n\nWhatever the Government of Canada has accomplished for the Indians - and they appear to have accomplished a great deal - we appear to have failed to retain their confidence and esteem, if indeed the Government has ever enjoyed these. Suspicion of the Department on the part of the Indians was very much in evidence during the course of the interview. In this connection I recall to mind a statement made by Colonel Carnichael of the Pensions Board. He had visited a large number of Indian reserves in Canada, with the object of interviewing Indians in receipt of pensions. He was amazed, so he informed me, at the bitter, hostile attitude of the Indians to what he referred to as officialdom. Is it not possible that the first step in a worthwhile Indian welfare program might well be the creation of a measure of confidence in the consciousness of the Indian in what the Department is doing and attempting to do, particularly a measure of confidence in the authority and sincerity of the Indian agent?\nI found the requests of these Indians somewhat interesting. Tootoosis, who appeared to speak for the group, asked for the immediate establishment of what he referred to as non-religious Indian day schools. He was not opposed, so he said, to religion but it should not be forced down the throats of the Indians. He asked also for the establishment of a community hall in which Indian women could meet for the remodelling of clothing and for the discussion of timely topics. They had a Homemakers' Club on his reserve, that did good work. \"When we go to church,\" he stated, \"we walk along the road together; then we divide, each group going to his own particular church, but when the members of the Homemakers' Club go to a meeting, they all go to the same place and work together.\" It was his opinion that it would be a great pity if religion divided the Indians in the same way that it appears to have divided white men. \"But I am not opposed to religion,\" he concluded, laughingly, \"although it does not seem to have done the white man much good.\" I was anxious to learn from him where he got these progressive ideas. I had in mind ideas relating to the establishment of a community centre, the discussion of timely topics etc. He admitted that he had got a number of them from white farmers for whom he had worked. White farmers, he claimed, had been educating themselves and would soon take over the government of the provinces and ultimately the government of the whole country. My interview with this group left an impression on my mind that these Indians are thinking and should be provided at all times with intelligent, sane, progressive leadership.\n\nA number of interesting reports have recently been received from Mr. Morris, who is, as you know, engaged in an inspection of Indian agencies in the Prairie Provinces. In his report on the Grouard (R.C.) Residential School, dated May 14, Mr. Morris states:\n\n\"The children at this school are in good health and well clothed. Steam baths are installed and are very effective. Twelve senior girls, under the supervision of one of the Sisters, are living in a house apart from the other living quarters, where they are taught domestic science and housekeeping in a practical way\u2014cooking, cleaning, sewing, and in fact everything that is done in the average home. This is good work and training such as this should prove very beneficial to the girls after they leave school. Father Forcade's handicraft workshop is a rather substantial building of log construction. The women, many of whom are Indians, are becoming experts. The finished slippers, gloves, bags, etc., compare with the best manufactured anywhere. The Grouard Co-operative store occupies one end of the building and is doing a good business. This store is badly needed in this outlying, isolated district and will undoubtedly develop in time and become a real financial success.\"\n\nSomewhat discouraging reports have been received during the month on the condition of certain day and residential schools.\n\nCommissioner MacKay, in sending forward the public school inspector's report on the Cariboo Residential\nSchool (R.C.) states:\n\n\"It would appear that unless the Oblate Order, under whose auspices this school is operated, is in a position and is willing to provide a standard of accommodation in keeping with present day requirements, consideration should be given to the closing of this school and to the provision that might be made for the construction of Indian day schools to serve the needs of the Indian population.\"\n\nInspector McArthur, in his report on this school, states:\n\n\"As I reported last year, the buildings are old and are not well suited to present day needs. The classrooms are small and have insufficient and poorly placed window space. Electric lights partly compensate for inadequate natural lighting. During the year the old chapel was converted into a gymnasium and assembly hall. Although the room is rather small, it makes possible some physical education and provides space for assemblies during the winter months.\"\n\nInspector Hamilton, in his report on an inspection of the Pas Agency, dated June 15, states:\n\n\"Pine Bluff - Inspector recommends the construction of a new school and teacher's residence. The present buildings are built of logs and are in poor condition.\n\n\"Big Eddy - The teacher's residence at this school is badly constructed and small. After the war a new house should be built. The school itself is in poor condition.\n\n\"Shoal Lake - This school is of log construction and should be replaced after the war. The teacher's residence is in good condition.\n\n\"Red Earth - A new school should be erected here after the war. The teacher's house is in fair condition but requires repairs.\n\n\"Grand Rapids - This school is of log construction and small and is in poor condition. This building should be replaced just as soon as funds are available.\n\n\"Chemawawin - This school is past repair and should be replaced at the earliest possible date. The teacher's residence should be painted inside and out. The foundation requires repair.\"\n\nMr. Morris, in his report dated May 27 on the Ermineskin (R.C.) Residential School, Hobbema Agency, states:\n\n\"This is a very old school building, entirely unsuitable and in my opinion a dangerous fire hazard. If a fire were to break out in the middle of the night, with the temperature below zero, there is no doubt but that there would be a serious loss of life amongst the Sisters and the children. The place was spotlessly clean, however, and the remodelled...\"\nclothing and articles of handicraft were as good as anything yet seen on my trip\".\n\nMiss Bessie French, Principal of the Crosby Girls' School (United Church), Port Simpson, B.C., in a letter dated June 6, states:\n\n\"We are quite proud of ourselves this morning, for the mail has brought us word that we have been awarded the Oakesonton Challenge Cup for the highest standard of dramatic work achieved during the year. Of course, we are all delighted.\"\n\nThe following news excerpt is taken from the Vancouver Sun of May 29:\n\n\"Winners of the various prizes in the Victory Contest for 1944, sponsored by the Latham Foundation, have recently been announced. It is the godparent to many worthwhile enterprises for cultural progress and annually offers large sums of money and scholarships for art work of high merit. This year the Foundation launched its 16th poster contest for the Promotion of Humane Education.\n\n\"The animal poster contest is twofold in its purpose. It aims to encourage artistic proficiency and to inculcate in children everywhere the love and proper regard for animals and wild life. This group which is open to Grades 1 to 6 drew a great many entries from all over Canada and the United States. Four of the winners in this class were Canadians and two out of the four were Indian children living in British Columbia. Both winners are girls. Annie George is a pupil at the Indian day school at Penticton, and Helena Tiffin brings honour to the Christie Indian Residential School, on the west coast of Vancouver Island.\"\n\nCriticism is offered from time to time for our failure to encourage the brighter and more promising Indian pupils to take up high school and vocational studies. I attribute this criticism to the fact that the number of Indian pupils engaged in high school studies does not appear in the statistical tables published from year to year in our annual reports. Reports received from a number of residential school principals indicate that a fair proportion of the pupils proceed with high school studies in adjoining high schools and collegiate institutes. Canon Kinchin, in his report on the Shingwauk Residential School, states:\n\n\"Ten of our senior pupils have been attending either the collegiate institute or the technical school, where they have done good work. Two of them stand first in their respective classes. Twelve of this year's Grade VIII students are being recommended for Entrance and most of these are hoping to go down town to school next year.\"\n\nKatherine Middleton, in a recent article published in the Vancouver Province, refers to the attempts being made by the Department to establish goat herds at a number of northern reserves in British Columbia. Miss Middleton in this article states:\n\n\"Here is an interesting good-nutrition note, which is somewhat off the beaten path and has to do with goats and Indians on reserves.\n\nIt is -\n\"It is this way: Fresh goat's milk is strikingly similar in food value to cow's milk. Therefore, it offers a great deal in good nutrition. For this reason the goat is of particular value in remote spots where it is impossible to have a dairy cow but where the smaller and hardier goat will thrive. And so, out in British Columbia, the Indians on reserves are being encouraged to keep a goat, that is, two goats each to four families with children. This is being done through the Indian Department at Vanderhoof, B.C., and the first lot of goats have already been purchased. Some of the goats may find themselves as far as 100 miles north of this point, on the new Alaska highway.\n\n\"It seems that the Indians move back and forth for the fishing season and live in districts where it would not be possible to keep a cow. Not so with the goats, however, for there is usually lots of brush around the reserve as well as good greens for their food. And further, the Indian Department is arranging to take back half the increase in the goat population and these will be placed with more Indian families. This interesting story came to me through 'Country Life', a B.C. publication which briefly noted the news on this from 'The Blast' of Victoria, B.C. As one could expect, the latter publication has to do with the business of raising goats.\"\n\nIndian Agent W.P.B. Pugh, of Saddle Lake, Alberta, refers in his last report, dated June 2, to the recent visit of Mr. Morris to that agency. Mr. Pugh, in commenting on this visit, states:\n\n\"A very enjoyable and instructive visit was received from Mr. J. E. Morris. Mr. Morris was here from May 18 to May 26. To have an official visit the agency and to go over the ground with the agent is as good as a refresher course. While we had bad weather which threw some of our plans out of gear, I think Mr. Morris saw a very good cross section of the agency. I thoroughly enjoyed his visit and help and information I received from him and I can also say this for the rest of the staff. I can only express the hope that he may be able to visit this agency again and that other officials will also come. I hope also that I can make a success of some of the projects he is anxious to start, and I think I can see some action in the making already.\"\n\nAn urgent call was received a few days ago from the Extension Service of the Alberta Department of Agriculture, for a group of Indians in a number of our northern agencies of that province whose help appears to be urgently needed to harvest this year's crop. We have asked Inspector Schmidt to discuss this matter personally with the Head of the Extension Service. It would appear, from reports reaching this office that crop prospects in Alberta at this date are the best that they have been at any time in recent years.\n\nAn encouraging illustration of real co-operation between an Indian agent and an Indian day school teacher comes to us from the South Western Agency, New Brunswick. The Indian Agent, Mr. E. J. Whalen, in a letter dated June 15, states:\n\n\"The Kingsclear Reserve has a large supply of wild apple trees which could be made into a very profitable...\"\norchard, if the Indians could be persuaded to take an interest in these trees and graft and look after them, Miss Conners, the school teacher, and I got the children interested in grafting. During the season they put on 60 grafts. There are nearly all growing and I believe in a few years we will have the coming generation interested in grafting and looking after fruit trees. So far, however, the school children are the only ones interested, but if the graft survives the winter, I think the older people will become interested in this kind of work. We got the actions from the Dominion Experimental Farm and I was obliged to buy the materials and make our own grafting wax, as none of this was available in the area. I got the bees wax from the New Brunswick Beekeepers' Association, Inc., the tallow from the John Palmer Shoe Factory and the resin from the Neil Hardware store. I have enough wax to do another year.\"\n\nAn interesting item of information in this connection has also been received from Indian Agent R. L. Bonnah, of St. Regis. In his report dated June 2, he states:\n\nThree thousand strawberry plants were received and distributed amongst a few Indians. Ninety-four apple and cherry trees were received and placed with certain Indians who desire to eventually go into fruit farming. Three hundred and five apple and cherry trees were received and distributed amongst the various Women's Clubs. Four thousand five hundred forest tree nursery stock were received and placed amongst Indians to assist them in future years. I have made arrangements with the Quebec Forestry Branch to send an expert here to survey the ground in anticipation of an extensive reforestation program on the Quebec side of the river. I hope I will have the time to devote to this matter, but at the time of writing it is very doubtful.\"\n\nMr. Bonnah, in this report, refers also to an experiment in poultry-raising. \"Towards the close of the month,\" he states, \"all of the second batch of chickens were distributed through the Women's Clubs. It was interesting to note that many of the skeptics took advantage of the opportunity to obtain the allotted number of chickens before they finally disappeared. Of the 1300 purchased the total loss was 94. In general, the Women's Clubs appear to be functioning well and with a minimum of dissension\".\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nRev. C. A. Prinsau, Principal, Indian Res. School, Spanish;\nRev. George Dorsey, D.D., Assoc. Sec. United Church Mission Bd.;\nMrs. M. V. Thornton, Artist & Author, Vancouver, B.C.;\nMrs. Robertson, Canadian Mothercraft, Toronto;\nMr. H. J. Bastien, Indian Agent, Lorette, Que.;\nMr. G. W. Down, Indian Agent, Caradoc Agency, Ont.;\nMr. Perdue, Publicity Division.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, August 1, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCGILL,\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended July 31, 1944.\n\nWELFARE:\n\nA few days ago I received from the Treasury a statement of welfare expenditures for the period April 1 to June 30, 1944. This statement, you will note, shows an increase of $15,671.86 over the welfare expenditures for the corresponding period of last year. Increases have taken place in all the provinces with the exception of New Brunswick, Saskatchewan and the Yukon.\n\nIt would appear that we have reached a stage when welfare expenditures cannot be further reduced. In other words, we appear to have a group of aged, physically incapacitated Indians, unable to provide for themselves, and the number of these is not likely to show a reduction but rather a substantial increase during the years immediately ahead of us. It is significant that this increase has taken place despite the fact that very few expenditures have been made during the period for the purchase of agricultural implements or for agricultural operations. The fact that a charge is now made for discarded military clothing represents an increase of $5,482.04. It is unnecessary to remind you also that an increasingly large number of Indians are being discharged from sanatoria. These discharged Indians, many of whom have received one, two and three years' treatment, require additional care and are usually supplied, on the recommendation of the doctor, with additional rations, such as milk, eggs, fruit, etc. The number of such cases is also likely to increase steadily in the immediate future.\n\nIt is difficult to escape the feeling that we are witnessing at this time a steadily awakening interest in our Indian population and in the administration of Indian affairs. The number of requests received by this Division during the months of this year for Branch reports far exceeds the number of similar requests received at any time since I entered the Department, now almost 8 years ago. In addition to this, interviews with Members of Parliament and phone calls from Members of Parliament, seeking information, have been steadily multiplying. The convention of so-called Indian Chiefs at Ottawa a few weeks ago was immediately followed by the organization of an Indian Rights Association in the province of Alberta, and we are likely to hear a great deal from this organization in the days that lie ahead of us. It is significant that the secretary of the association is Mr. John Laurie, a high school principal, of Calgary. Mr.\nLaurie has already delivered a number of addresses on behalf of the Indians of Alberta. These addresses have received a great deal of publicity. It would appear that certain parties in Calgary have been circulating prominent citizens throughout the province on behalf of the Stony Indians. These Indians, under the chairmanship of Mr. Percy Gardner, of Pekisko, have engaged a firm of lawyers - Milligan and Millican, of Calgary, with the object of securing additional lands for the Stony Indians. In this connection you may remember that Mr. Christie also included, in the 1937-38 estimates an item for the purchase of additional lands for these Indians, but the item was later deleted, in the interests of economy. The correspondence on this matter would indicate that the outstanding need of the Stony Indians is land that will enable them to grow the vegetables necessary for their sustenance. The present lands - at least this is the contention - are subject to late frosts in the spring and early frosts in the fall, with the result that the production of vegetables is a very hazardous and uncertain undertaking.\n\nThe following excerpt has recently been taken from the \"Wampum\", a quarterly review of Mission work on the Indian reserves of Ontario:\n\n\"The Department of Indian Affairs can no longer hope to satisfy the Canadian people with the publication, annually, of brief tables of statistics. Such a report cannot possibly tell the story of what is being done. For their own defense at least they should make a publication which will give a fairer picture of the whole matter and invite discussion on these matters. Those in public positions no doubt become accustomed to criticism. The growing demand, however, for a study of our Indian work is a healthy sign of a new interest on the part of Canadians. If this demand is honestly met there will be a better day for us all.\"\n\nTwo conferences with representatives of the Penitentiaries Branch were held during the month. Penitentiaries throughout the Dominion are now prepared to supply this Branch with school desks, blankets, scribblers, chairs, and brooms. In addition to the repair of boots and the dyeing of discarded military clothing, they are also prepared to supply us with young Holstein bulls in the province of Ontario.\n\nWe have been experimenting during the last two or three year period, with a reasonable measure of success, in the purchase of baby chicks for distribution to reserves where Homemakers' Clubs have been organised. Indian Agent A. D. Moore, of Tyendinaga, in his report for July, states:\n\n\"Six hundred Barred Rock chicks were procured the first week of June and two breeder houses have been in operation, with fair prospects, and the losses to date in these birds have not been great. The Homemakers' Clubs held one meeting during June to report on their activities and to receive supplies of clothing.\"\n\nAn official letter, the subject matter of which is somewhat discouraging, was recently received from J. C. Kelley, of the War Assets Corporation. In this letter Mr. Kelley states:\n\n\"Mr. T. F. Murphy, Supt., Equipment and Supply Branch, Post Office Department, Ottawa. - Dear Sir: Reference is made to your memorandum of the 10th instant relative to the disposal of second hand wearing apparel to\nthe Indian Affairs Branch of the Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nAlthough this particular transaction will be cleared in the usual manner, it may be mentioned that subsequent surpluses must be listed with the Crown Assets Allocation Committee for directions and sale at the established rate to the Indian Affairs Branch. You are, therefore, requested to clarify the matter with the Chairman of the Crown Assets Allocation Committee and if continuing authority is granted, these items will then be available to the Indian Affairs Branch at a mutually agreed price.\n\n\"A copy of this letter is being forwarded to the Indian Affairs Branch for their information in the matter.\"\n\nIt would appear that the Indian Affairs Department and later the Indian Affairs Branch have been receiving, from the Post Office Department and from the R.C.M.P., discarded clothing without cost. The time at my disposal has not enabled me to search the records, but I have been informed that this clothing has been transferred without cost, year after year since Confederation. In future, however, a charge will be imposed. The imposition of this charge is to me somewhat disturbing at a time when our Indian agents appear to be overworked and a time when a number of agents are without competent clerical assistance. I may point out that this charge does not fit into our administrative setup for a number of reasons. The cost of relief and welfare is kept by agencies, with the result that blanket shipments of this clothing can no longer be sent forward to our inspectors, or if sent forward to our inspectors, an itemized account of the quantity allotted to each agency will have to be kept. In addition to this, the agent will be expected to sign the regular voucher, which is equivalent to an affidavit, stating that the clothing has been delivered at a particular reserve in good condition and that the charges are fair and reasonable. Few agents are prepared to sign such vouchers, unless they have actually inspected the clothing, with the result that this new policy is likely to entail a great deal of additional labour.\n\nThis is not all, however. In recent years a certain amount of this clothing was transferred to Indian residential schools, on the understanding that the senior girls would be given instruction in remodelling certain garments and in the production of clothing for the younger pupils. It will not be possible in the future to transfer this clothing to the schools unless a charge is made. Unfortunately, there are times when this clothing arrives in a mutilated and almost worthless condition. Should it arrive in this condition at a school, the Principal is likely to refuse delivery and will, in all probability, send it back to the centre from which it was shipped. As a matter of fact, Mr. Hives, Principal of the St. George's School at Lytton, who visited this office a few days ago, informed me that he was sending back a shipment of discarded clothing because on inspection it appeared to him to be so mutilated that it was practically worthless. This matter has been discussed very fully and in detail with Mr. Reaume and Mr. Vincent. Mr. Reaume has promised me that he would discuss the matter with the officials of the War Assets Allocation Committee in Montreal. I can only express the hope that\nofficialdom will display a semblance of sanity and revert to the original policy insofar as Post Office and R.C.M.P. clothing is concerned.\n\nMr. Morris has completed his inspection of the agencies in Alberta and Saskatchewan and left for Norway House, Manitoba, on July 24. Mr. N. J. McLeod, Indian Agent, Duck Lake, Sask., in a letter dated June 29, states:\n\n\"I wish to thank the Department officials at Ottawa for the opportunity of meeting and discussing the problems of Indian welfare with a representative direct from Ottawa. I can assure you his advice and guidance will be a great help to me in furthering Indian welfare.\"\n\nMr. McLeod is, as you know, one of our recently appointed agents and no doubt welcomed the opportunity afforded him to discuss administrative matters at his agency with Mr. Morris. In this connection I must express regret that the manual prepared for the guidance of agents has not yet been published. It is significant that we usually receive from an agent, immediately following his appointment, five or six times as many letters as are ordinarily received from an experienced agent. These letters invariably contain requests for information that might well be supplied in a manual. I have in mind the holiday periods at Indian day schools, the actual holidays allowed, Indian eligibility for relief, statement of relief rations, the responsibility for Indian burials, the repair of buildings and a number of such matters. In the absence of a dependable manual, misunderstandings are likely to arise. Mr. Fraser, for example, the recently appointed Indian agent for New Brunswick Northeastern Division, communicated with a member of Parliament for the district, protesting against the inadequacy of our relief rations and intimating that rations had been drastically reduced in 1946. As a matter of actual fact, no reduction took place in the ration list at that time. This list was, as you know, revised and substantially increased in May, 1946.\n\nTRAINING:\n\nI have referred on more than one occasion in my recent reports to the provision made by Provincial Governments and Public School Boards for substantial increases in teachers' salaries. I am now in receipt of a letter from the Department of Education of Nova Scotia, stating that the following provision has been made for additional payments to teachers in the province of Nova Scotia:\n\nINSTRUCTIONS CONCERNING SALARY INCREASES AUTHORIZED BY THE COUNCIL OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION\n\nMinute of the Council of Public Instruction of May 23, 1946.\n\nNo. 1. The request for increased grants recently presented to the government by the Nova Scotia Teachers' Union has been given long and careful consideration by the Council of Public Instruction, as a result of which it has been decided to make\nincreases for all classes of teachers according to the following schedule, beginning with the school year 1944-45:\n\n1. Teachers holding permanent or interim licenses of First Class or higher, and permanent licenses of Second or Third Class:\n   a. After 20 years of teaching service . . . . $300.\n   b. After 10 and up to the end of 20 years of teaching service . . . . . . . . . . 250.\n   c. After 5 and up to the end of 10 years of teaching service . . . . . . . . . . 200.\n   d. After 1 and up to the end of 5 years of teaching service . . . . . . . . . . 150.\n   e. In the first year of service . . . . . . 100.\n\n2. Graduates of the Normal College Summer School holding Temporary Second Class licenses, after the first year of service . . . . . . . . 100.\n\n3. Teachers holding permissive licenses, regardless of experience, and graduates of the Normal College Summer School holding Temporary Second Class licenses in the first year of service . . . . . . . . 50.\n\nThis salary schedule, which represents a substantial increase in the salaries paid in Nova Scotia until now, and other such salary schedules throughout the Dominion are likely to prove somewhat awkward and embarrassing if applied to Indian day school teachers. I have in mind the fact that increases such as these will enable the teacher to earn a salary considerably higher than the salaries paid to a number of our Indian agents. It is just possible that the time is rapidly approaching when a uniform salary schedule for Indian school teachers throughout the Dominion will become a necessity and when Indian day school teachers will become permanent Civil Servants.\n\nReports received at the end of the academic year suggest that an unusually large number of pupils in attendance at Indian day and residential schools this year passed their Entrance examinations. The Principal of the Shingwauk Indian Residential School, Sault Ste. Marie, states that 12 pupils completed their Entrance work at the end of the year and that of these 10 are likely to proceed with high school and vocational studies during the coming year.\n\nMr. F. L. Bonnah, Indian Agent, St. Regis, in a letter dated July 26, states:\n\n\"I am pleased to advise you that reports are now in concerning students of the Cornwall Island Schools who have successfully passed the Ontario Entrance examinations. At the West End School, under the direction of Mrs. Emily White, five pupils passed this examination. It is interesting to note that Inspector Mr. Thomas saw fit to recommend two of Mrs. White's pupils, the other three being successful on the written test. Considering the over-crowded conditions at this school and the handicaps under...\"\nwhich this teacher has had to work; I believe her success is well worthy of mention. This particular school, I note, has had an average attendance of approximately 45 pupils throughout the year.\n\nWe are experiencing the difficulty usually experienced at this season of the year in securing the number of teachers necessary for the operation of our Indian day schools. We have at this date 30 schools for which teachers have not been secured. Of this number, however, five remained without teachers during the last academic year, so that actually we require at this date 25 teachers to operate the same number of schools as were operated last year. We are in constant communication with the church authorities and it is our hope that a number of appointments will be made during the next two or three weeks.\n\nMr. Domett undertook an inspection of the Restigouche and Bersimis Schools during the early part of the month. You may remember that a great deal of difficulty was experienced by the Department in securing the fuel (coal) necessary to heat the Bersimis School, with the result that this school has been operated on a four-months basis during the last three years. This period of operation never proved wholly satisfactory, and a number of complaints reached the Department with respect to the waywardness and delinquency of children of school age. Mr. Domett, at the time of his visit, worked out an agreement whereby the school will operate for the period March 1 to November 30. This appears to be a fairly satisfactory solution to what had become a rather embarrassing and perplexing problem.\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nRev. Father G. Laviolette, O.M.I., Editor, Indian Missionary Record, Lebret, Sask.\n\nMr. G. W. Down, Indian Agent, Muncey, Ont.\n\nRev. H. Dunlop, O.M.I., Principal, Indian Residential School, Sechelt, B. C.\n\nRev. C. F. Hives, Principal, St. George's Residential School, Lytton, B. C.\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nMr. Wm. Bryce, M.P. for Selkirk, Man.\n\nDr. Trevor Lloyd, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, October 2, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCGILL\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended September 30, 1944.\n\nTRAINING & WELFARE\n\nMr. Phelan visited the Shubenacadie and Eskasoni Reserves during the two week period ending September 16. Mr. Phelan, while there, made arrangements with the Mother Superior of the Sisters of Charity for the employment of Sisters at the Shubenacadie Indian Day School. Mr. Phelan also interviewed Archbishop McNally at Halifax and Bishop Morrison at Antigonish. As the result of his interview with Bishop Morrison, it is altogether likely that a young Priest with special training in pedagogy and in the organization of co-operative societies will take charge of the reserve at Eskasoni.\n\nMr. Phelan, in his report on the Shubenacadie Residential School, states:\n\n\"I inspected this school very carefully on September 7 and found everything running smoothly.\n\n\"I must point out, however, that the Principal, Reverend Father J. W. Brown, is 64 years of age and, while he is quite vigorous, at the same time it is evident that the smooth operation is depending, to a large extent, upon the Reverend Sisters. During the course of an interview with Most Reverend J. T. McNally, Archbishop of Halifax, on September 5, I pointed out to him that, while we realize the difficulty of securing young men at the present time, owing to the number of Priests from this diocese in the Armed Forces, at the same time the Department hopes that conditions will make it possible for a young man to be secured in the near future.\n\n\"The pottery programme is proceeding very satisfactorily and a number of articles are being sold to people who call at the school. The Principal of the Province of Nova Scotia Technical College, at which pottery is taught, visits Shubenacadie frequently and is extremely interested in the work that is being done at our school. Due to the fact that several of the pupils who make pottery will eventually reside on the Shubenacadie Reserve, it is quite likely that this industry could be further encouraged on the reserve when the Sisters take charge of the day school. It is understood that one of the teachers who will go to the Shubenacadie Day School eventually will be able to continue the pottery training.\n\n\"You will recall that there was some correspondence regarding the purchase of additional land for the school and at the time the request was made to us we expressed the opinion that no additional land should be...\"\nsecured at the present time. I discussed this matter with the former Principal, Reverend J. P. Mackey, whom I met in Halifax on September 8, and he stated that there was approximately ten acres of land adjacent to the school which it would be desirable to purchase at some time, but that, as the school has done very well with the amount of land they have, he did not see any particular reason for making the purchase at the present time, other than it might stop someone else from securing it. In discussing the matter further with Father Brown, it appears that he has lately purchased five acres of this ten-acre plot. Evidently, following our refusal to purchase land, he purchased the five acres from his own funds. He paid $100 an acre for it, or a total of $500. He stated that if the Department wished to secure this from him at any time he was quite willing to transfer title to us for the amount just stated.\n\n\"There is a continuation school in the village of Shubenacadie, which is situated about a mile from the school, where instruction is given as far as Grade II. Pupils who take Grade II in the Nova Scotia schools can then proceed to Normal School for a year's training and obtain a teacher's certificate. A few years ago one of the pupils of the Shubenacadie School, James Prosper, resided at the Shubenacadie Residential School and took Grade II at the village school. He is now in the Air Force.\n\n\"It is interesting to know that 55 former pupils of the Shubenacadie Residential School are now in the Canadian Army. Of these three have been killed. One, Jimmy Prosper mentioned above, is in the Air Force and two ex-pupils are in the United States Navy.\n\n\"Both the main building and the outbuildings are in good condition, with the exception of the trouble that they have been having with the wall. Mr. Sparks, of the Surveys & Engineering Branch, who has been at Shubenacadie in connection with the erection of the new day school, made a careful inspection of the wall and roof and it is his opinion that the coping at the top of the walls should be fixed. He claims that if this is done the leaking of water into the building will be prevented. He had representatives of two firms inspect the roof with him and their quotations have not yet been received, but he estimated the expenditure would probably amount to $2000.00.\"\n\nIn discussing conditions on the reserve, particularly the housing program, Mr. Phelan states:\n\n\"I spent September 8 and 9 with the Indian Agent on this reserve. At the present time there are approximately 300 Indians residing on the reserve. Forty houses have been completed and of these eight were built during the current year. Five more cellars were being dug and this means that five more houses will be complete before the winter. A recent census of the reserve indicated that there are 107 children under the age of sixteen. Of course, all of these are not of school age at the present time. A visit to the day school which we are operating on the reserve until the new building is finished showed the names of 46 pupils on the register. As a result the old day school is extremely crowded and, pending the completion...\"\nof the new building, it may be necessary to have the younger children come for half a day and the older children for the other half.\n\n\"The erection of the new building is proceeding rather slowly. At the time of my visit on September 9 the foundation had been completed and it was hoped that the work would progress more quickly so that the walls would be erected and the roof on before the cold weather started. At the time I visited the reserve the well digger had not yet struck suitable water, although I phoned Mr. Buck today and was informed that suitable water had been secured at a depth of 327 feet.\n\n\"At the present time we are still operating schools on the Afton Reserve, Indian Cove Reserve and Millbrook Reserve. The Afton Reserve is just outside the town of Antigonish and Indian Agent Rice states that very few of the Indians residing here wish to move to the new reserve, as they can obtain work in Antigonish. The Indian Cove School is situated near Pictou Landing and the Millbrook School is located a short distance from Truro. In both cases the Indians are very reluctant to move to the new reserve for the same reason as I stated in regard to the Afton Reserve. I recommend that the Principal's residence and the teachers' residence be erected next year. As soon as the school is finished the other buildings will be required and they should be provided at the earliest possible date.\n\n\"On September 5 in Halifax I interviewed the Mother Superior of the Sisters of Charity. This is the same Order as we have in the Shubenacadie Residential School. They are willing to provide whatever number of qualified teachers we require. However, they have made all their appointments for the current academic year and, in view of the delay in erecting the building, it will not be possible for them to provide any Sisters until the academic year 1945-46. I pointed out that in addition to teaching the school it would be expected that the Sisters would take an active interest in Homemakers' Clubs on the reserve. The Mother Superior promised that they would do this and to assist us in this regard they would arrange to send one Sister who has had considerable experience in social service work. As you know, the salaries of teachers have been considerably increased in the white schools in Nova Scotia this year. It was agreed with the Mother Superior that the following salary rate would be suitable: $1200 a year for the Principal and $1000 a year for each assistant.\n\n\"This Order not only provides qualified teachers for schools, but also has a number of Sisters who are qualified nurses. One of their activities is the operation of a big hospital in Halifax. In the event of a nursing station being established on the new Shubenacadie Reserve, I feel very definitely that one of the Sisters should be employed. This would mean that both the teaching services and the nursing services would be in charge of the same Order and would no doubt give us beneficial results.\n\n\"At the present time, as you are aware, considerable employment is being given to the Indians in the erection of the new houses. I also noted that several had cultivated gardens during the past summer. A separate\nreport is being submitted regarding the lumber which is at present surplus to requirements.\n\nBoth the Indian Agent and the Clerk seem to be fully conversant with their duties and apparently are working hard to get everything into good shape.\n\nI have referred in my recent reports to the difficulty experienced in securing the number of fully qualified teachers necessary to operate our Indian day schools. In this connection it is gratifying to be able to state that despite the acute shortage of teachers existing throughout the Dominion, all our schools, with the exception of 20, are now in operation. A large number of the teachers now employed by the Department have been secured by the Churches. I am personally of the opinion that without the assistance of the Churches this year, a large number of our schools would have remained closed.\n\nAn unusually large number of residential school principals have resigned during the last two year period. These resignations, I note, have been due, in the majority of cases, to ill health. The change in the principalship of a residential school is a somewhat serious matter from the standpoint of effective departmental administration. An illustration of this is furnished by the experience we have recently had at the Norway House Residential School, operated by the United Church of Canada. The Principal of this school until the end of the last academic year was Mr. A. E. Caldwell. Mr. Caldwell has now been transferred to the Pacific Coast and is at present in charge of the Alberni Residential School. During his stay at Norway House, however, Mr. Caldwell was deeply interested in the organization of a goat herd. This interest was no doubt due, in part at least, to the health or nutritional surveys conducted in the Norway House district by Dr. Moore, Dr. Nisdall and Dr. Kruse. When the new principal, Mr. Jones, took over early in July, however, he immediately decided to sell or destroy the goat herd. Fortunately, Mr. Morris arrived at Norway House two weeks later and made arrangements whereby the goat herd at the school was purchased by the Department and placed under the supervision of Mr. Jackson, the recently appointed clerk at the agency. Mr. Morris, in his report, states:\n\n\"I arranged with the Principal of the School, Mr. Jones, to purchase the goat herd - 16 females at $14.00 each and 8 males at $10.00 each. This herd has been shamefully neglected; only three nannies were being milked and the milk was being fed to pigs, despite the fact that goats' milk is selling at $1.00 a quart in Montreal. Agent Lasenby was informed that he was to take over the herd and put it under the supervision of Mr. Jackson. The milk, for the time being, will be used at the hospital and milking nannies in future will be given out to Indian families with young children, who are unable to secure milk from local sources.\"\n\nReports recently reaching the Department indicate that a number of residential school principals are experiencing the utmost difficulty in recruiting the number of pupils for which per capita grants are allowed by the Department. Less than fifty per cent of the pupilage has been enrolled at the following schools: Mount Elgin Institute, Chapleau, Moose Factory and Albany.\n\nThe refusal on the part of Indians to return\ntheir children to school is due, no doubt, in the main, to existing economic conditions. Teen-age Indian boys and girls have been able to earn high wages at harvesting operations in the west and in the tobacco fields and fruit districts of Ontario, and the Indian parent looked upon any suggestion that the boys should return promptly to school as a suggestion that would result in an economic loss. The Churches have already protested somewhat vigorously against this condition and have already intimated that some re-adjustment will have to take place this year in the payment of our per capita grants if the Churches are to escape substantial deficits at the end of the year. I am personally of the opinion that a number of speeches delivered against residential schools during the last year or so are having a very adverse effect on the attendance of Indian pupils at these institutions. In fact, certain phrases from the speeches delivered have been quoted to me by Indians and by Indian parents. These pronouncements, they seem to think, justify them in refusing to send their children to these schools. It would appear that we are rapidly approaching a time when a definite decision will have to be reached with respect to residential schools throughout the Dominion. If they are not serving the purpose for which they were established, then in my judgment they should be either closed or remodelled or the program now in force modified to meet the more urgent needs of the Indian population.\n\nFor example, Mr. Doucet has spent a couple of years in working out a vocational program designed particularly for residential schools, and yet very few of our schools have either the classroom buildings or the equipment necessary to introduce this program.\n\nA particularly encouraging report on the work at the St. Regis Indian Day Schools was received from Indian Agent Bonnah. It would appear that the R.C.M.P. Constable and Mr. Bonnah have been devoting a great deal of time to the organization of a worthwhile program of athletics on the reserve. Mr. Bonnah, in his letter dated September 21, states\u2014\n\n\"It is more than gratifying to the writer and the local constable to feel that your office has put such weight behind our endeavour. As a result of our combined effort, the attendance at the Village School, so far, this week has increased by approximately 70%. The attendance at this school has never been what it should be, but, to make matters worse, the children, boys especially, had the habit of coming in late. Unless there is a very good reason to detain them now, they are on the dot when the bell rings. Otherwise they will be prevented from taking part in our sports program. Competitive sports are being arranged between the various schools. The idea behind this move was so that our children would get to know each other and perhaps by doing so would profit from the example of some of our better students. Strange as it may seem to your office, it is nevertheless a fact that many children from one school do not even know any of the children from another\".\n\nThe following -\nThe following visitors called at the office during the months\u2014\n\nReverend L. Beuglet, O.M.I., McLennan, Alberta;\n\nRight Rev. R. J. Renison, B.A., D.D., Bishop of Moosonee, Bishop's House, Cochrane, Ont.;\n\nRight Rev. W. A. Geddes, D.D., Yukon, N.W.T.\n\nRev. H. A.

Rose,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, November 1, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCGILL,\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Welfare and Training Service for the month ended October 31, 1944.\n\nIn my report of last month I referred to Mr. Phelan's visit to the Shubenacadie and Eskasoni Reserves in Nova Scotia. I submitted at that time a summary of the report made to me by Mr. Phelan, immediately following his visit.\n\nIn this report I am submitting a summary of certain recommendations made by Mr. Phelan, following his visit to the Eskasoni Reserve. His report on this reserve reads as follows:\n\n\"I spent September 11, 12 and 13 on this reserve. At the present time there are approximately 60 families on the reserve. The Indian Agent stated that there are approximately 75 additional families who may move to this reserve. The Agent considers that it is very doubtful if the Indians from the Sydney Reserve will move to Eskasoni. Practically all of these have reasonably good homes on the Sydney Reserve, which is located on the outskirts of the town of Sydney. In any event, they have permanent positions and practically all of them are able to provide for themselves. Some of them could be considered in prosperous circumstances. He mentioned particularly Ben Christian, who is a practical plumber and has his own business in Sydney. The Agent expressed the opinion that if these Sydney Indians did not move to Eskasoni they should be enfranchised.\n\n\"During the course of our conversation the Indian Agent stated that the Indians who have not yet removed to Eskasoni are expressing the opinion that if they remain where they are at present the Department will continue to provide the usual services. With this in their minds many of them are not anxious to move. The Indian Agent feels that unless we discontinue school services and medical services on these reserves it will be difficult, if not impossible, to have many of these Indians move to Eskasoni.\n\n\"At the present time the majority of the Indians living on the Eskasoni Reserve are being employed either in the sawmill or building the new houses. The Agent feels that immediate steps should be taken to plan some industry on the reserve at which the Indians could be employed. One plan the Agent has is to encourage native industries. In this connection he pointed out that as part of their post-war...\"\nprogramme the Provincial Government of Nova Scotia intends to feature the possibilities of the Bras D'Or Lakes for summer homes. As a consequence they hope to attract not only Canadians but Americans to this section of the province. If this plan goes through, the Agent thought that there would be a splendid market for Indian goods.\n\nUp to the present 20 houses have been completed, 14 houses partly completed, 4 barns completed, 2 outbuildings completed, 2 temporary buildings completed and 5 excavations for new houses are now ready. The attached rough sketch, prepared by the clerk at the Eskasoni Agency, gives an idea of where these buildings are located. The sawmill is operating and recently a machine for making shingles has been installed. In order to have the sawmill equipment complete the Agent requests that a planer and matcher be supplied. The only equipment of this kind available in Cape Breton could be secured for approximately $1,000, which the Agent considers is good value. There would be some slight additional expenditure for new belts, pulleys, etc. In answer to a query the Agent stated that the new houses being erected on the reserve cost approximately $1,000, which he considers is the minimum at which houses of this type could be erected at this particular place. It was evident that several Indians had cultivated gardens during the past summer, but there was no farming on an extensive scale. As you know, the reserve does not lend itself to this. There are several head of cattle on the reserve and a few horses.\n\nSCHOOL - The present school is located on the old section of the Eskasoni Reserve. It is simply a one-room building without basement. The majority of the desks are very antiquated and must have been supplied many years ago. I recommend that 24 medium sized chair desks be supplied. These can be used in the new school when it is erected. At the present time there is an enrolment of 48 pupils of whom 25 have to come approximately three miles and the Agent has arranged for driving them. The proposed site for the new school, Principal's residence and teachers' residence is adjacent to the church and to the present school. If the new school is erected on this site the driving of the children will have to be continued. I asked the Agent if it would not be possible to obtain a more central site, but he expressed the opinion that this was not feasible. However, it would appear that while the residence should be near the church for the convenience of the Sisters who will be in charge of the school, there is not the same necessity for having the school located at the same point. At the same time there is the question of supplying water and other services, and I presume the new site was selected with this in mind. I feel that this is a matter which should receive very careful consideration before we proceed with the erection of the new buildings. Whatever decision is made, I feel very definitely that immediate action should be taken. The policy of centralization is being retarded and might be ultimately ruined by the delay in the erection of the buildings required to provide an adequate educational programme. The Indian Agent considers, and I agree, that a definite date should be set for closing the outside schools. However, until the new school is provided, I cannot see how we can take definite action in this particular regard.\n\n\"At the -\n\"At the present time we are conducting the day school on the Sydney Reserve, which I have mentioned previously. The school on the Sydney Reserve is in reasonably good condition and in the event of our closing it, the Agent thought that arrangements could be made to have it taken over by the Catholic Church authorities, who are considering the erection of a new church in that district. Similarly, on the outskirts of the town of Sydney, we are also conducting schools on the Middle River and Woodsmag Reserve. Both of these buildings are very old and are of no value. The Salmon River School was built within the last few years and is a good building. The Agent considers that the neighbouring white section would be interested in obtaining it.\n\n\"I have already submitted a memorandum to you with reference to the appointment of Father Ross as Principal. This matter has already received attention. When in Antigonish I interviewed the Mother Superior of the Sisters of St. Martha. Tentative arrangements to secure the services of these teachers were previously made by Inspector Arnell. The Mother Superior seemed very anxious to co-operate with us and stated that if we advised her by April 1, 1945, regarding the number of Sisters we need, she would be able to supply them for the academic year 1945-46. It was agreed that the salary for the Principal would be $1,200 and for each assistant $1,000 per year. These are the same salaries as suggested for the Sisters at Shubenacadie. In this case, also, pointed out that the Sisters would be expected to take an active interest in Shubenacadie Clubs on the reserve. The Mother Superior promised that they would do this and provide a Sister who had experience in social service work. This Order also has Sisters who are qualified nurses. In the event of a nursing station being established on the Eskasoni Reserve, I feel that one of the Sisters should be employed. This would mean that both the teaching services and the nursing services would be in charge of the same Order. You will remember that I made the same recommendation in regard to the Shubenacadie Reserve.\n\n\"I had a very nice interview with Reverend A. R. MacDonald, Parish Priest of Christmas Island. Father MacDonald was formerly Agent for the Eskasoni Reserve and is familiar with conditions there during the past 25 years. He is extremely interested in our centralization programme and is giving both the Agent and clerk every possible assistance. Father MacDonald feels that the programme is proceeding satisfactorily, but, like many others, expressed the hope that we would provide the school at the earliest possible date. He was glad to know that Bishop Morrison had suggested Father Ross, whom Father MacDonald has known for many years.\"\n\nMay I direct your attention particularly to Mr. Phelan's reference to the school site. It was, to me, somewhat disturbing to learn that, should we proceed with construction on the site selected by Mr. Arnell and by Mr. Buck, it would be necessary to provide transportation for a number of Indian pupils whose homes would be three miles or more from the school. I decided to have Mr. Doucet,\nand a field man selected by the Department of Education for Nova Scotia undertook an educational survey of the reserve, with the object of selecting the best site or sites for the establishment of our Indian day schools. Mr. Doucet has now returned to Ottawa. He is of the opinion, and the representative of the Nova Scotia Department of Education agrees with him, that we should proceed with the construction of a four-room school on the present site. Both these officials are of the opinion that it will be necessary, in the not distant future, to construct an additional two-room or four-room school to meet the educational needs of the Indian population that will finally be established on this reserve. Mr. Doucet's report and findings, however, will not interfere in any way with our present building program. This matter has already been discussed very fully with Mr. Busk, and it has been decided to proceed with the construction of the school, together with the Principal's residence, residence for the Sisters and the other agency buildings, at the earliest possible date. I am attaching hereto the sketch map referred to by Mr. Phelan in his report, for your information.\n\nA somewhat discouraging report on conditions at the Mohawk Institute was received by Long Distance Telephone from Colonel Randle a few days ago. It would appear that as the result of carelessness the boiler at the school, which cost $5,500.00 including installation costs, was left without water and was injured to such an extent that it is no longer capable of functioning. I decided to send Mr. Phelan to Brantford to make a thorough enquiry into this accident. Mr. Phelan's report, which is dated October 30, 1944, reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Colonel Randle's letter of October 19 outlined what had happened. In interviewing the Principal, Reverend Mr. Snell, it was found that acting on the instructions of the man who is in charge of the furnace, one of the boys lowered the water in the boiler. Instead, however, of simply lowering the water, he left the tap open and went on to perform other duties and no one checked the matter. About 9:30 in the evening the building became cold and the stoker was started without anyone ascertaining if there was water in the boiler. As the pipes did not heat, the Principal again visited the boiler room and found the boiler ruined, due to the fact that there was no water in it and that the stoker had been running for over an hour.\n\n\"From my conversation with the Principal, it appears that the so-called engineer, the boys' master and even the Principal operate the stoker whenever they feel more heat is required. I pointed out to the Principal that this was very careless habit and issued instructions that in future the boiler should be operated by one or two persons and that when anyone was taking charge of the boiler he should take over from the one who had been handling it for the previous period. The Principal stated that he had engaged another man, whom he considered qualified. We discussed this man's qualifications and it is possible that he will be an improvement on the man who has been...\"\nemployed. However, I believe that it is advisable to instruct Colonel Randle to interview this man and make certain that he is capable.\n\n\"Following my visit to Brantford, I interviewed Mr. Briggs, the Chief Inspector of the Boiler Inspection Branch of the Department of Labour in Toronto. While the low pressure boiler we operate at Mohawk does not actually require a person holding a certificate, at the same time it would be preferable to have such a person, due to the fact that the hot water boiler is a high pressure one. In conversation with Mr. Briggs, he suggested that in the best interests of all parties concerned it would be preferable to secure a person holding at least fourth class papers. If the person engaged does not hold such papers, arrangements might be made to have him examined by the Board of Examiners of the Boiler Inspection Branch in Toronto.\"\n\nAccidents such as this appear to occur from time to time at residential schools, despite our best efforts to prevent them. Just how much they are due to dual control of these institutions, I am not in a position to state. I do feel, however, that I am not unfair when I state that the average clergyman is scarcely qualified to supervise the mechanical equipment supplied by the Government for the average residential school, nor is he equipped to pass judgment on the qualifications of the men who apply for positions such as the position of firemen and engineers, from time to time. Ordinarily, an accident such as this at Brantford would call for the dismissal of the principal. It so happens, however, that we had made arrangements whereby the present Principal, Mr. Snell, would retire at the end of the present academic year and that the school would be taken over and operated, not by the Church nor in co-operation with the Church, but by the Department, at that time. This is still my intention. In view of this decision, I am disposed to think that we should ask Colonel Randle to take a more active interest in the administration of the school and in the qualifications of the members of the staff until a new principal is appointed.\n\nA few weeks ago Dr. Moore and I interviewed Mrs. Allan Stevenson, National Director of the Red Cross Nutritional Services, with the object of having the Red Cross undertake a nutritional survey at a number of our Indian residential schools. Mrs. Stevenson and an associate undertook their first survey at the Chapleau (C.E.) Residential School early in October. Although Mrs. Stevenson's report has not yet reached us, she deemed it advisable to visit Ottawa a few days ago, to discuss with the officials here the work of her survey, which covered a period of ten days. A summary of Mrs. Stevenson's report will reach you in due course. In the meantime, it can be stated very definitely that conditions at the school are in no sense satisfactory. Mrs. Stevenson assured us that she went to the school, not expecting equipment comparable to the\nequipment in the average hospital. She was, however, not prepared for the lack of cleanliness in evidence everywhere in the school. She discovered that no arrangements whatever had been made to provide the pupils in attendance with foods containing Vitamin C - tomatoes, oranges, grapefruit, etc. She discovered that the method of cooking potatoes hours before they were actually consumed destroyed any Vitamin C that potatoes, when well cooked, usually contain. She discussed conditions at the school with the local medical health officer; with the Indian Agent, Mr. Matters; and with the dentist who was engaged in professional work at the school at the time of her visit. The dentist informed her that it had been his experience that Indian pupils entering the school with their teeth in good condition, for some reason or another that he could not explain, became victims of tooth disease in a comparatively short period of time. Mrs. Stevenson attributed this to lack of vitamin C in the diet and to the breakdown or collapse of the gum tissues. Mrs. Stevenson was particularly shocked at the provision, or lack of provision, made for the care and distribution of the milk supply at the school. The Principal, she said, seemed to feel that because they had an accredited herd, pasteurization or even cleanliness were no longer necessary. The result was that she and her assistant developed, during the first two or three days of the survey, a stomach infection, although both steadfastly refused to consume milk after the second day at the school.\n\nThe Chapleau School, operated by the Church of England, has always been looked upon as one of our reasonably efficient institutions. In fairness, it should be said, however, that the church authorities have been experiencing the utmost difficulty in securing the staff necessary to keep their school open and in operation during the last two or three year period, and yet there are certain features of the work at the school, discovered by Mrs. Stevenson, that are profoundly discouraging. For example, we have prepared, during the last three or four years, Vitamin Charts. These charts, together with circular letters, have been sent out from time to time to our Indian agents, our farming instructors, our residential school principals, and to our day school teachers. Mrs. Stevenson, prior to her visit to Chapleau, was supplied with copies of these charts. She told me quite emphatically that there was not a vestige of evidence anywhere at Chapleau to indicate that these charts had ever been read by the Principal or by the members of the staff. Mrs. Stevenson is personally of the opinion that the sending out of such charts is largely a waste of money and that if dietary practice at our schools is to be corrected, it will have to be corrected by personal contacts and by definite instruction. She expressed the opinion that the Red Cross might be willing to undertake a survey of an additional number of schools and might be prepared to provide dieticians to undertake Short Courses on Nutrition at each school, provided a satisfactory arrangement could be reached with this Department.\n\nEarly in the month, Mr. Phelan attended a conference of Indian day school teachers at the Oneida No. 1 School, Muncey, Ontario. Mr. Phelan, in his report, states:\n\n\"On October 15 I attended the ninth consecutive annual convention of the teachers in charge of the...\"\nfollowing Indian schools: Bear Creek, Back Settlement, River Settlement, Oneida No. 1, Oneida No. 2, Oneida No. 3, Moraviantown, St. Clair, Kettle Point, Walpole Island No. 1 and Walpole Island No. 2 Day Schools and Mount Elgin Residential School. The convention was held at the Oneida No. 1 School. In addition to the teachers mentioned, there were present Public School Inspectors Smith, Young and Pearson.\n\n\"A very interesting and constructive programme for the teachers had been prepared and each of the inspectors took a prominent part in the discussions, giving valuable advice to the teachers with reference to the proper handling of the various subjects of the curriculum. The President of the group this year is Mrs. Ross, the Principal of the Walpole Island No. 1 School. I answered several questions regarding the Department's policy and the method of supplying books, etc. At the request of the inspectors it was decided to supply copies of the new curriculum readers published by W. J. Gare and Company to all the schools which had delegates at this particular convention. The inspectors expressed the opinion that this series was one of the best in existence at the present time and was especially suitable for Indian schools.\n\n\"It will be interesting to you to know that all our schools in this particular section have co-operated in response to the request to gather milkweed tops for war purposes. A very large amount of this is being sent to the distributing point.\n\n\"At the conclusion of the meeting the President expressed the appreciation of the gathering that one of the Departmental officials had attended.\"\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month of October:\n\nReverend Canon Vale, Principal, Chapleau Indian Residential School, Chapleau, Ont.\n\nDr. L. D. Livingstone, Aklavit, N.W.T. (Fort Norman Agency)\n\nDr. J. H. Riepel, Agent & Medical Officer, Fort Resolution, N.W.T.\n\nMr. V. L. Stewart, Stewart-Lovick, Ltd., Southam Building, Calgary, Alta.\n\nMrs. Allan Stevenson, National Director, Red Cross Nutritional Services, and Miss McLeod.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training\nOttawa, December 6, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. DOUXET,\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Training Division for the month ended November 30, 1944.\n\nAt the request of the Indian Agent, Mr. Doucet spent November 16, 17 and 18 on the St. Regis Reserve, inspecting the different schools.\n\nFrom a report that Mr. Doucet has submitted, it is evident that the services of Miss Mary Terrance, teacher of the Chemail School, are not satisfactory and it will probably be necessary to make a change of teacher at this school.\n\nDue to the encouragement of Indian Agent Bonnah, a Boy Scout group has been organized. In regard to this Mr. Doucet writes:\n\n\"I was very much impressed with the enthusiasm displayed by the boys and girls in this group and I think this movement deserves every encouragement. For a club room they are using the building formerly used as a residence by the agent. On Halloween a party was organized by the personnel of the agency, with the result that no extra police supervision was necessary and no damage of any kind was done on the reserve.\"\n\nIn a report on his inspection of the Swan Lake School, in the Portage la Prairie Agency, on November 10, the Public School Inspector points out that the teachers had cultivated, during the past summer, a garden for the school and also individual gardens for the students. As a result he has in store from the school garden 15 bushels of potatoes, 140 lbs. of white beans, 250 lbs. of turnips, 40 lbs. of onions and a large box of carrots. These vegetables will be used during the winter to serve a midday lunch to the pupils.\n\nArrangements were recently completed for transferring a buck kid goat from the Norway House Agency to the Duck Lake Indian Residential School. The Principal of the latter school, in a letter dated November 6, states that the pupils are very much interested in raising goats.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\n- MR. ROY -\n\nThe following is a brief report on the work of the Welfare Division for the month of November.\n\nThe relief statement for the first seven months of the year to October show there is an increase totalling $87,450.21 over the same period last year. While this is a large increase it is not considered serious. Most of it can be accounted for as follows:\n\n(1) Additional quantities of foods were purchased for delivery to ration houses on the various reserves in the Prairie Provinces and N.S.T., to meet the increase in destitute Indians on a parity with the quantities set out on the normal ration list.\n\n(2) Extra fishing nets purchased for Northern Indians cost approximately $8,000 more than the previous year.\n\n(3) A very active building program is being presented to house Indian families being settled on the Eskimo and Subsistence Reserves in N.S.-amounting to approximately $50,000 to-date.\n\nI visited the Women's Clubs at Tyendinaga, Golden Lake and Maria Reserves where arrangements were completed for the women members to undertake the making of various articles of clothing, such as, pyjamas, nightgowns, dressing gowns, shirts, etc. This clothing is to be used for distribution from time to time to Indians receiving medical treatment in hospitals. The same will also be available to be issued to Indians when discharged from hospital. A considerable saving should result from this undertaking. The arrangement is that the women will buy the material, the women will supply the labour and the Board will pay for the labour, not in cash but in household needs, such as, dishes, kitchen utensils, paint, and similar articles of furniture, etc. This project as well as providing clothing at less cost to hospital patients will give instruction and proficient Indian women an opportunity to improve Indian homes and general living conditions. This experiment, if successful in the East, will be introduced later to other areas in Canada.\n\nIt was thought the women might have difficulty in making men's trousers so arrangements have been made to purchase 1,000 pairs, new, assorted sizes, from the Air Force. The cloth for the making of shirts and women's blouses is being obtained from the Department of Munitions and Supply.\nThe purchase of the right type of engines to operate the saw mill at Indian Lake in the Bow River Agency has taken up considerable time. The senior officials of the other Divisions were consulted to discover if they were undertaking any projects that might require the use of a heavy Canadian Tractor. As a result of these discussions however, information of Bow River has been written to for additional information, which when received, should make it possible to arrive at a satisfactory decision.\n\nMr. J. A. McLaughlin of the Justice Department visited the office and with Mr. Arnold present we discussed the various services that might be available to our Branch at the various Institutions across Canada. Mr. McLaughlin has since summarized the discussion, and set out in detail, the services that are available, and it is thought, this Branch will benefit a great deal by taking advantage of his suggestions.\n\nDuring the summer we took advantage of the opportunity of obtaining three pure bred Holstein bull calves from the Kingston Institution. These are excellent animals and will, undoubtedly, make a big improvement in the Indian milking cattle. We also availed ourselves of the opportunity of accepting sufficient vegetables - turnips, carrots, beets and potatoes, which were grown at the Institution at Collingwood and St. Vincent, as well as the care of the seeds of distinctive Indians at Golden Lake and St. Regis. These two reserves suffered from lack of moisture during the growing season and the vegetable crop was almost a complete failure.\n\nIndian Agent, Dr. T. J. Griford, advises:\n\n\"The last of the 500 ten gallon hogs were given out this Fall to Indian hunters. Most of those issued previously were still in good shape but the fish and game supply was so abundant that there was no difficulty in using all the hogs we had. Some were shipped to Factory River and East Main, where there is also a good fish run each Fall.\n\n\"It would be good policy to distribute more of these wooden hogs to scattered Bay Route and on reoccupation for them if funds are available for their purchase.\n\n\"This is a very interesting experiment - started two years ago and we are very happy to note that 200 - 10 gallon hogs or salt cured fish and game have been provided for winter food. It is considered that this experiment should be developed in other Agencies in the North as the freighting of cured meat and other foods in the isolated areas is very costly.\n\nArrangements were completed during November with officers of the Justice Branch to slaughter 300 Elk at Jasper Park - $750 at Banff Park and $8 at Factory - the meat to be slowly frozen and stored in packing houses and then distributed as rations to needy Indians. Inspector Schmidt has had considerable difficulty in obtaining cold storage space. He eventually was successful in obtaining space in the Burns and Company packing plant at Calgary, providing the meat is inspected by a qualified Veterinary Surgeon.\nDr. H. Barker, Veterinary Director General, Department of Agriculture, was interviewed by Dr. H. F. Lewis of the Burns Bros., Inspector Arnold and myself, and arrangements have been made whereby a Dominion Government Inspector will be available at the time of the slaughter to inspect the meat and see that it meets with the requirements of the Department of Agriculture for storage in the Burns plant.\n\nMr. W. B. Greenwood, Assistant Associate Director, National Selective Service, interviewed Inspector Arnold and myself, with respect to obtaining Indian labour for pulpwood operations. He stated that there was a serious labour shortage in the pulp industry in the area extending from Sarnia to Port Arthur. The Indian Agents in the area affected are being written to requesting that attention be drawn to this particular labour shortage with instructions to do everything possible to obtain Indian help. It was pointed out to Mr. Greenwood that there was little likelihood of obtaining a great number of volunteers, as practically every able-bodied Indian in this area is at present employed.\n\nJ. E. Harris,\nWELLS DIVISION.\nMemorandum-\n\nMr. Hoey -\n\nThe following is a brief report on the work of the Welfare Division for the month of December.\n\nThe statement from the Treasury Office for the first eight months ending November 30th shows that relief costs are up $96,999.95 as compared with the same period last year. The greatest increases are in Nova Scotia - $19,514.33, Quebec - $23,211.89, Manitoba - $19,428.38, and Alberta - $14,045.12.\n\nThe Nova Scotia increase is the result of the building programme in connection with centralization schemes in that province.\n\nThe Quebec increase is mainly Abitibi - approximately $5,000, Caughnawaga - $3,500, Maniwaki - $2,500 and Restigouche - $3,000. These increases at these agencies will be investigated.\n\nThe Norway House Agency in Manitoba shows the greatest increase totalling $14,305.82. Note, a quantity of pork had to be condemned. The cost of replacing it amounted to $1,400. Approximately $1,700 was required to purchase additional groceries for destitute Indians. A goat herd was purchased and a barn built to house them; hay and oats were bought at Winnipeg for winter feed; three sewing machines as well as a quantity of sewing material was supplied to the Cross Lake Homemakers' Clubs; an addition to the warehouse was built to properly store greater quantities of food, particularly bacon.\n\nThe increase in Alberta totals approximately $14,000. Lesser Slave Lake - approximate increase $4,800; Rocky Mountain House (a new agency) - $1,420 - purchase of harness, farm machinery, etc. The purchase of clothing in Alberta shows an increase of approximately $6,000 under the heading of general. Quantities of military clothing were made available at Calgary. This clothing was purchased and distributed to the various agencies.\n\nReports from the various Homemakers' Clubs show that they have all been very active. Great quantities of children's wearing apparel have been made up from discarded military clothing. The women are very interested in their work. The following is a letter which I received from Mrs. Mary Sinclair, President, of one of the three Homemakers' Clubs organized at Cross Lake at the time of my visit:\n\n\"We, the homemakers of Cross Lake wish to express our gratitude to you for the nice sewing machine you sent us. Also we have been very glad of the good counsel you gave us last summer.\"\nof how we might help our husbands in many ways. Yes, Mr. Morris, you are helping us a lot, and we thank you very much.\n\nAt this time I would like to tell you that the homemakers' clubs are going along fine, except that the building in which the sewing was to take place wasn't ready. So we Presidents made arrangements about this. We planned that our sewing time should be on Thursdays every week in the Presidents' homes for the time being till the house is built.\n\nThe soldiers' clothes you sent us were divided into three bundles, one for each club. The women ripped the clothes and made fine clothes out of them such as snow-suits, dresses, coats, etc.\n\nThe women seem to be very interested in their sewing like myself. My children are wearing clothes I made out of soldiers' clothes. Indeed, it is a great help for our husbands as there is no work around here and no fur at all this year, and hardly any price for fur. People live mostly on fishing by selling them to the Hudson's Bay Co. and the schools; so that means it will be hard this winter for us all.\n\nMy husband is Charlie Sinclair, Councillor. We have seven children, three of whom are at the school and four at home. I had a little baby girl last September. Her name is Jean Margaret. She will be three months old on the ninth of December.\n\nMr. Morris, one thing I wish to ask you which the homemakers' club does not understand. Will the government always help us by sending things like this; or will we have to help ourselves?\n\nAll the members in my group seem to remember you as they always mention your name at every sewing day while they are doing their sewing.\n\nWell, sir, I must conclude this letter now. As I conclude, I wish to express my best wishes to you for the coming New Year. May it bring all its richest blessings into your home. I am wishing you a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.\n\nGood bye, Mr. Morris.\n\n(Mrs.) Mary Sinclair,\nPresident,\nHomemakers' Club #2\n\nWe very seldom receive letters of thanks, but during the past year one other letter of appreciation was received from Mrs. Grant, who is convenor of the Homemakers' Clubs at Tyendinaga. We are particularly glad to know that the women are taking an active interest in improving their homes and living conditions on the reserves.\n\nThe reports and the results of farming and grazing in the Prairie Provinces show that on the whole the past summer has been an outstanding year. Great quantities of grains of all kinds have been harvested.\nThe cattle herds are showing increases and are commencing the winter in excellent health with plenty of hay and fodder available. The following is an excerpt from Indian Agent Young's report, dated December 15th:\n\nConditions are very good. The Indian farmers are doing well, due to good crops and good prices for their grain. A number of them have purchased machinery, horses, and have also repaired their houses.\n\nBesides doing this the Indian farmers have paid $1216.88 off their old seed grain debt since June, 1944. This seed grain debt was for seed received prior to 1937.\n\nThis office is particularly pleased with Mr. Young's action in collecting $1216.88, being payments on old seed grain debts. Mr. Young's ability to collect debts for seed grain prior to 1937 is to be commended as they have already been placed in the uncollectable column. Such debts are seldom collected. Mr. Young reports that a total of 58,228 bushels of grain were harvested in his agency this year - community farms 21,418, Indian farms 36,810. When the grain belonging to the two community farms is sold there undoubtedly will be a balance to their credit of approximately $20,000. The balance at present is $16,474.34.\n\nMrs. M. E. Watnier, special investigator of the Children's Aid Society, visited the office. Mrs. Watnier has been very helpful in dealing with several cases of young Indian girls who gave birth to illegitimate children.\n\nJ. E. Morris,\nWelfare Division.\nOttawa, January 31, 1945.\n\nMemorandum\u2014\n\n- Mr. Roy -\n\nThe following is a brief report on the work of the Welfare Division for the month of January.\n\nThe major portion of the month was taken up with the placing of our usual contract requisitions for groceries, ammunition, fishing supplies, etc.\n\nMr. W.F.B. Pugh, of the Saddle Lake Agency, spent some time in the Welfare Division during his visit to headquarters, and on leaving expressed himself as having a much clearer understanding of the Department's welfare policy, generally, and stated that as a result of his visit and having met headquarters staff he would resume his duties at the Saddle Lake Agency feeling his problems were understood here, and that he is more than a cog-in-a-wheel in which no one is particularly interested.\n\nMr. E. Lortiviore, of the Athabasca Agency, spent some time with Mr. Harris and the undersigned during his recent visit to Ottawa, and a $500.00 increase this year over last year's relief costs was discussed at some length. He pointed out that this increase is accounted for in improved health and living conditions amongst the Athabasca Indians and is reflected in reduced medical costs. Considering the Indian population of the Athabasca Agency the per capita increase in relief costs is not large. Mr. Lortiviore appears to have the question of Indian welfare well in hand in his agency.\n\nThe centralization scheme in Nova Scotia, which is responsible for increased relief costs in that Province, is progressing favorably and in his latest monthly report Mr. H. G. Ross, of Antigonish, advises that this year's quota of twenty new houses has been completed. I quote hereunder from the report referred to\u2014\n\n\"At the close of October we were engaged in operating the shingle mill and building Indian houses. With very little variation these two projects were carried through until our quota was reached. The shingle mill worked more or less steadily until December 20th and supplied all our shingles for 20 houses and we have over 25 ft on hand surplus to this year's requirements. The shingles were made at an approximate cost of $2.00 per thousand and represent a total output of 300 ft for the year.\n\nAt the end of December 16 houses were completed and two more all done but the finishing touches. Since the last report we brought three families from Truro and placed them in new homes on this reserve, and are making plans to bring three more immediately after the new year.\"\nDiscarded military clothing is still being purchased from the Department of National Defense - although in reduced quantities as compared with earlier in the year due to stores now being built up in many of the agencies. Some requisitions for clothing still continue to come in, however, and reports indicate that this clothing continues to be used to good advantage by the Indians receiving same. I again quote from Mr. R. G. Ross's recent report on the Subsistence agency:\n\n\"There is not a family on this and many other reserves who does not have this material in great quantity and make from it admirable clothing for the children. Recently we received here a number of sheepskin linings (the outer canvas coat was removed) and in very few days little Indian children blossomed out with new suits and parka hoods made from sheepskin and looking for all the world like pictures seen of little Eskimo children. The difficulty or impossibility of securing camera films prevent us from sending pictures to your office showing the multitude of uses made of this clothing.\"\n\nThe experiment referred to in Mr. Harris' report for November, regarding the making of pyjamas, nightgowns, dressing-gowns, etc., has been somewhat delayed due to difficulties in obtaining material, but most of this has now been received and some very creditable samples of women's skirts made from R.C.A.F. (R.B.) material by the homemaker's Club at Neepawa have been forwarded to this office by Mrs. J. B. Gordon, Indian Agent.\n\nConsiderable time was spent during January in an endeavor to arrange the purchase of a D-4 Caterpillar Tractor for the operation of the sawmill at Norway House. As you are aware, arrangements were made to ship the old Norway House mill and engine to Island Lake, via Hudson - Hudson Bay Railway - Illford - and winter tractor freight to Island Lake, leaving Norway House Monday, January 29th, by train. Our application has been submitted to the Director of Administration of Farm Construction Machinery and Municipal Service Equipment, of the Hartline Prices and Trade Board, but to date has not been approved. This must be given continued attention - even if it is necessary for some one from this office to personally interview Mr. L. R. Charlton, Director of the above mentioned Branch of the Hartline Prices and Trade Board, at Toronto. The logs are now being cut for next season's operations and cannot be left to rot for want of power to operate the mill. It is imperative to receive one of the tractors released in the next quota in order to take advantage of summer navigation on Lake Winnipeg.\n\nMr. J. A. McLoughlin, Acting Inspector of Penitentiaries, called at this office during the month and left blueprints of a folding chair and garden hand scuffle for the manufacture for this Branch at $2.75 for the former and $3.10 for the latter, P.O.R. Stoney Mountain Penitentiary, based on the present cost of material. Inspector McLoughlin, and Warden Campbell of the Stoney Mountain Penitentiary, interviewed our Inspector Hamilton in Winnipeg after having discussed this subject with officials of the Indian Affairs Branch here, and the items mentioned were suggested by Inspector Hamilton. The garden hand scuffle is designed from one Mr. Hamilton constructed for his own use and found very satisfactory for gardening operations. The advisability of purchasing a number of these scuffles for welfare purposes is now under consideration.\nIn closing I might state that nothing particularly out of the ordinary occurred during the month of January. Our regular quota of Indian visitors included two unmarried natives, a discharged soldier, and a number of one of the Homemakers' Clubs - all in need of guidance or assistance.\n\nC. Roberts,\nWelfare Division.\nOttawa, February 26, 1945.\n\nMemorandum\u2014\n\n- Mr. Roy -\n\nThe following is a report on the work of the Welfare Division for the month of February.\n\nDuring the month the Division was busy clearing up outstanding purchase orders and accountable advances in preparation for the end of the fiscal year.\n\nAgent Lariviere (Matane, Quebec) reports a poor fur hunt. This situation has been further complicated by an epidemic of scarlet fever at Chibougamau. The agent took immediate effective measures to deal with the situation, but the cost of these and the additional relief indicated will further increase relief costs in his agency where expenditures are already very high.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Haislip reporting on the Fortage in Prairie Agency, for the month of January, states that the general health of his Indians is good. Trapping has been only fair with prices for fur slightly lower than last year. The majority of his Indians are away from the reserves getting employed at fair prices. Fishing is steady - fair to good, with prices slightly improved over last month.\n\nThe Indian Agent of the Fox Agency, reporting on an inspection of the northern portion of his agency states:\n\n\"In every case I found conditions exceedingly bad. The fur catch has been very poor, in fact, a failure. In addition, the Province did not allow any beaver to be trapped this year, and this is the only animal the Indians have been able to trap in recent years.\n\nI had to buy relief at all places \u2014 so will have to purchase more supplies for the undersigned band to prevent starvation \u2014 Will you please send authority by telegram to spend $100.00 for clothes for relief of this (Belcourt House) Band.\"\n\nIn a later letter the agent stated that the band remaining food was Split Lake, not Belcourt House. Necessary expenditures have been authorised.\n\nInspector Hamilton, reporting on conditions in the Sioux Lookout Agency states that - on the whole the catch of fur has been varied as from fair to good. In the last category we find the Trout Lake Band, where good trappers have had incomes of from $800.00 to $1,500.00. Five Indians of this band chartered a plane at Christmas time to visit their children at the Sioux Lookout Residential School.\nSchool. The cost of this charter was $515.00. The general health of this agency is reported good. Mr. Swartman, the Indian Agent, reports that the total value of fish caught under commercial licenses in this agency, during 1944, amounted to $77,363.99. In the more remote parts of the agency approximately one-half of the value of the catch was consumed in air transportation charges.\n\nThe Indian Agent at Batshawan, Quebec, has reported that his Indians have had a very poor harvest this winter. So poor, in fact, that merchants who outfitted Indian families last fall have declined to grant further credit to these Indians. The branch was faced with the necessity of furnishing limited outfits, or authorizing relief allowances. The limited outfits were authorized.\n\nIn the spring of 1944 ten Indians from the Albany and Attawapiskat Bands were given employment by the Boardmore Leather Company of Acton, Ontario. Later on in the year, this number was increased to fifteen. A report has now been received from Dr. T. J. Orford, the local Indian Agent, stating that the Indians have given very satisfactory service. In fact, the Company has stated that some of the Indians are becoming experts and are being placed on piece-work where they can earn more pay. Thirteen of these Indians are paying for Victory Bonds on the installment purchase plan, while they make down payments amounting to over $300.00. One of these Indians had the misfortune to lose his hand in an accident. He was given hospital attention by the Compensation Board, while the Company kept him on the payroll. He has been fitted with an artificial hand and is now working at the installation centre. It is anticipated he will be able to work again soon and will receive a pension of $25.00 per month for life. Dr. Orford states - \"In my opinion these Indians have substantially contributed to the war effort with their labour and purchase of bonds. There appears to be complete satisfaction between them and their employers with no thought on the part of the firm towards exploiting them\".\n\nOne of our New Brunswick agents has requested authority to purchase seed potato requirements now. He points out that due to the increase of export orders for New Brunswick seed it will be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain requirements at a later date. He states that one order alone for seed, to the value of $300,000.00, has been received from the Government of France.\n\nThe following is an excerpt from a report received from Miss H. Foster, Indian Affairs Bureau, at Briftpille, Alberta, on the activities of the Samsonkwa Club at Briftpille:\n\n\"Smoker Creek: The Indians on this reserve are more settled than the Indians on the Briftpille reserve. Many of the men work on the railroad and the families live within easy reach of one another. There are a number of clean houses and several rather intelligent young women. To date six meetings have been held. The members discussed the building of a hall under the conditions suggested by you on your visit here last spring. In the meantime a log building (two-story) formerly the residence of Jean Baptiste Willier of Smoker Creek, is being used as a club hall. The women furnished the building and cleaned it thoroughly. It was decorated for a Christmas party held Dec. 24/44 for the community and their families. The decorations were made entirely by the Indian women of foil and crepe paper; stuffed toys and rag dolls were made by the younger girls. There was an exchange of gifts and \"Santa Claus\" was present...\"\nto entertain the children. A few samples of beading and some work in birch bark were on display. An invitation to attend the party was sent to the Indian Agent.\n\nPlans for regular meetings in the new year in the form of sewing bees were made. Miss Blanche Damerau has kindly consented to help with sewing and later with cooking lessons, both fields in which she excels.\n\nFrom the Health District papers, we choose a simple story for each meeting. This is told first in English and then in Cree. Scrap books are being kept\u2014one on sewing hints, cooking tips, and a third on general interest topics.\n\nThe women on the Sucker Creek reserve are enthusiastic and interested in the club. Although progress will be slow, over a period of time we may reach our objective.*\n\nOur housing programme in the Nova Scotia agencies continues. The Indians of the Shubenacadie Indian Reserve are busy with logging operations to provide the material to construct some forty new houses during 1945.\n\nDuring the month Captain G. Armstrong returned to work in the Welfare Division after an absence on leave of \u00bd years in the Canadian Active Army.\n\nG. Armstrong,\nWelfare Division.\nOttawa, March 12, 1945.\n\nMemorandum -\n\n- Acting Director -\n\nThe following is a report on the work of the Welfare Division for the month of March.\n\nDuring the month the Division has been very busy dealing with requests for seed, fencing, machinery, etc. The tempo of this work has been speeded up due to the early spring.\n\nThe Branch has received the following reports of conditions amongst the Indians from such widely scattered places as Fort Reliance, Saguenay Bay and Fort Churchill, on the west coast of Hudson's Bay. The Hudson's Bay Company doctor, at Fort Reliance, reports -\n\n\"Life at Reliance is still rolling along in the usual manner, not getting much excitement. Indians are having a fair few years, so far, which helps to keep things moving.\"\n\nThe Churchill Detachment of the R.C.M.P., reporting on winter patrol to Rock Lake, Manitoba, advises as follows -\n\n\"In regard to Indians I found them in fairly good condition. They have had a good few weeks this season and have plenty of outdoor meat and grease. It is reported that coloured farms are now being found in districts which previously have been occupied by the white man. Several supplies have been brought to the writer by the Indians. This kind which was until recently absolutely unknown in this area now seems to have entered the district in numbers.\"\n\nAt this time of the year the Branch receives many requests for seed, fertilizers, chickens, young pigs, fruit trees, etc., from the various agencies throughout the Dominion. In connection with our program for bettering the living conditions of our Indians many of these articles are supplied free of charge. Of course, we have to distinguish between a genuine desire for improvement and the desire to get something for nothing simply because it is being given away. Certain of our agencies such as Traditions, Canada, and Golden Lake, have used such assistance to good advantage while others like Saguenay went something for nothing, not even being prepared to say thank you for it. The following is an excerpt from the Saguenay agent's report on a distribution of young chickens last year -\n\n\"I may say that I concur with you (Mrs. Robertson - Indian) and would suggest that no chickens be given out this year as it should be borne in mind that the Indians of this reserve who are interested in raising poultry have for many years bought their own chickens and can always, with a few exceptions, find means to meet their own requirements.\n\nI regret the lack of interest taken by our Indians in this project...\"\nproject but I honestly cannot recommend an expenditure of money which in my opinion is not warranted by present economic circumstances nor by the actual attitude of the Indians.\n\nSince receiving the above report an Indian delegation from Goughnour visited the Branch advising us that they were prepared to accept a distribution of young pigs in lieu of chickens this year. Needless to say such distribution has not been authorized.\n\nIn direct contrast to the above I would like to quote from a report received from G. W. Horn, our Indian Agent at Haney, Ontario, dealing with his 1944 agricultural programme -\n\n\"I have in mind a story that might be told of three men who came to me early in the year requesting assistance in cash crop farming. All three are middle aged men with families and all, I was advised, with bad records. In fact I was told not to trust any one of them. I therefore talked to each one explaining my proposition and what he would be expected to do in return. With more or less verbal agreement I covered harvest, assisted in land preparation, supplied seed and followed through the growing season with occasional advice. Weather conditions appreciably reduced their crops but not their enthusiasm. Each one more than lived up to his part of the bargain; but my point was not so much the bargain as it was to re-establish three men, and by their own unsolicited expressions of thanks, I think I am able to claim success in that all three are on the way to establishment and looking forward to 1945 and better crops.\"\n\nMajor D. H. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, forwards us the following report on the success of the Nootka Indians of the West Coast Agency in attempting to better their economic conditions. It appears that these Indians have built a fleet valued in estimated cost to be the second of its kind on the coast to enable themselves by independent fishing and marketing, to improve their financial status. The cost of this fishing and marketing fleet was $32,000.00 plus $477.00 for a lighting plant. The fleet was located in Friendly Cove, and the Indians having no funds to build an approach and provide an anchor, asked departmental assistance. This was provided at a cost of $484.64.\n\nDuring the month officials of the Division attended a number of conferences on Family Allowances. A set of instructions for Registering Officials has been drawn up and has been approved by both the Deputy Minister of Mines and Resources and of National Health and Welfare. To date forms required to register eligible Indian families have not arrived at this office, but are expected in the course of the next few days.\n\nG. Armstrong,\nWelfare Division.\nOttawa, May 1, 1945.\n\nHonours\u2014\n\nActing Director\u2014\n\nThe following is a report on the work of the Welfare Division during the month of April.\n\nThe Division has been very busy during the month clearing the balance of 1944-45 vouchers for payments, dealing with Family Allowance problems and registrations, requisitioning advances for the new year, and erecting the necessary accommodations from the 1945-46 Vote. We are pleased to report that there has been no carry over of unpaid accounts from the past fiscal year.\n\nThe last fiscal year has been a year of progress in so far as our Indians are concerned. Reports received from Indian Agencies all across the Dominion indicate that the financial status of our Indians has been improved materially due to the unseasoned demand for casual labour with resultant high wages. Returns from fur are not as great as in the previous year but have been smaller and prices lower. Income from this source is estimated to be from 75% to 75% of that received last year.\n\nIncrease in Indian income from all sources has entailed increased work on the part of our agency. The following excerpt from a report received from the Indian Agent at Bella Coola can be duplicated in many of our agencies across the Dominion\u2014\n\nNearly 1000 Income Tax Returns are now in process of preparation and the pending registration of Indians for Family Allowances will keep the administrative end of the agency on the jump for some time. This office is also the business centre of the Bella Coola Indian Lumber mill which handles millions of dollars in timber as well as all the buying, selling of logs, and other problems incident to an annual logging operation of from one to two million feet of pulp, spruce, and cedar.\n\nOn many Indian Reserves throughout the Dominion enthusiastic Homemakers' Clubs have been established. These Clubs are furnishing the Indian women a new incentive to maintain better living conditions in their homes. In Eastern Ontario and Quebec the Homemakers' Clubs are making clothing for use in our hospitals. Spinning and weaving pyjamas; Golden Lake dressing gowns; St. Basil windbreakers; Hudson's Bay Company women's shirts. Small fruits, dry-cured chilis, garden seeds, etc., have been supplied free of charge to the Indian families in many parts of the Dominion.\nDuring the month the Indian Agent at St. Regis informed us that he had formed a Girl Guide Company of twenty Indian girls. He was authorized by the Branch to obtain Guide uniforms for these girls and to keep these uniforms as a Company store unless the Indian girls purchased their uniforms from him. In such cases the agent has been authorized to purchase as many additional uniforms as have been sold.\n\nThe Indian Agent at Fort Frances reported the formation of a Cadet Corps of twenty-eight boys at the residential school. These boys are being trained by Sgt. Willard Price of Fort Frances. The Agent has also reported the formation of a \"Teen age Gentlemen's Club\" at the residential school for boys and girls under the supervision of the Knights of Columbus. The agent stresses upon the necessity of constructing a community building and club-room on the reserve for the use of these young Indians.\n\nFrom time to time the Branch has to deal with the problems of delinquency among Indian girls and women. The attached report from Miss Ruth Atkinson, Welfare Worker, of Prince Rupert, British Columbia, outlines conditions better than we can describe them. There appears to be a common sense solution to the problem. Give the Indian Agent the powers of a magistrate that he may be able to adjudicate in paternity cases and deal with offenders in instances such as mentioned in this report.\n\n[Signature]\n\nG. Armstrong,\nWelfare Division.\nOttawa, January 2, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. ROE,\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Training Division for the month ended December 31, 1944.\n\nAs the result of an invitation received some weeks before, Mr. Doucet was authorized to visit the St. Regis Indian Reserve in New York State, adjoining our St. Regis Reserve, for the purpose of addressing a gathering of American Indian school teachers which was being held at Hogansburg. In connection with this visit, the following letter has been received from Mr. R. P. Daly, Supervising Principal of the St. Regis (American) Indian School:\n\n\"It was an inspiring pleasure to have you visit our school and speak to our parent-teacher association, December 5th. Everyone - children, parents, and teachers - spoke about your manner of kindness and tolerance. Your visit was just the 'tonic' that we needed to inspire us to greater co-operation in the solution of the problems that confront us.\n\n\"Canada has now given me two delightful experiences this year - my visit to your country and one of your reservations, and your recent visit to St. Regis. The good-will that I encountered both times makes me hopeful that our two countries may in time convince the world that international cooperation and confidence may be achieved in time of peace as well as in time of war.\n\n\"You have an open invitation to visit us often at your convenience.\"\n\nIt is also interesting to know that the American School has offered the use of their gymnasium several times a week, free of charge, if desired, by pupils attending our St. Regis Schools.\n\nOn October 27 the Deputy Minister was forwarded a report submitted by Dr. A. B. Simas, following his inspection of the Ekhorn Residential School. Since that time the authorities of the M. S. C. C. have appointed a new principal, in the person of Mr. R. E. Hilts, who was formerly assistant principal at the St. George's Indian Residential School. In a letter dated December 31, 1944, from the Reverend Dr. H. A. Alderwood, he states that he had just returned from an inspection of the Ekhorn School and the following statements were made in his letter:\n\n\"We have been delighted with the manner in which Mr. Hilts has tackled the problem. He seems to...\"\nhave been able to create a new spirit of loyalty and enthusiasm among the staff, and we are confident that the spirit of the school has been changed.\n\n\"Several staff changes have taken place and we are confident that the new workers secured will do much to raise the tone of the school. The new Farm Instructor has already made changes which have greatly increased the supply of milk and we have confidence that in the coming year he will be able to develop the garden along new lines.\n\n\"In the matter of food, Mr. Hiltz has declared that in the main supplies were adequate but he has made a number of changes aimed at improving variety and attractiveness. We have approved of his suggestion that bread should be secured from a bakery at Virden and are well satisfied that this is of high quality. The children are receiving less bread, more milk, more fruit and in general we feel confident that little fault could now be found with the food. The Principal has also introduced a better system in the serving of the meals so that the food is warm and appetising when received.\n\n\"In the matter of clothing Mr. Hiltz found that a number of items were short and this again was a result of bad management, as the Women's Auxiliary of our Missionary Society freely supplies adequate clothing when it is ordered by the school. Our records show that about $4,200.00 was spent in 1948 and this ought to have been adequate supplies. In the matter of bedding there was a real shortage in some linens and Mr. Hiltz has sent in very urgent requisitions which are now being filled. I understand that the Department has been securing new mattresses and we have on order a large quantity of blankets from the Army surplus supplies.\n\n\"The Principal has had all the lockers removed from the dormitories and these are being placed in the play-rooms. This will serve to increase the air space and we have instructed the Principal to keep his attendance down to 130 so that there may be no complaint of overcrowding.\n\n\"The Principal has thrown himself enthusiastically into the task of reviving organisations that had been allowed to lapse. Both the Scout troop and Guide Company are now functioning and a choir is being trained to give a candlelight service at Christmas time in the village church.\"\n\nWe have recently received copy of a letter written by the Director of the Canadian Red Cross Society to the teacher of the Chatlain Bay School, St. Regis Agency. This letter reads in part as follows:-\n\n\"Ever so many grateful thanks to you and your juniors for the wonderful box of work which we received this week. We are more than thrilled to get these big jumper dresses with blouses so well made, the other dresses both big and small, and all the dear little rompers, to say nothing of the beautifully made nighties and hospital bed jackets so daintily edged and trimmed. I am afraid we sent you a lot of difficult sewing and it was more than good of you to get it all finished. I am keeping a sample for an exhibit, and all the rest together with the sweet blue baby knitted jackets and booties will be sent overseas to help in\nthe clothing of children, boys and girls, in countries which have been under the Germans for so long.\"\n\nSchool Inspector Wilson, reporting on his inspection of the Morley Indian Residential School on November 2, 1944, commented on the work that is being done, as follows:\n\n\"Main attention was given to language and reading in the teaching observed at this time. Mrs. Lepard secured quite good results in seat assignments and a reasonable amount of oral response in her teaching and questioning periods. It is quite evident that, under the guidance being given here, the pupils are gaining mastery of simple fundamentals and co-operate with interest and enjoyment.\n\nHowever, the enrolment of this room and of the junior room also does not permit the more intimate personal contacts of teacher with individuals which are deemed essential for maximum results. This objective is attained in part with the senior girls and boys who attend school half days only. They devote part-time to farm or household duties.\n\nMr. Lepard, with the assistance of an Indian boy of about 18 years, instructs and supervises the senior boys in farm duties and workshop. Mrs. Lepard takes charge of the senior girls in household work. In this she has the assistance of two Indian girls, who appear to be giving needed help. One of them is gifted in music and she directs an orchestra. Each year as I visit the school I hear her group of eight or ten play a few selections on instruments which they have gathered together from various sources, and it is a delight to observe what has been accomplished.\"\n\nUpon a recommendation of Indian Superintendent Rundle, approval was granted for Mr. Joseph Hill, the principal of the Six Nations No. 11 School, to conduct a physical training and athletic program for teen-age Indians at the Six Nations superintendency. These classes are held in the agency community hall on Monday and Friday each week from 8 to 10 P.M. The program followed and the attendance for the month of November, 1944, was as follows:\n\n1. Physical Training,\n2. Tumbling and Pyramid Building,\n3. Stunt Games,\n4. Basketball, Volley Ball and Floor Hockey,\n5. Table Tennis.\n\nAttendances: November 4 - 70; 6 - 36; 10 - 68; 12 - 37; 17 - 65; 20 - 35; 24 - 77; 27 - 34.\n\nIn reporting on his inspection of the Bel Ground Day School, New Brunswick Northeastern Indian Agency, on\nthe clothing of children, boys and girls, in countries which have been under the Germans for so long.\"\n\nSchool Inspector Wilson, reporting on his inspection of the Morley Indian Residential School on November 2, 1944, commented on the work that is being done, as follows:\n\n\"Main attention was given to language and reading in the teaching observed at this time.

Report of Inspector Carten pn Eel Ground School, - re Marie Ginnish, former pupil, assisted in taking commercial course - now in Order office, Eatons' Mail Order Dept., Moncton.\nOttawa, February 2, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Training Division for the month ended January 31, 1945.\n\nThe first telegram received in the New Year conveyed information regarding the destruction by fire of the main building at the Wabasee Church of England Residential School. This is a church-owned building, erected many years ago. The incident was reported to the Minister's office in a memorandum dated January 8, 1945.\n\nThe month has been reasonably busy, including the checking of the December quarter returns from the residential schools. Quarterly returns from the different day schools have also been received during the month.\n\nFrom Inspector Hamilton's preliminary reports, regarding the work of the recently appointed Principal of the Elkhorn School, it is felt that we can expect better conditions to exist at this school in the future.\n\nIn his report for the month of January, 1945, on conditions in the Blackfoot Agency, Indian Agent Gooderham wrote as follows:\n\n\"School concerts were attended; Indian children are natural actors and actresses and these concerts are very interesting. The Crowfoot School pupils were exceptionally good and a special concert was put on for invited whites and was attended by prominent people as far away as Calgary. It must be mentioned here that the Sister Superior found good market for native handicraft in 1944. She got the mothers of pupils to do the work. She supplied most of the material and paid them well. Fifteen to twenty women earned from $10.00 to $20.00 per week for at least 10 months in a year. They did this in their spare time. The organization was splendid and the work good. All credit is due this Sister.\"\n\nSince the commencement of the current academic year, we have authorized several grants to enable Indian pupils to take advantage of higher education. In the majority of instances the reports received are extremely encouraging. In a letter from the teacher of the Cape Croker Indian Day School, she writes regarding two former pupils of her school as follows:\n\n\"You will be pleased to know that our friend Basil Johnston of Regiopolis College came first in his report at the Christmas exams.\n\n\"Ines Johnston, Stratford, is doing very well.\"\ntoo and Sister believes she can finish commercial course in June if she keeps on as she has been doing.\"\n\nDuring the month 425 letters were sent out from this Division. In future months it is hoped to supply additional information of a somewhat similar nature.\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during January:\n\nRev. F. O'Grady, Principal Indian Residential School, Kamloops, B.C.\n\nRev. C. A. Primeau, S.J., Principal, Indian Residential School, Spanish, Ont.\n\nMr. W.P.B. Pugh, Indian Agent, Saddle Lake, Alberta.\n\nMr. H. P. Ruddy, Indian Agent, Golden Lake, Ont.\n\nMr. H. Lariviere, Indian Agent, Abitibi Agency, Que.\n\nRev. George Dorey, D.D., Associate Secretary, Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, Toronto, Ont.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, March 5, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. ROY,\n\nI am submitting herewith a report of the activities of the Training Division for the month ended February 28, 1946.\n\nLast fall we supplied a loan for the St. Cyprian (C.E.) Indian Residential School (Pelican Indian Agency). Since that time the school has gone ahead with the project and results are more than encouraging. They secured the services of Mr. David Boyle, Principal of the Coleman School District No. 1416, to teach the children this craft. Mr. Boyle has had considerable experience and is doing first class work.\n\nA report from the Principal of the Fort Alexander (R.C.) Indian Residential School (Clansboyes Agency) indicates that the Cadet Corps which was formed there last year is extremely active and the training they are receiving is proving valuable for the boys belonging to the Corps.\n\nEarly in February we were advised by the Trusts and Guarantees Company, Limited, Calgary, that the late H. B. Penrose had made a bequest of $500.00 to the Stony Indians attending the Morley School the sum of $500.00 to provide Christmas presents and entertainment for them for the next five years after my decease.\" A cheque for the above amount has been received and has been deposited in the Trust Account of the Stony Indians. The Principal of the Morley Residential School has been so informed and instructed to apply the November first of 1945, 1946, 1947, 1948 and 1949 for $100.00, in order to enable him to carry out the terms of the bequest at Christmas time in each of the years mentioned.\n\nOn behalf of the Holy Angels' Residential School management, Fort Chipewyan, Inspector Schmidt forwarded several articles of clothing as samples of the work being done by the pupils in the use of discarded military clothing. It is quite evident that valuable use of discarded clothing can be made at many of our residential schools.\n\nSister Lebreux, one of the teachers at the Berens River R.C. Day School (Clansboyes Agency) has organized the Berens River Indian Women's War Service Club with a membership of 45 Indian women. These are divided into five different groups. The statement forwarded to\nus indicates that a considerable amount of clothing has been remade from discarded military supplies.\n\nWith one exception, the Wabasee C.B. School, the December quarter (1944) returns have been received from all the residential schools and the per capita grant due has been paid.\n\nLast Fall the Government Stationery Office requested that the requisitions from the residential schools for books and other classroom material for the academic year 1945-46 be forwarded to the Stationery Office as early as possible in 1945. Consequently all residential schools were requested to forward their requisitions early in January. The majority of these have been received and are going forward to the Government Stationery Office.\n\nA recent report from Mr. G. W. Down, Indian Agent, Cariboo Agency, reads as follows:\n\n\"The response of our Indian children to the War effort must not be overlooked. All schools have their own junior organizations and all have contributed regularly to War Savings Certificates. A recent check with the teachers reveals that a total of $345.18 in War Savings Stamps was purchased in 1944 and many children have fully paid certificates in their possession.\n\n\"The Milkwood Food collection during the Fall of 1944 received attention and 200 bags were collected for which $40.00 was received and distributed to the various schools according to the number of bags obtained.\"\n\nDuring the month 440 letters were sent out from this Division and 445 vouchers were passed for payment.\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during February:\n\nRight Rev. R. J. Benson, D.D., Bishop of Moosejaw;\nRev. L. Boulet, O.M.I., Administrator, Grouard Diocese, McLennan, Alberta;\nSt. Rev. Napoleon Labrie, C.J.M., Baie Comeau, Que.\nRev. H.A. Alderwood, Winnipeg, Man.\nRev. George Borey, D.D., United Church Home Mission Board, Toronto, Ont.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, April 2, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEY.\n\nI submit herewith a report of the activities of the Training Division for the month ended March 31, 1945.\n\nIndian Agent Orford had arranged a plane trip around Hudson's Bay for the month of March. We took advantage of this situation to have Mr. Doucet accompany him. Mr. Doucet left Ottawa on March 5 and was absent for three weeks. During that period he had an opportunity of visiting the two residential schools at Fort George, Que., the residential school and a day school at Albany, the residential school and the day school at Moosonee and the day school at Rupert's house. At each of the points mentioned he had the opportunity of staying sufficiently long to enable him to review the work that is being done and to make practical suggestions to the principals and teachers regarding improvement of the classroom work.\n\nA report received from the public school inspector on the Fort-a-la-Corne South Indian Day School, Duck Lake Agency, province of Sask., reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Ahenakew are to be complimented on their real interest in the welfare of the students. Mr. Ahenakew is supplying some instruction in manual training, while Mrs. Ahenakew instructs the girls in sewing, knitting and embroidering. This type of instruction is going to be of real practical value to the students.\"\n\nMr. Ahenakew is an Indian whom we assisted some years ago in taking a high school and teacher's training course.\n\nThe Inspector's report has been received on the Onion Lake R.C. Residential School. The following excerpts from that report are interesting:\n\n\"Written work was superior to that of many public schools. In particular I might mention letters which were written by all the pupils at my request.\n\n\"I found that writing was above the average and reading equal to that of pupils of foreign extraction in attendance at white schools.\"\n\nThe work done in the primary classroom of any school is extremely important, as it lays a firm foundation for the future development of the pupil.\nThe following excerpt from a report of the school inspector on the Thunderchild Residential School is consequently very encouraging:\n\n\"This is a progressive classroom for beginners in the study of English. The children live in a natural atmosphere and there is a harmony of ideas, action, colour, sound, etc., which encourages growth. The teacher tries to understand her pupils and they respond eagerly to her appeal. I am sure correct social and study habits are encouraged.\"\n\nThe Inspector also notes with pleasure the success that this school obtained in securing prizes for hand work at the Regina and Prince Albert Fairs.\n\nA few months ago we had several complaints regarding the Brandon Indian Residential School. The matter was discussed with the Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church, and the Reverend Mr. O. B. Strapp, formerly Principal of the Mount Elgin Residential School in Ontario, was transferred to Brandon as Principal. Subsequent to his taking charge of the school we arranged with Mr. Hamilton to make monthly inspections with a view to keeping a close check on this important school. In a letter dated March 10, Mr. Hamilton reports that conditions have improved at the school and that a much better feeling exists between the staff and the pupils.\n\nThe Indian Residential School conducted under the auspices of the M.S.C.C. at Fort George, Que., was destroyed by fire on January 26, 1943. The Anglican Church authorities have recently completed a new building at this point. It is 100 ft. 6 in. by 65 ft. The main floor has a 10 ft. ceiling and the second floor an 8 ft. ceiling. Building operations were commenced in the early summer of 1943 and the building was not finally completed until October, 1944. We allow per capita grant for 50 pupils.\n\nDuring the month 430 letters were sent out from this Division and 682 vouchers were passed for payment.\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during March:\n\nLt.-Col. E. P. Randle, Indian Superintendent, Brantford, Ont.\nMr. Colin Chisholm, Teacher, Cornwall Island East Indian Day School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, May 1, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEY,\n\nI submit herewith a report of the activities of the Training Division for the month ended April 30, 1945.\n\nIn a telegram dated April 9, Indian Agent Todd advised this Branch that the pump-house at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School had been destroyed by fire on April 8. Fortunately, all the equipment was saved, and arrangements were made to rebuild the pump-house at a cost of less than $200.00. The material was supplied by the Department and the work was done without cost to us, by the senior boys, under the direction of the manual training instructor.\n\nThe following extract is taken from the report of the provincial school inspector regarding his inspection, on March 22 and 23, 1945, of the Kamloops School, which is our largest Indian Residential School:\n\n\"There has been a marked improvement in the quality of the teaching in Divisions I and II, boys' classes, since my visit to the school in 1944. The teachers of these divisions are experienced teachers, who hold first class certificates in the province of Saskatchewan. The Sisters in charge of Divisions I and II, girls' classes, are also carrying on effective work. All four teachers are strongly interested in their work, keen and alert in their attitude towards modern teaching procedures, and eager to raise the standing of the classes under their charge. A more detailed account of the work carried on by these teachers will be found in the enclosed reports on the work of each.\n\n\"The school grounds are large and well adapted for recreational purposes. Father O'Grady is strongly interested in the development and beautification of the grounds about the buildings and is continuing to direct improvements in accordance with his original plans.\n\n\"The main school building, auditorium and gymnasium, manual training building, workshops, barns, etc., are well cared for and in good condition. The school plant is being further increased by the erection of a small sawmill, which, when completed, will give the male pupils an opportunity to gain valuable experience in this phase of manual training.\n\n\"Vocational training continues to receive a large measure of attention in this school, and facilities\nfor carrying on this work are being gradually extended. One half of each school day is given over to instruction in farm work and technical training, under competent instructors. The main objective of this instruction is to give a practical training in the duties essential to the carrying on of a well conducted farm, and in practical manual skills.\n\n\"The school is well organized and capably administered by Rev. Father O'Grady, the Principal. He is strongly interested in the well-being of the pupils under his charge, and is progressive, and receptive to new ideas in his attitude towards modern education. He has strengthened the teaching staff in a marked degree this year, particularly in the boys' divisions of the school, and has extended the facilities for training in manual and vocational training.\n\n\"The combined gymnasium and auditorium building is extensively used for recreational and physical training activities. At an evening entertainment given in this building during one evening of my visit to the school, the pupils staged an exhibition of physical exercises, vocal and instrumental music, etc. This programme was excellently presented and reflected much credit on the instructors who trained them in these various activities.\"\n\nIn a letter dated April 13, 1945, Indian Agent Daunt reported as follows in connection with the visit of Major Ian Eisenhardt, Federal Director of National Physical Fitness, to the St. Mary's Mission Residential School (New Westminster Indian Agency):\n\n\"I beg to report, for your information, that on April 11th, the St. Mary's Indian Residential School was visited by Major Ian Eisenhardt, Federal Director of National Physical Fitness. He was accompanied by Captain G. C. Darby, University of Saskatchewan, Mr. Ray Youmans, University of Manitoba, and Mr. Gerry Matheson, of the British Columbia Fitness Programme. I met these gentlemen at the school.\n\n\"The school teams put on a display which was declared by Major Eisenhardt to be the best he had seen in his tour of the country. He was also greatly impressed by the singing of both boys and girls.\n\n\"Major Eisenhardt stated it was his intention to call upon the Department, when he returns to Ottawa, around April 23rd, and seemed to be anxious to make arrangements, if possible, for a team from the school to give displays across Canada, during the coming summer. He will doubtless go fully into his re-actions when he visits you.\n\n\"A very fine luncheon was served to the party by the pupils of the school.\n\n\"There is no doubt that the performance put up by the pupils was a great credit to themselves, the school and the Department.\"\n\nIndian Agent -\nIndian Agent Matters (Chapleau Agency) advises that, at the Spring Convocation of Wycliffe College, John Jeffries, a member of the Mississaboe Cree Band, graduated and will eventually become a clergyman of the Church of England. Jeffries was formerly a pupil of the Chapleau Residential School.\n\nFire of unknown origin broke out in the boiler-room at the Ermineskin Residential School (Hobbema Indian Agency) just after midnight on April 16. Shortly after the outbreak of the fire, it was discovered and prompt action was taken to extinguish it. As a result of the work of the staff, assisted by the City of Wetaskiwin Fire Department, the fire was brought under control within an hour and a half. This is a church-owned school and the management carried insurance, which will cover the damage to the building. Commenting on the fire, Indian Agent Lewis writes:\n\n\"I give credit, for this fire not assuming greater proportions, to the fire drill, which is regularly practised in this school, where everyone has a job to do in case of fire, and knows how to do it, and the assistance cheerfully given by the Wetaskiwin Fire Department, to whom I would ask that the Department forward its thanks officially.\n\n\"I also wish to report that the school was evacuated in five minutes, each pupil parading in front of the school with a blanket. When it was found that there was no immediate danger, the older pupils got clothing and bedding from the dormitory and the girls and smaller boys were billeted in the Church for the night. The older boys were allowed back into the dormitory of the new wing after the fire was out.\"\n\nOn the recommendation of Mr. Stelfox, it was decided to approve the operation of a day school at Rocky Mountain House during the coming summer, and P.C. 2259 was obtained authorizing its establishment. Mr. Stelfox was so informed, but he now advises that in his opinion it is impossible to operate a school this year. However, he intends to make another attempt later in the year.\n\nAt the Coqualeetza Hospital we employ two teachers to give instruction to the children who are receiving treatment. The work done by the teachers has been most commendable and has elicited favourable comment from the inspector. It is interesting to know that two of the boys have recently won prizes in the Kiwanis Hobby Show for Boys. Both were first prizes - one for wood carving and the other for leather craft. This Hobby Show was held during the first week of April.\nDuring the month 511 letters were sent out from this Division and 703 vouchers were passed for payment.\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month of April:\n\nRight Rev. R. J. Renison, B.A., D.D.,\nBishop of Moosonee, Cochrane, Ont.\n\nPt. Rev. J. Trocellier, O.M.I.,\nFort Smith, N.W.T.\n\nMr. James E. Daly, Indian Agent, Charlottetown, P.E.I.\n\nMr. J. A.

HOEY,\n\nI submit herewith a report of the activities of the Training Division for the month ended May 31, 1945:\n\nIn a report recently received from Mr. D. S. Pitts, Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, Kenora Agency, he advises that the Boys' Band from that school made a splendid showing at the Manitoba Musical Festival, which is stated to be one of the largest in the British Empire. The Band won two competitions and was second in the third, with marks of 86, 85 and 85.\n\nUnder the direction of Dr. W. S. Barclay, Medical Superintendent of the Coqualeetza Hospital, the second annual Tuberculosis Poster Contest was carried out among the Indian schools in British Columbia. Eleven of the 13 residential schools competed and sent a total of 37 entries. The material was sent to approximately 44 of the day schools in the province, but it is disappointing to note that only 5 of these competed. The Department allowed an amount of $25.00 for prizes and the grand prize was won by Sally Prince, aged 15 - Grade 8 - from the Lejac Indian Residential School. It is intended to hold another contest this Fall.\n\nIn reporting on his inspection of the St. Mary's Mission Residential School, Mission City, British Columbia, on May 2 and 3, the public school inspector wrote in part as follows:\n\n\"Judging by all reasonable standards, the children are exceptionally well cared for. The treatment accorded them is not coldly professional. They are growing up in an environment of kindness, sympathy and understanding. To this treatment the pupils make a fine response, with genuine loyalty and affection towards their teachers and the Principal.\n\n\"In physical education high standards have been attained, the older boys displaying superior skill and training in the most advanced programme of physical education.\"\n\nA short time after receiving the above report, Major Ian Eisenhardt, National Director of Physical Fitness, Department of National Health and Welfare, visited the Branch and interviewed the Acting Director. Major Eisenhardt wrote as follows:\n\n\"I was very...\"\n\"I was very happy to meet you last Wednesday and it was a great relief to me to realize how much importance you attach to physical fitness; at least with you I did not have to do any selling job.\n\n\"Regarding our conversation pertaining to physical training among Indians, I would appreciate it very much if you would authorize me officially to take a film on the training in physical education, which is given at the St. Mary's Indian Residential School at Mission City, B.C.\n\n\"I would also appreciate your official authorization to take along on a proposed Trans-Canada tour of a British Columbia gymnastic team, a contingent of Indian boys from the above mentioned school.\n\n\"Both of the above proposed activities have the full approval of your local officials.\n\n\"The matter of considering Indians and Eskimos as the 10th province under the National Physical Fitness Act is one which I would appreciate very much, if you would discuss with your Minister and I, on my side, will take the question up with the Minister of National Health and Welfare, The Honourable Brooke Claxton, and as soon as one of us has any news regarding further developments, we should advise the other.\"\n\nWe are hopeful that the interest of Major Eisenhardt in our Indian children will result in the encouragement of physical training at our Indian schools.\n\nJudging from reports received, it is evident that domestic science is continuing to receive proper attention in the Indian day schools in the province of New Brunswick. The following report from the teacher of the Oromocto School gives a fair idea of the work being done:\n\n\"We received 20 yards of flannelette for the school and from this, the girls made their own underwear and underwear for the smaller pupils who are not able to sew. In all, 11 pairs of bloomers and 2 slips were made. From the scraps, quilt pieces were cut by the pupils and taken home to be made into quilts.\n\n\"Snow suits were made from Air Force uniforms, both for the smaller children at school and for those at home not of school age. This work was done by the women and supervised in the homes and 10 such suits were made.\n\n\"Army gloves were darned in school and given to pupils who needed them. In cases where the gloves were too badly worn to be darned, the hands were cut off and new bands knitted to the wrists. The school children, the women and the teacher supplied the yarn for this project, sometimes using yarn that had been ravelled from sweaters, etc.\n\n\"Sixteen suits of discarded Army underwear were cut down and made over to fit the boys. Besides this, the women on the reserve made over some of the underwear into suitable garments for themselves.\"\n\n- The following\nThe following interesting newspaper clipping comments on the work being done at the St. Mary's Day School, New Brunswick West Indian Agency:\n\n\"One day this week the teachers and pupils of St. Mary's School, Devon, had a most interesting display and sale. During the past three months this school has been under the supervision of two Sisters of Charity, and innovations and improvements have been introduced. The introduction of needlework and home economics has been received with enthusiasm both by the pupils and their parents. Practical instruction is given in all branches of home economics, including knitting, sewing, crocheting, weaving and care of the home.\"\n\nIn reporting on the Lejac Indian Residential School, Stuart Lake Indian Agency, province of British Columbia, the public school inspector writes:\n\n\"Administration is conscientious, efficient and constructive. The harmonious relationship among staff members is gratifying and is reflected in the general atmosphere of the institution. The tone is good and the pupils appear to be happy and healthy; compared with children in the Indian day schools I visit, they are fortunate in their environment.\n\n\"The unremitting direction, supervision and attention to detail of the Sister Superior are of an unusually high order and are worthy of the highest praise.\n\n\"The farm is an instructional and economic asset and, in view of acute labour problems, its operation reflects great credit on both management and staff.\n\n\"The health of pupils receives constant attention; recreational activities are well directed and supervised. In view of the long winter season, more space for indoor activities is needed.\n\n\"The general operation of the school shows a keen appreciation of native traits and needs and reflects great credit on the principal and staff.\"\n\nDuring the month 580 letters were sent out from this Division 472 vouchers were passed for payment.\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month of May:\n\n(Ms.)\n\nRight Rev.

Undoubtedly this will affect the income of many farmers, particularly in the Prairie Provinces as the average room to seed will be a great deal less than last year.\n\nThe live stock returns for Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, have all been received with the exception of the Sarcee and Pelican Agencies. Mr. McMillan, the agent at Peigan, submitted a count indicating that it was a book count. This was considered to be unsatisfactory and was returned to Inspector Schmidt for investigation and report. The total count for Manitoba was 2869, a decrease of 100 over the previous year. The count for Saskatchewan was 7410, an increase of 993 over the previous year. The Alberta returns will be reported when the count is completed.\n\nMr. O. Armstrong and myself inspected the Golden Lake Reserve for one day visiting the Indian homes and the school, as well as inspecting the goat herd and pasture. Every home with the exception of three was very clean and tidy. The Indian women have really done a fine job in cleaning up their yards and surroundings. A number of children were distributed to the members of the Homemakers' Club. Milking goats are being allotted to the different families. There are three poor families who, in spite of every effort to assist them, are still living in very dirty, unhealthy shacks. It is the intention of this Division to assist these three families in constructing new homes so that their children can be brought up in sanitary conditions. In my last month's report I advised that the women members of the Homemakers' Club had undertaken to care for Angus Fisher - blind and paralyzed during the night. Since this was for a period of two months, and I wish to report that at the time of our visit the home was splendidly clean; the windows and doors were properly screened and Angus was resting as comfortable as it was possible to make him. In fact, he could not receive better care or attention. The women deserve a great deal of credit for this very fine work as I feel that it made the old man much happier to be with his own people during the few remaining days of his life. Mr. Fisher died two days after our visit and the women have the satisfaction of knowing that they did their best to make him comfortable.\n\nThe school and grounds were in excellent condition. The grounds were nicely mowed and flower beds were set out. The school children themselves were very clean and well dressed. The school-teacher, Miss McNulty, is doing a very fine job. She likes her work...\nwork and the children co-operate with her. There is only one criticism to make if she is to be criticised, and that is that she keeps the class as late as 6 o'clock which often makes it very late when the youngsters return to their homes. This school is a credit to our branch and compares very favourably with the best country schools for white children in the district.\n\nThe goat herd now numbering approximately 90 is in excellent condition. Some of the goats are a little on the thin side but arrangements are being made to extend their pasture. Three animals are being shipped to start another herd in the Athabasca Agency. Arrangements are now being made to place a number of milking nannies in other agencies where milk is very necessary.\n\nA convention was held on June 19th, 20th and 21st, at the Tyendinaga Indian Reserve, of delegates from reserves in eastern Canada. There were two delegates from Golden Lake; five from Manitoulin; three from Coughswayage; seven from St. Regis, and three from Caradoc\u2014a total of 20. Practically all the members as well as the officers of the four clubs at Tyendinaga attended. The purpose of this meeting was for the women to become acquainted, discuss their problems, and learn as much as they could from the efforts of the other clubs. The meeting was held in the Council Hall. Dr. P. E. Moore, Mr. Armstrong and myself, attended the convention. Chief Clifford Maracle welcomed the out-of-town delegates and guests on behalf of the Tyendinaga Band.\n\nMrs. Minnie Brant, convenor of the Tyendinaga Homemakers' Clubs, read an address of welcome to the out-of-town delegates which reflected great credit on herself. She hoped that the delegates would make themselves completely at home and that they would enjoy their visit while at Tyendinaga. Dr. Moore, commenting afterwards, stated that she would grace any meeting. During the two days of my visit she was very busy among the delegates seeing that they were looked after properly and arranging teas and luncheons. In other words, she supervised the convention so that everything ran off smoothly.\n\nMr. Armstrong gave a short talk on the benefits of Family Allowances. He pointed out to the women that as leaders in their various reserves they should do everything humanly possible to assist in bettering the living conditions of their children. He gave them figures on the amount of money that could be distributed in each of their reserves if all the children between the ages of one and fifteen were registered. According to the last census, the total amount from Family Allowances at Caradoc will be\u2014$36,300.00; Golden Lake $5,100.00; Coughswayage $72,300.00; Manitoulin $15,120.00; St. Regis $31,740.00 and Tyendinaga $10,840.00. Mr. Armstrong emphasized that if the money is properly spent there should be a real improvement in the health and living conditions of all families.\n\nDr. Moore gave an illustrated lecture on diseases of the eyes, mouth, skin, etc. His lecture naturally would be very technical, but in simple language he told the women how many of these diseases could be avoided and cured by proper eating. That is, cooking the foods properly and preparing balanced diets for their families. He showed these women how it will be possible to purchase such foods as milk, greens, etc., with the money available from Family Allowances. I am of the opinion that the women benefited a great deal by his talk.\n\nDr. H. A. Boyce, physician for the Tyendinaga Reserve, gave a health talk and stressed the eating of proper foods, particularly milk for children.\n\nMr. T. L. Bonnabit.\nMr. T. L. Bemah's talk on why we should organize our Indian children went over in a big way. He has recently organized a Boy Scout Company as well as a Girl Guide Company at his agency. One of the representatives from St. Regis was Margaret Thomas, a fourteen-year-old patrol leader. She looked very lovely in her Girl Guide uniform. She gave a display of the uses made of the rope, which is part of her uniform, as well as giving a brief talk on the significance of the different badges, etc.\n\nMr. Bemah was very much in demand at rest periods by the delegates of the other clubs, who were anxious to learn all about his organizations so that similar ones could be introduced at their reserves.\n\nMiss N. Stoddart, school-teacher at the eastern Indians school, gave a talk on education. She stressed the necessity of children attending school regularly and requested that the women of the Homemakers' Clubs use their influence to encourage all mothers to see that their children attended school regularly and on time.\n\nMrs. Morris Mareale (Indian), school-teacher at the central school, also gave a short talk on the attendance of school children stating that she had been a student under Miss Stoddart and that she found her advice and encouragement very beneficial and that she always looked up to Miss Stoddart as her inspiration. Mrs. Mareale entertained the delegates by playing several piano selections.\n\nMrs. J. Levalley, of Golden Lake, gave a brief talk on the benefits derived on her reserve since the organization of the Homemakers' Club at Golden Lake. She stated that the Indians at Golden Lake had made more progress since the Homemakers' Club was formed four years ago than in the previous 25 years.\n\nMrs. Lewis McComber, President of the Coughswaga Homemakers' Club, stated that she was firmly convinced that if the women will continue the work of their organization and cooperate with the Indian Affairs Branch that great good can be accomplished on the reserves. She was loud in her praise of the assistance and encouragement they had received and stated that the Medical Division had already accomplished a great deal of good for them by providing medical services and hospitalization. Mrs. McComber has only one complaint to make and she asked that attention be given to the placing of key teachers in charge of the schools at Coughswaga at an early date. She stated that she knew there was a serious shortage of teachers but hoped that when this condition improved the Branch would give serious consideration to her suggestion.\n\nReverend H. Pringle, the Anglican Minister located on the reserve, gave a very interesting talk. He selected as his subject \"Homemakers' Clubs\" and then gave a brief explanation of each word emphasizing its meaning, describing what a house consisted of, showing the difference of makers of homes and breakers of homes, and the importance of clubbing together to accomplish the maximum of good for all. Mr. Pringle pointed out the fact that the several speakers had stressed the importance of the proper care and feeding of children, as well as how living conditions generally could be improved. He was of the opinion that these talks would be very beneficial and would assist the Indians in complying with the Family Allowances Act.\nThe delegates from each of the Homemakers' Clubs, represented, placed on display articles of remodelled clothing made by their members. This clothing displayed excellent workmanship and were all useful articles of wearing apparel. The more you see of the work that these women do the more you realize that they are experts with their hands. Prizes were given for the best samples. The judges were two women prominent in Red Cross work at Deseronto. Indian Agent A. D. Moore reports on the convention as follows:\n\nDuring the first two days of the gathering Departmental officials were present and are quite familiar with the proceedings that took place on those days. At 10:00 A.M. on June 21st, the Club members assembled at the home of the Reverend H. Pringle and spent one half hour viewing the display of hand paintings of Mr. Pringle at the Rectory. At 12:30 a party of forty proceeded to the R.C.A.F. Mohawk Airport where, by the kindness of the Commanding Officer, Group Captain Seacole, they were provided with guides, and for two hours, visited the main points of interest at the Airport. At 1:00 P.M., they assembled at the Council Hall for luncheon.\n\nWhile the delegates were at luncheon, I secured the services of Mrs. McCullough and Mrs. Dalanly, prominent Red Cross workers of Deseronto, and had them judge the articles that were on display. In view of the fact that these articles were made from many varieties of materials, and, as each Reserve had a magnificent display, it was decided that the judges would pick the best made articles from the whole display which were set aside as samples of the best workmanship, and, in doing so, some articles were taken from the exhibits of each and every Reserve. Mrs. McCullough addressed the gathering and explained the reasons for the choices made by the judges, and so that there would be no hard feelings among the delegates, we awarded each visiting delegation a prize of $5.00 from the $25.00 authorized, which pleased them very much. As Tyendinaga has four Clubs and each had a large display, I, in consultation with Mrs. Brent and the judges, thought they were worthy of consideration as the basis and gave them a prize of $2.50 for each club, or a total of $10.00, making total prize awards of $35.00. As the programme called for the awarding of prizes, I paid them in cash which pleased the delegates very much, and, if you consider the amount paid excessive or not authorized, you can deduct the same from the enclosed voucher.\n\nAfter the awarding of prizes the meeting was thrown open and, with my permission, the delegates exchanged a number of articles among themselves so that they could take home and display the work that was being done on other Reserves. After the mutual exchange of ideas for the betterment of the clubs, the meeting closed and the delegates packed their exhibits and were conveyed to their trains; some proceeding Thursday evening, while others remained over until Friday morning.\n\nMrs. Brent informs me that she hopes to have sufficient Club funds...\n\" Funds to pay all local accounts for transportation, board and lodgings, but if they run short, it may be necessary to ask the Department to pay a small amount, and this will be known definitely when all accounts are in and the local clubs meet.\n\nIn my opinion the gathering was a marked success and the delegates should carry back to their Reserves many new ideas and suggestions for the benefit of their peoples. The Tyendinaga Clubs are to be congratulated on the manner in which they organized and carried through their duties as hostesses and who were so instrumental in the success of the gathering, and I would suggest that a letter be sent by the Department to Mrs. Brent, her officers and members, to congratulate them for the services they rendered.\"\n\nIndian Agent Moore acted as Chairman for the convention. He was very constructive in his suggestions and guidance, and conducted the meeting in a most efficient manner.\n\nThe delegates were taken on a tour of the reserve visiting homes, the schools and the churches, and a special visit was made to the Mohawk R.C.A.F. Airport. Attached hereto is a programme which you will note made a very busy three days. It is my personal opinion that this meeting will prove very beneficial and the various delegates will go back to their reserves and report what they have learned to the members of their clubs. Undoubtedly if the women on these reserves will work together, and with the benefits to be derived from Family Allowances, they should accomplish a great deal of good both for themselves and their families. It is hoped that these meetings will become an annual affair. The delegation from St. Regis requested that the meeting next year be held on their reserve.\n\nAs you know Tyendinaga is noted for the large acreage put into growing crops for the canners such as beans, peas, tomatoes, etc. Last fall this reserve did a great deal of fall ploughing and the Indians hoped to increase their acreage this year. However, the late wet spring made this impossible. A great number of acres will not be planted at all. One Indian who had planted thirteen acres of tomatoes lost the whole crop two nights later by frost. He was unable to replant all of the crop, but he was successful in obtaining additional tomato plants to replace eight acres.\n\nIndian Agent Lariviere reports as follows on Phillip Palson, Turgan Lake, Quebec, who is to receive a number of goats this year from the Golden Lake herd:\n\n\" Above advised he secured a ploy. As on hay it was possible for him to pay for it cash on delivery. He demanded that I express his thanks to you for having protected him in case it would have been impossible for him to pay cash. He further demanded that I thank you for having furnished him with seeds. He stated that you may rest assured that he will look after the goats to the best of his ability, not only for his own benefit but to support movement to improve Indians, etc.\n\nTaking advantage of this letter - the Palson girl at school in Amos - I am informed, has done very well and desires to return.\n\nThese Palsons are no doubt exceptions and I believe through them much can be done to improve other Indians in their area. They have just ambitions and do things in an intelligent manner without ups and downs, like we usually find among the so-called intelligent Indians.\"\n\nMr. Lariviere...\nMr. Lariviere, in his report on the goats at Wawenapit in which he refers to the Indians as the 'Happy Potato Band' because of the number of bushels of potatoes they harvested last year, states:\n\nThis Band as found could be called, to better express their views, etc., 'Happy Potato Band'. The other very interesting part respects the goats. In spite of hard luck (the billy and the oldest and best nanny died during winter) they are getting from 4 goats, two young ones and two about 3 years old, 2 gallons of milk daily. Our trouble this year was \"I HAVE NO MILK\" can get some. See Gill \"the boss\" of the goat set up, he arranged things, in an Indian like manner and he certainly has created a STRONG DESIRE FOR MILK (even an aged Indian stated if he had THAT KIND OF MILK HE WOULD FEEL FINE). In his set up he takes care that his daughter does most of the work. His goats are getting to be very good milking them, too. The value of milk to them based on EVAPORATED MILK FROM STORE is about $6.00 per day. At the present time our boss said \"I THINK I WILL FLA IT TO GET 3 GALLONS MORE\". The reason why, he said, he was watching them very close because he found out some days they give more and he WANTS MORE.\n\nWith regard to the Wawenapit Band, Indian Agent Lariviere further reports that he arranged for twelve able-bodied men to be engaged as fire-rangers by the Province. Fifteen men were sent to Clova to work on special jobs for the Canadian International Paper Company. In each case he arranged that part of their wages was mailed to the Manager of the Hudson's Bay Company at Wawenapit to provide food and other necessities for their families. Further he had the doctor inoculate them for typhoid. He made a request to the Canadian International Paper Company that their foreman be requested to instruct the brighter Indians in the art of filling saws so that they would be more competent in pulpwood operations.\n\nRegarding the prosecution of Indians who commit acts of immorality particularly against the juveniles, the following is an excerpt from Inspector Osmundson's letter to the Superintendent of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at Regina. Note, this letter was written at the request of the Welfare Division:\n\nConfirming conversation in your office on the 9th instant and in view of the fact that many cases have gone unpunished when Indians have been charged under Section 301-2 of the Criminal Code, it is considered in order, and in fact advisable, that your Detachment men should lay charges under the Juvenile Delinquents Act in the future unless there is almost a certainty of conviction under Section 301-2 of the Criminal Code.\n\nIt has been found that in the very few cases where a conviction was secured on a charge of Carnal Knowledge the Penalty imposed was very light as Magistrates do not seem to consider that offences of this nature committed by Indians, upon Indians, are as serious as such offence committed by white people, upon white people. For this reason it is thought...\nthought that a conviction under the Juvenile Delinquents Act will serve the purpose. The defense usually put up when an Indian is charged under Section 301-2 of the Criminal Code is that the girl in question was not of previous chart character. Such a statement by the accused when charged under the Juvenile Delinquents Act will be no defense and implicate others, thereby resulting in their being charged the same.\n\nIndian Agent Mr. Sampson in his quarterly report states:\n\n\"Children of Unmarried Parents Act, No. 56,\n\nTwo cases under this Act were brought into court and both putative fathers were ordered to pay maintenance costs of the illegitimate children. Another case is under investigation now. The fathers in all cases are Indians.\"\n\nMr. Sampson advises re trapping and hunting:\n\n\"The winter's returns have been moderate and all trappers have had slightly increased revenue this season as lynx is becoming plentiful again and is currently bringing a good price. Wolves continue in great numbers and besides seriously depleting and driving moose from the country are attacking beaver and foxes. With the ban on poisoning these predators few are caught; trapping them requires patience, scrupulous care, and cleanliness which the Indian fails to give.\"\n\nIt is the intention of the Welfare Division to encourage Inspectors and Agents at every opportunity to prosecute and imprison Indians who are living in an immoral manner.\n\nFather J. E. Beaumet, O.M.I., of Val d'or, Quebec, visited the office. He was loud in his praise of the work being accomplished by Indian Agent Lariviere. He was curious to know what control, if any, would be exercised over the purchases made by Indians with Family Allowance cheques. When informed that certain foods would be supplied under the supervision of the Indian Agent he expressed pleasure, and he felt that if the proper foods were supplied it would be very beneficial in improving the health of children and families.\n\nJ. E. Morris,\nWelfare Division.\nOttawa, July 3, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEY,\n\nI submit herewith a report of the activities of the Training Division for the month ended June 30, 1945:\n\nDuring the past month there has been considerable correspondence with respect to repairs and equipment required at the various schools throughout Canada for the coming academic year.\n\nRequisitions for school material have been completed and forwarded to the Government Stationery Office.\n\nApproximately 560 letters have been sent out from the Division and 485 vouchers were passed for payment.\n\nMr. Doucet was absent for approximately three weeks, during which time he inspected the following Residential Schools: Spanish, Shingwauk Home, Fort William, Sioux Lookout, McIntosh and Fort Frances. He also inspected the Day Schools on the Garden River Reserve. The following are extracts from his report:\n\nSPANISH RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL:\n\n\"The pupils have been divided into two groups, the juniors and the seniors. This division takes place in the refectory and in the dormitories. The result has been very gratifying to the pupils and the management. The senior boys have their clubroom near the dormitory. This clubroom is under the management of the pupils themselves. They need not retire at the same time as the juniors but may do so at their own discretion. Their good behaviour entitles them to this privilege. This is a definite step in the training of responsibility.\n\n\"A great improvement is noticeable in the spirit of these pupils. This, I believe, is due in part to the divisions mentioned above and to the introduction of other activities such as organized games, skating parties, etc., in which both boys and girls participate. This is normal in the life of young people and with the proper supervision is bound to have a good result. In general, in all the schools there appears to be a better spirit among the children. This is attributed mostly to the application of the principles encouraged by the general convention at Winnipeg.\"\n\nSHINGWAUK\n\n\"The Girl Guides do good work. There is a happy spirit among the girls. They attend meetings with other girls in the city. They are left to manage these meetings...\"\nthemselves and participate in the work. This organization will leave its mark on the character of these children. It is unfortunate that the boys are not so well favoured. This is due, of course, to the lack of trained male help. It is hoped that this flaw in our schools may soon be remedied.\n\n\"A number of pupils attend the Sault Ste. Marie High School and are a credit to the school and to themselves. The Reverend Principal takes great pride in the achievements of his pupils and is doing a good job under difficult circumstances. Tests taken at this school will appear also at the end of this report.\"\n\n\"SIoux LOOKOUT\n\n\"The cadets are doing very commendable work. They take a great deal of pride in their appearance and carry on very efficiently. They deserve a great deal of credit. In order to train for their work they walk once a week five miles to get to Sioux Lookout, march drill, and practise there for a number of hours and then return to their school. They were preparing for a general inspection in Sioux Lookout and I had the pleasure of meeting the executives and the various training officers. These people expressed their satisfaction with the work done by the Sioux Lookout Indian Cadets.\"\n\n\"RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n\"Two main points have struck me on this inspection trip:\n\n1. The eagerness of the teachers in seeking information and endeavouring to improve their methods.\n\n2. The handicap under which teachers who have not been able to get any professional training are working.\n\n\"It has also struck me that in the schools that I have visited for the second time there is a great improvement in the spirit of the children. There is more happiness, more satisfaction,- In other words, greater family spirit. It is rather encouraging to notice that some of the suggestions that have been carried out seem to be bringing results.\n\n\"Some method will have to be found to give teachers who wish to work in Indian schools a special training that will fit them to teach Indian children. As mentioned in my previous reports, the teacher is the keystone for the complete structure of Indian education. This, I wish to add, to my mind, is of primary importance.\"\nPublic School Inspector McBurney, in reporting on his inspection of the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School, Sioux Lookout, Ontario, wrote as follows:\n\n\"This is the first time it has been my privilege to visit Miss Atwater. She comes to this school with many years' successful experience at Gordon Indian School. There is every indication that she is doing very commendable work. Her pupils are making good progress in their studies. They show good interest in their work and their books are neatly kept. Peter Hill, in Grade VIII, is an Entrance candidate this year.\n\n\"The classroom is clean and bright and the classroom material is put to good use. The Register is carefully kept.\n\n\"At the time of my visit it was a privilege to meet Mr. Doucet, Inspector from the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa. I heard him speak the evening of May 16th to the members of the Sioux Lookout Public School Home and School Club. He gave a very interesting talk on present-day trends in education.\n\n\"It was also a pleasure to renew acquaintances with the principal of the school, Rev. A. B. Cheales, and with Mrs. Cheales. During this war period Mr. Cheales has had an added burden because of the scarcity of fully-qualified teachers for his school.\"\n\nInspector Warkentin, in reporting on his inspection of the Fort Alexander Residential School, Clandeboye Agency, Manitoba, made the following interesting comments:\n\n\"The progress made by the pupils in Miss Tetrault's room is excellent and truly exceptional. This is particularly evident in the beginners' class, who have had only one year's instruction. While most of them, if not all of them, are older than white children would be for the same grade, I find that these children have made better progress in reading than many classes of beginners in the other schools of my division. When I remember that the Indian children are learning to read what is to them a foreign language and that the teacher is instructing in a language which is not her mother tongue, I find the skill acquired by these children truly remarkable.\"\nI attach, for your information, a Year Book issued by the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School. As you know, this school is located at Lebret, Saskatchewan, and has an authorized enrolment of 250. This booklet is a very interesting review of the work of the school for the academic year 1944-45 and it will, no doubt, be noted with interest that over 100 of the ex-pupils of this school were in the Armed Forces.\n\nThe water for the Alberni Residential School, situated in the West Coast Agency, Vancouver Island, British Columbia, is secured from the town of Alberni. For some months past the management has been complaining regarding the charges for the water. Indian Commissioner MacKay was instructed to arrange with officials of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, Vancouver, to investigate the matter. This was done recently and it was found that the water system was leaking at the rate of 10,000 gallons per day, maximum pressure. This leak has been repaired, at no expense.\n\nThe attached snapshot gives an idea of the articles produced by the Woodworking Class at the Old Sun Indian Residential School, operated under the auspices of the Church of England, at Gleichen, Alberta.\nInspector McBurney's report, following his inspection of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School on June 4, reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Mrs. Douglas continues to do good work, as in previous years. Her pupils are making good progress in their studies. They speak and read well for Indian children. The writing and art work, as in previous years, is excellent.\n\n\"In my opinion Mrs. Douglas has an excellent influence on the pupils and on the school. She has now been teaching twelve years in this school.\n\n\"The Boys' Band at this school has over a number of years won distinction. Most of the boys in the Band are in this classroom.\n\nThe following visitors called at this office during the month of June:\n\nRev. Paul Langlois, O.M.I., Principal, Albany Residential School.\n\nRev. Father Beuglet, O.M.I., Administrator, Grouard, Alta.\n\nLt.-Col. E. P. Randle, Six Nations Superintendent, Brantford, Ont.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\"\nOttawa, August 6, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOST,\n\nI submit herewith a report of the activities of the Training Division for the month ended July 31, 1945:\n\nOn July 31 there were 32 Indian day schools for which we had not yet secured a teacher for the academic year 1945-46. At 19 of this number the teacher has always been nominated by one of the Churches. In each of these cases the Church concerned has assured us that a teacher will be secured before September 1. To secure teachers for the remaining 13, we have been in communication with the Indian Agent and the local Inspector and others interested and we are still hopeful that at the majority of them, at least, we will be able to secure a teacher before the new academic year commences.\n\nDuring the first part of the month Mr. Doucet visited the Restigouche Reserve and made arrangements for necessary improvements to the school. On the return trip he visited B\u00e9relinie, where we are now operating the school from March 1 to November 15. There was an excellent attendance of pupils at the time he was present and the classroom work appeared to be progressing satisfactorily. On July 28 he left for Winnipeg, to conduct a Teachers' Conference at St. Boniface Manitoba, during the last week of the month.\n\nA report from the Principal of the Elkhorn Residential School supplied detailed information regarding the graduation exercises and a notable performance of \"The Moon Goddess\" which was presented at the City of Brandon by an all-Indian cast, the members of which had been trained by the Principal. Both the Brandon Daily Sun and the Elkhorn Mercury gave special prominence to this performance.\n\nInspector George Young, reporting on his inspection of the Back Settlement Day School, Caradoc Agency, Province of Ontario, wrote:\n\n\"The class work of this school leads the rest of the reserve. I found all pupils very happy and apparently making rapid progress, in spite of irregular attendance. The progress in every subject is almost equal to our best white schools. The youngsters all read well, write neatly, explain subjects with ability, answer promptly, calculate with a good degree of skill and speed. Their records indicate that they are covering a large portion of the regular Ontario Course of Study.\n\n\"A limited amount of hand work has been accomplished. Mrs. Thompson has given you splendid service and has developed a commendable spirit in the purchase of War Savings Stamps. Their conduct is most commendable.\"\nInspector G. W. Bartlett, reporting on his inspection of the Fairford Indian Day School, Portage la Prairie and Manitowapah Agency, Manitoba, commented on the school as follows:\n\n\"I am glad to learn that all requests for supplies and equipment made last year have been met. The children present were ahead in Arithmetic of those in similar grades in white schools but much slower in getting work done. I got very good results in Silent Reading, but their Oral Reading leaves much to be desired.\"\n\nDuring the month 620 letters were sent out from this Division and 650 vouchers were passed for payment.\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nLt.-Col. E. P. Randle, Indian Supt., Brantford, Ont.\nRev. F. O'Grady, Principal, Kamloops Indian Residential School, Kamloops, B.C.\nRev. T. J. Dwyer, S.J., Indian Missionary, North Shore, Lake Huron.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, September 6, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEY,\n\nI submit herewith a report of the activities of the Training Division for the month ended August 31, 1945.\n\nIn my report for the month of July I stated that on July 31 there were 32 Indian day schools for which we had not yet secured a teacher for the academic year 1945-46. On August 31 there were 22 schools for which a teacher had not yet been secured. Of this number, 11 were schools at which the Church concerned is allowed to nominate the teacher, and in all of these cases the church authorities feel that a teacher will yet be secured.\n\nFrom July 31 to August 3, inclusive, Mr. Doucet conducted a summer course at St. Boniface. This was attended by 82 teachers from Indian residential schools in Manitoba. On August 6, 7, 8 and 9 he conducted a similar course at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, Lebret, Sask., which was attended by 40 teachers of Indian residential schools. Reports from those interested indicate that great interest was shown by all present and everyone appeared satisfied with the manner in which these courses were conducted.\n\nFollowing these conferences, Mr. Doucet proceeded to The Pas, where he examined the buildings of The Pas Air Force, with a view to determining if they would be suitable for a residential school, requested by the Missionary Society of the Church of England. Mr. Doucet's conclusions were that the buildings available at this point would not be suitable as a residential school.\n\nInspector Hamilton, reporting on his visit during the month of July to Cross Lake Reserve, writes as follows in connection with the Cross Lake Indian Residential School:\n\n\"This was my first visit to the new school and I was greatly impressed with the very excellent building.\n\n\"The dormitories were spotless, well aired and very bright. The beds were quite close together, but with all the windows I am sure the children have plenty of fresh air. The bedding was clean and there was abundant.\n\n\"The classrooms were very bright and the walls nicely decorated. The desks, although in use for some years, were almost without a scratch. I am certain, from the books seen, that the Sisters do very excellent work in the classroom.\n\n\"I examined the work done in the sewing-room...\"\nand must admit that the girls do splendid sewing. They make dresses, knit all kinds of garments and do very excellent patch-work and darning.\n\nThe kitchen and dining rooms were in excellent order and the girls receive a good training in cooking and baking. The children seen were in good health and I am sure are well cared for and well fed.\n\nThe school has a large garden, which this year was planted late and of course was not up when I was there. The Rev. Father keeps some very fine Holstein cows, a flock of hens and some pigs. The school is under excellent management and the children appeared very happy. The operating of such an excellent school in this remote area is a great credit to the Church and Government. The Rev. Father Trudeau is interested in his work and is assisted by an excellent staff of Sisters.\"\n\nWith your approval, I visited the Caughnawaga Reserve during the month, in order to choose accommodation for another classroom, rendered necessary by the return to the reserve of several Indian families who have been residing in the United States. A store on the main street of the village was secured and this should prove suitable for the current academic year. I also went to Brantford, where Colonel Randle and myself interviewed Rev. Mr. J. Zimmerman, who is now Principal of the Mohawk Institute. Detailed reports regarding these visits have already been submitted to you.\n\nRequests for materials and supplies of various kinds, correspondence with regard to appointment of teachers and other communications related to the re-opening of the schools for the academic year 1945-46 have necessitated a great deal of correspondence during the month, and all members of the staff have been extremely busy. Seven hundred and sixty (760) letters were sent out from this Division during the month and $25 vouchers were passed for payment.\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month:\n\nRev. J. Camirand, Principal, Kuper Island Indian Residential School, B.C.\n\nRev. L. Lauzon, Indian Missionary, Cowichan Agency, B.C.\n\nRev. Father Lalonde, S.J., Indian Missionary, Caughnawaga,\n\nRev. Sister Mary George, Principal, Indian Day School (P.C.) Caughnawaga, Que.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMemorandum\u2014\n\nDirector\u2014\n\nThe following is a report on the work of the Welfare Division during the month of August.\n\nEarly in the month the Division shipped clothing made by our Indian Homemakers' Clubs at Tyendinaga, Golden Lake, St. Regis, Maniwaki and Restigouche, to the Unappelle Indian Hospital and the new Airport Hospital at The Pas. The Purchasing Agent in reporting that he was unable to obtain children's flannel gowns required for the latter hospital suggested that this clothing might be manufactured by Homemakers' Clubs. Arrangements are being made to have them supplied by the Tyendinaga Branch. In acknowledging receipt of the shipment mentioned above Dr. Simson, Medical Superintendent of the Unappelle Hospital, wrote as follows:\n\n\"The shipment of clothing arrived here in good condition and we appreciate receiving it very much. As the quality of material in pyjamas and nightgowns is such superior to what may be purchased anywhere today, and our stock is nil, we would appreciate a further shipment of them should they become available.\"\n\nDr. R. F. Iule, Medical Superintendent, of The Pas Agency, reporting on his treaty trip\u2014conditions generally and York Factory in particular\u2014states:\n\n\"I think that gardens could also be classified as natural resources which have not been used to the extent which they might be. This applies to a greater or less extent to all reserves. However, it is my considered opinion that there will be no progress in this direction until the Indians are given a firm and sympathetic supervision.\"\n\nWhile on the subject of gardening I have to quote an excerpt from Mr. Inspector Hamilton's report on a visit to the Mathias Colomb Reserve at Pukatagan in The Pas Agency on July 10, 1945:\n\n\"There were a few nice garden plots. I found potatoes just coming through the ground and those were the first I had seen up in any Indian garden. I was told by several (Indians) that many have small plots of potatoes close to their winter dwellings.\"\nSpeaking of new sources of income, in the same report, the Inspector states that some members of this Band are starting to engage in fishing in addition to the usual hunting and trapping. One Indian said that he and his son made $200.00 fishing in ten days. They fish at Grenville Lake and Ramell Lake.\n\nEach year the Division provides a certain sum of money to pay prizes for garden competitions. This year gardens have been disappointing as a whole because of the cold, wet spring. Despite this handicap some basins have done remarkably well. Agent Whalen, of Fredericton, N.B., reporting on the competition in his agency, encloses a letter from the judge of the competition, Mr. R. A. Smith, Horticultural Service, of the Provincial Department of Agriculture, Fredericton. This enclosure deals with the Kingsclear Reserve Competition and, in part, reads as follows:\n\n\"Your department and the Indians themselves are to be congratulated on the excellence of various gardens, which are a credit, considering the unfavourable season and the poor results obtained. The project, I feel, is a step in the right direction as it helps the Indians to support themselves at a time when certain foods are in short supply. Generally speaking some of these gardens compare very favourably with the best found anywhere this season.\"\n\nFrom time to time the Division receives reports from various sources indicating that the Indians as a whole throughout the Dominion are experiencing a period of prosperity. Many of these reports would indicate that the Indians are engaging in co-operative enterprises thus taking advantage of their natural resources which in former days would have been more or less exploited by whites. As a case in point I might mention the Bella Coola Indian Agency. This Agency has considerable timber resources which in former years would probably have been sold on a stumpage basis to white operators who would have engaged white men to do the work of cutting the timber. The Indians of Bella Coola have organized an association called the Bella Coola Lumbermen who are cutting the timber on the reserve and selling it direct to the manufacturers thus eliminating the middle man's profits. An Auditor's report on a recent inspection of this Agency shows that in the 1944-45 operations the income of this group was $22,461.79. Disbursements, which include among other items, a new tractor, bulldozer, $230.00 purchase of war bonds, Red Cross $101.00, party for the troops $25.00, wages $8,717.14, amount to $22,122.54, leaving a cash balance of $338.85 to their credit after a loan from the department of $5,000.00 has been repaid. In addition to the above credit this association now has assets of some $12,500.00, and a credit surplus of $6,886.38 timber cut but not delivered. Considerable credit for the success of this venture must be given to the local Indian Agent who manages the books of the association, and keeps them straight in so far as their financial transactions are concerned.\nIn a report from the Bella Coola Agency, dated July 24, the agent states as follows:\n\n\"Plans are now being considered to have the Bella Coola Indians loggers take over a timber license of three million feet of spruce on Kwatna Inlet as a fall operation when fishing closes down. At Bella Bella the Indians had a satisfactory herring run with a gross of $56,000.00 to the bands. This operation was followed by a fairly good halibut season and the commissioners advise that $25,000.00 cash was paid to the Bella Bella Indians for halibut and fresh fish this spring.\"\n\nThe Auditor's report on the Kwakwaka'wakw Indian Agency states that the 1944-45 revenue from all sources amounted to $78,401.06. He notes an item - refund of income tax deductions to Indian fishermen $22,641.77.\n\nInspector Hamilton reporting on a visit to York Factory and Shuswap districts states as follows:\n\n\"The Indians, especially at York, were well dressed. They had good clothes and all were clean in appearance. The babies were very clean and outfitted with nice clothes and plenty of bright warm blankets. These same remarks apply to the Shuswap group and those located at Gillam. Certainly there were no signs of recent hardship or poverty. The relief issued to the York Factory Indians for the winter amounted to less than $100.00 and Mr. Island, the Indians' Agent Manager, said there was no hardship. He also stated that the Indians had paid practically all their debts.\n\nThere is work now for all the Indians freighting for the Hudson's Bay Company. They earn about $4.00 per day and board. It takes a week to make a return trip to Shuswap for which the Indians receive $25.00 and food. They will have steady work until they leave (for their trapping grounds) in September.\"\n\nDr. J. P. Harvey, Indian Agent, at Fort Norman,\n\nN.W.T., reports:\n\n\"Contrary to my expectations the prices of spring fur held up and the catch was good. This was general throughout the area. Consequently, the people at present have fairly large quantities of money among them and also as a consequence, the gambling is again flourishing at new higher levels. Talking seems to have little effect and it seems that to cut it down will require definite regulations with penalties.\"\nThroughout the Dominion the French receive communications showing that the Indians of Canada appreciate the fact that they receive family allowances in the same manner as their white neighbours. Agent Featherston, of the Ross Indian Agency, at Longford Mills, Ontario, remarking on this states:\n\n\"They are now impatiently waiting for the initial payment and think that the whole thing is a successful idea. What the agent thinks is another story.\"\n\nThe Indians of Northern Manitoba are increasingly obtaining employment in the fishing industry. Prices are high when disposed of to the consumer, but owing to the cost of transportation from northern areas the return to the Indians is not as great as one would be led to expect. However, this industry is assuring an income to the Indians at a period when they used to be very hard up. Inspector Hamilton, reporting on his recent inspection of the Norway House Agency, states that the Indians of God's Lake are receiving $.45 per lb. for white fish and $.65 per lb. for trout plus a .25 bonus in each case. They contracted to supply up to 600,000 lbs. of fish. This limit was not reached, but some idea of the amount that was supplied is reflected in a credit of approximately $1,000.00 bonus money which has been left with the trader as a fund to be used in obtaining winter outfits to go hunting and trapping. The trader, Mr. Campbell, advises that he has work which will give the Indians from $2,500.00 to $3,000.00 and they can start this work any day.\n\nMr. Inspector Thibault reporting on a recent inspection tour of the Lower St. Lawrence states that the Indian Agent at Mingan reported that hunting was fairly good and prices paid to the Indians for their fur were very good. This success in hunting is reflected in lowered relief costs. The agent states that relief is now being given to only the old and sick Indians.\n\nMr. John E. Pugh, our Indian Agent at Blood, reports calling for tenders on the sale of 455 steers and 150 head of dry cows and heifers. Bids are to be received up to 4 P.M. on September 4 next.\n\nMr. C. F. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies in Alberta, reports that it was necessary to destroy one of the departmental herd bulls at Morley, Alberta. This bull was sold for slaughter, as due to some disease he was of no further use for breeding purposes.\n\nThe Division has received a report from the ReGellePe stating that an Indian of the White Bear Indian Reserve had been sentenced to three months in the Regina goal for an offence of contributing to juvenile delinquency under the Juvenile Delinquents Act. It might be pointed out that this Division is attempting to obtain a conviction in every case where there are offences against\nyoung Indian girls. We find that the magistrates are inclined to a misguided leniency in their sentences because they seem to be of the opinion that because the crime is committed by Indians against Indians it is not as serious as it would be if the parties were whites. In my opinion, the only way to prevent such offenses is to amend the Indian Act to give the Indian agent power to deal with them.\n\n[Signature]\n\nG. Armstrong,\nWelfare Division.\nMemorandum\u2014\n\nDirector\u2014\n\nThe following is a report on the activities of the Welfare Division during the month of September.\n\nReports received from Indian Agents across the Dominion show our Homemakers' Clubs to be very active:\n\nDeseronto Club\u2014This club has arranged to make up 50 children's flannel gowns for the Airport Hospital at The Pas, Manitoba. The Purchasing Agent was unable to obtain this clothing from usual trade sources so the Indian women kindly offered to assist us by making the gowns.\n\nRestigouche Club\u2014This club consists of some 15 members under the guidance of the Reverend Principal of the Indian Day School. They have arranged to make 300 pairs of pyjamas and 500 dressing-gowns during the coming winter for the use of our Indian hospitals. The Branch is to provide the materials and will pay .75\u00a2 each for the garments. Payment is to be in kind, that is, useful household equipment; and or clothing.\n\nGolden Lake\u2014This club under the capable leadership of Mrs. J. Levalley held a picnic to collect funds for the building of a new church on the reserve. Over $1,400.00 was collected. This winter, in addition to the usual activities, they are going to carry on with their programme of making dressing-gowns for use in Indian hospitals.\n\nDuring the month organisation of clubs continued in the Birtle and Portage la Prairie Agencies. Miss E. Smith Windsor was engaged as an organiser during the month of August. During that period she visited the following clubs\u2014Belting River Reserve, Keesekookomin, Bird Tail Sioux, Long Plain Reserve and Swan Lake Reserve. Miss Windsor reports that the clubs are active and are doing excellent work in the re-modelling of military clothing for their own and their less fortunate neighbours' use. The Swan Lake Club put on a special display at the Swan Lake Fair and received fifteen first prizes and five seconds for their work. One is amazed at the ingenuity of the women in re-modelling discarded army clothing. Miss Windsor notes quilts from khaki shorts, windbreakers from khaki drill and a \"trim little dress\" from a khaki shirt.\n\nA new club has been organised at the Oka Country School. This club has a membership of sixteen and the President is a Mrs. Oke. This is the first sign that a band hitherto classed as\nuncooperative may be experiencing a change of heart. Anyway it is a step in the right direction and the club will receive every encouragement from the Branch.\n\nAttached hereto is a copy of a most interesting report on the summer camp held for the Girl Guide Company of the St. Regis Band. This was an experiment on the part of Mr. T. L. Bomah, our local Indian Agent, and I would say that the results show that it is definitely worth while.\n\nLast month we submitted a report on commercial fishing on God's Lake Reserve of the Norway House Indian Agency. We have now been advised that the Marketing Prices and Trade Board have ordered the white contractor (as to increase the price paid to Indians for fish by $2 to $3 per lb., as this contract was for an amount of $50,000 lbs., the adjustment will assure the Indians of considerable extra income. This action was a result of representations made by Mr. Cowan, Assistant Deputy Minister of Mines and Natural Resources for the Province of Manitoba.\n\nDuring the month the Branch finally succeeded in having a wooden shack situated on No. 2 Highway, Tyendinaga Reserve, dismantled. This shack was an eye-sore among the well kept farms and farm buildings fronting on the main road.\n\nA Royal Canadian Mounted Police report recently received shows that Alfred Clarke, a treaty Indian from the God's Lake Band, was sentenced to six months in Norway House Common Gaol because of a charge of non-support laid against him by his wife. This sentence was suspended on the accused answering that he would support his wife and children in the amount of $25.00 per month. We have had considerable trouble with Indians who, on living off a reserve, fail to contribute to the support of their wives. The action on part of the Magistrate at Norway House should certainly cut down complaints of this nature in that area at least.\n\nDuring the month many Indian delegates to the Convention in Ottawa visited the Division. Numerous welfare matters were discussed to the mutual advantage of the Division and the Indians concerned. Welfare matters in general were discussed with Mr. T. L. Bomah, Indian Agent at St. Regis. He has submitted a proposed set of bylaws for the St. Regis Band. These bylaws were passed unanimously by the Band Council, and it is hoped that once they have become law many hang-ups to the agent's programme for bettering conditions in the agency will be eliminated.\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. Armstrong,\nWelfare Division.\nOttawa, October 4, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nM. ALLAN.\n\nI submit herewith a report of the activities of the Training Division for the month ended September 30, 1945.\n\nIn my last monthly report I stated that on August 31 there were 28 Indian day schools for which a teacher had not been secured for the academic year 1945-46. During the past month we have succeeded in re-opening 7 of these and consequently on September 30, 1945, there were 15 Indian day schools without teachers, divided as follows: Ontario 5; Manitoba 2; Saskatchewan 1; and British Columbia 7. It is interesting to note that an article in the Winnipeg Free Press dated August 29, 1945, stated that at the re-opening of the white schools in Manitoba on September 1 there were 125 rural schools without a teacher.\n\nEarly reports from various parts of the Dominion indicate that we may expect very large attendances at all our day schools. This is probably due to a great extent to the payment of family allowances. As soon as the September quarter returns are received, it is intended to review each of them carefully and make certain that children enrolled are attending regularly.\n\nAs family allowances are not paid to parents whose children are enrolled in residential schools, it was felt some months ago that there might be considerable difficulty in obtaining full enrolment at the residential schools this year. However, with the exception of a few schools, recent reports indicate that practically all our residential schools will have their full enrolment, and in many cases they have received applications for more pupils than there is accommodation available.\n\nConsequent upon the opening of the schools for another academic year the correspondence during the month has been extremely heavy. Eight hundred and fifty (850) letters were sent out from this Division during the month and 550 vouchers were passed for payment.\n\nThe following visitors called at this office...\nduring the months:\n\nChief Taylor, Onion Lake Reserve, Sask.\nChief Poorman, Poorman's Reserve, Sask.\nTelford Adams, Sarnia Reserve.\n\nMr. J. A. Marleau, Indian Agent, Sturgeon Falls, Ont.\nRev. H.A. Alderwood, D.D., Secretary, Indian & Eskimo Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, November 3, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEY,\n\nI submit herewith a report of the activities of the Training Division for the month ended October 31, 1945.\n\nIn my last report I stated that on September 30, 1945, there were 15 Indian day schools without teachers. On October 31 there were 10 Indian day schools without teachers, divided as follows: Ontario 3, Saskatchewan 1 and British Columbia 6.\n\nIn my last report I referred to information that had been received regarding increased attendances at day schools. This week I reviewed the returns received from the Indian day schools for the quarter ended September 30, 1945, and compared them with the returns received for the quarter ended September 30, 1944. In nearly every case there was a very greatly increased enrolment and a corresponding increase in the average attendance. On some reserves, where we have had trouble obtaining attendance, it was found that although the enrolment was much larger the average attendance had not shown a corresponding increase. In all such cases the agent was written and referred to the action that he is authorized to take in regard to family allowances where Indian children residing on a reserve where school facilities are available do not attend regularly.\n\nThe September quarter returns from the residential schools also show largely increased enrolments and thus many schools have considerably more pupils than their authorized enrolment. As a consequence, it can be expected that we will have many requests for an increase in the pupilage at our residential schools.\n\nWith reference to the provision being made in the supplementary estimates for assisting certain Indian residential schools in employing qualified vocational teachers, we have made extensive inquiries with a view to securing such teachers. While the number available is limited, we have at the present time nine or ten vocational teachers in view, whose services we hope to secure in the next month or so.\n\nThe routine work of this Division has been very heavy during the month, as we received the quarterly\n\n.......... returns\nreturns from all the residential schools for the quarter ended September. All these have to be checked carefully in order to calculate the amount of per capita allowance due. Day school return forms have to be reviewed and the enrolments and average attendances recorded so that the figures will be available when preparing the annual report.\n\nEight hundred and seventy-five (875) letters were sent out from this Division during the month and 555 vouchers were passed for payment.\n\nThe following visitors called at the office during the month\u2014\n\nMost Rev. J. Charbonneau, D.D., Archbishop of Montreal;\nMost Rev. J. Trocellier, O.M.I., Vicar Apostolic, Mackenzie;\nMost Rev. J. C. Cody, D.D., Victoria, B.C.\nMost Rev. I.

Burk, Indian Agent, Port Arthur, Ont.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMemorandum:\n\n- Director -\n\nThe following is a report on the activities of the Welfare Division during the month of October.\n\nThe volume of the work in this Division increased considerably during the month as many of our Indian Agents, having completed their field work, are bringing their office work up to date. Reports received from across the Dominion show that crops on the whole have been rather disappointing. The western agencies had a very late spring followed by a hot summer and a very wet autumn. In many agencies harvesting has not been completed by the end of October. Our Indian Agent at Pelly reports that they had a splendid crop on their Community Farms. He mentions one field of oats, 57 acres, which threshed out more than 90 bushels to the acre. Indian gardens have been poor and the Branch will be faced with the necessity of supplying considerable quantities of seed potatoes next spring. We have had numerous complaints from agencies across the Dominion of a shortage of land and shortening in the trading posts from which our Indians receive their winter supplies. Indians use large quantities of fats and usually purchase their winter supply when they leave for their hunting grounds. This year we have had many representations from merchants who are unable to obtain necessary supplies to outfit the Indians. In many instances Indians have proceeded to their hunting grounds without their minimum requirements of fats.\n\nDr. T. J. Orford, Indian Agent of the James Bay Agency, reporting on a visit made to the Fort George Band, stresses the economic and physical difference between the Indians who tramp on the coast and those who trap inland:\n\n\"The inlanders, about 255 in number, are noticeably better clothed and healthier appearing than the coastal hunters. In comparing fur incomes the reason becomes apparent - they constitute only one third of the band in numbers yet they trade more than two thirds of the total band fur hunt. The inlanders have good hunting and trapping grounds with sufficient fish, rabbits and birds to supply a fairly good diet basis and enough income from furs to keep well clothed and fairly well outfitted. The coastal people have poor game conditions and only one or two good fishing areas - and a low fur income. One noticeable feature of moving these people to hospital or to work is to see the rapid weight increase that begins immediately. Every youngster gains at least five pounds and I have seen as much as fifteen pounds increase in children around twelve years of age with three square meals a day.\"\nThe agent points out that the Welfare Division will in the future find it necessary to greatly increase expenditure on these Indians until \"our Beaver Sanctuary comes into production\". In comparison with these Indians the agent notes as follows:\n\n\"Moving down to Rupert's House and Nemaska we step into another world. The Hudson's Bay Company Sanctuary has been gradually increasing the beaver quota and this year the Department's Nottaway Sanctuary opens up. At Nemaska every head of family must have a beaver quota and a single man or woman requiring beaver for support has a quota. There is therefore no welfare issue of food or clothing required at present. Those who are crippled or too old to trap the fur for themselves are given the beaver by some other member of the family.\"\n\nSpeaking of the Indians housing accommodation at Nemaska the agent states:\n\n\"It is a very agreeable change from the usual type of James Bay Camp - this should be an easy band to control (tuberculosis) once we are able to undertake a full X-ray survey and hospitalise all those showing signs of the disease.\"\n\nThe agent points out that the Indians of Rupert's House having money to spare are asking for lumber to build houses, tent floors and walls, and make wooden sidewalks.\n\nThe agent further points out that Mrs. J.S.C. Watt, the widow of a Hudson's Bay Manager who first began beaver conservation is living at Rupert's House. She is operating a bakery which is apparently going to be very successful. The Indians, under her leadership, are constructing a community hall 106 feet long by 28 feet wide with cement foundation and pillars. The Indians are supplying the labour at $1.00 a day and have donated nearly $5,000.00 to defray the cost of construction in addition to promising more from this year's beaver hunt. The agent states \"in my opinion it gives us as an Indian Department a very red face\". The agent also mentions considerable unrest or agitation by certain members of the Moose Band. Apparently these people are followers of Jules Sicot.\n\nEach year Dr. Orford carries out a gardening project at Moosonee. This year he reports that despite the cold spring and an early frost they will have sufficient seed potatoes for next year. Dr. Orford found that he was unable to grow beans in his garden so he requested the Branch to obtain a culture from the Dominion Experimental Farm. The result was most satisfactory. Three rows of beans were sown - two with the culture, and one without. The untreated seed did not germinate while the agent had a very heavy crop from the treated seed.\n\nIn connection with our garden competitions throughout the Dominion I would like to call your attention to the one held on the Moravian Indian Reserve. The first prize awarded for the best garden was a sixty-six piece dinner set, and the second prize awarded was a 9 x 15 rug. Agents throughout the Dominion have been encouraged to give prizes for garden competitions in kind instead of paying cash as Indians who receive cash spend it immediately while prizes in kind are proudly treasured by the recipient.\nFrom reports received from agencies across the Dominion it appears that the Indians are enjoying full and profitable employment. In the Stuart Lake Agency the Farming Instructor states that on all reserves visited the Indians were employed in the logging industry, ties, pitprops and saw logs. There is plenty of work for all that are able and willing to work.\n\nDuring the month a conference of agents, and Farming Instructors, of the Province of Saskatchewan, was held in Regina, to meet Colonel H. M. Jones, the Branch Supervisor of Family Allowances. In addition to Allowances many other problems were discussed and the following recommendations were submitted to the Branch:\n\n1. An increase in the Farming Instructors' salaries\n2. Further hospitalization facilities\n3. B.C.G. vaccination of all Indian babies\n4. Annual conferences with a senior representative of the Ottawa office present\n5. The payment of day school teachers' salaries for the full twelve months of the year.\n\nIn addition, the conference recommended that Farming Instructors be supplied with an efficient means of transportation. At present the Farming Instructors either use their own cars, or horse and buggy. The Instructors have to cover considerable ground each day so the horse transport is not considered efficient enough, and a recommendation has been made that a light half-ton pick up truck be supplied to each Farming Instructor.\n\nThe Division is in receipt of a report from the Yukon advising us of an epidemic of influenza at Old Crow, Yukon Territory, during July and August. No medical service was available so the wife of Corporal E. A. Kirk, R.C.M.P., officer in charge of the detachment there, assumed control. She contracted influenza but had to take over again after a few days because the other white people at the Post became ill. This Division wishes to express its deep appreciation of the excellent service rendered by Corporal Kirk and Mrs. Kirk in this emergency.\n\nDuring the month numerous sales of livestock were held throughout the Dominion. Prices were very good indeed and the income to the Indians concerned was very substantial.\n\n| Hobbsma Agency | $1,030.28 |\n| Blood          | $1,005.47 |\n| Paigan         | $3,000.00 |\n\nLast spring the Branch established a purebred herd in the Paigan Agency. The agent reports that \"the herd has improved considerably in condition during the summer months. The calves born, five heifers and four bulls, are a fair bunch. Two of the bull calves are much better than the others and may develop into sires.\"\nReports received from every province across the Dominion indicate that Family Allowances are being used to good advantage by Indians in supplying them with that \"necessary extra\" which means the difference between living and existing. Indian children returning to our schools are better fed and better dressed than ever before.\n\nThe following report from Inspector Ostender would indicate the necessity of providing trained personnel to direct the activities of our Homemakers' Clubs. His recommendation to pay Farming Instructors' wives for their services in this connection is being given serious consideration\u2014\n\n\"The new Homemakers' Clubs have been formed in this province and the only ones operating satisfactorily at the present time are the White Bear, Assiniboine, Thunderchild, and Meadow Lake Clubs. The success of a Homemaker's Club depends almost entirely upon the representative of the Department who is operating it. We have no Indian women with administrative ability and initiative sufficient to organise and keep a Homemaker's Club in operation. We have therefore had to depend almost entirely upon unpaid representatives of the Department. In most cases these are the wives of the Farming Instructors. When a man is being paid a lower salary than many of the men he knows with equal or less ability and working shorter hours it is hardly to be expected that his wife will have much energy and enthusiasm to assist him in his work with no further remuneration. Some ladies will do this but there are not many of them. The question of Homemakers' Clubs is intertwined with education and the administration of Family Allowances to the extent that it would appear that the best solution for the future is the appointment of a married day school teacher who will also find teaching in social service work and who can be paid a small additional salary for this work. Appointments of teachers in our day schools, like the appointment of our Farming Instructors, are not very attractive to the right class of people at the present time. On nearly every occasion when I have had an interview with a prospective Farming Instructor and told him what was expected of him and the salary which he would get he lost interest. I am informed by the Church authorities who have been given the task of finding day school teachers that they are faced with practically the same replies.\"\n\nAgent Swartman of the Sioux Lookout Agency has reported that the Indians of Lee Soul, Osmaburgh, Trout Lake, Fort Hope, and Martin Falls Bands, have had a good early summer fish catch. He also notes that much of the profit of this industry goes to the transportation companies. The Trout Lake Band, at Hijicon, has a good estate of sturgeon and caviar in May, but had to pay the Canadian Pacific Airlines .20\u00a2 per pound to have their produce transported to the market (railway). The Fort Hope and Martin Falls Bands engaged in commercial fishing for Austin Airways who paid them .15\u00a2 per pound this summer at the fishing grounds as against .10\u00a2 per pound in 1944.\n\n[Signature]\n\nO. Armstrong,\nWelfare Division\nMemorandum -\n\n- Director -\n\nThe following is a report on the activities of the Welfare Division during the month of November.\n\nDuring the month the Division was extremely busy completing preparation of Welfare and Agency Estimates for the fiscal year 1946-47. This is the first time that the Welfare Division has had to prepare Agency Estimates, and the task was complicated to some extent by the absence of last year's work sheets.\n\nMr. Morris returned from an inspection trip of the Maritime Provinces around the middle of November. Since his return one stenographer has been engaged full time typing his reports. As the other stenographer was working on the typing of Estimates considerable trouble was experienced in handling current correspondence. Mr. Roberts helped solve the problem by doing his own typing. The writer could not overcome his difficulties that way as the \"hunt and poke\" method he uses is very slow to say the least.\n\nAt long last the bylaws of the St. Regis Band have been revised in such a manner as to receive the approval of the Band Departmental Solicitor. The Band officials have been toiling over these bylaws during spare minutes for a period of over two months. It certainly is a relief to see them on their way to the Indian Agent, for approval of the Band before placing them with the Privy Council for authorization.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies for the Province of Manitoba, has forwarded a report (copy of which is attached) on fishing operations in the Lake Winnipeg district during the 1945 season. He shows an income of $79,338.13 from this industry. The Branch is at present canvassing the possibility of recovery of oil from fish offal to provide the fats so badly needed by our northern Indians. In this connection I would like to express the thanks of the Division to the Fisheries Research Board of Canada for information placed at our disposal.\n\nNow that the Estimates are to the fore I think this would be a very opportune time to call the attention of the powers that be to housing conditions that exist among our Indians. Recently a report was received from our Field Nurse, Miss Ruth Bohman, whose territory covers the Saddle Lake and Lesser Slave Lake agencies. The particular reserve mentioned - Beaver Lake - is in the Lesser Slave Lake Agency.\n\n\"In October 10 I made a visit to the Beaver Lake Reserve. The condition of the Indians up there is appalling. Most of the houses were at this time undergoing repair for the winter. Most of the...\"\nhomes on that reserve are very poorly built and have insufficient windows\u2014most of them having only one which measures about 24\" x 24\". I also checked the water supply and found one well that was more than a mere hole in the ground. Most of the drinking water comes from either stagnant sloughs or else dug outs in the marsh lands. The water was biologically tested at the Provincial Lab and the reports filed at this office, and several specimens were reported positive \"unfit for human consumption\".\n\nThere are 9 school age children that are not at school (and there were a number of families not at home) some of these children, ages ranging from 7 to 15, who have never been to school.\n\nThere is a special case I would like to draw to your attention Doctor. Flora Gladue, who is suffering from an acute eye condition\u201410 years of age. I was unable to examine the child because of parental objections. I tried to reason with the family but of no avail. The child is partially blind and I advised the parents to take the child to Lee in Biche to see the Doctor there. To date the parents have made no effort to get medical attention. Is there anything that can be done in these cases where the parents refuse to have a child treated. They are paying a heavy price. I am sure the child will lose her sight. The children on this reserve are suffering badly from malnutrition and Tuberculosis. All in all the health picture at Beaver Lake is a sad one.\n\nSeveral trips were made to Goodfish Reserve and here the conditions are considerably better. Here too the houses were undergoing repair. A number of children here were suffering from Dysentery. A number of Indians are using the water from the Whitefish Creek and I sent specimens to the Lab. The report came back \"positive\".\n\nProvision has been made in the 1946-47 Estimates to carry out a program of building and repairing Indian houses. It is hoped that when this program is completed conditions such as those mentioned by the nurse will not exist anywhere in the Dominion of Canada.\n\nFor a number of years the Branch operated the Community Farm on the Oak Lake Indian Reserve, in the Griswold Agency, Province of Manitoba. During this period of operation a considerable credit was built up in trust funds at Ottawa from proceeds of crops sold. Last spring the Community Farm was divided among twelve Indian farmers who were supplied with implements, horses, and harness, to operate this land. At that time the Branch was a little dubious of the success of this venture but the agent's report shows that the Indians have used the land and equipment to very good advantage. The agent states as follows:\n\n\"The results of this year's farming by these Oak Lake Indians proves that they really can do very good work, and I feel that this was a venture worth while. With the yields received and the good price of grain, these Indians all have a good income. You will note that one of the smallest farmers, Mr. Daniel, with 21 acres seeded, got 377 bushels of wheat and 150 bushels of oats. This gives him an income of $7777.00. Another Indian, Mr. Chukas, with 42 acres of wheat and 31 acres of oats has an income of $1777.00. Let us hope that this proves to these farmers that work well done at the proper time really pays, and that they will continue to work and produce crops like they have done this year.\"\nDuring the month the Branch was advised by the Lands, Parks and Forests Branch, that they proposed to slaughter surplus elk at Banff and Jasper National Parks this fall, as follows:\n\n1) 400 Elk, Banff National Park\n2) 250 Elk, Jasper National Park\n\nThe meat of these animals, with the exception of a small quantity required by the Alternative Service Work Camps, was donated for the use of our Indians. Our Inspector of Indian Agencies, for the Province of Alberta, was advised in the matter and he made all the necessary arrangements for the slaughter and handling of the meat.\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.

In the afternoon, Sisters Ray, etc., and Jean Picard came with the singers for a truck ride. Dan Quinn had his driving and he took us as far as the station at Maida. Just as we reached there, we saw the St. Bruno car going by. They didn't stop, but we waved waved our hands for they were in a hurry. We found out afterwards that they were taking a patient to the hospital at High Prairie. When we came back, some boys were talking about dinner. George Fraser said, \"Don't talk about dinner, or I'll eat all of you up!\" I guess his ride had made him very hungry. We enjoyed our ride very much although it was quite cold, and we were glad that we were singers, for the other boys and girls did not have the same privilege as we had.\n\nNext day was All Souls' Day. The people came in great crowds, because they wanted to go down to the graveyard with the Fathers and Sisters to pray for the dead. We prayed all the way down, and when we got there, we sang the \"Liberation\" and recited many prayers. There are three Bishops buried here, also three priests, two Brothers and four Sisters of Providence. This little cemetery is in the center near the big cross, and is locked off from the rest. All around are the graves of the people who are taking their last sleep, waiting for the Lord to blow his trumpet on the last day.\n\nUrban Collin\u2014\u2014Sr. VII.\n\nVISITORS\n\nOn Nov. 5th, our Indian aunt, Mr. L'H\u00e9roux, visited our school. We were glad to see him. He said he could try to come and visit us often this year. We hope he doesn't change his mind for he is always a welcome visitor to our school. When he left, Jimmy Thomas asked him if we could have a holiday. Mr. L'H\u00e9roux and Fr. Fulher laughed\u2014but we got the holiday alright! Come again!! \u2014 Gerard Thibeault\u2014Sr. VI.\nHAPPY FEAST!\n\nFr. Lajoie had his feast on Nov. 13th. He said Mass at 6:30 AM in the Convent chapel. We sang hymns during the Mass and prayed for him. After breakfast, Fr. Falher and Floo' and Sr. Superior came to the halls with Fr. Lajoie. He spoke to us about hunting and he told us that he would like to spend a longer time with us. Before he left, he gave us a treat of candy. Then we gave three loud cheers that filled the church. He is Vicar General because he is taking Bishop Guy's place. Would we have had a holiday if it hadn't been Saturday?--- Roy Smith -- Gr.V.\n\nELECTIONS\n\nThe elections for the Children of Mary officers was held on Nov. 16th. We had been waiting anxiously for this event for a long time, so that night we all gathered in the Girls' Refectory to hold our meeting. Rev. Fr. Falher, Sr. Superior Sr. Jean Placidus, and the two Sisters in charge of the girls at the time, Sr. M. Thea and Sr. Guy of the Senior were all present. It was an easy election, for almost everyone seemed to have the same intentions, and soon, we saw that our new President was Helen Miller, the Vice-President, the same as last year: Rosalie Webb. When Mary Collins was elected as Secretary, she had all the votes except three. The three newly elected officers thanked us for the honor we had given them, promised to do their best, and then shook hands and received the congratulations of Fr. Falher and the Sisters. When Fr. Falher announced to us that Rev. Fr. Kindervater would be our new Director, we clapped and cheered with joy, for we knew that our conferences would be interesting.\n\nThat same day, our class went to the Club meeting of Lister Benigna's pupils. It was most interesting and all well done. We thanked Sister and the Junior Club for having given us such an interesting half hour, and we told them we hope they will entertain us soon again.\n\nMabel Gladu --- Gr. VI.\nST. THERESE'S CLUB MEETING\n\nOn Nov. 16th, we had our club meeting. We invited Sr. Jean Placideus and her pupils in our schoolroom. Alexis Cardinal jiggled while Sister Jean played the organ. Therese Aussent recited a poem \"Jesus Tender Shepherd\" as a night prayer. Then Elsie Phillips sang a song called \"I'm a Grey Little Eskimo\". After her song, Roger Quirion told a good joke. These are some of the things we did. We like to have the meetings and hope they will enjoy the next one too, because Sister Jean Placideus said that she enjoyed it very much. We are trying to live up to our aims.\n\nTherese Aussent --Gr. V...... Jim Andrew --Gr. IV.\n\nA SILVER JUBILEE\n\nOn Nov. 19th it was Sr. Mary Thea's silver jubilee. It was twenty-five years that she was a sister. But she was not all that time in Croward. She stayed in some other missions as a school teacher. Many of the older pupils had her for a teacher when they were in the lower grades. We prayed for her and wished her a happy feast. On her Silver Jubilee, Fr. Falhor granted us a half-holiday. We enjoyed sliding in the afternoon. George Fraser --Gr. V...... Alfred Thibault --Gr. IV.\n\nA TOFFY FILL\n\nWe looked forward to the feast of St. Catherine, for it is a Canadian custom to make toffy on that day. We are like all children; we love sweets of any kind, and with dear old Sister Duguay as Toffy Chief, we are sure to get a big share. So the toffy began to boil two days before, so that the girls could get it all pulled in time. We were always trying to find an excuse to go to the kitchen so we could smell it even if we were not lucky enough to get a piece from the friendly cooks. We had a sweet, sticky evening, and a happy one because we ate toffy to our hearts' content.\nThat same day, our teacher took us to see the Boys' new house. It was lovely although it was not yet finished. I was so busy looking at the big steam furnace that I did not notice that I was behind the others, and just as I came out from the furnace room, a man standing on the elevator at the third floor threw down a board which almost hit me on the head. For the first time in my life, I was swift and got out of the way just on time. This is the third year that we go visiting the new house on the feast of St. Catherine. Two years ago, Sister took us to see the new barn. Last year, Sr. Superior was doing the first washing in the new laundry, so Sr. Jean took us to see it, so we could see the big electric washers at work. Will there be something to visit next year, we wonder?\n\nNellie Ghostkeeper, one of our old pupils who has been at the Mission for many years finally decided to get married, and on the feast of St. Catherine, she and Louis Cordinal were married by Rev. Fr. Proulx in the Fathers' chapel. The newly married couple had the wedding supper at the Fathers' Refectory, after which they came to see the Sisters and the girls. We wished them good luck and gave them some stuffy. So it was a very interesting day for us, and I hope I will be here in the Mission to celebrate the next St. Catherine's day.\n\nMaggie Budskin---Gr.VI.\n\nRETREAT FOR THE CHILDREN\n\nFrom Dec. 5th to the 8th, we had our retreat in the chapel. Rev. Fr. Floc'h preached it and he explained things well, because everybody could understand what he said. There were four instructions every day, two in English and two in Cree. He pointed out to us how to try to become better and to be very good Catholics. Since we had our retreat, we will try to be very good and be pious little children. We had Benediction in the Chapel every night. We surely enjoyed our retreat very much this year.\n\nVictorine Bellrose. --- Gr. V.\n\nWhile Fr. Floc'h was here preaching the retreat, Fr. Falher went to Sturgeon Lake to preach to the Children there. When he came back he brought Fr. Rou\u00e9.\nRECEPTION FOR THE CHILDREN OF MARY\n\nOn the feast of the Immaculate Conception, eight of us girls were received as Children of Mary. We were all dressed in white for the ceremony which was very beautiful. Before Benediction, Fr. Kindervater, our director, spoke to us very briefly on the joy of being a Child of our Heavenly Mother, saying that when we begin to approach what our mother does for us, as she begins to grow up.\n\nFather then blessed our candles and gave them to us, and while he was blessing our badges, Helen Miller, our president, and Rosalie Webster, our Vice-President, lighted them for us. After our beautiful new badges were given to us, we recited our Act of Consecration. Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament came next, after which we went to the hall and received the congratulations of our director, and Sr. John Placidus, our directress.\n\nWhen we went to supper, we were so surprised and happy to see a special table prepared for us, the nuns members, and our officers. Sister Josephine had arranged the table with beautiful bouquets of flowers. We had a very nice supper, and a very gay time. To thank Sr. Josephine Augustin for all she did for us, also Sr. Superior for the beautiful pictures which pleased us so much. That night the C. of Mary had a reunion in our classroom, where Fr. Kindervater showed us such lovely pictures with his electric machine. It was all about the life of St. Ann and the Blessed Virgin Mary. As he showed us the pictures, Father told so many interesting stories that the time just flew by, and all of a sudden, it was 8:30.\n\nWe sang songs; some of the girls did some special dances, and then to finish up the evening right, Fr. Kindervater sang a song in German. The other girls had been in bed quite a while when we tiptoed in....so happy over that beautiful day. It is my first year in the Mission and all these things are so new to me, but I am...\nso proud to be a Child of Mary at last, and will do my best to do all that we have been advised to do by those who are in charge. Dorothy Phillips \u2014 Gr. VIII.\n\nMORE ANGELS IN THE HOUSE!!!!\n\nOn Sunday, Dec. 12th, nine little girls were received into the Guardian Angel Society. After Fr. Fisher had blessed the bridges and given a nice little instruction, we said our Act of Consecration. That evening we chose our officers. They were Margaret Ander, Florence Noskeyl and Viola Willier.\n\nThat same afternoon three children were baptized. They are Annie, Smith and Peter Kassapomatto. They came from White Fish Lake, but have been staying here since school started. They are happy now because they were anxious to be baptized.\n\nElsie Phillips \u2014 Gr. LV.\n\nARRIVALS\n\nRev. Fr. Lajoie has just returned from a business trip to Ottawa. He went there with Bishop Guy. We are sure he had a pleasant time, and we hope he had good success in what he planned to do on that trip.\n\nSister McReilly, who went away from here in September because she was very ill, gave us a big surprise by coming here on Dec. 10th. She had been in Vancouver B.C., where she had to have an operation, but to everybody's surprise, she got better almost right away, so she decided to give the Sisters here a surprise, by coming back. We were all so glad to see her back; we had prayed for her every day while she was gone. I suppose she will soon be taking care of the sick people again because she is a good nurse.\n\nErnest Giroux \u2014 Gr. VIII.\nA RED LETTER DAY\n\nWhen it was decided that the boys' house was to be blessed on Dec. 14th, Rev. Fr. Lejole asked Bishop Guy if he would please come for that great day. The Bishop was in the midst of his Xmas rush, but because he wanted to make us very happy, he consented to come. When we heard that he was coming, we children began to count the hours. Before Mass on Tuesday morning, no one could keep quiet. When Sister started playing the march in the chapel our hearts began to thump. They thumped harder as we saw our dear Bishop Guy coming in with a smile on his face. I guess if it hadn't been in the chapel, we would all have eloped and married \u2014 but we couldn't so during Mass we sang with all our hearts to thank God for this great joy. After Mass we waited for him in the dining room. When he came out of the chapel we greeted him so joyously. He told us he was happy to come here, and he showed it too. You might say we were lucky but we would have enjoyed it more if he could have stayed with us longer.\n\nHelen Miller \u2014 Gr. VII.\n\nAt eleven o'clock, we had such joy on seeing Bishop Guy coming in to bless the boys' building. We were so happy because he kept his promise in coming to see us soon. The children first sang a welcome song to show that even if Bishop Guy doesn't live here he will always be welcome in his former home. The song was followed by an address read by Frank Giroux. Then His Excellency gave us a very nice and interesting talk. How glad we were when he said that in a few weeks' time Mr. Christ would be coming to help Fr. Lejole. How everyone clapped! We know that the Bishop remembers us because he came here from many miles to bless the house of the boys, and he travelled many more hours than the hours he stayed here in Grouard. We surely hope that he will come to visit us soon again and that he will stay longer. May God bless him always!\n\nRuth Jordan \u2014 Gr. VIII.\n\nThat evening the carpenters put on a program for the special benefit of the Bishop. Wasn't it funny to see the working men dressed as girls? One I enjoyed was a play called \"The Troubles of Cowen\", acted by Mr. Paulet and Noel Fortin. Mr. Paulet was\nphoning to someone asking for a man to fix the shutter and the other understood \"shut up\". When he first started to phone he would repeat \"Hello, are you there?\" so many times that it made us laugh just to hear it. The other would get off the subject, and Mr. Prulet would say \"Oh Pshaw!\" and again repeat \"Hello, are you there?\" There were six numbers on the program and all were very interesting. The program was under the direction of Mr. Barulieu, the main boss.\n\nI think the best actors were Mr. Portelance and his son, Rudolph. They made us laugh so much that the tears were just rolling down our cheeks. In a play called \"Scientific Dentistry\", Mr. Portelance pulled out a tooth from Mr. Audier. That was the funniest play I had ever seen, because he used a butcher knife, big pliers and a rope to take the tooth out, and when the tooth finally came out, the dentist and the patient both fell down on the floor from the shock. Mr. Barulieu sang a beautiful song called, \"Pray, Love and Sing\". Everyone enjoyed the program very, very much.\n\nMabel Noskoyi --- Gr. VIII.\n\nIf you want to see the boys' magnificent new building follow me and I will show it to you. Let us go inside up the steps by the front door that we see in the picture. Now those three windows to the west end the one to the east is the boys' Recreation Hall. The other two windows to the east is the refectory. The floor is made entirely of cement; the walls are plastered.\n\nNow let us go upstairs. The stairs are not made yet so the men make a ladder-stairs. It is rather shaky, be careful or you'll tumble down and break your neck maybe! The second story contains all of the dormitory. At the western end is the Infirmary, locker, and Sister Mary's room. At the other end are Sr. Henriette Eugenie's room and bath rooms.\n\nNow to the basement - first let us go to the Engine Room. There is a wonderful big furnace here which heats the whole house with steam. Near the furnace is a tank which holds 500 gallons of hot water. I guess the boys will have clean hands, and clean dishes after this! There are bathrooms, a baggage room and a tank room.\nThe rest of the basement is the laundry. The machines haven't arrived yet so we are waiting for them. There are no hot air grates; instead we have radiators in the rooms.\n\nWhen His Excellency, Mgr. Joseph Gay blessed the building, the priests who accompanied him were Fathers Lejoie, Falher, Floch, Kindervater and Proulx.\n\nBrother Nicol and Mr. A. Beaulieu also accompanied them. They said some special prayers for the house blessing. It is the only house that is entirely fire-proof from Edmonton up to the North Pole, so you see we have reason to be proud!\n\nDesigner and Composer: Mary O'Neil\nGRATITUDE AND WISHES\n\nIt has been very flattering and pleasing for us to have received such kind encouragement in our work; \"The Grouard Echoes\" has many generous friends whom we wish to thank most sincerely today for their kindness. We wish to thank very specially, our inspector, Mr. Gilles, for his encouraging letter which we highly appreciated \u2014 also that of our Indian Agent, Mr. L'Houroux. May we offer our sincerest thanks also to all those generous friends who so kindly sent us financial aid? We were deeply touched by so much kindness and we are most grateful.\n\nOnce again the beautiful season of Christmas is here \u2014 and once again, we offer to our friends, all the loving wishes that we have in our hearts for them. To our many readers, far and near, we extend our sincerest wishes for a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, praying that the Divine Babe may hear our prayers on your behalf and grant you your hearts' desires.\n\nMerry Christmas! \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Happy New Year!\n\nGod bless you!\n\nThe Editors.\nTo His Excellency,\nMt. Rev. Joseph Guy,\nto whose helpful kindness this little paper owes its existence,\n\nwe lovingly and gratefully dedicate this issue of the Brouard Echoes\n\"PER CRUCEM AD LUCEM\"\n\nThey are gone, those beautiful days so filled with happiness and blessings! We gaze slowly and sadly around us... all speaks to us of him who was our father, our friend, our advocate for seven happy years. We recall the Mission as it was before his arrival. We admire now\u2014our beautiful new school, the renovated convent, the enlarged play yards, the spacious barns and sheds, the comfortable homes for our employees, and last of all, the wonderful new building for the boys\u2014a lasting monument to his loving solicitude\u2014and we realize fully all that our dear Bishop has done for us. The realization fills our hearts with gratitude but overwhelms us also with poignant regret for our loss. To escape from the loneliness that surges over us, we mount slowly to the classroom. But here again, we're met with reminders of his affectionate interest: the piano, the music cabinet, the beautiful pictures on the wall, the typewriter, our printing machine, and countless other treasures speak to us of our loss. Gazing up into his pictured face smiling down so kindly at us from the piano, we say:\n\n\"O kindest of fathers! it is hard, bitterly hard to give you up! You have been a kind, good father to all your flock, but to us, your Ground children, you have been more than a friend, more than a father; you have been an inspiration. God bless you for your loving kindness, your interest in all that concerned us! God bless you for having given us so beautiful an example of Christlike charity! You are gone, dear Father, and we are missing you, but in your new field of action, God bless you, we pray. And through the years, when memory brings the picture of your kindly face before us, we shall murmur softly, \"Dear Bishop Guy, God bless you!\"\n\n\"There is never a life without sadness, There is never a heart free from pain;\nIf one seeks in this world for true solace, He seeks for it ever in vain.\nSo, when to your poor heart comes sorrow, The deepest, perhaps, you have known.\n'Tis the touch of God's sickle at harvest, Since He reaps in the fields He has sown.\"\nVACATION.\n\nWe were glad to hear that Bishop Breynat was coming to visit us one day. Suddenly we heard something like an airplane and began to look around for it. Then we went down to the lake to see Bishop Breynat who was there. That evening, the Fathers and sisters and everybody went to see the plane. The pilot took some for a short ride; for some it was their first experience. When Mgr. Chrest and Mr. Mass went up, the pilot made loops and circles. When they came down again, the riders looked very white and sickly! They left the next morning at nine o'clock; it was beautiful to see the rising of the airplane. We hope to see them again.\n\nRoy Smith -- Grade V.\n\nWe find many kinds of wild berries in the woods. There were more raspberries than any other kind of berries this year. There were quite a few choke cherries and cranberries too. It rained too much in August and the raspberries would fall off. There were too bad to go berry picking too. Last year there were many a little but there were not many this year.\n\nCorr. Dossierkiss -- Harold Austen, Gr. V.\n\nOn Sunday, July 25th, we went for the pilgrimage of St. Anne at St. Bruno Mission. We got up very early so we could arrive there for the ten o'clock Mass. After our dinner, we visited the peoples' tents, and enjoyed it very much. Around two o'clock we had the procession. They sang some hymns while Bishop Guy carried the Blessed Sacrament. He told the people that this was the last pilgrimage yet because there were so many for the High Mass and other ceremonies. Afterwards we went to town with Sister Francis Desire\u00e9 and played around for a while, then went back to Groulx. We enjoyed the day very much.\n\nMalbo Cardinal -- Grade V.\n\nMerry Ann Cardinal was married to John Smith on August 25th. She wore a long white satin dress. Everything she had on was white, even her slippers. The witnesses were Agathe Cardinal with Henry Tomkins, Nellie Ghostkeeper with Harry Thomas, and Nancy Thomas with Leo Dufrane. Father Bemerge said the Mass and gave a nice little talk. They had a nice breakfast at the Fathers' house afterwards.\nSCHOOL DAYS! SCHOOL DAYS!\n\n\"Yes, we came all the way in the Mission truck, but we stopped at St. Bruno's for dinner. I was so surprised and sorry to hear that Sister Bernadette Clare is teaching there this year instead of in Grouard. Who is replacing her here? Sister Guy of the Savior? Are Mrs. Louis du Bois Pastuer and Henriette Eugenie the only two new Sisters this year? I'm sorry that Sister Fran\u00e7oise D\u00e9sir\u00e9e and Sr. George Wilfred are gone; we will miss them both, won't we? But I'm so glad that Sr. Mary Thecla and Sr. Jean Placidus are back from their visit to the United States. How hard I prayed for them while they were far away, so that they would come back here again.\n\nWhat's the new Father's name? What? Father Kindervater? Isn't he jolly? I saw him talking to Father Beaucage, and when I heard Fr. Kindervater laugh I had to laugh too, though I didn't know what they were laughing about! My! What a beautiful house the boys are going to have! Is it true the Mission trucks are hauling day and night? And they say there are thirty men working there\u2014many of them experts from Saskatchewan or Southern Alberta. Pardon me? O, yes, indeed! I'm glad to be back at school! Especially since I am to be in the Senior class this year and to be Sr. Jean's pupil! How anxious I am for morning so I can start in. I will always consider tomorrow a red-letter day!\n\nJean Bellrose\u2014Grade VI.\n\nWhen Sister Jean Placidus came home to Grouard after three long months away from us, she brought back many nice things for the classroom. We were so glad to hear that her brother had given her a nice Brunswick portable with many records. Sister also brought her mother's radio for the school. Now in our class, we have three nice musical instruments. The Jesuit Fathers in Icikin gave Sr. M. Thecla fifty nice rolls for our piano. So you can imagine what a musical year we will have! Some of Sister Jean's friends also gave her many nice pictures and books which we enjoy looking at? Don't you wish you were in our classroom? I'm sure you do!\n\nMabel Noakewi\u2014Grade VIII. Simone Dufrane\u2014Sr. VE\nThe old pupils who are continuing their studies went back to their different schools. Nancy Thomas, Mary Jane Sinclair and Nora Mohr went back to St. Augustine's at Peace River, but Florence Cunningham went to the Normal at Calgary.\n\nPaul Hurubise who was at the Junior College with Harry Thomas is now going to the Jesuit College with the Fowrgus boys. Harry Thomas of course is back at the Junior too. He wrote and said that Greek is no big job! Two of our last year's pupils are keeping on their studies: Jonny Gordon is going to school at High Prairie and Raymond L'Hirondelle is going to High School at Peace River. Good luck to you, dear old schoolmates!\n\nJIMMY THOMAS --- Gr. VIII.\n\nMOTHER PROVINCIAL'S VISIT\n\nMother Provincial came here in the beginning of July to visit. Sister Mary Theola and Sister Jean Pl\u00e9chais did not see her because they were not here. So when they came back, Sr. Superior went with them to McLennan to see Mother Provincial as she was there then. Then they came back they brought Sister Mireille with them; she went to the hospital in August. On Sept. 12th, Mother came with Sr. Gertrude McGillis but left the next day. Sr. Mireille stayed here about fifteen days and then went to Vancouver to have an operation. We are praying so she will be well again.\n\nMRS. RUTZINGER --- Gr. V.\n\nTHE NEW BUILDING\n\nThe new house that they are making for the boys is beautiful. It is of brick and it is 110 feet long by 40 feet wide. It is three stories high and is entirely fireproof. The floors are made of cement. For the ceilings they have many big irons and iron pillars to hold it up. The walls are made of brick and tiles. They will put some plaster on the walls of the house to make it nicer. The outside of the house is made of bricks and there is a cross made of cement in the front center. On the right hand side of the cross is written A.D. which means \"In the\nyear of the Lord\" or \"Anno Domini\" as they say in Latin. On the left side is marked 1937. We are very proud of that house because it is the only fireproof building in the country. In our next issue, we will describe it and perhaps draw a picture of it for you.\n\nGeorge Califer -- Gr. VIII ... Jeremie Cardinal -- Gr. VII.\n\nDuring vacation, Mrs. Quirion with her daughter and Yvonne Dion cooked for all the hired men who were working on the new building. A few weeks ago Mrs. Quirion was seriously hurt in an automobile accident and is now in the McLennan hospital. Since then the working men are having their meals at the man's refectory. Mr. and Mrs. Assent and their children are now living in Mrs. Quirion's house which was Mr. Liz\u00e9e's house before. Mr. and Mrs. Liz\u00e9e are now in charge of the mission farm.\n\nLena Twin -- Gr. VI.\n\nMORE CHANGES\n\nAbout two weeks ago, Rev. Fr. Lejoie, the changed from St. Augustine's Mission so he could come here to replace the Bishop until the new Bishop arrives. We bid Fr. Lejoie a hearty welcome to Ground and we promise to be so pleasant that he will not be too lonesome for his Peace River children.\n\nFr. Beauchamp our dear Catechism teacher left us to go to be the Superior of Peace River Mission. We were very sorry to see him go because he was so good to us. But Fr. Proulx who was sick in the McLennan hospital came back and is now teaching us Catechism. We like him very much and hope he may be a good teacher like Fr. Beauchamp.\n\nSister A. Riberdy came here a few weeks ago to replace Sr. Marcelline as Sacristan. Sister has a twin sister whom she left at Kenora, but we are hoping she may come and join her sister here soon.\n\nAnnie Thomas -- Gr. VII.\n\nMrs. Walter - driving through the country saw two regimentmen climbing a telephone pole. \"These men,\" she said haughtily, \"must think I never drove a car before.\"\n**POATOE**\n\nOne morning while we were in school studying, one of the sisters came and told Sr. Jean Flechidus that we were going to start the potatoes. We were kind of glad because we knew we were going to have fun. When we went to the big field on the other hill we didn't know the boys were trying to beat us. Then we heard that we started counting our sacks. Also, but were beaten by the boys, we had picked 1500 sacks of potatoes. While we were picking, the men were finishing the new root cellar which is all made of cement. We knew the potatoes will not rot so easily now. The following Saturday Sr. Mary Auxiliatrice and the boys went to the farm to pick all the potatoes for Mr. Liz\u00e9e. They had much fun and enjoyed the truck ride too.\n\nFrank Giroux --- Gr. VI.\n\n**INSPECTOR'S VISIT**\n\nOne morning we heard that Mr. Gillis, our new inspector, was coming to our classroom. We were anxious to see him, yet we were rather afraid to go to school. But as soon as we saw him, we decided we liked him because he reminded us so much of Mr. Liz\u00e9e, the Bishop's chauffeur. Mr. Gillis is tall, has brown eyes and a gentle smile. He stayed in our room all forenoon, and we enjoyed every minute of it. Before he left, we sang several songs for him. If he enjoyed his visit as much as we did, Mr. Gillis must have pleasant memories of Grouard!\n\nHelen Miller --- Gr. VII.\n\n**FAST DAYS**\n\nOn September 29th, we had a good holiday because it was Sr. Superior's feast. We enjoyed playing the gramophone in the girls' hall. In the afternoon all the boys and girls had each an apple, some candy and ice-cream which tasted very good. We also had a little program in the girls' hall. It was done only by a few girls. Some sang and others played different little games.\n\nRosalie Wabicon --- Gr.VI.\nOn the eve of Fr. Falher's feast, we had an interesting program. How happy we were that Bishop Guy and Mgr. Charost were here to unite their wishes to ours for our pastor's feast. All the Fathers and Sisters came, also the men working at the mission came with their wives.\n\nThe program was started by a beautiful festal song then Ernest Giroux read the address. We played Fr. Falher's favorite pieces on our flutes, then Fred Giroux as Uncle Podgor caused a lot of excitement and laughter by his accidents, when trying to hang a picture. We also reported our \"Historical Trivologic.\" The German song, on account of its queer sounding words, nearly took the house down. I'm sure Fr. Bruckert would have been proud to see that we remembered so well the song he taught us last spring.\n\nDorothy Phillips \u2014 Gr. VIII\n\nMgr. Charost came with the big red truck to get us dry scholars for the concert in honor of Fr. Falher, because we older girls were in the program. As soon as we got to the Mission, Sr. John Precious brought us into the chapel for benediction. All the people then came in the classroom where the concert was taking place. After all was over Sr. Superior brought two big pans full of apples which Fr. Falher gave to all the children. When it was time to go home Mgr. Charost got Bishop's car and he took us home in it. We were all very glad because it is not often we have a chance to ride in the Bishop's car. We'll think of dear Mgr. Charost for his kindness. Fr. Falher said that he enjoyed this program better than any other he had attended for a long time.\n\nKathleen Morton \u2014 Gr. VI\n\nIt happened that Mgr. Charost's feast came the next day after Fr. Falher's, so on the sixth of October (his birthday) he said Mass in our chapel. The hymns were lovely, and we tried our very best to sing well for it was his last feast in Grouard.\n\nMargie Budskin \u2014 Gr. VI\nELECTIONS\n\nWe the pupils of Grade IV and Grade V had our elections on Oct. 1st. We chose Mary Twin for President, Victor Twin for our vice-president and Victoria Ballerose for our Secretary. We wanted to have it on Oct. 1st because it was near the feast of St. Therese of the Child Jesus. Sister explained our motto to us and she also talked about our patroness. Our aims are to be obedient, speak out in class and to give good example. Our motto is \"Onward and Upward\" and our colors are pink and green, the same as last year.\n\nCharlotte Gladu \u2014 Gr. IV.\n\nFAREWELL TO THESE\n\nI had never thought that such sad days could come to the Mission, for I had been here over four years, and I thought that it would always be a happy place in which to live. I realize now what sadness is, because ever since June when we heard that our dear Bishop and his secretary would be leaving us, our hearts have been very sad. Now that they are gone, we are lonesome and wish the dear Lord had not taken them away from us. But I suppose this is our cross which we must carry bravely if we want to reach Heaven some day.\n\nBishop Guy and Msgr. Cherest had been away for some time because they went to assist at the Churchill Jubilee, and when they came back, we realized that they had just one month left to stay with us. Many people came from all over to see them before they left and to say Goodbye. As October 20th drew nearer and nearer, we became very sad. On October 17th, all the people of Grouard came to the Girls' Hall where a Farewell reunion was held. It was very hard to sing and to talk, but we did our best to make our last little concert nice. Floroma Shaw read a very beautiful and sad address; three times she had to stop, because she was crying. Dorothy Phillips recited a very touching poem, and then two girls sang a song called \"We'll Not Forget\" which made many people cry. Then Frank Giroux, who always makes everyone laugh when he is in a play, came to speak his lines ... but instead,\nhe burst out crying, and could not say a word. After the children finished their parts, Fr. Falher got up and told the Bishop how grateful we were for all he had done for us, and expressed his deep regret over the departure of both His Excellency and his devoted secretary. Then Mr. Ausetant read an address in French, Willie H\u00e9bert read one in Cree, then Mrs. Maurice spoke in English, saying that our loss is Or. Volbourg's &c. Dan Cunningham expressed the regrets of the Half-Breeds while Mgr. Thomas-Giroux spoke for the old pupils.\n\nWhen all the speeches were over, Bishop Guy got up to speak. How attentively we listened to the last words of our beloved Bishop. He then presented a beautiful certificate of Bravery from the Government to Sr. Mary Auxiliatrice and another to Harry Fraser for their heroism at the fire last winter, and told us to follow these examples. After that we all went outside to have our pictures taken, as a souvenir of our last reunion. Fr. Sorrent and the St. Bruno Sisters, also Fathers Bouveng and Mdeau from Peace River, were there too.\n\nThis morning, Oct. 20th, Mgr. Chrest said his last Mass in Grouard in our chapel at 11 a.m. Then the Bishop said his last six. We sang hymns, though we found it hard to do anything but cry\u2014our hearts were so sad. At 8 o'clock, the Bishop, Mgr. Chrest and the Fathers went to the cemetery for a last prayer beside the quiet graves of the other three Bishops of Grouard, then all assembled for the last prayers and the blessing of our dear Bishop. Outside, the Bishop's car was waiting, and as soon as it started it was followed by the two big trucks filled with the children and Sisters. This was the first time we had gone for a ride on a sad occasion\u2014as Fr. Falher had said, it was like a funeral. We went to the station, and watched the train coming. When we had waved our last Goodbyes and watched the train out of sight our hearts were very heavy for we realized that our kind Bishop was gone for good. Everyone said that our loss was a double one because Mgr. Chrest whom everyone loves, is gone too. We are glad that he will be near the Bishop to help him in all his cares, but we will miss Mgr. Chrest.\nvery much, because he was always so very kind and helpful to everybody. The Bishop promised us that they would both come back and pay us a visit some day. We hope that promise will come true very soon. Until then we are keeping our promise and are praying very hard, so that God may bless them both and make them happy in their new life.\n\nMary O'Keefe\u2014Ruth Morden \u2014Gr. VIII.\n\nSOME DAY\n\nNot now, but in the coming years,\nWhen we have reached the Better Land,\nWe'll know the meaning of our tears,\nAnd all we do not understand.\n\nWe'll know why friends we love the best\nAre forced to leave us with our woes,\nWhy strangers come to take their place,\nWhose hearts are not as true as theirs.\n\nHope, then, my soul, the God of old\nIs guiding thee with kindly hand.\nThe plan of life He'll soon unfold,\nWhen we meet in the Better Land.\nChristmas Greetings\n\nChristmas is coming\nChristmas is here!\nWe send you a greeting\nFull of good cheer.\n\nThe Christmas Card shown above will wish all our Readers A Happy Christmas and at the same time show what the Grade One pupils made for Christmas. The drawing at the left shows the outside of the card when finished.\nRe-organization of Our Magazine.\n\nRev. Father Balter, Sister Superior and the teachers had a meeting and decided that the four classrooms unite to publish a school journal. Each class-room will give short stories or articles and in this way all the pupils will help in the making of the school Journal. The name Blue Quills Moccasin Telegram will be the same as before. We will change the cover for Christmas so we will send them earlier.\n\nTheresa Iaskweyak \u2014 Grade VII.\n\nStory of the Blue Quills School\n\nby the Senior Boys' Class.\n\nWe have read with much interest the Journals coming from the different Indian schools. We find them most interesting. It is the first time our class has written for a Journal, and we do it with pleasure. We would like to tell you something about our school so that we may be more acquainted. We have the benefit here of a large modern school. We know much work has had to be done in the past before it was possible to have this fine school. We owe much to the Oblates Fathers and the Sisters of Charity, whom we more often call the Grey Nuns. We, the pupils of the Boys' Class have been asked to tell the story of the Blue Quills school, so my friend Adolphus will begin farther on in this Journal.\n\nJoseph MacGilvery \u2014 Grade VII.\n\nVisit of Bishop Pallaise.\n\nOn November 4th Bishop Pallaise gave us a surprise by visiting us. He was with Father Lemoine, Provincial, and another priest. They arrived just in time for supper and there was great excitement in getting supper ready for them. I know this as I am working in the kitchen this month.\n\nThe next morning all the children went to attend the Bishop's Mass. Most of them went to holy Communion as it was the First Friday of the month. Of course we kissed his ring first and then we received the Host.\n\nThe Bishop and the two priests went to Frog Lake to bless the two crosses that are to mark the places where the two priests were murdered during the Riel Rebellion. (Father Marchand and Father Lafond.) The priests were killed there but their bodies were brought to St. Albert.\n\nRoseanna Cardinal \u2014 Grade VII.\n\nAt Frog Lake.\n\nMy home is at Legoff. My grandfather's name was Delaney. He was a Farm Instructor at Frog Lake. My mother often spoke to me about my late grandfather who had been killed at Frog Lake about half a century ago. Rev. Father Lafond was going to hear my dying grandfather's confession when suddenly a shell of a gun went through him and Father Lafond fell dead to the ground. I am going to draw a picture of the two crosses that Father Langlois put up at Frog Lake.\n\nEric Martineau \u2014 Grade IV.\n\nDoctor Hill's Visit.\n\nOn Wednesday, November 3rd, Dr. Hill, the Indian agent of Onion Lake came to visit our school with Joe John from there. Rev. Father Balter had a long talk with Dr. Hill while Joe John saw his two nieces, Theresa and Jeannette. Dr. Hill went away that same evening.\n\nJeanne Janvier \u2014 Grade VI.\nA Narrow Escape\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Nov. 18th, around three o'clock something very exciting happened.\n\nPaul Fluet, a new employee was hauling coal from St. Paul with a team of horses. He drove to where they empty the coal and as they were peeling, one of the horses fell into the hole with his hind legs. His front legs and half of his body were on the top while the horses on him was all broken up. Four other employees came to help but they could not pull him out. Then they quickly ran in and tried to get him down by the inside. They at last succeeded. Then they led him out of the furnace room and then by the furnace. It was rather difficult for the poor horse to go up the stairway in going out again. But you buy imagine how gladly the horse galloped with joy when he was out again after such a hard struggle. Here is the picture I drew of how he looked when he fell in.\n\nTherena Paqweyak \u2014 GPM VII.\n\nConclusion of The Story of Blue Quills School.\n\nI wish to tell you first about the Fathers who at different times have been in charge of our school. While it was on the Sande Lake Reserve there have been besides the ones already mentioned: Father Levesque, Father Lefebvre and Anglin, who all helped us to make good reputations. Then I would like to say something about two of these Fathers whom I am glad to have as Principals while I was a pupil. First I began to like to remember Father Anglin who was here when I was a little boy and our prayers go in his behalf to the Great Master in Heaven. Besides, we would often hear about our good Principal Father Salter. After doing so many years of his life to the School when I was on the Reserve, he has come to us here in the Blue Quills.\nTo make you understand much in a few words I will say; we pray he may stay with us many years.\n\nArthur MacFetters - Grade VII.\n\nA Mass for our Dead.\n\nOn Nov. 3rd Sister said that it would be fine to have a Mass for the children who died in our School. We started to give the money on Nov. 10th. When we knew that we could not pay the dollar we went to the boys' room and asked them if they would help us to pay the dollar. On Nov. 30th we had $1.05. Each of the four class-rooms had given something. We expected only a low Mass but Father Balter gave us a High Mass instead. The Requiem Mass was on the first of December and all the children sang the parts of the Mass. Here are the children who paid the money.\n\nBernadette Metchawee --- Grade IV.\n\nOffering to have a Mass said for these children who died while in our School: Pierre Cardinal --- Suzanne Cryer --- Annie Katchimut --- Joseph Jonas Cardinal.\n\nElizabeth Houle --- Theresa Pitre --- 10\u00a2\nMadeleine Blackman --- Alice Nayottatik --- 5\u00a2\nMargaret D. Large --- Patrick Gladu --- 5\u00a2\nTheresa Taskwayuk --- Agnes Cardinal --- 5\u00a2\nRoseanna Cardinal --- Adolphus Half --- 10\u00a2\nRosie Cardinal --- Stanley Cardinal --- 4\u00a2\nDavid Stamp --- Mr. S. Pitre --- 10\u00a2\nJoseph Redcrow --- Albert Cardinal --- 3\u00a2\nEric Martineau --- Francois Loth --- 5\u00a2\nErnest LeClerc --- 5\u00a2\n\nTotal --- $1.05\n\nFun on the Feast of St. Catherine.\n\nWe had lots of fun on St. Catherine's Feast. In the morning nearly all the girls went to Mass except those who had some work in the kitchen and in the dining-room.\n\nAt school we had an Arithmetic game the first, the second was Bible History and if we knew we put up our hands. The teacher called one to say it. After we had a peanut. When we went down to dinner we had some taffy. After supper all of the older girls went to help in the kitchen and in the dining-room that we could be finished early. Sister Houle waited for the kitchen girls. The Sisters from St. Theresa Hospital in St. Paul came and the Sisters all went up to the Sisters' parlor. Miss Marie Ange Thibert came to keep us. We played Bingo and the one who won got something. After we finished playing Bingo the girls started to dance. Three best players played mouth-organ. One came to take the place when one got tired. After we took our lunch and the Sisters did too. Then we went to bed.\n\nAlice Nayottatik --- Grade IV.\n\nMr. Schmidt's Visit.\n\nMr. Schmidt, the Inspector, came on Friday, Nov. 27th but we did not know he was here. We were very surprised to see him on Saturday morning when we went to Mass. It was so nice to see him receiving Holy Communion. Monday morning Mr. Gullion, the Indian Agent, took him to Lac La Biche in his car. Mr. Schmidt came back on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, Dec. 8th. We were glad to hear him sing so well and it gave us a good push. After High Mass, Sister Reule said that we sang loud that time. We were sure that we had pleased everybody. Agnes Cardinal said she hoped he would come back to help us sing on Christmas.\n\nJane Whiskyjack --- Grade V.\n\nWants to be wise like Solomon.\n\nWe have Catechism every day from 1:30 P.M. till 2 o'clock. When Father Balter cannot come our teacher teaches the lesson. We have Bible History. One of the stories I liked best was the way Solomon could find out to which woman the baby belonged. I was glad the mother got back her son. I wish to be wise like Solomon. Our History says he got wisdom because he prayed to the Lord for it. That made me think that I should pray much. Elie Noel - Gr. IV.\nmuch for the magazine and the letter.\n\nGive my best regards to all the pupils I knew, also to the Sisters.\n\nYour very sincerely,\nRobert Anderson.\n\nRobert and his father are taking the treatment for Tuberculosis. They were in the General Hospital for about a year before going to the University Hospital.\n\nOur New Skating Rink\n\nWe are working on a new skating rink. As soon as it is cold enough we will put on the water. Father Allard got us some new skates and some of the boys have new hockey sticks. We will have pleasure skating and playing hockey this winter.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Blackman \u2014 Grade VI.\n\nJokes in Our School\n\nOne forenoon in the kitchen as a girl was filling her dessert bowl too much \u2014 with peaches \u2014 the Sister in charge of the cooking said; \"Say, Catherine, that bowl is too full.\" The girl replied; \"No Sister, it is because my bowl is too small.\"\n\nOn another occasion a little girl in grade two had to make a sentence with \"whiskers\" but did not know what it meant so she said; \"The whiskers can run\", thinking it was some kind of an animal.\n\nRoseanna Cardinal \u2014 Grade VII.\n\nBible History Stories\n\nWe are making a booklet for Bible History, and we are pasting pictures in it. We are writing stories in it too, and this is the story I wrote about.\n\nSodom\n\nThe angels are coming with Lot and his two daughters. Lot's wife was turned into a pillar of salt because she turned back. The city was burned because there were too many wicked people. There is now a lake. It is called \"Dead Sea\". This story teaches us that God punishes the wicked people.\n\nMargaret Cardinal \u2014 Grade IV.\n\nNews Items\n\nNancy Janvier was not well since she had the measles in June but she came back to school again on Oct. 9th. She stayed here for almost a month. Then she went to bed on Nov. 7th. When her came she had been taken to the hospital. She went home to Lagoff with her mother. Lately we heard that Nancy was feeling better.\n\nReverend Sister Superior went to St. Theresa Hospital to get all her teeth out. She went on Nov. 30th. She stayed four days in the hospital and came back on Saturday morning Dec. 4th.\n\nSister Ida Thibert works in the kitchen and she is a very good cook. On Nov. 29th she went to bed because she had the Grippe. She was taken to the hospital on Dec. 3rd. We all hope that she will soon recover from her sickness and come back again to our school.\n\nCaroline Janvier \u2014 Grade VI.\nMiss Theresa Paskey, President of the Tekakwitha Club,\nBlue Quills Residential School.\n\nNovember 27th, 1937.\n\nDear Friends,\n\nI want to thank you in the name of my class for your kind invitation to join the School Paper Club. We enjoyed reading your club magazine and met copy would be most welcome. We have decided to make a little bit of money by selling our club magazine. We will be glad to help you with any questions you may have.\n\nYour little Indian friends,\n\nby Jean Baptiste Lafl\u00e8che.\n\nThe pupils of Holy Family School.\n\nNovember 27th, 1937.\n\nDear Sister,\n\nHere I am to thank you for the kind letter such a happy surprise to poor little me in the land of ice and snow! I am very enthusiastic over your school magazine. I think it is a splendid way of broadening pupils' minds and getting them interested in something beyond their own little personal world. Pupils must be led to interpret others and the outside world. We will do that for us. After all, it's a self-centered, direct citizenship; besides being a tremendous opportunity for civilization and cooperation.\n\nAn old maid wished to marry a man but could not get him. So one evening she went in the church to pray. She did not see the priest who was there also. Thinking she was alone she knelt before the crib and began to pray out loud with great devotion. \"Oh Lord, that I may marry this man! May he be good to me! Make him love me!\" The priest hiding behind the post said in a shrill childlike voice: \"No one does not love you! He does not want you!\" The\n\nIndian Affairs - School Files (RG 10, Volume 6054, File 150-62, part 1)\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\n\ncollectionscanada.gc.ca\nHow We Expect to Spend Christmas.\n\nWe usually go to bed early after supper for we have to get up before twelve.\n\nDuring the second and third Masses we sing hymns in Cree and English. After Mass we go down to the dining-room to take our lunch of doughnuts and cocoa. Then we go to bed for we are quite tired. In the morning we take our breakfast and besides we have some popcorn or sometimes apples.\n\nDuring the day we play games and in the evening, that is the time we have the most fun, as we have our Christmas Tree.\n\nAll the boys and girls and the Staff are assembled in our room as usual. But Santa Claus comes in the last. He then starts to call each one and asks us to do something for him, such as singing and dancing; then he gives us the toys. We again get some more candies and peanuts.\n\nSo I hope we will have some fun again this year as we usually do.\n\nMargaret Mary Large \u2014 Grade VI.\n\nA New Year's Wish.\n\nTake my wish and take my blessing\nHere beside the New Year's door;\nMay the grace of God be with you\nThis year, next year, evermore.\n\n.................\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created":
