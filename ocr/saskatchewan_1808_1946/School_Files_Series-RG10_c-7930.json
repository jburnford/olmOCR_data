His letter reads as follows:\n\n\"We have for attention your letter of the 14th instant in connection with the extension of the Fort Frances water supply to the Indian School. Your request for a full report and detailed plan of the installation has been noted.\n\nUnder date of August 5 last we forwarded a memorandum by Mr. J.T. Ross, of this staff and a print from a plot made by Mr. D.J. Gibson, D.M.S., dated November 24, 1946 and entitled \"Map of Indian Reserve No. 1, Rainy Lake District Rainy River\". I would refer you to this correspondence so that you may understand the difficulty in providing a detailed plan that can be accurately used to show locations of this pipe line as actually constructed. This print did not cover the land operated by the Indian School and so far as we can learn, no plan exists at Fort Frances although it is possible that such a plan is available in the Indian Affairs Branch. The actual construction of the line and connection to the school was carried out by the Town of Fort Frances without supervision from this office inasmuch as the Town is by agreement held responsible for the maintenance of the water line. We can, of course, secure from the town a description of the method of construction and what material was put into the job. However, the town has no engineer and I do not believe have any plans showing the construction. To give all the details asked for in your letter would involve a considerable amount of survey work in the field by this office and we are not in a position to do this until next summer.\n\nBy the terms of the agreement, which is now awaiting signature at Ottawa, the Town of Fort Frances undertook to carry out certain work and accept certain responsibilities. This work has been completed and they have assumed these responsibilities. The responsibility of the Indian Affairs Branch was to contribute $6,000.00 towards this work; presumably before the work was instituted. I could ask, therefore, that there be no further delay in connection with the payment to the Town of Fort Frances.\"\n\nR. A.

Webster, local electrician, and they decided to put in a new independent service from outside the building and installed a separate meter.\n\nThere was nothing wrong with the new stove supplied and the fault lay in not determining the load on the service, which, with added meters etc. since the line was installed, had overtaxed the load.

As the school was without heat it was necessary to engage a steam fitter to connect up the high pressure boiler, which is hand fired, and used in the laundry to the intake line of the school so that it would act as a stand-by until repairs can be made on the stoker.

Instead of \"Attendance of Fort Frances Fire Brigade at Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church\", it should read\n\n\"Attendance of Fort Frances Fire Brigade at Fort Frances Residential School in order to save the school from possible destruction owing to the fire that occurred in the church located near the school.\"\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard E.

However, exception was taken to this price by this office and a reduction to $285.17 resulted. As this is the amount that the meter would have cost f.o.b. Fort Frances, if delivered direct from the manufacturers, we have approved the account and would ask that payment be made as promptly as possible.\n\nAccording to terms of the agreement covering the installation of the water supply to the Indian Residential School, His Majesty agrees to supply a three inch water meter approved by the Superintendent of Water Works System of the Town of Fort Frances.

They have carried out work at this school in the past under Mr. Gow's direction, and he has found them to be very reliable; consequently he requested them to submit an estimate to him which he will forward to us as soon as possible. In the meantime, we are forwarding to Mr. Gow for his information our own estimate of the cost of this work.\n\nAs a result of a more complete layout covering in particular revisions to the walk-in refrigerator, you are advised that approximately $700.00 must be added to our original estimate of $2,500. This means that Indian Affairs should be advised to provide about $3,200 for this work.\n\nMr. Smith of the Smith Construction Company, urged that an early decision be reached in order to enable him to plan for materials and labour.

We are cancelling this encumbrance as the one recently issued to you will cover the total expenditure.\n\nSince approving the repairs mentioned in your memorandum of September 23rd we have had communication from the Indian agent indicating the school is having considerable trouble with their electric system due to the volume of electric current being used at the present time.\n\nWe have no funds on hand to make extensive repairs to the wiring system and we feel their circuits should not be unnecessarily overloaded.\n\nIncluded in the improvements that you intend to make is a walk-in refrigerator, the installation of which will involve the use of additional electric current.\n\nI thought it advisable to bring this matter to your attention so that additional loading of the electric system will not be incurred.\n\nDirector,\nMISSIONARY OBLATES OF MARY IMMACULATE\nINDIAN WELFARE AND TRAINING COMMISSION.\n\nFebruary 17th 49.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Alterations to Indian Residential School at Fort Frances.\n\nMy dear Mr. Thelan,\n\nAs promised, I am enclosing plans prepared by Mr. Buck for the above alterations.

At that time your Branch had prepared a plan indicating the work which should be done (see Index No. 852).\n\nYou also obtained a quotation of $3,200.00 for the work (your memorandum of 9th September, 1947, File IA 1380-3).\n\nFunds were not available at that time, and consequently, no action was taken. Recently we received a request from the management of the school to proceed with the work which was proposed in 1947. We would appreciate it if you would obtain a new tender and advise us at what cost you can have the work carried out.\n\nPP/ST\n\nDirector.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to Reverend V. de Varennes, C.M.,\n\nAddress: Principal, Indian Residential School,\nFort Frances, Ontario.\n\nDATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT\n---|---|---\nFeb. 28 | To allowance towards salary of Night Watchman at the Fort Frances Indian Residential School at the rate of $60.00 per month (1 month @ $60.00 per month) | $60.00\n\nClass No. 516-01-819\n\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Preference for GLOBE TUBULAR STEEL DESKS is found wherever the best is demanded.\n\nGLOBE TUBULAR STEEL SCHOOL DESK CONSTRUCTION\nA Few Reasons for Their Great Popularity\n\n1. TUBULAR STEEL STANDARD\u2014Just as nature puts its greatest strength in the hollow spaces (the wheat straw, the bamboo, the bone structure), so the great strength of GLOBE TUBULAR STEEL is obtained by the triangular hollow tube construction. Breakage is entirely eliminated in shipping and in actual use.\n\n2. LIVE FOOT FASTENING\u2014Nature provides the example for the striking principle of the LIVESTRAFFIC in the feet of GLOBE TUBULAR STEEL DESKS. The outer rim only is in contact with the floor. This provides reserve area to absorb shocks. The flat footed desk is a weakness. The solid surface, flat on the floor provides no means for absorbing stress or strain.\n\n3. CONTINUOUS LIVE FASTENINGS OF STEEL PARTS TO WOOD\u2014The principle of screwing a nut on a bolt is so simple it cannot be questioned. The threads of the nut engaging in the continuous series of spirals on the bolt results in a powerful holding device. It is effective because it is continuous. The \"continuous fastening\" of wood parts to metal in GLOBE TUBULAR STEEL DESKS is effective because the wood parts grip the serpentine steel flanges with a continuous HOLD over the full extent of the contact of wood and steel. An exclusive GLOBE feature.\n\n4. NOISELESS SEAT HINGE\u2014Because the parts are perfect in design and dimension, a quality made possible by the use of high grade steel, noise and wear are almost entirely eliminated. The special design provides positive stops to the fold without jar or noise. The operation is smooth and silent. No oiling or adjusting is ever required.\n\n5. EASE OF ASSEMBLING\u2014Simple and effective method of assembling\u2014easily understood\u2014requires no expert ability to erect and install. A flange of dovetail type, termed \"Serpentine\" because of its irregular shape, is a part of the steel framework of the desk, which engages into dovetail grooves cut into the wood parts of the desk. These serpentine flanges engage the wood to a depth of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of an inch with an undercut grip of \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) of an inch and when driven firmly in position, exert a constant live tension that assures rigidity and firmness to the completed desk. Screws at proper places reinforce the automatic attachment, while two screws engage from the under side through top into the back.\nStyle No. 10 New Globe Combination Desk\n\nTwo Styles\u2014Single and Double Entire.\n\nSizes\u2014Stocked in five standard sizes of Desks, Rears and Fronts.\n\nForm Fitting Backs and Seats\u2014Hygienic, made to fit the pupil so as to provide comfortable and healthful accommodation for each child.\n\nStandards\u2014Globe special style, double truss design, cast iron, smooth, neat, and graceful, tough and durable.\n\nSeat Hinges\u2014Globe exclusive patented Ball Bearing\u2014no contact of iron against iron.

S. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nOn my way to the Fur Conference at Fort William this week I called at the Fort Frances Residential School, Fort Frances. I was speaking to Father Le Varenses, Principal of the School and he advised me that he had on hand a pump, air compressor, storage tanks and gasoline tank which would be suitable for pumping water at one of our other schools. These items are no longer of any use at this school as the water works system has been installed in the town of Fort Frances.\n\nThe water situation at Sandy Bay is more or less a source of trouble and eventually we will have to put in a water system from the lake. Would it be possible to transfer the equipment on hand at the Fort Frances School to the Sandy Bay School? Same could be put into storage until such time as we are able to have water put in from the lake. I feel that this should be placed in this year's estimates and proceeded with next year. The present system at the Sandy Bay School is not satisfactory if a fire occurred.\n\nIf the transfer is recommended the equipment could be shipped to Amaranth, Manitoba, a distance of three miles from Sandy Bay Residential School. Please advise if you approve of the above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S. Lewis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n12th May, 1949.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your letter of the 5th instant with reference to the pump, air compressor, storage tanks and gasoline engine which are suitable for pumping water and are surplus to requirements at the Fort Frances Indian Residential School.\n\nWe approve your suggestion that the items mentioned be transferred to the Sandy Bay Residential School, and you may make the necessary arrangements accordingly.\n\nBernard F.

This was submitted by Wellington Smith Limited of Fort Frances in the sum of $5,475.00 with electric wiring to be charged extra to this sum.\n\nThis price is considerably higher than the original rough estimate of $3,300.00 submitted by the P.H. Smith Company in October 1947. We have discussed the matter with Indian Affairs officials on the telephone and they have indicated their intention to proceed with the work on the basis of the tendered price.\n\nWhile the price as stated is high, it is not considered exorbitant as there are of necessity, many uncertainties to be encountered in a job of this nature.\n\nIt is pointed out that the tender varies in one respect from the requirements called for on our design. The Wellington Smith Limited proposal to install a metal hood over the kitchen range to connect to the chimney using natural draught instead of an exhaust fan as called for. We do not concur with this suggestion as the movement of air required to ventilate this area cannot be obtained by natural draught. Further, it is against recognized principles to install a ventilating pipe and connect same to a chimney.\n\nWe are advised verbally that the Indian Affairs Branch will prepare a memorandum to Council requesting authority to have the work carried out for the above sum. They have requested that this Branch take on supervision of the project, which can conveniently be handled by Mr. Gow's office.\n\nA.H. Hargreaves,\nfor Chas. R.

Smith Ltd.  \n\nYou may know that the Frigidaire Unit we have now is about 15 years old and inadequate in strength and quality because running with Sulphur gas. You are aware also that too oftentimes the Department and ourselves are spending money in replacing valve and overhauling due to the corrosive effect of the Sulphur gas.  \n\nIf we would install the old Unit in the new room, it will require some expenses and it will be for only a short while because our Unit is too old to stand an heavy load due to a larger Refrigerator.  \n\nI believe it wise to change this old Unit for a new one with H.P. stronger, i.e., H.P. with Freon gas, while they are making a new modern Refrigerator room.  \n\nI enclosed one copy of Specification and price Quotations submitted by The J.H. Ashdown Hardware Co. of Winnipeg for your information.  \n\nYours devotedly,  \n\n[Signature]  \n\nV. de Varennes  \nC.M.I.\nFort Frances, Ont., Sept. 30th, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRe: File 463-5 (E1)\n\nI have been requested by the Principal at the Residential School to forward the enclosed specification and quotations covering a new unit for the Frigidaire which is going to be enlarged.\n\nKindly advise if consideration will be given as requested for a new unit as the present one has been giving considerable trouble.\n\nJ.F.

It was noted however that this equipment was not new by any means, but appeared to be operating satisfactorily and its replacement was not considered necessary at that time.\n\nHowever, due to the inferior design of the old refrigerating space, in which it was necessary to use the space as a combination cooler and pantry, necessitating frequent opening of the entrance door, it can be taken for granted that the compressor unit was called upon to provide a rugged service. This type of service contributed to a more rapid deterioration than would originally have been the case.\n\nIt is our opinion that the new refrigerating equipment as outlined by the J.H. Ashdown Hardware Company Limited is justified and their proposition appears to be fair and reasonable.\n\nIf the Indian Affairs Branch wish to authorize this work, it is felt that it should be classed under the heading of maintenance and not be considered as an extra to the Wellington Smith Company Contract covering the structural revisions to the building.\n\nWe are returning herewith the submission prepared by the J.H. Ashdown Hardware Company Limited.\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief, Engineering and Construction Division.\n\nEnc.\n\nR.A.

In order to be sure of the position of the land, I have had the enclosed telegram sent to Fort Francis and the Indian Reserve in order that I shall be able to inform Your Grace should the land prove to have worked on the land \u2014 the position of the twenty acres of land which you desire to secure. I may add that it is within the bounds of any of the reserves shown on the tracing; it will be impossible for the department to dispose of the same, as these reserves are held subject to confirmation by the Government of Ontario, and until they are so confirmed (the important is not in a position even after the Indians surrender any part of the reserves, to convey a title to any land included in them.\nThe Department might be prepared, however, to give permission to a portion of the reserved land being occupied for missionary purposes; and on the return of the tracing with the land desired marked thereon, if it be within the Indian Reserves, Your Grace will be informed as to whether the Department can grant the permission.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYour Grace's obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy Minister\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nHis Grace Archbishop Langevin,\nSt. Boniface.\nFor the benefit of the Great Discoverer (signature)\n\nAssuming it would be advisable to reserve a right of copy in certain cases, I have been the more anxious to be free that is a matter of detail.

However, I enclose our file No. 3597 herewith in case you may be able to extract from them anything that would assist you in your search.\n\nIn this connection, Mr. Clayton, the Clerk in charge of our Survey records, states that he was under the impression that this General Reserve at Rainy Lake was to be a Treaty ground where the Indians of No. 3 Treaty would assemble to get their annual payments.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nD.

At the foot of Rainy Lake, to be laid off as nearly as may be in the manner indicated on the plan, two chains in depth along the shore of Rainy Lake and Bank of Rainy River to be reserved for roads, right of way for lumber men, homes, wharves, and other public purposes.\n\nThis Indian Reserve not to be for any particular Chief or Band, but for the Gauleaux Tribe generally, and for the purpose of maintaining thereon an Indian Agency, with the necessary grounds and buildings.\"\n\nIt would therefore appear that the consent of certain Tribes and Bands would be necessary before any portion of the Reserve may be used for any other purpose. Probably only the Rainy Lake and Rainy River Bands have been in the habit of making any use of this Reserve, and these may be the only Bands necessary to consult. The Agency buildings are situated on this Reserve.\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe\nOttawa, September 19th, 1895.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to return File No. 3697 of your Department, with thanks.

A reservation of ten acres is made for lumbering, booms, churches, and other public purposes. You will also report\n\nC. Overholtz,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Frances,\nOntario.\nTo explain matters, I would mention that there are two fields belonging to this property in which, according to the deed, they are respectively described.

Have come to the conclusion that the two fields are located at the point of the station; therefore, I should be glad of the information in order that I can locate the line definitely before measuring them and making a satisfactory report.

I am pleased to inform you that I find it impossible to join the desired mission along the boundary line.\n\nTo explain myself, I should point out that the three parcels at the extreme end of point, which I designate as the nearest to the present location, are not sufficiently located and should be joined with those on Main Road. By placing the buildings where they are shown on the map, it would appear that there was considerable land between them and the first road line, whereas if they were situated in their proper place it would hardly be seen that very little land has been lost around the Agency buildings.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 15th ult., I have to inform you that there is no information in the Department as to the location of the two fields you mention. I think you had better communicate with the Rev. C. Cahill, O.M.I., at Rat Portage, regarding the boundaries of the land desired by him. He, or the Archbishop of St. Boniface, may be very glad to assist you in Fort Frances.\n\nIn drawing the lines, which you should make with stones or substantial posts, you must be careful to allow sufficient land around the houses, buildings, and mark them, and the true position of the buildings on the accompanying sketch.

H. [signature]\n\n[Signature] Agent\nas that this a man to meet expense to be concerned. It must be remembered that included in this piece of land is a clearance of at least 15 acres, all of which work has been done at the expense of Indian Agent. And it was only last spring that I posted 10 acre of it from a second growth of underbrush to land fit for the planting beside setting out 1500 feet to place with. It will be readily seen how much I am out of pocket. Now my reason for caution is to settle this matter in the manner upon the Delawares that I set that I wish to have it in the way of the Roman Catholic Mission holding this piece of property, but that it would be far more desirable and better in every way if the Indians agent in this district could be put there. If necessary I could easily show the adverse case for all parties concerned, to be gained by the agent living in that place. And if such was allowed should then suggest that this property be held intact for Industrial School purposes. No Board that I am aware of have any right by the Revenue Act to have I ever heard of any claims being put forward. Of course why does not interfere with any Indian dealings.\nNibly in the affirmative, but at the same time would distinctly state they should not. To explain myself, I have to refer to the Deputy, and that owing to the isolated position of the place, there is no possibility to the boundary line, the fact that all people who go and from that place to Lake Superior have to travel within a few feet of the boundary, so that these people are often of the toughest description, as I shall thereafter.\n\nMy objectionable, an Agent is compelled to leave a man in charge here whenever he is absent; that is to say, if he is a married man and has any prospect for his wife and family. Since I have been here, I have paid a man $500 each month and board and that extends over a period of years. Now the only chance an Agent has to secure himself for the expenditure is to try and do a little extra work and save through prudent economy expenses. If the piece of land required for mission purposes is taken away, the Agent will lose more than half of what he had before and from experience I can assure the Department that any loss laid upon him by the privilege of saving is worse than useless, as far...\nI am now returning the sketch enclosed in your last letter, which shows the position of the place of land required by the Rich Indians, also the position of the Agency building (marked U). As I am in addition attached to the field as surveyed by Mr. Gillis, which is meant to allow for the occupation of land by the Indians.\n\nAll the boundaries lines are marked by the surveyor, with the exception of the east line, which has partly disappeared through the bush as it which has been cut out and marked off. Between the Agency Building and the place of land to purchase, there is a field of about 10 acres, and beyond that running up to the water, there is a path. Regarding the allowance of two chains from the shore, I may say that Mr. Gillis informed me that no chain was allowed by them in their plan, and if the Aboriginal Indians do two chains less allowed, it is a simple matter to alter the plans accordingly, and the Rev. Father Pothill understands this.\n\nIt will be seen that the area is only a little in excess of that offered for the space the Rich Indians require. It is whether these proposed boundaries interfere with the ground required for Agent's purpose, I can only reply.\nJanuary 13th 1896.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 124993 of the 15th ultimo. With further reference to yours of the 19th September last in reference to the land desired by Mr. Glace the Archdeacon of St. Boniface and I to inform you that as soon as practicable after the Rev. C. Pahillie returns to Red River on the 1st of this month, I shall be able to communicate with him on the matter and as a result of our first interview, the Rev. Pahillie agreed to meet me at the spot in question on the 10th and there and then point out to me the piece of land acquired.

Mr. Dawson, the Indian Commissioner who set apart said Reserve, did so *inter alia* in the following terms: \"This Indian Reserve not to be for any particular Chief or Band, but for the Saulteaux Tribe generally, and for the purpose of maintaining thereon an Indian Agency, with the necessary grounds and buildings\".\n\nThe title not only of this Reserve, but I understand of all other Indian Reserves in what is called New Ontario is in an unsatisfactory state. Mining claims are likely soon to be applied for on some of them, and the cutting of timber on the reserves is under limitation owing to the same uncertainty of title.\n\nI have been informed by a gentleman from Fort Frances, that the Ontario Government sent one agent or more through some portion of their new territory last summer to investigate and report on some of these disputed questions; and now since the Legislative Session of that Province is over, I would suggest that communication be had with the Government of Ontario to ascertain whether it is not now in a position to come to some understanding with the Dominion Government in regard to confirming to the latter the title of the Indian Reserves in New Ontario.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nReferring to your letter of 22nd November last,\n\nI have been informed by Mr. Smith, in re the application of Archbishop Langevin, for certain lands near Fort Frances for an Indian mission and for the site of a Boarding School, and also for aid to erect such school, I beg to say that I have had, as you desired, an interview with His Grace in regard to said applications.\n\nWith respect to the twenty acres asked for Missionary purposes, it is clear that the Roman Catholic Church authorities would require a full title to the land in order to be able to establish a permanent mission. Such a title it is apparently at present impossible for the Indian Department to give, even were the Indians to surrender the land for the purpose, inasmuch as it is stated in one of the letters on the file transmitted to this office, namely the letter of 31st July 1896, signed by D.C. Scott, then Acting Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, that \"if it\" (the land applied for) \"be within the bounds of any of the reserves shown on the tracing it will be impossible for the Department to dispose of the same, as these reserves are held subject to confirmation by the Government of Ontario, and until they are so confirmed the Department is not in a position, even after the Indians surrender any part of the reserves, to convey a\n\nJan.

I think I am right in stating that when the Rat Portage school was provided for it was not anticipated that any further application would be made for a school at Fort Frances.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, 14th Nov., 1900\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant; and in reply to that portion which has reference to the application of His Grace, the Archbishop of St. Boniface for certain lands near Port Frances for the site for a boarding school and also for aid to erect such school, I am directed to say that the Department cannot authorize any grants for a school at Port Frances, as there is one at Rat Portage and another at Fort William.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg,\n[Signature]\nOttawa, 6th January, 1904.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that it has been decided to accept the proposition made by the Oblate Fathers of St. Boniface for the transfer to them of the St. Boniface Industrial School property in exchange for three boarding schools to be erected at an aggregate cost of \u00a33,025.00, such exchange to take effect as soon as the boarding schools are erected to the satisfaction of this Department.\n\nPlans of the proposed buildings have been submitted, which will be referred to the Government Architect for approval, but past experience having shown that schools have been put up in most undesirable locations, the Department would like to have a report on the proposed sites of the buildings which are to be erected at Sandy Bay, Fort Frances and Fort Alexander. Such reports should state what facilities are afforded for obtaining a supply of water, wood and arable land, as well as a proper drainage system.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Redley,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nHon.

The Indians at Fort Alexander, at Fort Francis and Fort Relly are asking for a boarding school in each place because the day schools are attended by few children and become almost useless.\n\nThe minister, in view of the foregoing, recommends that the exchange be approved by the Governor in Council on the basis above indicated, and that as soon as the three boarding school buildings are completed to the satisfaction of the Department of Indian Affairs and a conveyance made to the Crown of the land occupied by and appurtenant to the said three boarding schools, a patent issue by the Crown, under the provisions of the Dominion Lands Act to Les P\u00e8res Oblate for the land now held by the Crown at St. Boniface and at present used for industrial school purposes; and that a conveyance be also made by the Department of Indian Affairs for the St. Boniface Industrial School buildings, with their furnishings.\n\nThe Committee submit the same for approval.\n\nJohn J. Mace,\nClerk of the Privy Council.\ngrant by the Oblat Fathers to the four boarding schools, namely:\n\nSandy Bay........42 pupils at $72...$3,024.00\nFort Frances......40 = $72...$2,880.00\nFort Relly........26 = $72...$1,890.00\nFort Alexander....45 = $72...$3,240.00\n\nTotal = $10,944.00\n\nFrom an educational standpoint it is considered difficult to conduct efficiently and effectively the St. Boniface Industrial School at the present per capita rate. The school as located does not afford facilities to train Indian boys in agriculture; but the Church authorities will undertake to have a man in charge of the boys at each of the proposed boarding schools and one at the school at Fort Relly who will teach them practical farming; and, with the boys taught to farm and the girls to do house work, the Department would have from the proposed schools more desirable educational results than can be hoped for from St. Boniface and thirty-two more Indian pupils will be benefitted by the proposed exchange. From a business standpoint it is considered that the three boarding schools proposed to be erected if carefully built according to specifications will be a fair value for the St. Boniface Industrial School property.\n\nThe minister submits that it is contended on the part of the Church authorities that:\n\n1. It is impossible to recruit a sufficient number of Indian children at the St. Boniface Industrial School to maintain it without debt.\n2. The results from establishing three boarding schools would be more satisfactory.\n3. It will be easier to get a regular attendance of children, and consequently to educate them.\nof present full value. Fifty per cent of the cost of the remainder fairly represent their present value; making the present value of furnishings about $1400, and the total cost $32,400.\n\nThe proposition of the Oblat Fathers is that they will undertake to erect three boarding schools at the aggregate cost of $32,522.81; one of these schools to be located on the land belonging to the Department of Indian Affairs, near Fort Francis, in the province of Ontario; another to be on the reserve at Sandy Bay, near Manitoba; and the third at Fort Alexander, in the province of Manitoba, on land belonging to the Oblat Mission, which owns a tract in the reserve; the mission agreeing to transfer to the Department of Indian Affairs the quantity of land required for school-site and yards. Upon completion of the three boarding schools at the points mentioned in accordance with plans and specifications to be approved of by the Department of Indian Affairs, a transfer of the whole property of the St. Boniface Industrial School, including buildings, land and furnishings, is to be made to the Reverend Les P\u00e8res Oblats; the Department of Indian Affairs also agreeing to pay to the Oblat Fathers the per capita grant at present allowed the St. Boniface Industrial School, namely, $11,000.00 using at the rate of $110.00 for 100 pupils, a proportion of which per capita grant may be applied by the Oblat Fathers to a fourth school now nearing completion by them at Fort Selkirk. The following will be the probable distribution of the\nExtract from a Report of a Committee of the Honourable the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency on the 6th January, 1904.\n\nPRIVY COUNCIL\nCANADA,\n\nOn a report dated 23rd December, 1903, from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, stating that a proposition has been made on behalf of St. Boniface, Manitoba, for the acquisition by them of the \"Les Neverends Reserve Oblate,\" or St. Boniface Industrial School and furnishings, together with the land connected therewith containing an area of forty-four acres and which is held by the Crown for industrial school purposes, in consideration of their erecting, in lieu thereof, three boarding schools at an aggregate cost of $33,522.81.\n\nThe minister further states that the question as to the advisability of the exchange, from business and educational standpoints, was referred to the Assistant Indian Commissioner at Winnipeg, whose report, in substance is as follows, and is concurred in by the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs:\n\n\"The St. Boniface school cost $29,000 and the land $2000, making in all $31,000. Furnishings not included as fixtures in the $29,000, cost upwards of $4,600 which makes the total cost $33,600. Inquiry shows that of $4,600, the furnishings which may be considered still to be of value, cost $2,195. Of these furnishings the iron beds which cost $627, and which were purchased in 1901-02 are all that are considered.\"\n\nThe honourable\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nwhich he had his premises, we would find there all\nthe facilities required for a proper accommodation for\na school.\n\nHoping that this report will prove satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nhonourable sir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n(signed) J.F.

A small creek which runs into the lake, flows by the side of this ridge and will afford a good opportunity of drainage for the school and the farm.\n\nThe land is all wooded and of good quality for farming. In many places, fields and meadows could be easily cleared as the fire has destroyed the big timber, and the shrubs are only beginning to grow. With little work, we could secure new land apart from that used by the Indians, as we consider it wise not to interfere with their rights of raising hay. We have not yet tested the quality of the water to be supplied, but as the lake is not far off no difficulty will be met with regard to a sufficient supply.\n\nFORT ALEXANDER.\n\nThe most convenient site for a school at Fort Alexander would be at a little distance from the present day schoolbuilding and on the same grounds. Water can be easily supplied from the Winnipeg river, the distance being short and the height of the land being not over 25 feet above the level of the lowest waters.\n\nThe soil on this reserve is excellent, and once drained and cleared will be excellent for farming.\n\nWe presume that the Indian Department will concede a certain portion of the reserves for the use of the schools.\n\nCOUCHICHING near FORT FRANCIS.\n\nOn this reserve a convenient site is available only on the chief's property and if he could be induced, to give up that piece of land on\nSt. Mary's Presbytery,\nWinnipeg, Man.,\nJanuary 29th, 1904.\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nI respectfully beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20th inst., requesting me to provide the Department with some details in regard to the location as well as to the facilities for obtaining a supply of water, wood, arable land and a proper drainage system for the schools to be erected at Sandy Bay, Fort Alexander and Fort Frances. In compliance with your wishes, I beg leave to submit the following notes collected in a trip of inspection made last spring, at Sandy Bay by Reverend J.B. Dorais, then principal of the St. Boniface Industrial School for the purpose of searching for a suitable site for the erection of a school on that reserve. I also sent him to Fort Alexander and Fort Frances for the same purpose.\n\nIn his report he says that at Sandy Bay and Fort Alexander, all the facilities that could be desired for such establishments are found on these reserves. On the reserve of Gouahisking near Fort Frances, arable land is not so plentiful as it is found on the reserves in Manitoba, but a sufficient quantity can be easily secured. The particulars are as follows:\n\nSANDY BAY.\n\nA very convenient place has been found at a distance of about 600 yards south west of the church erected on the shore of the bay. There is an\ncorroborate all rather Dorais' opinions. Mr. Agent Simford informs me that there are water, wood, and drainage at Sandy Bay; but not much good arable land, and worse, that the climatic conditions are unfavourable as the reserve being on the west shore of Lake Manitoba, the ice on the lake in spring delays vegetation. It is therefore unsuitable for raising grain; but there is hay on the reserve and stock might be kept. In regard to Fort Alexander, I understand that the proposed site is a good one. There is plenty of wood near at hand, water is convenient, and there is good arable land on the reserve though much of it requires drainage. Of Couchiching, I have no information except what Father Dorais gives.\n\nIf the Department approves of the schools being on reserves, I would recommend a closer inspection of the proposed sites than can be made at this season of the year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD.

That it is proposed that all three sites shall be on Indian reserves. Does the Department approve or locate the schools and farms on Indian reserves; and if so, should ordinary consent (not a surrender) of Indians be asked? Further, in the case of the Coucanching reserve near Fort Frances, would the Ontario government require to be consulted; and is the Department prepared to allow compensation to the Chief to induce him to give up his property?\n\n2.

It would appear from Father Mangan's letter that the proposed sites are on Indian reserves and the Commissioner wishes to know if the Department approves of the schools being placed there; as if so, he would recommend a closer inspection of the ground than can be made at this season of the year. I can see no objection to the schools being placed on reserves, but wherever they are located, the Oblate Fathers should pay any compensation that the Ontario Government or individual Indians are entitled to for the land chosen.\n\nAs the terms of the proposed exchange call for the transfer of the buildings and sites the Department should be put to no trouble or expense in the transaction.\n\nI think that if the Commissioner is not prepared to accept the sites chosen without further inspection, the selection should be delayed until such time as the inspection can be made.\n\nA notice that in the Order-in-Council, it is stated that the proposed school at Fort Alexander is to be placed on land belonging to the Oblate\nOttawa, 18th February, 1904.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant regarding the proposed transfer of the St. Boniface Industrial School property to the Oblate Fathers for three boarding schools and giving your views in respect to the sites designated by Rev.

In reply I beg to say that the Department has no objection to locating the schools and farms on Indian reserves, but wherever they are placed the Oblate Fathers should pay any compensation that the Ontario government or individual Indians are entitled to for the land chosen, as the terms of the proposed exchange call for the transfer of the buildings and sites to the Department and it should be put to no trouble or expense in the transaction.\n\nIf you are not prepared to accept the sites chosen without further inspection, the selection should be delayed until such time as the inspection can be made.\n\nI have the honour to be Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Redley,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nHon.

J P Magan of St. Mary's Church, Winnipeg, in which he states that under an agreement with your Department they are to erect an Indian Boarding School at Fort Frances, and a site has been selected on Indian Reserve No. 1, north of Pither's Point on Rainy River, immediately south of Reserve A, for that purpose. The Rev. Mr Magan states that your Department is not prepared to formally approve of the erection of the school on the above site without the consent of this Government being first obtained.\n\nIn respect to the above application I have to say that this Department will not oppose the granting of a lease or patent of the school site referred to.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Commissioner\n\nFrank Pedley Esq.,\nDeputy to Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, 15th June, 1904\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the proposed exchange of the St Boniface Industrial school property with the Oblate Fathers, I beg to say that a letter has been received from Mr Aubrey White, Assistant Commissioner of Crown Lands, Toronto, in which he states that his Department will not oppose the granting of a lease or patent of the school site selected on Indian Reserve No. 1, North Pither's Point on Rainy River, immediately south of Reserve A, by Rev. Father Magan. In this connection I beg to refer you to official letter of 16th February last respecting the sites to be chosen for the proposed boarding schools by the Oblate Fathers.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nHon. David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 15th ultimo in which you advised the Commissioner that the Assistant Commissioner of Crown Lands had consented on behalf of the Ontario Government to the occupation of a portion of the Indian Reserve No. 1 as a site for the proposed boarding school at Fort Frances, I would say that I have visited the Reserve, gone over the proposed site, and have come to the conclusion that it is admirably suited for school purposes. The land is lightly wooded, the soil is good, drainage easy, and water easily had. It fronts on Rainy Lake, and between the bank and the ordinary height of water there is an excellent sand beach. Mr. Wright, after careful examination and consideration, has strongly recommended the site. I concur in the recommendation, and would ask that authority be given so that the work can be gone on with.\n\nI may add that Father Magnan had already advised this office of the receipt by him of the consent of the Ontario Government. I enclose a copy of the rough plan showing the site which Father Magnan filed here.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAss't Indian Commissioner.\nThe Asst. Commissioner has also notified the Department of the selection of a site upon the Sandy Bay reserve for the purpose of a boarding school, which contains 100 acres and he states that Mr Inspector Mariott informs him that the Indians have formally given their consent to this area being set aside for school purposes, and that the Commissioner before leaving on his vacation has visited and approved of the site chosen. It would appear that the Department would be justified in approving of the Sandy Bay site, and also of the site chosen near Ft. Frances when compensation is made to the Chief, and if it is satisfied that the quantity of land will suffice.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, 18th July, 1904:\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nIn further reference to the proposed exchange of the St Boniface Industrial school for boarding schools to be erected by the Oblate Fathers, I beg to say that the Assistant Commissioner reports that he has personally visited the site for the proposed boarding school at Fort Frances, which he considers admirably suited for the purpose. The Asst. Commissioner of Crown Lands for Ontario has notified the Department that there will be no opposition to the granting of a lease or patent of the site. Mr McKenna, however, does not give the area of the piece of property selected, but judging by the rough sketch which accompanies his letter, I should say it would not contain much over 50 acres. In January last Rev. Father Magman, with whom the negotiations have been carried on, reported that a convenient site is available near Ft. Frances, but that it was on the Chief's property and that if he could be induced to give up the land, they would find all the facilities they required for the school on it. I take it that this is the site selected. If so the Oblate Fathers should pay any compensation to which the Chief is entitled for this land and the Commissioner was so informed on the 16th Feb. last. If the Department is satisfied on this point, there is no objection to their being allowed to proceed with the buildings on this site, if the quantity of land is deemed sufficient.\nIndian Commissioner\n\nIn your reply refer to No. 64758 and state of this letter and address Hon. David Laird, Indian Commissioner, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nII6761\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant conveying approval of the sites proposed for the Boarding Schools at Fort Frances and Sandy Bay.\n\nIn respect to the quotation from the letter from Father Magan dated the 28th of January last, I would say that the site since selected was not referred to the Rev. gentleman. The present site is on Reserve No. 1, known as the Agency Reserve, as shown on the rough plan which I sent you. The first to choose it was Mr. Agent Wright.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

The school is at least 850 feet distant from the beach which slopes very gradually to deep water. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the Principal of the School is more anxious about the appearance of his school grounds in front than from any real danger to the school buildings due to an advance of the water of the lake.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 29, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th inst., with regard to the site of the Fort Frances Boarding school, and in reply I beg to say that your explanation with reference to this site and the necessity for the embankment spoken of by the Principal of the school is entirely satisfactory to the Department.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nFORT FRANCES INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL,\nFort Frances, Ont.\n13th November, 1907\n\nSir,\n\nAs I find that the land granted by the Department for this school on the Agency Reserve, is not sufficient for all our requirements, I would ask the Department through you, to give a further grant of 20 chains from the Agency Reserve, adjoining the other land granted us, for school purposes, as shown on the enclosed plan. This would make about 80 acres in all. The land which the Department gave on this reserve for school purposes, has all been cleared, and if the additional land asked for is granted, it will be kept for fuel for the school, and as fast as it is cleared it will be cropped.\n\nI explained the matter to Mr. S. Bray, Chief Surveyor of the Department, when he was here last month, and he will be able to more fully explain the requirements to the Department, than I can in a letter.\n\nIn the West the Boarding Schools have from 160 to 320 acres, principally prairie, whereas we have only about 40 acres, all of which had to be cleared at a cost of about $40.00 per acre, and the amount of land we have is not sufficient to enable us to raise our root crops, feed for stock etc., for the support of the school, and we earnestly ask that the Department grant our request.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.P.

H.M. Brassard, Principal of the Fort Frances Indian Boarding School; asking for a further grant of land from the Agency Reserve, for school purposes. I beg to state that I think this school should have more land than they have, and I see no reason why their request should not be granted.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nOne corner of the building is apparently in the said road allowance.\n\nD.J.Gillon, O.L.S., has been instructed in a recent letter to survey the boundaries of the Agency Reserve, Fort Frances, and to show on his plan the portion of land desired by the school. If you approve Agent Wright may be requested to instruct Mr. Gillon to mark the proposed addition to be allotted for the use of the school with iron posts.\n\nActing on 95721\n\nChief Surveyor.\nOttawa Dec 3, 1907.\n\nMemorandum for Deputy Minister.\n\nDEPT. OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nDEC 7 1907\nSURVEYS.\n\nWith reference to letters hereunder from Agent Wright and the Principal of the Fort Frances Indian Boarding school, I beg to state that on my recent visit to Fort Frances I visited the school. The Principal brought to my attention the fact of more land being required for the school. The Principal appears to be very energetic. The boys help extensively in the farm work and will certainly derive great benefit from this experience. The school will depend to a considerable extent on the produce of the farm. The area allotted to school is very small (40 acres), very good use will certainly be made of the additional area desired. The land is lying idle. I think it cannot be put to a better use.\n\nWith reference to the sketch accompanying the Principal's letter, I beg to draw your attention to the fact that I have marked off the whole Lake frontage from the block asked for, reducing the addition to the school to 20 acres. The Lake front will be valuable for building lots; in fact it is now of considerable value for that purpose. The school does not require any more Lake frontage than it has at present.\n\nI drew the attention of the Principal to the necessity of materially increasing the area of the cemetery. The sketch shows the proposed addition. I also informed him that the school building has unfortunately been placed too near the water's edge. The allowance for the road along the water's edge in the original plan of the reserve is two chains wide.\nOttawa Dec 9, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to the survey of the Agency Reserve to be made by Mr. D.J. Gillon, and to your letter of the 14th ultimo, No. 2194, I have to request you to instruct Mr. Gillon to survey the block of 30 acres shown on the plan enclosed to be assigned for the use of the Boarding school. Please inform the Principal of the school that the Lake front is reserved as it may be hereafter decided to subdivide it into suburban lots. The school also does not require more frontage on the Lake.\n\nMr. Gillon should plant iron posts at the points marked on the plan. A substantial wooden post should be planted by the side of each iron post. All of them should be marked I.R. Iron posts should be of 1\u00bd inch square iron\u20143 feet long. Mr. Gillon should show the school, the cemetery etc. on his plan.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ.F.

The reasons set forth in the communication of the Rev. H.M. Armstrong are, I think, well taken. I may say that I met the Rev. Gentleman some time ago and in discussing the matter with him I learned that he desired to secure this additional piece of land so as to enlarge the grounds now held by the Industrial School at that point and for the further purpose which is set out in his communication to the Hon. the Premier, of preventing it from being occupied by undesirable persons or institutions which might be detrimental to the youth attending the school.\n\nI would be pleased to learn from you if it is the intention of the department in view of the representations made to either grant this land to the Industrial School or hold it and thereby prevent its being occupied in any way that would prejudice the interests of the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, School Files (RG 10), Volume 6395, File 469-9, part 1)\nOttawa, November 27, 1908.\n\nDear Sir:\u2014\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 26th instant, in regard to the question of disposition of a small portion of the Indian Reserve at Pithers Point, to the Indian Industrial School, and in reply to say that the Department is in communication with the local agent, and when he has been heard from the matter will receive due consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nJames Conlee, Esq., M.P.,\nPort Arthur,\nOnt.\nFort Frances\n\nMap - showing our selection\n\n65 acres\n\nPresent School land\n\n65 acres\n\n60 acres\n\nTo be given up by the school\n\nTown farm\n\nGiven by the 1st Dept.\n\n1910\nSir,\n\nThe Govt.

Father Kalmes for an addition of twenty acres to the Fort Frances Boarding School site, as shown on the plan enclosed in your said letter, I beg to state that it will be very inconvenient to bring this matter before the Indians interested until the annuity payments in June next, and I have not the least doubt but what they will consent to the Department allowing the School to use the piece of land in question for school purposes.\n\nReferring to the original 43 acres set aside for this school and the additional 21 acres assigned for the use of it, the Indians were not asked or consulted in the matter.\n\nIn your letters of the 26th November, 1907, No. 95721, and 9th December, 1907, No. 285250-1, you state that the Lake front is reserved, as it may be hereafter decided to subdivide it into suburban lots, and that the school does not require more frontage on the lake, as this frontage will probably be valuable if laid out in lots.\n\nIn my opinion the school has sufficient land, and if the Indians are to derive any benefit from this reserve, the balance should be subdivided in suburban lots and sold for their benefit.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 4th., 1911.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\n\nI would recommend that the school be allowed to use the additional twenty acres mentioned in the attached correspondence.

Original on File 160370-19A\n\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n\nI must not forget to mention the following sad fact which is that the water of Rainy Lake injures considerably our land. Only last summer we lost about ten feet of ground in front of the school. This is caused by the extraordinary rise of water the a private industry of International Fall will maintain at any cost. At that rate if no obstacles are placed in their way we will soon be in the water. Our agent, Mr. J.P. Wright, has had something done to stop the evil, we hope he will not let matters rest there, but will oblige the American Company (authors of this disaster) to do more solid work.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nPh. Vales, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\ninstitution, and avoid a deficit.\n\nIf this land is to be held for settlement, there can be no better settlement than utilizing it for the school purposes.\n\nThe town of Fort Frances has already surveyed a large tract of land adjoining the school, for park purposes, and if the acreage desired for the school is sold for summer resorts you can imagine the injuries which it will bring on Indian people.\n\nThe school is established on sound basis, and is destined to be a permanent institution. It is therefore absolutely necessary that the Government should provide sufficient ground, especially when it is the expressed wish of the Indians interested, who own the land.\n\nAs regards the Government purchasing this land may I suggest that it would not be a precedent, for it was done in other instances. I have before me the last annual report of the Department of Indian Affairs, and I find on page 623 that the Hon. Murray of Brandon Industrial School is very grateful to the Govt. for purchasing 650 acres of land, for that institution, when they had already 80 acres; see also, page 436 of the report. I also find on page 606 of the Auditor General's report, that the Dept. paid $1600.00 cash for the land. The land at Fort Frances could be purchased for the school, at a valuation which would satisfy the claims of the Indians.\n\nBy your cooperation, Honourable Sir, may these few observations obtain for us favorable results. This with this hope, I have the honour to be\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nTo Mr. [Name] over\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nTo Mr. [Name] over\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nTo Mr. [Name] over\nIndian Boarding School\nFort Frances Ont.\n\nJuly 2nd 1913\n\nMr. Rookie\nMinister of the Interior\nOttawa\n\nCommr. Sir,\n\nPermit me to remind you that the desire manifested at different times by different persons to obtain the 60 acres of land adjoining the school land on the south side, is more likely than ever.\n\nIt is because I consider that the land asked for is absolutely necessary for the proper management of our school, and I supplicate the Department, not for any price, to let it pass into other hands. The following observations will surely help us to obtain our views.\n\nOne of the objections to granting over land to the Fort Frances Boarding School out of the agency Indian reserve, that was surrendered by the Indians for sale, is that the consent of the Ontario Government would have to be obtained.\n\nHave any steps been taken by the Department to obtain this consent?\n\nAnother reason is that the land is to be sold for benefit of the Indians.\n\nCould not the Indian Department, seeing it? The school is a Government Institution and according to the new agreement, it is obligatory to have sufficient land for farm and garden purposes. This school is doing good work among the Indians, and as the Government grant is small, the Indians are endeavoring to supplement their earnings out of the farm and garden, to supply the needs of the...\nOttawa, August 6, 1915.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nReferring to the request made by you sometime ago that the sixty acre lot adjoining the Fort Frances School land be added to the school property, I beg to say that it has been decided to give you permission to cultivate these sixty acres but no arrangement can be made to have it form part of the school lands pending a settlement of the reserve question with the Ontario Government. It is to be clearly understood that right to cultivate is the only concession hereby given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Phe Wales, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal Fort Frances Boarding School,\nFort Frances, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 6th ultimo,\n\nNo. 285250, enclosing copy of a letter addressed to the Rev. Ph. Vales, O.M.I., Principal, Fort Frances Boarding School, I would ask what portion of the old Agency Reserve this sixty acres referred to belongs, as when the school was first built there was 43 acres set aside from this reserve for the school, and a few years ago, an additional 20 acres on the back of the reserve was given them for wood lands, this has all been cleared, but not yet cultivated, now the Principal informs me that the 60 acres referred to as an additional 60 acres to what they now have, but that cannot be cultivated, as it is all timbered land, and I do not see why they should want so much land.\n\nI enclose a rough sketch of the plan of the old agency reserve, showing what the school now have, and what was leased to the town of Fort Frances as a park, the balance being still the agency reserve.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nOttawa, Oct. 4, 1913.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nReferring to letter to you of Aug. 6, last, in which you were given permission to cultivate the balance of sixty acres adjoining the Fort Frances School Lands I have to inform you that the said permission is hereby rescinded as only a part of the said lands will be allowed for school purposes. You will be hereafter advised of the lands that will be attached to the school. In the meantime I have to say that on no account is any timber to be cut on the lake front or for a distance of at least ten chains back from the front.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev.

To complete this, their foreman, Mr. Reddell, claimed himself authorized to cut all the timber needed, on the land conceded to the School, on the 4th of October, in the year 1913, Letter No. 285.800.\n\nWhen I made a few observations about this, and I suppose to make me, more readily accept, a deed accomplished, he promised me, that when the work would be finished, he would let me have all the wood; but he did not keep his word, in fact he sold the wood to J. Sack, Contractor at Park Frances.\n\nI would like to know what the Department thinks of such proceedings, and if we could exact a little compensation in return.\n\nHoping to receive from you a prompt and favorable reply.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nYour respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada - Biblioth\u00e8que et Archivage Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, 9th March, 1915\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter in regard to the wood alleged to have been taken by Messrs. Seaman & Penniman's Freeman, for track purposes, from the land which you state was conceded to the School, on the 4th October, 1913, and his refusal to let you have the wood, when the work was completed, and in reply to inform you that this matter should have been referred to the local Indian Agent.\n\nOn receipt of a report from him of the facts, the Department would be in a position to say how much, if any, compensation, should be given.\n\nIt is observed that the letter of 4th October, 1913, states that you were advised that on no account is any timber to be cut on the lake front, or for at least a distance of ten chains back from the front, also that only a part of the 60 Acres would be allowed for School purposes.\n\nYou should interview the Indian Agent, Mr. Wright, and give him communication of this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

I prepared a report recommending but on consultation with Agent Wright it was found that his policy was to sell the waterfront still unprotected to private parties who were in search of building sites, and they could then protect their own property and thus save the Department from further expense in this direction. In view of this I withheld my report. It has since transpired that Mr. Wright's scheme has not materialized, and the erosion of the bank still goes on. I now recommend that this matter receive further attention from the Department, and that the Agent be instructed to investigate the matter and obtain figures showing the prospective cost of extending the \"rip-rap\" so as to prevent further damage.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies and schools.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the Fort Frances Boarding School, dated March 20, 1916. Original on file 285250-6\n\nLand Cultivated.\n\nThe original holdings were sixty-three acres. From this 8 acres have been taken for public roads. Seven more are covered with buildings. Sixteen acres are unstumped. This leaves but 32 acres in actual cultivation. Six acres are borrowed from Indians. The school has no pasture land and in consequence the cattle must be herded on the highways or land for pasture must be rented. The land at command of the school seems to me to be inadequate and I recommend that this question receive the further attention of the Department.\n\nSgd. John Semmens,\nInsp.\nOttawa, March 29, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that Mr. Inspector Simmons in a recent report on the Fort Frances Boarding School states as follows: \"The original holdings were sixty-three acres.

Wright, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Frances, Ont.\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, relative to the land held by the Fort Frances Boarding School, and in reply beg to state that they have not sufficient pasture land for the stock they have and would suggest that say 60 or 75 acres of the west end of reserve 16A be leased from the Indians for a term of years, at a small rental, would give them all the land they required, if the recommendations made by Mr. Bray in the 3 clause of your letter of the 4th October, 1913, No. 282759, was carried out.\n\nThe most of the land on the west end of reserve 16A, could be very easily cleared, as it was burnt off many years ago and there is good pasture on it, the Indians have never made any attempt to do anything with it, although I have often tried to get them to make it into hay land, it is low and flat land.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nOctober 27, 1926.\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the communication from the Rev.

I wish to recommend that the Department be instructed to inform the Golf Club that any activity, if commenced, should cease at the time being. I also recommend that our representative be asked why he did not consult the Rev. Principal before making his recommendation and why he made no mention of the fact that the 27 acres in question - lying immediately south of the \"Addition\" to the school property - had been fenced and was in use by the school management.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nArchbishop's Palace\nSt. Boniface\nChancery\n\nSt. Boniface,\n\ncould be secured in the immediate neighborhood.\nSome with the possession of this plot the First\nFrancis School is less favored than many other\nIndian schools, as far as land is concerned.\n\nOf the 143 acres only 63 are good farming land,\nthe remaining 80 acres located from the Indians\nin 1916, for a period of 15 years for pasture\nare of very little value to the school.

This plot is of great importance to the School, but I do not hesitate to give the Rev. Father my hearty cooperation in this matter.\n\nSo far the St. Francis School has had the privilege and uninterrupted use of this land, and much work has been done on it. But now the Board of St. Francis has made application to have 20 acres of that plot and without due authorization has acted as real owner, clearing the land, building about two yards of the fence and disposing of about 50 Indian feet that had been placed there as repairs.\n\nThis land seems absolutely necessary for the purposes for which the Indian School is conducted, and no other good land\nMarch 14th, 1927\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, in reference to land adjoining the property of the Fort Frances Residential School.\n\nI have carefully noted your representations and will bring them to the attention of the officer of the Department who has been instructed to take the matter up as soon as the snow is off the lands in question.

Father Superior of the Oblate Order for that District. While he was anxious that the school should have what land was necessary, he said he would be very pleased to have me call on him at Winnipeg after having gone over the situation at Fort Frances with a view to having a better understanding of the situation.\n\nIf you think I should not do this will you please wire me at Fort Frances on Thursday to return from there. I have taken transportation to Winnipeg in case you think I should go on, but refund can be obtained on the difference if not used, I presume.\n\nIt might be advisable to talk the matter over with the Father Superior and possibly the Archbishop of St. Boniface in order that they may have a clear understanding of the situation and the actual facts as to provision made for the school if I find that the 86 acres we are renting for them is good and sufficient land. However, I leave this to your judgment and if not instructed to the contrary, will presume you intend me to proceed to Winnipeg.\n\n[Signature]\n\nF. J. J. J.\n\"So far as cultivable land is concerned, the school has not yet cultivated all the acreage they own. While I am of the opinion that the school is well provided for in acreage, I would like very much to see them get that parcel adjoining the north boundary and containing about 12 acres. This is the parcel I have already referred to as being excellent soil as compared with their present holdings.\"\n\nMr. Parker recommends that we lease the 12 acres of Arnold (or Allan) for the use of the school and that the school clear the 88 acre plot (an inexpensive undertaking) so that the Fort Frances Golf Club be given a lease of the 20 acres they want and that he explain this to Archbishop Beliveau of St. Boniface.\n\n[Signature]\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nThe original of Mr. Parker's report of May 13th is on file 3228-2. In brief he states the school has 65 acres (43.2 acres with buildings and 20 acres to the southwest) and in addition, in 1916 (file 27124-2) 88.15 acres of reserve 16 was leased to the school for a period of 15 years. To quote:\n\n\"With the 65 acres forming the school lot proper, this gives a total available area of 151 acres. No promise was ever made of the 20 acres now in dispute and the provision of the 88 acres in 1916 was plainly intended as a settlement of the land question at Fort Frances Boarding School, and, furthermore, no further mention of the matter had been made until the letter previously referred to, in Oct., 1926, written after the Rev. Principal had heard that the 20 acres was likely to be leased to a Golf Club.\"\n\n\"After having examined this land, I paid some attention to a plot immediately north of the school lot and in Reserve 16A. This is an excellent piece of land and of superior soil to any other I examined while at Fort Frances. I think this plot would cover about 10-12 acres. It is owned by the band but I understand held by an Indian known as Fred Arnold, now in gaol. The land is only half cleared, the balance being covered with small undergrowth. The School is using the cleared portion under some agreement with Arnold.\"\n\n\"Of the school lands I found the original 43 acres all cleared and cultivated. On the 20 acre addition, I found it all cleared but about 5 acres in the south end not yet cleaned up and evidently never yet cultivated. In fact the entire 20 acre plot does not show signs of active cultivation.\"\n\n\"After having carefully viewed the matter from every standpoint, I am compelled to admit that the school having got along in the past with the allotted land can do so in the future. The only use ever made of the 88 acres was to pasture a few cows. The 65 acres to the north of the school will provide all the pasture they require and more. If they were to clear and fence a part of it, cattle could be pastured there from early summer on.\"\nCollege Mathieu\n340 Provencher Avenue,\nSaint-Boniface, Man.\n\nGravelbourg, August 3rd, 1927\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Mr. Scott:\n\nBeing here on a flying trip I meet Rev. Mr. Perreault, Principal of St. Stanislaus Indian Residential School, who asks me to write to you in connection with a part of land applied for by the Port Frances Golf Club.\n\nThe Reverend Principal states that he has written to you on May 6th, 1927, but that no answer has come as yet. However, he is made to understand that the transfer of the said land has been made to the Club, though no official advice has been given him. You realize that the Reverend Father feels sorry for the loss of the land, a fact which he did not think possible after the representations of His Grace Archbishop A. B\u00e9liveau, Very Rev. Father J. Magran O.M.I., Provincial and mine. However, if such transfer is a fact, the Reverend Principal has to accept it but wishes to reiterate his respectful protestations.\n\nThe Reverend Principal would be grateful to the Department if same could consider let-giving his school the equivalent of the transferred portion by effecting for the use of the school a similar quantity of land situated on the North West side of the school; 20-acre clearing and draining the pasture ground of the school.\n\nI leave the above requests of the Reverend Principal to your kind attention and hope for a favorable solution of the case.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada - Biblioth\u00e8que et Archivage Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, [date]\n\nMr.\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nAugust 16, 1927.\n\nDear Father Guy,\n\nI am replying to your letter of the 3rd instant, written on behalf of Rev. Father Perreault, O.M.I., of St. Francois, as Dr. Scott is at present in the West. I may say that, following a very careful investigation made by our Inspector Mr. Parker, the Department decided to grant a lease to the Fort Frances Gold Club.\n\nHowever, it is our desire to meet Father Perreault as much as possible, and the local Agent has been instructed to report to the Department whether it would be possible to give the Industrial School the use of a twelve or fourteen acre parcel adjoining the north boundary of the present school property. This parcel, I understand, contains some very good land, and would be more suitable for cultivation than the area recently leased to the Gold Club.\n\nThe matter will continue to receive our attention, and I have no doubt that a mutually satisfactory adjustment will be reached shortly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Father Joseph Guy, O.M.I.,\nCollege Mathieu,\nGravelbourg, Sask.\nAugust 19, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nAs the Fort Frances Golf Club have now secured possession by lease of a parcel of land formerly used by the Industrial School, I have to request that you now give consideration to the proposition to acquire for the use of the School that parcel immediately adjoining the north boundary of the present School property, containing twelve or fourteen acres, and apparently the property of an Indian named Arnold.\n\nI understand that portion of this Arnold property is at present leased by the School, and if so, kindly advise upon what terms and conditions. Further, it will be necessary for you to find out whether the remaining portion of this property might be leased, and if so, also at what annual rent.\n\nOn the other hand, it might be possible to purchase Arnold's interest in this parcel for a nominal figure, subject to the approval of the Band. These are matters which I have to request that you investigate fully and report to the Department with as little delay as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Maclean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nAlonzo Spencer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Frances, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th ultimo; in regard to Lease of portion of land lying North of Industrial School.\n\nAnd in reply to same I have seen Freddie Jourdain, and also consulted the Couchiching Band. The Couchiching Band refuse to let him sell this piece of land. Therefore the only thing that we can do is Rent it from Freddie Jourdain, for a number of years, which he is satisfied to do. The Principal tells some one he is paying $10.00 per Year, and some say $5.00 per Year. But I would recommend that he be given $8.00 per Year for 15 or 20 Year Lease, so if the Department will agree to lease and send a Lease I will have Freddie Jourdain sign it.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nFort Frances Ontario,\nNov. 23rd 1927\n\nD. McLean Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am glad to learn that the Indian Department has the intention to give me a compensation for the school land leased to the Fort Frances Golf Club. It is for me a great relief which when the occurrence would come into effect would remove the thorn deeply thrust into my heart since the day of the negotiation of the lease. That compensation so long expected would always be welcome but especially at the coming Christmas.\n\nThe lot of the Indian reserve immediately N.W. of the school containing approximately 15 acres was owned by Fred Allan on the date of the lease. Since he left the school a few years ago he is always absent from the reserve; he comes back only once a year for a few days to get his treaty money. He has not made any improvements of any kind. He is consenting to dispose of his land in favor of the school, either renting or selling as you may see by the note he signed for the purpose and I have handed it to Revd Father I.Guy O.M.I. The reasons he gave me when making the paper was that he did not intend to ever use his land, and he would be pleased to help the school in remembrance of the education he received there. It would be preferable to buy than to rent the land, as the school could always need it all the time, and no more negotiations would be required in the future.\n\nThe price of the land could be set by the Indian Agent himself and the money of the sale should be deposited in the bank and handed to Fred Allan when he proves to make a good use of it, however if the note bearing his signature is not sufficient for the final dealing we have to wait for him at the next treaty payment.\n\nCharles Jourdain is the owner of the next lot containing approximately 12 or 14 acres. He is a widower of 50 years old, has only one boy of 21 years old. He has a shack, a garden large enough to plant \u00bd a bushel of potatoes. The rest of his land is absolutely left vacant and unutilized. He would consent to sell the fraction of his land required to form the balance of 23 acres leased to the Golf Club at the price set by the Indian Agent, at any time I could get his signature for the formal dealing.\n\nHoping to have an early settlement,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nB.

These two lots are, at present, held by Fred Allan (or Arnold) and Charles Jourdain. Mr. Parker reports that these would be of much value to the school. It is not necessary to include the shack and vegetable garden of the Indian Jourdain. I believe that an annual rental of $10. or $15. is acceptable to each of these Indians but it might be advisable to have Mr. Spencer determine what should be allowed.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDecember 22nd 1927.\n\nINDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL.\nFort Hope, Ont.\n\nHon.

I consider it as an evident proof of encouragement from your part towards my school.\n\nYour sincerely devoted,\n\nS. Perreault, Principal\nOttawa, January 7, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nIt has been decided by the Department that by reason of a lease of a portion of the reserve to the Fort Frances Golf Club, some other lands should be placed at the disposal of the Residential School. There has been an interchange of correspondence with Rev. Father Perrault, Principal of the School, in connection with this matter.\n\nI have to request, therefore, that you give your attention at once to securing twenty-year leases of the two lots of approximately twelve acres each, which lie to the northwest of the Residential School property. These lots are, I understand, owned by Fred Andrews and Harry Young. You will notice that an annual rental of $10 or $15 for each of these lots would be sufficient and likely acceptable to the Indian owners. The Department will, of course, be responsible for the payment of this rental.

G. Murray, K.C., Fort Frances, Ont., for professional services rendered in connection with leases of land from Messrs Fred Arnold and Charles Jourdain to the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs. Before taxing this bill, however, I am to ask you please to furnish me with information showing upon what authority Mr. Murray was employed in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Minister of Justice.\n\nThe Acting Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMemo.\n\nReferring to letter below, from the Deputy Minister of Justice, I have to say that it does not appear that Mr. A. G. Murray, K.C., of Fort Frances, was at any time authorized by the Department to prepare the leases which accompanied Agent Spencer's letters of the 1st instant. You will note that the Departmental letter of January 7th last addressed to Agent Spencer, instructed him to secure these leases, but it was never intended in so far as this Branch is concerned, that he should employ the services of a lawyer for the purpose.\n\nOfficer in Charge.\nFebruary 24, 1928.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nRe A.S., Indian Affairs\u2014Taxed Accountant,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, in reference to the accounts presented by Mr. A.G.

It was expected that he would prepare the leases himself, but apparently he did not feel competent to do so, and on his own authority engaged Mr. Murray.\n\nIn view of the circumstances I trust that you will be able to give favourable consideration to the taxation of the account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

G.

Murray, K.C., for drawing leave of land from Fred Arnold and Charles Jourdain to the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, I beg to say that, in accordance with the usual custom, the account submitted was forwarded to the Department of Justice for taxation previous to the matter of payment receiving consideration. The Department of Justice taxed the account and it has been paid by cheque No. 6105 for the amount stated, and the cheque is going forward. However, Deputy Minister of Justice has requested that you be advised that you had no authority to engage Mr. Murray without the approval of the Minister of Justice, and that in future no legal accounts incurred by you upon your own responsibility will be paid by the Government.\n\nIn future when you consider it necessary to retain the services of a lawyer, you should write to this Department for authority and await instructions before taking action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Spenser, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Frances, Ont.\n\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\nFort Frances Indian Residential School\nOntario\n\nJune 16th 1928\n\nR.\n\nDear Mr. Sir,\n\nI am glad to inform you that Mr. Spencer has promptly carried out your instructions in regard to the lots of Mr. Miller and Mr. Jourdain and has leased them for a term of twenty years for the use of the Provincial Industrial School. I am writing you again for that additional land which remains so much needed. I beg to inform you that this spring I will fence these two lots with barbed wire and cultivate the portion already cleared containing approximately five acres. In regard to the rest of the land consisting of about fifteen acres, it could not be used in any way for the present even for a pasture before it has been cleared, which will involve too heavy expenses for the school especially if the clearing is made all at once as it should be in order to have that land productive as soon as possible. Therefore I am making application to the Indian Department to supply me the necessary funds for that purpose. As you have so promptly secured that additional land near the site of my school, I hope that you will consider my request.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nS. Perreault\nPrincipal\nOttawa, June 25, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a request from the Principal of the Fort Frances Indian Residential School to provide the funds required in the clearing of the land which was recently rented for school purposes. He states that there are about 15 acres which cannot be used until it has been cleared, and he is anxious to have this done, in order that this land can be utilized for productive purposes as soon as possible.\n\nI have to request that you will make a careful examination and inform the Department of the amount of clearing that would be required. If possible, you should state the approximate cost per acre of having the clearing carried out. Your report at your earliest convenience, giving as full information as possible regarding the work required and the cost, will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. Spencer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Frances, Ont.\nOttawa, June 25, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, relative to your request for the necessary funds to clear the land which has recently been rented for the use of the Fort Frances Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that we are requesting Mr. Agent Spencer to report on the work required in the clearing of this land and the approximate cost of having the same carried out. When we have this information, consideration will be given to your request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. B. Perreault, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nFort Frances, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo; in regard to clearing of land recently tented for School purposes.\n\nAnd in reply to same, I visited this portion of land on the Couchiching Reserve, measured it up, and find that as near as I can come to it there is 124 acres of land to be cleared, which would cost around $300.00. There is also a ditch required, which would cost around $90.00, making a total of $390.00 before this land could be in shape for productive purposes, and which would be a very productive piece of land, as it is the very best of soil, and if you decide to do this work, I will look after the work and see that it is done right.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nOttawa, July 12, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, informing the Department of the cost of clearing the land which was recently rented for the use of the Fort Frances Indian Residential School. It is noted that there is 12\u00bd acres of land to be cleared and that the cost will be approximately $300, also that there is a ditch required, which would cost about $50.\n\nThe Department will approve of having this work carried out, and you may arrange to have the above quantity of land cleared and a ditch dug. The work should be performed by day labour, using the services of Indians as far as possible. You should keep proper time sheets, in duplicate, of the labour employed, which should be signed by the man engaged and certified by yourself. Should you require an advance to pay the labour, the same will be sent you upon receipt of a request stating the amount required. The total expenditure for the purpose should not exceed the estimate submitted by you, as mentioned above. This work should be started as soon as possible. The school authorities should assist in the labour as far as possible, without expense to this Department and the work should be carried out under the supervision of the Principal or yourself.\n\nA supply of time sheets for the keeping of labour returns is being sent you herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

Scott,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFor the last 15 years, the Department has rented a tract of land on the Reserve, west of the railroad, for the use of the School. The lease expires on July 16th, 1931.\n\nThis land has served us wonderfully well as a pasture. There is abundant feed for what cattle we have, and being well tread, it is a protection against the intense heat of summer as well as against flies.\n\nWhat land the School has besides the above mentioned tract, is barely sufficient for our winter supply of hay and oats, so that if we were to lose this rented land, we would be forced to use our own land for pasture and consequently buy all our feed for winter.\n\nThe School has already spent a fair amount for improvements on this land. Last year we had to put up a new fence, the old one having been destroyed by bush fire.\n\nFurthermore this land is practically useless to the people of the Reserve, and will be so for quite a few years to come. Most homes are already built and a great number of these are at Frog Creek, about three miles from the School. We have, however offered those who wished it, to build their homes on the higher levels of this tract of land. There are a few good locations that would be well protected from rising waters in the spring, but so far none have accepted this offer, which gives further proof of the uselessness of this land to them.\n\nTherefore, dear Sir, we would like to petition the Department to give Mr. Spencer necessary authority to renew the lease for an equal period of time. By so doing, the School will be assured of summer feed for the stock on this land and winter feed from our cultivated land.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.M. Brassard, O.M.I.\n\nPrincipal.\nNovember 21st, 1930.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nP.C. 1818 of August 2nd, 1916, authorized the lease of 75 acres, more or less, of Indian reserve No. 16 A. This land has been used by the Fort Frances Indian Residential School. The property actually comprised 88.18 acres and School Vote has paid to the credit of the band (Account 130) annually, $88.18.\n\nThe Reverend Principal of the school is very desirous that this land be secured for school purposes for a further term. The school has many improvements on it and it is really needed for educational purposes. The question of paying rentals as during the past fifteen years is desirable. The school is maintained largely for the benefit of the children of this and neighbouring reserves. Why should not the parcel in question be surrendered for school purposes and no rental charged? This is the practice practically everywhere else in Canada. In any case, this land is needed for school purposes and I should be grateful if you would take whatever action you consider advisable.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell F. Harris\nOttawa, November 21st, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to renewing the lease of the 88.16 acres of the Indian reserve No. 16 A, which is used for the purposes of the Fort Frances Indian Residential School.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, regarding renewal of the lease of the land on reserve 16 A used for pasturage in connection with the Fort Frances Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that Mr. Agent Spencer is being instructed to take up with the members of the band the question of obtaining a surrender of this land for school purposes. If the Indians agree to the surrender of the land in question, approximately 65 acres, it would not be necessary to renew the lease. When the Department is informed by the Agent as to whether the Indians will agree to the surrender of the land, you will be advised. In the event of a surrender not being obtained, it will, no doubt, not be difficult to obtain a renewal of the lease.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. V. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. H. M.

He was in last August and was completely in rags, and I had to outfit him with some clothing, and he informed me that he had $15.00 yearly rental coming for land on the Couchiching Reserve. I wrote to Mr. Spencer, the Agent there, and he informs me that this is correct.\n\nWould it be in order to render a voucher to the Department for supplies that Fred Allen received from the Hudson's Bay Company here on my order, so that this account can be paid?

No doubt five good milking cows would give\nall the milk and butter needed for the pupils and staff of the School.\nIt is out of question to raise cattle for beef, for the timothy hay\nwhich is growing well on our farm could easily be sold at $25.00\na ton. Consequently, by reducing the number of cows, I will also reduce\nfeed, labor and wages.\n\nNow, we have a stock of old and degenerated\ncows, which ought to be put away, and replaced by new ones of\npure breed.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a letter received from the Principal of the Fort Frances Indian School, in which he asks to be let sell six of their herd. And asks the Dept to purchase for them, a registered bull and cow, now I think this is a very foolish thing to ask the Dept, if they want to reduce their stock let them do so, but let them take the proceeds of the sale and replace with two registered animals.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSIR.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nOttawa, July 6th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, enclosing a communication which you received from the Principal of the Fort Frances Indian Residential School requesting permission to sell 6 of their present herd of milk cows and that the Department provide them with a registered bull and cow.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that if the Principal wishes to reduce the stock he may do so, but the proceeds should be used to purchase the two registered animals he asks for. It is considered that for the pupilage at this school at least 7 good milk cows should be kept in order to provide sufficient milk. The Department is not prepared at the present time to provide any funds to purchase registered stock.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. Spencer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Frances, Ont.\nIn it is all the statement I can make of what happen to the stock.\n\nYour's very truly\n\nH. M. Brassard Ptr. O.K.I.\nIndian Boarding School  \nFort Frances, Ont.  \n15 November 1929\n\nTo Mr. A. Spencer Ind. Agent\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI come back again to ask you to solicit the Dept. of Indian Affairs to permit us to buy four or five head of Cattle for the school. Actually we have only on hand 4 milking cows, 1 bull and a calf. It is not sufficient for the need of the school. In my estimate we need about 8 good milking cows for the necessity of the children, and I see the school in the impossible to buy from its own fund.\n\nI received a word from Rev. Father Guy who was in Ottawa lately and he encourages us to apply to the Dept. for the permit to buy some. Actually there are two (2) nice heifers to be sold at a fair price and they are expected to arrive soon... It is a good occasion.\n\nTo give an account of the stock from the beginning of the school, for me, it is an impossibility because I have been away different times. But I remember I bought myself the first two (2) milking Cows and the two horses we had. And when I left in 1909 I had four (4) head of Cattle and two (2) horses that have been bought when we built the school. I come back in 1916 I found that the stock was fourteen to sixteen head about I do not remember well, and when I left in 1925 I had 16 head from which flock we were killing for the use of the school. We had then the beef for most of the year. And this year, when I come back I found seven head of Cattle and among them two(2) were sick and we were obliged to kill them.\n\nWhen I took charge of the school in February last I asked the oldest boys what happened to the cattle under the administration of Rev. Father Perreault? They said: We don't know, but we found one morning that three of them were dead.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a letter I received from Principal of the Fort Frances Residential School, in which he is requesting the Department to purchase for the School, four head of milk cows. No doubt but the children should have plenty of milk, but according to his statement, in the last five years their herd has dwindled from 16 head to six head of cattle, and no account of what has been done with them, I do not know what the custom of the Dept. is, in regard to furnishing stock for the Schools, so I will have to leave the question in your hands, either to grant or refuse the request.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nOttawa, November 22, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 4084 of the 15th instant, enclosing a letter from the Rev. Principal of the Fort Frances Indian Residential School, concerning the milch herd. Please inform Father Brouard that it is the practice of the Department to ask the management at our schools to keep 11% stock replacement from the natural increase or from school earnings. In this case, the school management appears to be responsible for a thinning in the milch herd from 16 animals to 4. Therefore, the Department believes that it should not be expected to provide the 4 new animals that are now required. I agree that 8 milch cows are necessary for a school with a pupilage of 85.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA.

If the Principal wishes to purchase the horses and pay for same, the Department would consider reimbursing him next summer.

Upon enquiry from the Mother Superior of St. Joseph's Orphanage, I have to explain that I asked how many children in the Orphanage and I understood 72, but find the number of Indians children in the school 28 and eight other Indian girls not in school but being instructed in household duties, and three out-of-school age, the remaining number being children of white parents, the greater part of whom are Orphans supported by public subscription and private donations also in addition to the 72 are obliged to take a few boarders who pay, as the Government Grant is not sufficient to support the institution; enclosed are my reports of short-term Indian schools for last month, and will await the Department's order to consider my report for January 28 children instead of 72.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nJames Macdonald\n\nDefecty Lieut.

The students have been transferred to another school until further notice.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.P. Denully, Esq.\nIndian Agent\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of the Return for December Quarter last from the Fort William Orphanage, and in reply I have to inform you that, as this is a Boarding School where the pupils are supposed to be present all Quarter, the Department is not in a position to know why the Return shows the school as being open only 48 days out of the full Quarter of 92 days, and it would like this explained.\n\nI have also to call your attention to the fact that the pupils are not numbered on the Return in accordance with the \"Explanations\" on the Register, and that the same number has not been retained by the pupils. It is observed that pupil No. 10 on the September Return appears as pupil No. 31 on the December Return. The boys should be numbered from upwards and the girls from 01, and any number once given a pupil should not be again taken by any other.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P. Donnelly, Esq:\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeput. Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs\n[Handwritten text not legible]\nReferring to your letter of the 23rd ultimo No. 15381574 relative the return of Dec. quarter last from the East William Orphanage, and that as a boarding school the pupils are supposed to be present all quarter of 92 days, and it would like this explained, also calling attention to the numbering of the children from No. onwards, and that the number once given a pupil should remain always the same on the Register and otherwise. Have to state that I wrote the Rev. Mother Superior in charge of the Orphanage on the above subjects, and enclose the reply which I hope will be satisfactory. The correct numbering of the pupils will be obeyed; and the Superior states that the legal number of teaching days in this Province for last quarter were fifty nine. The 1st of November (all saints day) was a holiday, this accounts for the return showing only 58 days, and the total number of last quarter were ninety-two days, an Saturday the teachers are taught housework, consequently time is not given on the Register for that day, and was not aware that the Superintendent wished pupils taught that day or to give time for that day.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nDeputy Chief General\nof Indian Affairs\n\n[Signature]\n\nI am Sir,\n\nOver Assistant Scout\n\n[Signature]\n1896\n\nTo the\n\ngentlemen of your recommendation,\n\nin behalf of the First\n\nChurch of St. John's and what\n\nwe believe are employed in teaching\n\nthe children of the school, we\n\nwould respectfully request that\n\nthe Sister could not teach, and\n\nthat the teacher be teaching\n\nthe children of the school.\nTo Shingwauk Home (Bunji Sie House) and Shingwauk Home (Chimneying) He could accommodate but Indian children in even a greater number. However at present we cannot receive more than thirty children.\n\nI am obliged to you for your valuable assistance in preparing this report.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHon. Sir Macdonell H.C.\n\nOttawa\nIn conclusion, I will offer no objection to the proposal for 25 more pupils being taken there and children from the Orphanage when sufficiently advanced in years and education can be drafted to this school.\n\nThe Department will have no objection to increase the salary of the teacher of the Girls School to $250 but such increase cannot be retrospective.\n\nAs regards the application for a salary for a second teacher I have to say that the number of children attending the Fort William Schools does not justify such outlay. There are only 16 pupils on the roll for the Girls School, 14 at the Boys School and 34 in the Orphanage (7 boys and 17 girls) or 51 in all with two teachers already provided for. If the proposal is approved, we would have to send these children to another school, 21 girls and 21 boys, a great inconvenience to the school which, in my opinion, can be looked after and taught by one teacher. I feel the number under one teacher is sufficient for the common schools without causing hardship. The Department therefore remains that it cannot see its way to comply with the request to give a salary to a second teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n[Place and Date]\nTHIS LETTER HAS BEEN SENT\n\nI have been requested by Mr. Smith to send you a copy of the report on the Wikwemikong School. The report contains detailed information about the school's operations, including enrollment numbers, funding sources, and educational programs.\n\nThe school currently has an enrollment of 150 students, with a staff of 20 teachers and administrators. The school offers a comprehensive curriculum, focusing on both academic and vocational training. The vocational training program includes courses in carpentry, auto mechanics, and electronics.\n\nIn addition to the Wikwemikong School, there is also an Orphanage located on the reserve. The Orphanage provides care and education for orphaned children. The Department of Education has made provisions for the Orphanage, ensuring that the children receive proper care and education.\n\nThe Department of Education has also made provisions for the Shingwauk Home, which provides care and education for children who are not orphaned. The Shingwauk Home has a staff of instructors to meet the requirements of the Department. The Department has made provision for an additional number of pupils at the Wikwemikong Institution.\n\nG.H.

I have already written to the president of that institution on the subject; the answer I got was that they could not be taken there gratis, that they were also doing keeping 10 children and that they were receiving annual subsidies from the Department and unless they would be paid for they could not afford to take them etc. What do you think? Therefore, I beg the Department to grant us a yearly subsidy for at least 50 children, boys and girls at $60.00 dollars a head as it is done elsewhere for such institutions being the only way I see to succeed in the management of our school etc. If this is granted as I hope, your privileged boys at least, could be admitted at this institution to finish their education as said above.\n\nHonorable sir, although my letter being already too long, I cannot close it without presenting you two other similar requests. Please allow me to mention them to you. I shall be as brief as possible.\n\nAmong the several bands of Indians whose spiritual welfare had been instructed to care by the missionary, there are two of them which have not yet any school regularly established and recognized by the Department. These are the Mi'kmaq Nation.\nfor want of proper schooling remain in\nignorance and will never enjoy the benefit\nof a civilized and Christian education.\nTherefore I beg the Department to give us\naid and do for us what is done for\nother such institutions all through the\nDominion of Canada. Our sisters have\nthe charge of educating the boys as well\nas the girls, which can be managed well\nenough for a time, until these boys\nhave come to the age of 13 or 14 years old;\nafter that they cannot be kept any\nlonger with the girls, as you would\nreally understand. Then what to do\nwith these poor orphan boys? After they\nhave been well started in their education\nthey have to be thrown in the streets or let\nthem go with some friends, which would\nbe very much as bad, and in less than a\nyear they would not only forget the\ngood teaching they had got but become\nsometimes even worse than the other\nboys who had not the same chance,\nit is really too bad. What have we tried\nin order to obviate to such a difficulty\nand will I see only one thing to do?\nit would be to transfer our orphan\nboys to the Williamsburg Boys' Industrial School, to send our boys there\n177173\n\nFort William Mission Aug 6th 1874\n\nTo the Honorable Minister in charge of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nOur orphanage or Indian industrial school have been so far deprived of the subsidy granted yearly for poor Indian children, let it be from $50 to sixty dollars a head, as it is granted to other such schools in various missionary homes. Without which our orphanage or industrial school cannot stand. Now the poor children of St. Joseph's who are in charge of our school, with their small salary could buy food and clothes to many brothers even living from several other reservations, which they are no more ever allowed to collect money from white people as formerly. This is impossible. They have succeeded last year, with many privations of their own, to keep sixteen children, but surely the Department cannot expect any longer such a sacrifice to be imposed upon their good old plan. Besides this, there are not less than forty or fifty children, boys and girls who\nFort William Mission August 14th 1875\n\nHon.

Or will you have to report again next year, if so, about what time please?\n\nI am sorry, sir, to bother you so much and again, but as I consider this as a matter of death or life to our orphanage, I cannot really look at it with indifference; I am obliged to do all in my power to render it free from difficulties.\n\nRemain, sir, your humble servant,\n\n[Signature]\nFort William Sept. 14th 1896\n\nMay be Red Eye Deputy Chief &c. of Indian Affairs\n\nAlbion 153775\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI thank you for your prompt reply to my last letter and regret.\n\nYou will please allow me some questioning. There is something in your answer I cannot understand. You seem to satisfy me without a few words of explanation on your part. For more reasons, please allow me to quote your own answer; this is it:\n\n\"I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th ultimo asking for the reasons stated therein, that the Joseph Orphanage at Fort William may receive a per capita grant for at least 50 children, and in reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that it will be impossible to comply with request that you as all estimates are now in. But the Department does not, after this year only to whom it is not possible for the reason stated therein, since the Joseph Orphanage at Fort William should receive nearly a per capita grant for at least 50 children. I understand it, but what you meant or not? If it is so, I am very much obliged to the Department for such an\n1823\n\nSt. Joseph's Ind. Res.\n\nLt. William Hannon\n\nTo Mr.\n\nJ. P.

However the note may not have reached its destination.\nDear [Name],\n\nWill you please send over some cold cream for the use of the children in the ward.\n\nDr. Smith says you can make up a good cream from these directions:\n\nFirstly, take two cups of water and dissolve a quarter of a pound of salt in it. Next, take an attendant doctor this year for the Indians. I am sure he can make medicines. If we could only give him with the salt, he would furnish it. Surely the sisters understand making medicines. I will send one dollar next. It would be a great saving. When I see you we will speak about it.\n\nIf all else fails, please write you will oblige,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. I have not heard from you recently.\nSir,\n\nAs requested in your letter of the 16th instant no. 55, 896\u20142 relating to our finances, axes and enclose the enclosed sister's Dionysia letter or receipt for the axes. I might also draw the Department's attention to the Reverend Brother Superior's request regarding some drugs that might be furnished the Orphanage, as about $100 worth of medicines bought at wholesale, and dealt out by the Dispensary Sister would be a saving of a few hundred dollars. Drugs are often administered through the doctor, as in many instances the doctor is paid for trifling sicknesses. Communicate among children, that the Mother & Sisters could attend to themselves, I wrote the Doctor this morning to furnish these sick Orphans with pills, which I suppose will amount to a few dollars for its prescriptions, when if administered by the Dispensary Sister would be saved.

Sir:\n\nI have the liberty of addressing you on behalf of our Indian Home, which has been recently established, and I am at present obliged to observe that the school cannot be opened from the commencement until we are able to provide for even that small number of children who have been placed in our institution previously.\n\nThe Shingwauk Institution, and many others, conducted in the same manner as our own, and of which I have had the pleasure of visiting, namely the \"new\" school, promised us at least thirty pupils. Trusting your Department will take the matter into consideration, and we shall wait for the necessary funds.\n\nAccept my sincere thanks for the kindness and good wishes which you so kindly sent us a few days ago.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nfor the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs:\n\nRe extra provision for the Fort William Orphanage:\n\nThe enclosed communication from the Sister Superior of the Fort William Orphanage is forwarded for the consideration of the Minister, and in connection therewith the undersigned begs to state that the Sisters at Fort William have a commodious new building with accommodation for 50 pupils. The Government makes a grant to this Institution of $500 per annum.\n\nThe school at Wikwemikong to which the Sister Superior refers is the only Roman Catholic institution receiving a per capita grant and is full to overflowing, and numerous applications have had to be refused. Were further provision made for the Orphanage a number of Roman Catholic children, who cannot be taken in at present, could be accommodated.\n\nThe Mount Elgin, Shingwauk and Wikwemikong schools each receive a per capita grant of $60 per annum for each of 100 pupils, and the Mohawk is paid the same for 91 pupils.\nOTTAWA 1st April 1897\n\nRev.

Surely the per capita payment of at least sixty dollars for thirty-three and a half years is a fair amount to make out so you cannot find me the per capita payment this year.\n\nI am obliged to send you notice to liquidate the debt shown on the statement and you. If you do not come to our assistance I fear we cannot long continue the good work we have been doing.\n\nI had the honour of meeting Mr. Macdonald (Inspector of Indian Affairs) and explained to him the workings of the school.

You must have already observed in looking over the financial statement of receipts and expenses for last year, which was sent to the Department the 1st of last July, that it showed a debt of one hundred and seventy-five dollars and sixty-five cents. Even the treaty money which the parents of our pupils formerly sent us by the treaty to purchase clothing for their children, has not been given us this year with the exception of sixteen dollars.\n\nI was obliged to go from door to door and solicit anew to supply the school wants in time.\n\nI ought here perhaps that it is not a pleasant task to collect as the people do not consider it their duty to contribute towards the support of our Indian children.\n\nHon. Sir, I will leave the matter to your consideration and beg you to assist me in our present necessity.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nQUERY.\n\nANSWER.\n\nWhere is the financial statement card to have been sent in July last?\n\nACCOUNTANT'S BRANCH.\n\nOct 16th 1897.\n\nM.

Wm.) should give some assistance - they at least keep the school out of debt. The Govt claimed and be asked to vote anything further. The Band could offer to assist. However, I should say that the Band has already done a good deal for the school in the way of funds for building, supplies, etc.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nHCR, will you kindly let me know how many pupils there are at St. Boniface among whom the Bands 4th & 5th may belong.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nI wrote to the Deputy Chief, Mr. [illegible], in an office last September, stating that we had no capital, but only fifteen dollars, which I took a stake. The purpose of the committee was made out for this year so they could not grant the per capita payment for another year. I said so, and we came to the point that all should be in the financial situation. I went to the office last July. I also asked the Hon. Mr. [illegible] for the matter. If you will find the honor of a visit, you can explain to me the situation at the time. Please be assured that this will be successful yet, and have faith in the Lord, and pray for me. You will assist yourself in any situation and obtain our request. We have been told in the time at present there has been several applications.\nwhich we were obliged to reject on account of\nour limited means. I pray you to give me\nwith an early reply; in this case we could not\nobtain any assistance.\n\nPrincipal.\nSecretary,\n\nThe Chiefs Board of the Band surplus has a small pecuniary charge in aid of the Orphanage May 5th for $10.00 per annum. According to the present attendance as given by Mr. Edward Brown (8) this would be a contribution of $90.00 per ann. It is a question for him whether he will increase the grant of $50.00 to the Orphanage. The statement is made by the Superior that they are in debt $99.62.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nMadam,\n\nSir F. N. Biscarne, Director of Indian Affairs, has directed me to reply to your letter of the 7th inst., making application for increased accommodations at the St. Joseph's Indian Home, Cat Williams, Ont.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your request is being considered. I trust to apologize for the delay in answering your last letter and to state in conclusion that while some information was being obtained your letter was overlooked instead of being acknowledged.\n\n(Signed) [Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nthere would probably be an urgent appeal that the application of the grant be correspondingly increased, and likewise as the Ontario government contributes to this school, there must be white children there as well as Indians and it would therefore always be the possibility of a claim being made on account of the number of children and the Department might not know whether it was paying for Indian children only or for white children as well.\n\nH.C. Ross\nTo Secretary,\n\nWith reference to the application of the district supervisor of the Fort William Orphanage for increased assistance and particularly for a perpetual grant instead of an annual lump sum of $500, I have to say that this request has been considered in the Department and a reply was given to the district supervisor that the application had been received too late to adjust any item being inserted in the estimates for the ensuing year.\n\nIf it be now considered advisable to grant this school increased funds than heretofore, I would suggest that the grant be raised from $500 to $600\u2014this increase would not meet the present indebtedness of $199.62 per year\u2014but I think it not at all advisable to allow a larger grant because, first, with every increase in the number of pupils\nReferring to my letter to you of yesterday, the Dept. cannot agree to increase the amount of $500 nor entertain the proposition to allow a larger grant. The Secretary\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary\nI have been requested by Mr. Smith to write a letter to Mr. Brown regarding the school in our district.\n\nMr. Smith mentioned that the school is in need of some improvements. He suggested that we should consider purchasing new desks and chairs for the students. Additionally, he mentioned that the school needs more books for the children to read.\n\nI agree with Mr. Smith's suggestions and will discuss them with the parents at our next meeting. We will also consider the possibility of hiring a part-time teacher to assist with the teaching duties.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that these changes will benefit the children and improve their learning experience.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Name]\nyourself effect to represent the necessity of increased rent for the well working of the establishment.\nOTTAWA, 18th March, 1894.\n\nI have the honor to inform you that your application for increased assistance having been fully considered, the Department regrets that it cannot increase the present grant of $300 nor entertain the proposition that the present grant of $300 be increased to the \"Fort William Orphanage.\"\n\nThe reasons for the Department not doing anything more for this Institution are as follows:\n\nIt is considered that the present grant of $300 ought to be sufficient for the small number of children at this school, which is also supported by the Ontario Government and by public charity.\n\nWith respect to the proposition to allow a per capita grant in the event of an increase in the number of pupils there would probably be an appeal for an increased grant, but as there are white children at this school, there would likewise be the possibility of the claim being based on the total number of children and the Department might not know whether it was paying for the Indian children only.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPort Arthur,\nOnt.\n\nSecretary\nMr. Watson,\nIndian Agent,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring again to the \"Indian orphanage\" at Fort William. I have informed by the Master Superintendent that they house no white children, as after their departure from when they commenced to publish they learned that they could not get the \"2000\" \"Indian building fund money\" unless they totally abandoned the white children which they did consequently they feel that they are entitled to your consideration (this) to put on some basis or other Indian Schools or orphanages, because this house caused allegations going around in the town concerning as the citizens of the town thought the best should receive the assistance necessary without subjecting the Indians to such unnecessary work. Surely intimate upon Early Commence if you can in any way increase their grant or otherwise their most urgent request please your kind\n\nJ. Maclean\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, 29th April, 1898.\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\n\nI beg to submit herewith a letter from Mr. W. L. Matthews, of Port Arthur, informing the Department that he has ascertained that there are no white children at the Port William Orphanage.\n\nMr. Matthews, when recently in Ottawa, urged the Department to increase the grant to this institution, or to make a per capita grant; but was informed that the matter had already been brought before the Department by the Sister Superior in charge, and that it had been decided that the present grant of $500 could not be increased, nor the proposition to allow a per capita grant entertained. One strong objection to the allowance of the latter form of grant was the fact that it was understood that there were white children at the Orphanage, and therefore in the event of a per capita grant the total number for whom the claim would be made might not be composed of Indian children only, but include white also, for whom the Department is not responsible.\n\nIn his present letter Mr. Matthews states that he has ascertained that since the Port William Orphanage was rebuilt after the fire no white children have been kept there.\n\nAs all the children at this institution have come from the Port William Band it might be proper to contribute $100 from the funds of that Band, in addition to the $500 provided by Parliament, as suggested in the Accountant's memoranda of the 2nd November and 2nd December '97. The Orphanage is unable to pay expenses at present.\nOttawa, 12th July, 1898.\n\nSir:\n\nI hope to inform you that your letter of the 12th ultimo, giving further information in connection with your application for an increased grant to the Fort William Orphanage, having been submitted to the Deputy Superintendent General, I am directed to inform you that there are no funds from which any additional grant could be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

F. Holbrook, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur.\nSome weeks ago we called your attention to the necessity of appointing a physician to attend the inmates of our Orphanage, but our request was not sustained, and as there has been considerable sickness among the children we have had to bear the expense of their medical treatment. This we find a great hardship in fact an impossibility with our limited means, as we have great difficulty in meeting the current expenses of the house. We would therefore, humbly solicit an increase of five hundred dollars $500. in your annual grant of five hundred dollars $500. to our Institution.\n\nHoping you may see your way to accede to our request,\n\nWe have the honor to\n\nMost respectfully Yours\n\nSisters of St Joseph, in charge of the Indian mission home at Fort William.\n\nTo the Secretary of Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nHerewith find communication from the Sisters of St. Joseph asking that the annual grant to the Orphanage be increased from five hundred to seven hundred Dollars.\n\nI feel convinced that their statement regarding the difficulty of meeting current expenses is quite correct also that regarding the sickness among pupils.\n\nThe requisition for a physician spoken of was forwarded the Department on 25th Sept this year, and the reply handed to the Sisters.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. J. Hodder,\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nAbout four years ago the Sisters of St Joseph put up a very commodious and well finished building with accommodation for 50 children to replace the old building which had been destroyed by fire. The cost of the new building was somewhere in the neighborhood of $7000.00, to which the Fort William Indians contributed $1000.00.\n\nI see by the last published report of the Inspector of Public Charities for Ontario that the school received $148.92 from the Ontario Government for the year of '93, although Mr Matthews states that there were then no white children at the school.\n\nI know of my own knowledge that the white population of Port Arthur and Fort William think it a hardship that they have to contribute towards the support of Indian children at this school, which is conducted in connection with the Indian Mission at Fort William.\n\nThe sum contributed by the Government to this school amounts to only about $20.00 per head while the Ontario rate is less than $6.00, leaving $40.00 or $50.00 to be made up by outside contributions.\n\n[Signature]\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 28th December, 1893\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nMemo. re further application for increased\nPort William Orphanage.\n\nMr Agent Hodder submits an application from the Sisters of St Joseph who are in\ncharge of the Institution for an increased grant of\n$300.00 to the $500.00 now paid.\n\nThere are 24 Indian children now being\nmaintained and educated at the Orphanage and the\ndepartment is informed that there are no white\nchildren there.\n\nIn March '98 Mr Matthews of Port Arthur\npresented a similar application for an increase\nor a per capita grant, was informed that no increase\nwould be made and that the proposition for a per\ncapita grant could not be entertained, the reasons\ngiven being that the present grant of $500.00 was\nconsidered sufficient for the small number of child-\nren then in the school, which is also supported by\nthe Ontario Government and by public charity.\n\nThe reason for not acceding to the request\nto put this school on a per capita basis was that as\nthere were white children at the school, there would be\na possibility of the claim being based on the\ntotal number of children and that the Department\nmight not know whether it was paying for Indian\nchildren only.\nOTTAWA 4th January 1900\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th ultimo, forwarding a communication from the Sisters of St Joseph asking that the annual grant to the Orphanage at Port Williams be increased from $500 to $700; and in reply I am directed to say that no increase in the grant can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.

William O'Grady.\n\nThe present application for a grant of $40 per capita on the average attendance is only another way of renewing the application which has been made annually for the past four years. Last year the application was for a net increase of $200.00 over the $500.00 given by the Department. Last year the average attendance was 25, and if he were allowed at the rate asked for it would entail an annual expense of $800.00, which is $300.00 more than at present provided.\n\nThe Department has not acceded to any of the previous applications for increase, chiefly on the ground that white children were admitted to the school which receives assistance from the Ontario as well as the Dominion Government.\n\nI do not think that it will be necessary for me to go more fully into this matter as my previous memoranda on this subject are on this file, and are turned out in case you wish to look over them.\n\n[Signature]\nPort Arthur, 6th October, 1902.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith quarterly returns of the schools in this Agency, together with requisition for teachers salaries.\n\nI would like the Department to furnish me a list showing the authorized number of school days in each quarter, as there seems to be a difference of opinion amongst the teachers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 20th October, 1903.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your inquiry as to the number of school days in each quarter, I beg to refer you to the instructions to teachers printed on the back of the school returns, about which there can be no difficulty in understanding; how many days school is required to be kept open in each quarter.

Thus meeting the wishes of the band as expressed in their resolution passed in this Council meeting of the 2nd July and 27th May 1895.\n\nOn Oct 5th 1895 the Bishop of Peterborough wrote, stating that the orphanage church was almost completed and on the 12th Oct 95, the balance of the grant ($600) was paid over to the Bishop.\nGeneral History (continued)\n\nThe Hon. Mr. Daly then Sup't General of Indian Affairs in his letter to the Bishop in reply, said that he would recommend that His Excellency in Council authorize a contribution of \u00a32000.00 from the Capital of the Fort William Band to assist in constructing the Orphanage School. The Band having at their credit at this time Capital amounting to \u00a314,354.77.\n\nThe Indians of the Fort William Band met in Council on the 27th May 1895 and passed a resolution, asking that the Debt be paid from the Capital funds of the Band, the sum of \u00a32000.00 to be appropriated as follows:\n\n- \u00a31000.00 towards re-building the Church.\n- \u00a31500.00 towards the Orphanage.\n\nOn the 16th June 1895, an Order in Council was passed authorizing the expenditure of \u00a32000.00 from the Capital of the Credit of the Band to be towards the building of the new Orphanage.\n\nAs this O.C. did not meet the wishes of the Band as expressed in their Council Meeting of the 27th May 1895 viz., the granting of \u00a31000.00 to the Church and only \u00a3500.00 to the Orphanage, the Debt was the Bishop of Peterborough authorizing him to send \u00a3500.00 of the amount already approved by Council for the Orphanage to be applied to the building of the Church.\n\nOn Aug. 3rd 1895, an Order in Council was passed amending the previous order of...\nGeneral History (continued)\n\nFile no. 39305\n\nFor the Estimates for the fiscal year 1884-85.\n\nFile no. 39305\n\nAn annual grant was granted to the Orphanage.\n\nFile no. 39305\n\nThe first quarter return received (Sept. 1884) from the Orphanage showed an attendance of 16 girls at the school at that time.\n\nFile no. 39305\n\nOn the 26th March 1887 Mr. Dawson wrote to the Dept. asking that the grant of \u00a3300 be increased and in the Estimates for 1889-90 an additional grant of \u00a3200 was made to the Orphanage, raising the yearly grant to \u00a3500, which amount the Orphanage has received each year since the 1st July 1889.\n\nIn the supplementary estimates for 1888-9 a grant of \u00a3250 was provided towards the expense of removing and repairing an old school building which was added to the Orphanage for the purpose of increasing the accommodation.\n\nFile no. 39305\n\nOn the 27th June 1894, an Order in Council was passed granting the sum of \u00a3100 from the funds of the Fort William Band towards making necessary repairs to the Orphanage.\n\nDestroyed by Fire\n\nOn the 10th April 1895, the Orphanage Convent church at Fort William were completely destroyed by fire. The Orphanage was valued at \u00a310,000 and was insured for \u00a35,000.\n\nNew Orphanage Buildings\n\nOn the 22nd April 1895 the Bishop of Peterborough wrote to the Dept. asking that a grant be given towards building a new Orphanage to supply the place of the one destroyed by fire.\nGrant (concluded)\n\n\"Considered, the Dept. regrets that it cannot increase the present grant of $500.00 nor entertain the proposition to allow a per capita grant to the Fort William Orphanage.\"\n\nGeneral History\n\nThe Fort William Orphanage was first established in 1870 by ladies from France devoted to charitable work.\n\nThe first object of the institution was the Education of the young Indian girls on the Fort William Reserve and neighbouring places.\n\nDuring the first years only Indian girls were instructed in the Orphanage. They were taught English and the various household duties. Later, in addition to the Indian girls the Institution also received white children.\n\nThe Institution bore all the expenses in connection with the Educational support of the children at the Orphanage, most of its funds being received from a society in France. The first \"Fort Grant\" being made toward the support in 1883.\n\nThe building at that time (1883) consisted of a two storey frame, 40 x 50 feet with accommodation for about 130 pupils.\n\nThe first Government support asked for in connection with the Orphanage was when on the 15 Aug/82, the Directors forwarded a petition to the Governor General in which the above facts were set forth.\nGrant (continued)\n\nThe O.C. dated June 22/76 or July 19/6588 of the September quarter 1875, when an order in Council was passed authorizing a grant of \u00a3500 annually to the Boys' School. They now receive a grant of \u00a3500 per annum from the Crown which amount is paid to the trustees of St Joseph.\n\nThe Debt did not contribute anything towards the support of Orphanage Boarding School till 1885 when it was said a yearly grant of \u00a3300 which amount it continued to receive each year up to and including the year 1889.\n\nIn 1890, the grant to the Orphanage was increased to \u00a3500 per annum which amount it has received from the Government each year since 1890.\n\nThe Orphanage is paid a straight yearly grant of \u00a3500 and not by a per capita allowance.\n\nThe authorities for connection with the Orphanage and more especially the Rev. Brother Tuberculosis have been urging the Debt for some years to have their grant to the Orphanage School increased or placed on a per capita basis.\n\nOn the 18th March 1898 Mr. M. Lea, Secretary of the Dept of Indian Affairs finally wrote Mr. J. L. Matthews at Port Arthur in regard to the Department's decision in the matter as follows: \"I am directed to inform you that your application for increased assistance having been fully considered...\"\nFort William Orphanage\n\nSituation:\nThe Fort William Orphanage Boarding School, or St. Joseph's Home as it is also known, is situated on the Kaministiquia River on the Fort William Indian Reserve near the town of Fort William Algoma, Ont.\n\nThere is one acre of land in connection with the school.\n\nIt is a Roman Catholic institution, the work of teaching being carried on under the auspices of the Sisters of St. Joseph.\n\nThe Home is a two-story frame building 70 x 45 feet, with basement and rests on a stone foundation. The School is an old frame building 44 x 20 feet.\n\nThe buildings are heated by two furnaces in which wood is burned. They are supplied with water from the river by means of a force pump.\n\nThe Fort William Orphanage Boarding School was first opened in the year 1870. There is also a Boys' and a Girls' Day School run in connection with the Orphanage. These two day schools were opened in 1868, but the Board did not contribute any grant till 1870.\nSt. Peter's Cathedral\nPeterborough, Ont.\n\nHowever, this indigenous resource cannot be relied upon\nand the existing council is expected to continue its efforts at\nthis time. We have been generous in the past. In\nreviewing over the last annual Report of the Department of\nIndian Affairs, I notice that the Indian Boarding Schools of\nDominion receive from the Government a per capita\ngrant, while the First Nations Boarding Schools receive by\nfar the least of all the grants, although they have the least\nnumber of children. If you will kindly refer to page 5, both\nof the Reports you will observe that Oak Portage Boarding\nSchool which had parent 30 children, received a subsidy\n$2155, and Little Harbour School, with 40 children, received\n$2689. These two are now in the best of shape and\nsimilar to that of these schools.\n\nI would respectfully suggest that the Boarding School staff\nbe given the opportunity to develop a plan to make the\nother Indian Boarding schools similar to the missionary\nfunding arrangement of say $75 per capita for 40 boarders.\nIf this is done the school building will be improved, as\nit is lacking many accommodations for about 60 children,\nand the students will not be obliged to stay so frequently\nin hostels away from their homes.\n\nBelieve me, sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n[Name]\n[Title]\nSt. Peter's Cathedral\nPeterborough, Ont.\n\nDec 27th 1902\n\nHon C. Lipton M.P.\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs\n\nSir,\n\nI desire to bring before you the financial condition of the Indian Boarding School conducted by the Sisters of St. Joseph at Fort William. The annual government grant is only $500, though the Sisters board, lodge and instruct between 30 to 35 Indian children. You will readily perceive that this sum is barely sufficient to properly clothe the pupils, leaving aside their maintenance and other expenses. Besides, the Sisters have to deprive themselves of many things that, if not strictly necessary, would tend to their comfort, and they leave undone much that they would desire to do, in order to suitably clothe and feed the children in our care. The house is thus most economical.\n\nThese Indian children come from the reserves of Lake Superior, and during the past year the Sisters maintained 38 Indian children, 15 boys and 23 girls, in the Fort William Boarding School. At present there are still cases for the admission of 7 or 8 more from the River and their reserves. This school has, during past years, received considerable help from the various sources. The Government grant is very meagre in the annual budget.\nThe Fort William school furnishes a comfortable home and good education for young children and although it is most economically managed, they had a deficit last year of over $200.00. The contributions from other sources than the Department amounted to $1309.85. This is a large amount to raise by voluntary contribution in that neighborhood and must have caused the management a good deal of labor and anxiety to secure.\n\nI can see no reason why this school should not be recognized by the usual per capita grant of $60.00 for a limited number of pupils. The Indians along the North Shore of Lake Superior are of nomadic habits and most of them take their children with them on their hunts.\n\nThere seems no reason for enlarging the present building unless to provide accommodation for all the children on the reserve, day pupils as well as boarders. A new schoolhouse is required, so the Agent and School Inspector state, but the cost of the proposed building would make too great an inroad upon the funds of the Band, although the Indians are quite willing to contribute to this purpose. If a separate school building were put up, the present Orphanage has accommodation for more than the Department would probably be willing to make a grant for; as none but orphans from the Reserve should be taken.\n\n[Signature]\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 3rd January, 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nRe application of His Lordship, the Bishop of Peterborough for an increased grant to the Orphanage on the Fort William Reserve.\n\nThis school is not on a per capita basis and $500.00 is all the Department contributes towards its maintenance. The returns received show that there were 36 children in residence last year.\n\nFor the past six years the Church authorities have been endeavoring to obtain a per capita grant for this school but so far, unsuccessfully. The last application was refused on the ground that increased provision had been made for the Wikwemikong Industrial school, where 20 additional pupils were provided for in the estimates for 1901-2.\n\nThe census gives the Indian population of Ontario as 20,763, about one-third of whom are Roman Catholics. To meet the educational needs of these Indians the Department contributes maintenance for 120 pupils at Wikwemikong Industrial school, 30 boarders at Rat Portage (New Ontario) at $72 per capita and a lump sum of $300 for the Ft. William Orphanage.\n\nThe other Industrial schools in Ontario are each in receipt of a per capita grant of $60.00 for 100 pupils, the grant to the Rat Portage school being higher owing to its being dealt with by the Manitoba Superintendent.\nOttawa, January 27th, 1903.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Sifton,\n\nWith reference to the application of His Lordship the Bishop of Peterboro, for an increased grant by this Department to the Boarding School conducted by the Sisters of St. Joseph at Fort William, I beg leave to say that His Lordship asks that a per capita grant of $75.00 for 40 pupils be given him, which would amount to about $3,880.\n\nThe facts in connection with this school are set forth fully in the attached memorandum from Mr. Benson. I think the better solution of the matter for the present would be, if you are inclined to favour an increase at all, to make a grant of a lump sum, say, $1,000.00.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Seal]\nOttawa, 11th March, 1903.\n\nTo Lord:\n\nReferring to your Lordship's application of the 27th December last for a grant to the Fort William Orphanage, I have the honour to inform your Lordship that the same will receive due consideration when the estimates are being dealt with.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour Lordship's obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nVis Lordship,\n\nBishop Ro.

All children, irrespective of religion, get the same attention and education.\n\nI am in receipt of a communication from Rev Father R. E. Lamarche, S.J., Superintendent of the Mission, and Principal of the School, who points out the necessity of some definite assurance from the Department as to the per capita grant.\n\nHis Lordship, Bishop Scholard, of the diocese in which this school is situated, is very anxious that the matter be dealt with immediately, so that an appropriation might be taken in the next supplementary estimates to be brought down; otherwise there is likely to be great hardship and a good deal of confusion, and the Sisters may be compelled to close the School. In view of the possible removal of the School it would seem that this is a matter that should have immediate attention, and I will esteem it a special favor if you will be kind enough to bring it to\nmake application for attendance. That it has been possible for them to do so is owing to the fact that the Fathers (Christian Brothers) until recently have been supplying these schools with milk, vegetables and fuel. Last year they supplied and delivered 125 cords of wood and over 550 bushels of potatoes, as well as other lines of vegetables in proportion. I understand that the Brothers will not be able to supply vegetables this year, and will not be able to supply the wood. If they are moved from their present lands, as is proposed, it will be some time before they can be again settled and producing in the same way. Besides there has been a change in the management, and it is thought that in future it will be impossible to get such assistance from these Brothers. It is therefore important that the management of the school should know definitely what the Department will do towards its maintenance.\n\nThis is the only accessible school within the reach of seven or eight bands of Indians, viz., the Fort William, Savanne, Nepigon, Pays-Plat, Pic River, White...\nwhich she suffered by reason of being unable to employ men to take care of the furnace and to do other necessary work. The other sister who died was Sister Matilda. She had been in the school sixteen years, and as she was the senior sister had to take charge after the death of Mother Francis. She had been ill previously for some time. She was the cook of the house, and had to act as Superior of the school, and when there were some cases of typhoid fever in the school she had also to find time to nurse the sick children. These labors were too much for her strength and she contracted the disease and died after six days illness. Her life would not doubt have been spared if she had been able to hire nurses and servants to relieve her of part of the nursing and other work.\n\nThis School and its managers are certainly deserving of consideration. It would be too long a story to enumerate all the privations these Sisters have suffered in their endeavor to be able to keep all the children who\nHouse of Commons\n\nF.P. - 4\n\nand the $500.00 divided by that number, it will give the sum of $12.50 per capita for the 12 months maintenance, including board, instruction and the clothing of these children. There are two teachers whose salaries are fixed at $500.00 each, but the Sisters receive nothing individually; so the teachers' salaries are devoted to the maintenance of the children. The total inmates of the house, including the teachers, instructors, servants, &c., is about 60. To board and maintain this number of inmates is no small matter. The monthly bill for meats alone exceeds $60.00. To maintain the school, the Sisters have had to resort to begging, but the present Superior has forbidden this to be done in future. These Sisters devote their entire life to the teaching and maintenance of the children and the schools, and have had to suffer much privation for the want of the necessary articles of life. Their endeavors deserve consideration. Last year two sisters died. The Superior, Mother Francis, died of pneumonia, which she contracted no doubt by the strenuous labors and anxiety she was forced to undergo and the cold\nHouse of Commons\n\nF.P. -3-\n\nthat section of the country and rendered a very valuable public service. Circumstances have much changed in the last few years. There are not only several lines of steamers running to Fort William from Canadian ports, but also American lines of steamers, and there are now two railways traversing the country\u2014in fact three railways, as the Port Arthur, Duluth & Western, though managed by the Canadian Northern, is a separate line, and there will soon be another line traversing another section of the country, viz.: the G.T.F., all of which makes communication much easier than heretofore. This is evidenced by the large increase in the number of pupils attending the school, which is now 6 or 7 times greater than formerly. Besides the price of everything has gone up. Food, clothing, boots and shoes and labor has increased; so that the $500 is altogether inadequate for the support of the school and out of proportion with grants to other schools of a similar character. The average number of boarders in the school for many years has been from 35 to 40, sometimes 45. If the number of boarders be taken at 40\nHouse of Commons\n\nP.P. -2-\n\nnew there was some industrial instruction. I find upon looking over my correspondence that it is claimed that it is not only a boarding school, but an industrial school. Just what instruction is given I am unable at the present moment to state. I also find that the school management claim to have made application two years ago for a per capita grant and that nothing has as yet been definitely determined as regards the matter. I am also informed that Bishop O'Connor of Peterboro made an application on behalf of this school some time ago. That it has not been dealt with may be due to the fact that Mr. Sifton, who was then the Minister, has been absent a good deal this year. However, it is important that the matter be now dealt with.\n\nWhen this school was started there were very few pupils and I am informed that a grant of $500 per year was made by your Department and that at the time the management were satisfied with this sum. The school has been in existence for 25 years and has served a much felt want in\nHouse of Commons\n\nMay 27, 1905.\n\nFrank Pedley Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. Genl.

I was also of opinion that I had written the Department a few days previously. Neither my communication nor any application from the school management appeared to be at hand, and you stated you would have the papers looked up. These documents may be found. In the meantime I am writing you lest my previous letter may not have been mailed or may have been mislaid in some other way.\n\nIn my discussion with you I had assumed the school was merely a boarding school.

This school is in receipt of an annual grant of $500.00 and last quarter's return shows that there were 38 Indian pupils enrolled with an average attendance of 28. The present amount granted would provide for only about 9 pupils at the per capita rate of $60 and the maintenance of an average of nearly 20 pupils must be a severe tax on the management. They have a well-equipped institution and it is the only Roman Catholic boarding school in the Eastern Provinces, Wikwemikong being ranked as an industrial school and always having its full complement of pupils.\n\nIf the Grand Trunk Pacific does not appropriate the mission buildings and school at Fort William, the Orphanage will require new class-rooms as the building used for that purpose is in a very bad condition and not worth repairing. The question of putting this institution on a per capita basis is deserving of the Department's consideration.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, 5th June, 1905\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, applying on behalf of the Fort William Orphanage for a per capita grant in lieu of the annual allowance of $500.00 now given this institution; and in reply I beg to say that your application will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nJames Connell, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOTTAWA.\n3.\n\n286446\n\n...more distance, the tale would move the heart of a stone.

Scollard,\nBishop,\nNorth Bay,\nOnt.\n\nP.S. I may state that James Conner M.P. can confirm the truth of my statement. He has taken this matter up with your department.\nOver 400 Indian children and $500 a year to feed and clothe them and keep the institution heated means only about $12.50 per capita per year of an allowance from the government. When I learned that the Indian Industrial Schools west of Lake Superior receive a grant of $100 per head per year from the government, I was surprised and am yet under a cloud as to why this School has been treated differently from all the other Indian Industrial Schools of the West.\n\nSeven bands of Indians (the Fort William, the Sarnia, the Nepigon, the Pays Plat, the Pic River, the White River and Long Lake Bands) send their poor Indian children to this school. The means of communications are short of the number of children constantly grows so the same means of transportation afforded by the F.R.P. will mean that the number in the near future will grow still larger. Since I feel that I am only asking what is just, then I respectfully request you Hon. Sir to place in the Supplementary Estimates the sum of $100 per Capita for 60 Indian children.\n\nThe Sisters are doing a great work of self-sacrifice in that School, and if I were to relate to you the privations and hardships they have endured in order to support the School in the past or since a...\nNorth Bay, June 14th 1905\n\nThe Honorable F. Oliver Mr. P.,\nMinister of the Interior,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI write you in reference to the Indian Industrial and Boarding School at Fort William. On my first official visit as Bishop of the New Diocese of Sault Ste Marie to that School about three weeks ago, I was interested in the condition of affairs in that school.\n\nI found a large building then rent and clean, and well kept blankets, furnished, and heated with hot air furnaces. I found the Sisters of St. Joseph there, and 47 Indian boys and girls. I asked how they supported the institution, that is how they boarded, lodged, clothed and taught household economy to their inmates. The Mother Superior told me that they got a grant of $500 a year from the Government, and so the rest. They had to buy clothes and provisions from the merchants and bakers of Port Arthur and Fort William, and that, moreover, they had to visit the lumber shanties to buy alms to keep them from starving and going naked.\nintention is to maintain this boarding Industrial school which is the only one accessible to 7 bands of Indians. But then there must be means provided for the support of the institution at least by a per capita grant as it is given to all other boarding schools. The Superiors will not allow our Sisters to go begging around the country and even through the camps as they have been doing for two years in order to support the school, and even with that they have not collected enough to pay the debts they have contracted. All the agents of the Dept. who have passed through the mission for two years have recognized the justice of our petition and promised to support it. Bishop O'Connor has made a strong application, but never received more than the acknowledgement of his letter. It may be due to the fact that Hon. Sifton has been away a great part of that time. But as some friends suggested to me that our petition should be presented to the Dept or Committee through your medium. Although quite a stranger to you I feel confident that I have found the right way of presenting our petition if you take it in your hands. Excuse me for the lengthy explanation of our case but I thought it was not out of place to understand it better.\n\nThus\n\nS.P.E. I.S.2.\nbeing sufficient. One of these Sisters has been teaching the same class for 12 years, the other for 7 or 8 years, but they never touch a cent of their salary; it all goes to support the house. But I ask you is it fair to expect the Sisters not only to devote their lives for the instruction of the Indians, but also to be always under the privation of the most necessary articles of life? Last year we lost two Sisters. The Superior Mother Francis died with pneumonia that she contracted no doubt from the cold she suffered in her room during that severe winter when the blankets would be found sticking by frost to the wall, and the reason was that they could not afford to hire a man to take care of the furnaces. The other old Sr. Matilda who had been in the school for 16 being the senior Sister took charge of the house at the death of Mother Francis. She had been laid up herself for nearly 6 weeks previously. When an epidemic of typhoid fever broke out in the school she was the cook of the house, had to act as Superior of the school and find time to nurse the patients as the other Sisters. It was more than a robust health could bear. She took the fever herself when the pupils began to recover and died after six days. The life of this other devoted Sister might have been spared if they had means to hire nurses or at least servants to help them. It would be too long to enumerate all the privations our Sisters have to suffer in order to be able to keep all the children who make application for admission.\n\nThe Fathers have until now supplied the school with milk, vegetables, and have been hauling the cordwood, which this year amounts to 135 cords. The hauling is about 5 miles and it would cost them $1.00 a cord. They use over 550 bushels of potatoes the year round and other vegetables in proportion. But most likely the Fathers will not be able to start a farm as the one we have now in the new location where the mission will be removed when the G.T.P. takes this part of the mission. So before building a new school we have to know if the Dept's\n3 May 1905\n\nJames Connee, M. P.,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI call on you for a favor that I am sure you will be pleased to obtain for us if it is your power. For two years we have been applying to the Dept. of Indian Affairs to obtain a per capita grant for our Indian Boarding school as it is granted to all the other Indian Boarding schools of the Dominion. The Dept. is not to be blamed for the condition under which our school exists. When this boarding school was opened the Sisters had very few pupils and to be able to conduct the school they asked for a grant of at least $500 a year and it was granted. For more than 25 years now 6 sisters have been devoting themselves to educate the poor Indian children of Indians of 7 different Bands of this part of the country: Ft. Will. River Savanne, Nepigon, Paips-Plat, Pic-River, White River and Long Lake. But circumstances have changed\u2014We have two railways and very soon a 3rd one the C. T. P. that make communications so much easier than before and so the number of pupils have increased 4 or 5 times what it was at the beginning and the price of every thing, food, clothes, labor has also increased greatly. So that the grant of $500 is altogether out of proportion at present. For few years the average of boarders in the school has been from 35 to 40 sometimes 45. If you take the average of 40 boarders and divide the grant of $500.00 by that number it will give the sum of $12.50 per capita for the 13 months, for boarding, instructing and clothing those children. Naturally you will ask me how could the Sisters be able to conduct the school for that amount. Of course outside of the $500. grant there is the salary of the teachers $250.00 each that was raised to $300.00 each last year. But even by conservating the teacher's salary to support the school, it is very far from\nOttawa, June 28th, 1905.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the 14th instant, addressed to the Honourable Mr. Oliver, whose absence from the city and the consequent accumulation of correspondence has prevented an early reply, and to say with reference to a Government grant for the Fort William School that the application is not being lost sight of and I hope to be able to inform you at an early date what action the Government will take regarding meeting your request.\n\nI may say that both Mr. Bonnycastle and Mr. McCool, M.P., have interested themselves in this matter by calling at the Department and asking that no delay be done regarding it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

It has never been recognized as an Industrial or Boarding School and while it may have some claim upon the Department for financial recognition I am inclined to think that in view of the prospective change of the Indians and the school at Fort William by reason of the acquisition of part of the reserve by the Grand Trunk Pacific Ry., the question of whether we should put this school on a per capita basis should remain for another year. In the meantime I would recommend that this school receive the sum of $1,000.00 this year in addition to the $500.00 grant. Funds are available for this purpose.\nNorth Bay, June 30th, 1906.\n\nM. F.

Consequently, I was led to believe that I would only have to draw the Department's attention to the mistake and it would be forthwith corrected.

About 10 days ago I wrote Mr. F. Oliver, the Minister of the Interior requesting him to kindly inform me why this Port William orphanage has received such different treatment from the Department.

The Minister communicated the decision already arrived at, that the school would receive this year $1000 in addition to the $800 grant. He informed the Bishop and Mr. Gormee that the whole question of contribution to Indian schools would be gone into, and that when that was done the orphanage at Fort William would also be considered.\n\nNo intimation was given, nor promise made, that the orphanage would receive an increased grant, but that the merit of its work, along with that of other schools, would be taken into consideration and dealt with accordingly.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nOTTAWA, 13th July, 1905\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your application for increased assistance to the Fort William Orphanage, I beg to say that it has been decided to make an additional grant of $1000.00 over and above the $500.00 a year previously paid. This arrangement will date from the 1st instant and payment will be made quarterly upon receipt of the usual returns.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nJames Conner, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOTTAWA.\nOTTAWA, 24th July, 1906\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 13th inst., regarding your application for increased assistance to the Port William Orphanage, I beg to say that by a clerical error the word \"annual\" was inserted between the words \"additional\" and \"grant\" in the fourth line of the letter above referred to. It is the decision of the Department to make an additional grant for this year of $1,000.00 over and above the $500.00 previously paid. This grant is not to be paid annually, but only for the current year. In the meantime it is hoped that the whole school question will be thoroughly gone into and the grants re-adjusted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJames Conner, Esq., M.P.\nPort Arthur,\nOnt.\n\nSecretary\nThe Mission, Fort William; 25th July 1865\n\nTo\n\nThe Secretary Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa:\n\nWe have learned with pleasure from Rt. Rev. Bishop Seville and from Mr. James Conner M.P., that an additional grant of one $1000.00 shall be added to the annual $500.00 previously received every year for the support of the Fort William Boarding School. We, who are very thankful indeed, and we feel confident that our petition for a pecuniary grant shall also be received favourably for the school is conducted by the same principals than other Industrial schools.\n\nIt may be alleged though to reduce the number of new admissions for not only the Bishop who conduct the school receive no salary for their good work but they are running in debt, and this is against the constitution of any religious order.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nOTTAWA, 31st July, 1905\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 26th instant I beg to say that the grant of $1000.00, in addition to the $500.00 already allowed the Fort William Orphanage applies to the current year only. The question of the allowance of a per capita grant to this school will be considered during the current year.\n\nMr. Connors, M.D., was informed that the extra provision of $1000.00 was not to be in the shape of an annual grant, but only applied to this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. McLean\n\nSecretary\n\nRev. P.E. Lamarche, S.J.\nRoman Catholic Mission\nFort William, Ont.\nThis effect:\nMost of our children actually in the School are deprived of their fathers or mothers and some of both. The Sisters and the Fathers of the Mission have made great sacrifices to keep these poor children and it is only by begging that we have been able to manage it. But there are so many collections going on everywhere, for Hospitals, Churches etc., that we have decided to abandon that way of supporting the School, and we do not see any other way of continuing the good work done for over thirty years than the per capita Grant that all the other Boarding Schools receive from the Government.\n\nYour humble servant in X'tl\n\nRev. B. Lamarche, J.F.,\nPrincipal of the School.\nThe Secretary Department of Indian Affairs\nhad made the report that this school did not present the character required by the Dept. for an Industrial School. I stated why that I had not the occasion to meet the gentleman who may have come when I was away and the ladies tell me that they were not called to give an account of the work done at the School.\n\nIn letters I wrote last winter to Right Rev. Bishop Scollard and to M. J. Corrigan M.P., I said that outside of the ordinary teaching of schools that include the IV/Book Standard, the girls are trained in cooking, baking, washing, ironing, general housekeeping, sewing, knitting, patching and some can cut their own dresses.\n\nThe boys are not admitted as boarders after 12 years of age, as the management of girls and older boys in the same building is not considered advisable. The boys do the general housekeeping of their department and the older ones in spring time and summer help in the garden. But the greater number of the boys are from 7 to 10 years of age.\n\nI know that with proper means the management of the School could be improved, and we would be pleased to receive the directions of the Dept. to\nThe Mission, Fort William, March 27th 1906\n\nThe Secretary Department of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSeveral times since three years ago we have made application to the Dept. to obtain a per capita grant for the Fort William Indian Boarding School. It seems that right Rev. Bishop O'Connell's request is not on record. And last year Right Rev. Bishop Scott and Mr. Conner M.P. told us that the application was presented too late to be considered at that time, but a special grant of $500 was given for this year 1905-1906 to enable the Indians to pay their debts, and I think it will be sufficient.\n\nWe have now to look for the pressing future. I understand that the Indians are given one year from the 24th of January 1906 to move in another part of the Reserve, and I suppose we should move about the same time. But we cannot determine any plan of building a new school before we know the size we should give to the new house.\n\nIn an interview I had with Mr. J. Conner M.P. last time, he told me that some inspector\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, April 5, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nRev. Father Lamarche has again applied for a per capita grant for the Ft. William Orphanage. This school, which has had an average attendance of about 25 pupils for many years, is only in receipt of a lump sum of $500 per annum, although last year an additional $1000 was granted for maintenance, but this additional grant was only to cover the current year; it will cease on June 30, next.\n\nThere is no doubt that this institution is doing good work and deserving of being put on a satisfactory financial basis, especially as they will have to rebuild on account of their property being expropriated by the Grand Trunk Pacific, and they should know exactly how they will stand in relation to the Department. At present the school is forced to beg for contributions from outside sources, and last year they raised in this manner $2,570. It seems hardly fair that this school should have to raise so large an amount by voluntary contributions, and I do not see why the Department should hesitate to give them the usual per capita grant to Ontario schools, namely, $60, for 25 pupils. This question of a per capita grant for this school has been before the Department for a number of years, and as I said before, something definite should be done before they rebuild.\n\n[Signature]\nThe Mission, Fort William, May 21, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI hope the Department will be able to tell soon if the per capita Grant for the Boarding School is voted. The Sisters will not go to the expenses to have plans prepared before they are assured of the Grant.\n\nYour humble servant in Xst\n\nRev. P. E. Lamarche, S.J.,\nSup. at the Mission.\nOttawa, May 30, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith regard to the remarks hereunder, made by the Rev. P.E. Lamarche, Superintendent of the Ft. William Mission, in his letter of the 21st inst., regarding the question of a per capita grant for the Ft. William Orphanage, I beg to say that there is no provision made for providing a per capita grant. If the school is rebuilt I think it should be entitled to be placed on a better financial condition than at present, as the Church can hardly be expected to rebuild and carry on the school under the present conditions.\n\nFather Lamarche states that the Sisters will not go to the expense of having plans prepared before they are assured of the grant. If this school is abandoned, it would be a great loss to the Indians of Ft. William, and it seems to me that an effort should be made to allow them a per capita grant of $50 for at least 25 pupils. This would give them some encouragement to rebuild and continue their work.\n\nIn this connection please see my memorandum of the 3rd ult. turned out herewith.\n\n[Signature]\nExtract:\n\nDiocese of Sault Ste. Marie,\nD.J.S.\n\nNorth Bay, May 30, 1906\n\nThe Hon. F. Oliver, M.P.,\nMinister of the Interior,\n\nHonorable and dear friend:\u2014\n\nAbout a year ago on the occasion of a conference with you at Ottawa you were kind enough to rectify the injustice towards the Fort William Indian Orphanage by giving an additional grant of $1000 for the fiscal year 1905-06. You informed me at that time that during the late Parliamentary recess there would be an investigation of all the Indian Industrial Schools and Orphanages, with a view of readjusting the grants, at the same time assuring me that whatever would be decided upon, the Fort William Indian Orphanage would be treated, as regards the grant, in the same manner as all similar Indian institutions. I have not heard of any investigation being held during the recess, so I trust Hon. friend that you will do the same for the coming fiscal year towards the Fort William Orphanage as was done last year. I consider that the orphans must be in their present quarters for another year at least, as a suitable building cannot be ready for occupation on the new Indian location in a shorter time.\n\nIf instead of the grant which was given last year you decide to give a \"per caput\" allowance as is done in the other Indian institutions, I am certain all interested parties shall be satisfied.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nD. J. Scollard,\nEp. of S. S. Marie.\nThe Deputy Sir,\n\nWith\n\nfrom the Roman Catholic Bishop of Sault Ste. Marie, addressed to the Minister, which deals with the Fort William Orphanage I beg to refer you to my memorandum of the 36th ult., in which I stated that, if this school is to be rebuilt, it should, I consider, be entitled to be placed on a better financial condition than at present, as the Church can hardly be expected to rebuild and carry on the school under the present conditions.\n\nIn that memorandum I recommend that a per capita grant of $60 for at least 25 pupils be allowed.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nThis is to be sent as a supplement.\nOttawa, June 12, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith reference to that portion of the letter from the Roman Catholic Bishop of Sault Ste. Marie, addressed to the Minister, which deals with the Fort William Orphanage I beg to refer you to my memorandum of the 30th ult., in which I stated that, if this school is to be rebuilt, it should, I consider, be entitled to be placed on a better financial condition than at present, as the Church can hardly be expected to rebuild and carry on the school under the present conditions.\n\nIn that memorandum I recommended that a per capita grant of $60 for at least 25 pupils be allowed.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, June 16, 1908.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to that portion of your letter of the 31st ult., which refers to the question of a per capita grant for the Fort William Orphanage, I beg to say that the Department hopes to be in a position to give you a definite answer on this subject very shortly, but it cannot do so, however, until the supplementary estimates are passed by Parliament.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

Sir,\n\nIn reply to that portion of your letter of the 30th ult., addressed to the Superintendent General, which relates to the financial condition of the Fort William Orphanage I beg to say that the Department hopes at an early date to be in a position to meet Your Lordship's wishes that a fixed per capita grant may be provided for this institution.\n\nAs soon as the supplementary estimates are passed you will be definitely advised as to what the Department will be prepared to do.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nRight Rev.

Sir,\n\nReferring to our conversation here a few days ago with reference to the grants made to the Fort William Orphanage, I beg leave to say that I have looked into the matter and I find that in 1905-04 the sum of $1,000.00 was paid in addition to the $500.00 already provided, and in 1906-06 $1,000.00 was paid in addition to the $500.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Right Rev. D. J. Scollard, D.D.,\nBishop of Sault Ste Marie,\nNorth Bay, Ontario.\nbuildings this summer. The land and lots are not yet surveyed, and it will be probably one month or more before we can travel on that road.\n\nIt is only yesterday that the Bishop (Rev. Mr. Macdonald) visited me, that the removal of land I had asked the Indians to allow us to use for farming was approved by the Bishop. We could not go and work before the land be granted, surveyed and cleared. Now before the sufficient clearing be made and the material be brought on the ground from here, it would be too late to start building a Church, Residence and Boarding School.\n\nWe intend to clear the land this summer, dig the foundations and try to bring all the material we can, so as to be ready to start building early next spring. I hope this course will be approved of by the Bishop.\n\nWith reference to the cemetery I will have occasion to consult with our Bishop next week.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSup. at the Mission.\nThe Mission, Fort William, 6 July 1906\n\nThe Secretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received your welcome letter of June the 23rd No. 153815 informing me that a York Capital Grant of $60.00 per 25 pupils had been voted for The York William Boarding School.\n\nYou must understand that $60.00 a year or $5.00 a month is a very small amount to provide for something clothing of a child and the management of a Boarding School for this part of the country.\n\nHowever, the Superior of the diocese who has come from Peterborough to settle that matter, accepts this offer of the Dept. and has determined that the new Boarding House shall be built at Squam Bay (Mission Bay). It will be a frame building, brick walled, three stories high on stone foundations large enough to accommodate 50 pupils. As I mentioned it in a previous letter, the Boys' School will be discontinued with other one move to Mission Bay.\n\nOn account of all the delays that have happened, I do not see any hope of getting up\nNorth Bay, July 23rd.\n\nMy dear Mr. Redley:\n\nI have investigated the Fort William orphanage and found full information about grants made to the said orphanage. The orphanage never received more than $500 in any one year for its maintenance. The sum of $1000 was granted in 1903-04 to help defray the additional expenses incurred in the enlargement of the building. The grant was approved for that purpose and was so expended. I was certain of any assertion that never more than $500 was given for current maintenance.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop Stewart.\nOttawa, July 26, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nBishop Scollard, in reply to your letter of the 30th ult., says that the sum of $1,000 granted in 1903-04 to the Fort William Orphanage was to help to defray the additional expense incurred in the enlargement of the building and that the grant was requested for that purpose and was so expended. He concludes by saying that he was certain of his assertion that never more than $500 was given for current maintenance.\n\nUpon referring to No. 5 of this file I find that Bishop Scollard is correct. The $1,000 referred to was paid on account of buildings, although the grant was made in the supplementary estimates to provide an additional grant to the Fort William Orphanage. This item of $1,000 was placed in the supplementary estimates by direction of the Minister on a memorandum from you of January 27, 1903, which dealt with an application from Bishop O'Connor for a per capita grant to this school, and was intended to assist in the maintenance of this institution. There was no mention of buildings when the grant was applied for.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nFort William Mission, 18th April, 1907.\n\nTo His Lordship,\n\nBishop O'Connor,\n\nPeterboro.\n\nYour Lordship,\n\nI have the honor to forward herewith a resolution passed by the Fort William Band of Indians, the meaning of which is that we ask that the money granted by the Band to enable the Sisters of St Joseph to erect a Convent upon our Reserve together with the money received for the sale of the land on which the Convent stood, be returned to the Department of Indian Affairs to be held in trust and to be applied to the erection of another Convent upon the Reserve, at a place to be settled upon by the Band.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYours respectfully.\nFort William Reserve, 16th, April, 1907.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir-\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith copy of a resolution and letter forwarded to Bishop O'Connor of Peterboro, regarding matters connected with the Convent of the Sisters of St Joseph, it is we understand possible that there will be no Convent erected upon the reserve and that the Sisters will withdraw entirely from us, in this event we would like the Department to protect us for the amount granted from the funds of the Band towards the erection of the convent also for the amount received from the sale of the property upon which the convent stands, we feel that in the event of the withdrawal of the Sisters that our money should be returned, but should they remain we will willingly consent to the money being used for the erection of another Convent, at a place upon the reserve decided on by the Band.\n\n[Signature]\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th inst., inclosing a resolution of the Fort William Indians and a copy of a letter addressed to Bishop O'Connor, of Peterborough, setting forth that, in the event of the Sisters Of St. Joseph not erecting a convent and school on the new reserve, they be asked to refund the amount of money granted by the band for the erection of the Orphanage, together with the amount received from the sale of the land upon which the convent stood; and in reply I beg to say that the Department will await the reply of Bishop O'Connor before any further action is taken in this matter.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nJ.D. McLean\nSecretary.\n\nNeil McDougall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nSince the Indians are settled at present in two localities, several miles apart, it is not deemed advisable to commence building operations immediately but to await further developments in regard to the permanent settlement of the Band and greater union amongst the members.\n\nThe Indians seem to have the idea that all the money received for the sale of the Convent belongs to the Band. In this they are mistaken, for the money was paid for the Convent only and no part of it was paid for the land. The money expended on building the Convent twelve years ago, and the addition several years later, was obtained principally from white people, who gave donations to the Sisters and from the savings of the Sisters themselves, whilst the smaller portion was a grant from the funds of the Band.\n\nIn the meantime I may inform you and the Band that the amount received for the sale of the Convent is quite as safe in Peterborough as in the hands of the Indian Department, and when needed for a new Convent, will be obtained with greater facility from here than it would from the Indian Department.\n\nI remain, Yours truly,\n\nR. A. O'Connor,\nBishop of Peterborough,\nSt. Peter's Cathedral,\nPeterborough, Ont. May 7th, 1907.\n\nMr. Neil McDougall,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI received in due time your letter of 18th ult., in reference to the Indians of Fort William Reserve.\n\nYou state that they passed a resolution asking that the money granted by the Band to enable the Sisters of St. Joseph to erect a Convent upon their Reserve, together with the money received for the sale of the land on which the Convent stood, be returned to the Department of Indian Affairs, to be held in trust and to be applied to the erection of another Convent upon the Reserve, at a place to be settled upon by the Band.\n\nI may say that it was intended to build a Convent at Mission Bay, where a minority of the Band now resides, but when the Right Rev. Bishop Scollard visited Fort William and learned that many Indian families settled at the foot of Mount McKay, he decided on postponing building a Convent, until a larger number would settle in one place. He was lately in Ottawa and explained the condition of matters to the officials of the Indian Department. He was informed that it was not necessary to build upon the Reserve, but he could use his discretion and might build outside of the Reserve, if Indian children would be received into the new Convent.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of April 30th\n\nNo. 153816/1\n\nreferring to latter of above date and number with reference to resolution passed by the Fort William band respecting a certain grant from the band some years ago to the St Joseph's convent and the sale of the land to the Grand Trunk Pacific, I herewith beg to enclose you the reply from the Rev Bishop of St Peter's Peterborough Ont.\n\nyour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, May 28, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th ult., inclosing a copy of a communication received from His Lordship the Bishop of Peterborough in reference to the resolution passed by the Fort William band respecting the disposal of the funds received from the Grand Trunk Railway Company for the convent and property upon which it stands.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Bishop is correct in stating that no part of the money was paid the Church authorities for the land, and the question of recovering the Indians for the grant made from their funds towards the convent building can stand until it is settled whether the convent is to be rebuilt or not.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\nSecretary.\n\nNeil McDougall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nAs from the present time, we have tried without success to find a suitable building in Fort William to afford new proper quarters for the inmates of the Breton orphanage.\n\nIf I can get the authorities at the institution for boys and girls at Wikwemikong to accept the inmates there until such time as the new orphanage is completed, I presume that the Department would be willing to the Wikwemikong institution to take care of whatever number of inmates of the present Fort William orphanage which might be temporarily housed at Wikwemikong. I believe that there will not be a large number but may come in a few, which we shall have to house somewhere else and I believe that we had way out of the difficulty as we have now admitted for a time at Wikwemikong.\n\nI am yours very devotedly,\n\n[Signature]\nD.

Maria\nNorth Bay, July 8th\n\nMr. Frank Biffin\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Mr. Biffin:\n\nI am writing to you in Ottawa towards the end of April to discuss the rebuilding of the Fort William site or orphanage. In view of the fact that the division of the Indians of that place, I expressed the opinion to you that it would be better to obtain a site for the new orphanage on neutral territory, and you were favorable to the idea and interested, but as far as the per capita grant was concerned, it made no difference to the Department whether the orphanage was rebuilt on land outside the limits of the Reservation.\n\nIf the work were done by the new orphanage, the per capita grant would be saved. Now, it is probable that the F.S.P. officials will require possession of the old orphanage building very soon, and the new orphanage cannot be ready for occupation for over\nOttawa, July 12, 1907.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General\u2014\n\nBishop Scollard, of North Bay, writes, saying that the Grand Trunk Railway Pacific Company will most likely take possession of the Fort William Orphanage immediately, and he suggests that he be allowed to send as many of the pupils as possible to the Wikwemikong Industrial School. They would have room there to accommodate all the pupils, and I consider that this is the best arrangement that could be made, and the Department could transfer the grant for the Orphanage to the Wikwemikong school for the number of pupils admitted.\n\nI would recommend that Bishop Scollard be informed that his suggestion is approved of.\n\n[Signature]\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that this is the best course to pursue.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, July 15, 2007.\n\nRight Reverend Sirs\u2014\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 8th inst., advising the Department that it is probable that the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway officials will require possession of the Fort William Orphanage building very soon and suggesting that Your Lordship be allowed to transfer as many of the pupils as possible at present at the Orphanage to the Wikwemikong Industrial School until such time as a new building is provided.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department sees no objection to Your Lordship's suggestion and will transfer the grant for the Orphanage to the Wikwemikong school for the number of pupils admitted. This arrangement, however, must not be allowed to interfere with the admission of the number of pupils provided for from the province of Quebec.

Now there are Indians in the District of Algoma for whom the Fort William School would be more convenient than that at Wikwemikong; for instance there are the Indians at Michipicoten at White River, around Chapleau and at Biscotasing for whom the Fort William school would be more convenient. Besides there might be Indians in other places who for some reason would not send their children to Wikwemikong, and I think they should be given the option of sending them to Fort William though they might be outside of the Thunder Bay District.\n\nX D.J. Scollard\nBishop of S.S. Marie.\nOttawa, May 4, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 2nd instant, in which you state that you trust that the Department will not insist upon confining the Port William School to the Thunder Bay District for recruiting purposes.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of Your Lordship's explanation, the Department will not insist upon this being strictly carried out. The reason why the school was to be restricted to the Thunder Bay district was to avoid clashing with the boarding schools east and west of this district, and so long as these schools do not object the Port William school may take in pupils outside the limits mentioned in letter of the 26th ultimo, but it must be distinctly understood that they will have to be Indians and all admissions must be recognized by the Department before payment can be made.\n\nTrusting that this concession will be satisfactory to Your Lordship,\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRight Rev. D. J. Scollard, D.D., Secretary,\nBishop of Sault Ste. Marie,\nNorth Bay, Ont.\nThere is some question of building a school at Long Lake for the Long Lake Band of Indians. I was at Long Lake last summer and spent about a week there.\n\nThis is a nomadic band, almost entirely uncivilized. They are in the forest from October to May. In warmer weather they go about the lake fishing and picking berries. It is certain that they could not be persuaded to send their children to school, if a school and teacher were there. Besides, it would be impossible to get a teacher of any kind of qualification to go and stay there. There are many Indians who are willing to go to these places, but they are unwilling to go to those places.\n\nI am solicitous for the Educational and Moral Welfare of the Indians and must, in conscience, advise the Department against the expenditure of money for schools in places where they would produce little or no good.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Place]\nMy dear Mr. Dudley:\n\nIn view of the rather unfortunate division among the Indians at Fort William Indian Reservation, I have been finally decided to rebuild the Boarding School for Indian children at Fort William and on the Reserve. Each of the two schools will be built on the Reserve and will have a Church, a school on the Reserve and a Church, a school on the Reserve and a Church, a school on the Reserve and a Church.\n\nI considered it better to regard the Boarding School, not to take into account the number of students in terms but to rebuild it on neutral grounds and to secure all together.\n\nI respectfully request you to inform me if the Department will give the new Boarding School to each Indian inmate of the new Boarding School, provided such be elected suitable to occupy the Reserve, as my mind cannot carry the Reservation as my own. I cannot say that it should make any difference if the Department, where the building may be situated, provides it does the work satisfactorily.\nOttawa, December 31, 1907.\n\nRight Rev. Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 14th inst., and in reply to that portion in which you refer to the new boarding school for the Fort William band I beg to say that the Department is not at present prepared to give a decided opinion on this subject, as the whole school question is now receiving the Minister's attention.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Rev. Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. Dr. Soodard, D.D.,\nBishop of Baillie Etc., Huron,\nNorth Bay, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI want to know:\n\n1. Has the Department any objection to giving a per capita or joint grant to Indian Boarding Schools not situated on their Reservations?\n\n2. Will the Department, after it has arrived at an ultimate decision in reference to the Indian School question now under consideration, give the 3rd William Indian Boarding School a same departmental grant that it will give Indian Boarding Schools elsewhere?\n\nBefore answering this request I consider it only reasonable that you give me a definite reply to the above-mentioned questions.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD. F. Scaliard,\nDirector of S.S.M. and\nToronto Bay Dec. 22nd\n\nMr. J. M. Leam 321486\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 21st.\n\nThe information therein given me in reference to the future wants for the Indian Boarding School at Port Williams is most instructive. The E.S.P. may want possession of the present building next summer and we want if possible to have a building ready on the Port Williams side of the river to receive a number of students. How can we go ahead and build a building if there is not going to be any aid from the Department to support it? The money obtained for the sale of the building on the Reserve will not nearly pay for the site and the erection of another suitable building, let alone the cost of materials and wages of mechanics. Surely the Department can give me a more definite reply so as to warrant us in going on to rebuild.\nOttawa, January 11, 1898.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 32nd ult. In further reference to the new boarding school for the Fort William band, and in reply I beg to say that the Department sincerely regrets that it cannot at present give you any more definite information regarding this matter than was contained in its letter of the 32nd ult.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nRight Reverend Sir,\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. D.J., Scollard, D.D.,\nBishop of Sault Ste. Marie,\nNorth Bay, Ont.\nOttawa, July 6th, 1909.\n\nMadam,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 29th ultimo I beg to say that it would hardly be possible for the Department to direct the Agent to pay the annuity money of children in residence at the school into your hands without the consent of the parents. It is usual to pay the treaty money of minor children to the Indian parents, but the Department would have no objection to the Agent making some arrangement with them whereby the annuity money might be paid over to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nSister M. F. Clare,\nSt. Joseph's House,\n388 Franklin St.,\nFort William, Ont.\nThere are 30 Indian children there now, and it seems to me, that many more will come if the religious Sisters be given the ways and means to support and educate them. If the Department should adopt the policy of grading the amount of the per capita grant according to the quality, the appointments and equipment of the Institution, I feel confident that the Fort William Boarding School will pass muster before any critic as an A.I. Institution in every respect, and as such, should be entitled to the largest grant to be paid.\n\nRespectfully requesting that you, honourable friend, may give my petition for aid to this Fort William Boarding School, your favorable consideration, I am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n+ J.J. Brossard,\nBishop of St. Marie\nOttawa, February 16th, 1913.\n\nThe Honourable F. Oliver, M.P.,\nMinister of the Interior,\nOttawa.\n\nHonourable and dear Friend,\n\nReferring to our conversation of the 15th inst., regarding the Fort William Indian Orphanage Boarding School, I desire to add some supplementary information.\n\nThe old Fort William Boarding School, latterly acquired by the Grand Trunk Pacific cost for building and enlarging at various intervals, in round numbers $25,000, of which sum the Department of Indian Affairs voted an aggregate amount of about $5,000. Hence the Church put about $21,000 into the old school at the Mission. The new school recently erected cost about $32,000, the different items of which I have set forth in memo already in your hands.\n\nThe sum of $21,000 odd dollars received from the G.T. Pacific was put into this new building. In addition to this the church has put $12,000 into the new building and in furnishings for same, so there is a mortgage yet of $12,000 on the new orphanage. Hence the Church has invested in the new and old orphanages the total sum of $33,000 or more. There is a debt on the present boarding school of $17,000 at 5% per annum. This means an outlay of $870 each year for interest. The grant at present given by the Department to the school is $1,000 a year. If the interest on debt be deducted from this, we have only $930 per year to support the 50 Indian children who are now in the school. The former memo in your hands sets forth many items of additional cost of maintenance of the present boarding school, which were not had in the case of the former school. In view of the debt and expensive cost of maintenance of the present institution, we justly believe, that the Department ought to pay a portion of the debt, and give a large grant for maintenance. We believe the Department should pay one half the debt or $8,000, and for this we are willing to give any reasonable security which the Department may require. We respectfully request the Department to raise the per capita grant to $100 a year and to give a grant for 45 Indian children.\nST.

Now these have to be bought at a high price.\n\nd) Potatoes and all kinds of vegetables were raised and furnished from the farm. Now these have to be purchased.\n\ne) Besides these there are expenses for water, electric light, taxes to which were not had at the mission residence.\n\nf) Then there was the salaries of teachers who taught the day school, now nothing for that.\nboth on capital and current expense account.\n\nIf we were adopting this general principle I suggested to Bishop Scollard the possibility of paying $100.00 per pupil on a maximum of 75 pupils in the Fort William school. Please consider for consultation.\nOttawa, 17th February, 1910.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nBishop Scollard, North Bay, wants help to pay deficit on Indian Orphanage and Boarding School at Fort William, also increase of grant and increase of numbers. The present grant is $60.00 on 25 pupils.\n\nIn discussing matters with him the idea occurred to me that we might adopt a fixed policy in regard to aid to mission boarding schools. Where the Church provides the building and equipment if both are approved by the Department they to receive a maximum grant on a liberal number of pupils. In cases where the Department provided the building the grant to be proportionately less on such number of pupils as the Department might see fit.\n\nBy this means we might expect ultimately to get properly sanitary school buildings and to get away from the present lack of system whereby we pay both\nat the present juncture where the Church authorities are not likely to erect any additional Boarding Schools on Indian Reserves the suggestion that they receive the maximum grant under such conditions would hardly be operative. As for the present Boarding Schools buildings most of which are situated on Indian Reserves they are in effect the property of the Department by reason of the location. As we know from ascertained facts, none of these Boarding Schools cost less than $100 per capita, and as the maintenance grant is really the most difficult for the Churches to meet as it is a constant drain on their resources, I am inclined to think that the per capita grant should be an even one to all denominations, and that we should undertake to place all the Boarding and Industrial Schools in a sanitary condition. These changes need not necessarily be made immediately, and their cost in any event should not be very large. To provide open air sleeping rooms for the pupils at the Pasgan Reserve, by effective plans suggested by Insp. Markle, cost about $800.00.\n\nTo pay all the Boarding Schools in the country at the rate of $100.00 per capita would mean an additional outlay of $65,316.00.\n\nDeputy Supt. General.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Oliver,\n\nThe objections which arise to giving financial assistance to pay any portion of the cost of building the Indian Orphanage at Fort William are as follows:\n\nThe School is not situated on an Indian Reserve nor on property belonging to the Government. The present building was planned without reference to the Department, and in deciding upon the character of the building and its cost the Government was not consulted. It is a mixed school. While it may be primarily intended to accommodate Indian pupils, it also accommodates the children of white parents.\n\nNothing can be urged against giving an increased per capita grant to a larger number of pupils. $100.00 per pupil is not too high for a school situated at Fort William; and from Reserves along the line of the C. P. R., the additional number of pupils can be easily collected. The Fort William Reserve is well equipped educationally. There are two day schools on the Reserve, one at each settlement; and the average attendance is - Mission Bay, 19 and Mountain Village 38.\n\nI would desire to remark simply for your consideration that\nIn Ottawa, in the meantime the present starving needs of the Fort William school would not be relieved and it is for this reason that I respectfully request you Hon. Sir do give an additional grant this year and later on let it fall in line with other similar schools according to whatever system of aid which the Depart. Dept may adopt.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nD. J. Sealewood\nBishop of S.S. Wane.\nNorth Bay, March 27th, 1910.\n\nHonourable F. Oliver, M.P.,\nMinister of the Interior,\nOttawa 38355\n\nHonourable and dear Sir,\n\nReferring further to the Indian orphanage and Boarding School at Fort William about which I intimated you in Ottawa, I desire to state that the Religious Sisters have elected some lately the result of a begging expedition of theirs on behalf of the School among lumber and Railway Camps.\n\nThe object did not appear very favorably to the men in the Camps, and the collection was very small. The men raised an objection to being asked to contribute to the support of Indians. This means that the Sisters will find it very difficult to meet their obligations.\n\nI trust them that you shall impress upon your Colleagues of the Cabinet the necessity of this deficit and have some additional grant made this year.\n\nIt may take some time to adjust matters so as to systematize your grants to those Indian Schools along the lines which you mentioned at the time of your meeting with...\nOttawa, March 26, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the 22nd instant, addressed to the Hon. Mr. Oliver, with reference to the Fort William Orphanage, and to say that this matter is under consideration here, and it is hoped that the Department will be able to make an announcement regarding it at an early date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRt. Rev. D. J. Scollard,\nBishop of Sault Ste. Marie,\nNorth Bay, Ont.\nOttawa, April 26, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of March 22, I have great pleasure in informing you that Parliament has been pleased to increase the per capita grant for Indian pupils in the Fort William orphanage from $80.00 to $100.00 per annum, and the number of pupils authorized from 25 to 35. It is hoped that this will make the task of meeting the expenses of the school somewhat easier. I regret to say that it was not found possible to make a grant toward the building fund.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRt. Rev. D. J. Scollard,\nBishop of Sault Ste. Marie,\nNorth Bay, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\nchildren at present enrolled who cannot be identified as coming under this class and whose status will require further information before they can be treated as grant earners, and a list of the children referred to is being sent to the Principal for full particulars regarding them.\n\nI have also to inform Your Lordship that our Inspector, who is at present on the Fort William reserve has visited the St. Joseph's Orphanage and, while reporting most favourably on the work done there, has called attention to the need for better class-room accommodation, and upon reference to the plans of the building Your Lordship was good enough to leave with the Department it is noted that no special provision for class-rooms is shown thereon. As it is essential that this omission should be remedied as soon as possible the Department trusts that Your Lordship will see that suitable school-rooms with ample floor and air space for the number of pupils in attendance are provided either in the main building or an annex.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, April 26, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to inform Your Lordship that the estimates for the current year make provision for 35 pupils at the Fort William Orphanage at the rate of $100.00 per capita from the 1st instant.\n\nThis grant will be payable at the expiration of each quarter on receipt of the usual quarterly returns showing the number of pupils present during the quarter, the amount payable for each pupil to be calculated on the scale of payments, a copy of which is enclosed herewith.\n\nUnder the new arrangement increasing the per capita grant from $60.00 to $100.00 per annum the Department will require its regulations regarding the admission and recognition of grant earners to be strictly complied with in all cases. A blank form of application for admission is also enclosed, which explains itself. All such applications should be sent to the local Agent for transmission to and approval of the Department and no child will be recognized as a grant earner whose admission has not been officially sanctioned.\n\nThe Department's contribution towards the maintenance of this school is strictly limited to Indian children whose parents' names appear on the pay list of any band in the Thunder Bay district. There are a number of\n\nRight Rev. P. J. MacLard, D.D.,\nBishop of the Diocese of Sault Ste. Marie,\nNorth Bay, Ont.\nOttawa, October 28, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI beg to refer Your Lordship to official letter of April 26th, last. In this letter the terms on which the per capita grant to the Fort William Orphanage was increased from $60.00 to $100.00 were set forth. Applications recently received from the Principal of the school for the admission of several children would lead the Department to believe that those in charge have not been fully made aware of the conditions attached to this increase. In the first place the regulations of the Department regarding admission and recognition of grant earners were to be strictly complied with and the usual forms of applications made use of in each case. The Department's contribution towards the maintenance of the school was strictly limited to children whose parents' names appear on the pay list of any land in the Thunder Bay District.\n\nI have to ask Your Lordship to be good enough, if you have not already done so, to communicate with the Principal of the school and make clear to her the conditions above referred to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRight Rev. D. J. Boillard, D.D.,\nBishop ofault Ste. Marie,\nNorth Bay, Ont.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nnothing about that place and because she had no relatives there who wished to and see her children and let her know from time to time how they were getting along. So you see here will be always welcome when children even from Fort William Boarding School.\n\nI may state that in my opinion she ought to be a day school at Batchewana Bay. There were twenty children of school age there.\n\nI shall write the principal of the Fort William School if such regulations prevail here, but please hold by the terms of your letter of May 4th and send back for confirming the recruiting statement of the summer camp, etc., and I wish to be in Ottawa for strict alone, and asked to be in Ottawa for a meeting at Boarding School Street soon.\n\nA special Mr. Oliver informed would be held on Nov. 15th.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJ.J. Macdonald\nDiocese of St. Mary's\nSir,\n\nI have your favor of 25th inst.\n\nIn obedience of instructions in reference to admission of children into the Fort William Boarding School, I state that the Department does not intend that all the children which come from within the limits of the Thunder Bay District, in fact, in a letter under date of May 1st, 1910, you informed me, that children drawn outside of the Thunder Bay District could be admitted provided the authorities of the Board were satisfied that such child was not likely to be in need of further care and attention, and in the absence of such care or other persons who live at a distance from the school, the children of Eastern points before it would be considered.\n\nThere are, at the present time, some at Fort William.

April next.\n\nOn the return of this document the signature of the Deputy Superintendent General will be affixed and a copy will then be sent you. Certain alterations and improvements may be necessary to bring the buildings at Fort William up to the required standard. An officer of the Department has been instructed to inspect and report on the improvements required. A reasonable time will be granted by the Department to allow you to have these improvements made, and in the meantime, provided the Agreement is completed, the increased grant will be paid to the school at the rate of $100.00 per capita for 35 pupils from April 1st. next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

D.J. Scollard, D.D.\nBishop of Sault Ste. Marie\nNorth Bay, Ont\n9-11-1\n\nJ.M. Bennett, B.A.\nDepartment of Separate Schools\nToronto Avenue\nToronto\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing to discuss the department's plans to increase the Indian attendance at Fort William Residential School for the following reasons:\n\n1. This school was originally intended to accommodate at least 200 Indian children. Yet, they have never been able to maintain this number due to very small enrollment.\n\n2. There is a large territory for the school to draw from, namely places like Kenora Bay, Long Lake, Moosonee, Sioux Lookout, and the whole north shore of Lake Superior. This is why one school in each district would be more effective than the current setup at Fort William.\n\n3. The present teachers are not fully qualified Indians, lacking proper experience.\n\n4. The building is well adapted for a boarding school. It has a large outdoor area, plenty of playgrounds, fireplaces, balconies, and a admirable location. The outdoor facilities at Fort William make it a very suitable building.\n\n5. Many of the Indian children now at the school are unable to communicate effectively in English. Many need assistance in this area.\n\nKindly do your best in this matter and I will be appreciated.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.M. Bennett\nOTTAWA, June 11th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to draw your attention to the present enrollment at St. Joseph's Orphanage, Fort William.\n\nThe last return received shows an enrollment of 19 pupils, while a per capita grant is provided for 35 pupils. It is understood that this school was built to accommodate 50 Indian children, but the enrollment has never been more than about 25. The Separate School Inspector, Mr. J. M. Bennett, draws the attention of the Department to the small attendance of Indian children, and requests that steps be taken to increase the attendance. There is a large territory for this school to draw from, viz: Horn Bay, Long Lake, River, Pays Plat and along the northern shore of Lake Superior.\n\nThe Inspector states that the building is well adapted for a boarding school; they have a good ventilation system; plenty of fresh air; fireplaces; balconies in a splendid situation on the outskirts of Fort William. I have, therefore, requested that this summer, when making visits to the various Reserves, you will endeavor to secure a number of pupils for this school. Care should be taken to see that they are Catholics or non-Catholics and in good health. In the event that any children be obtained, applications signed by one or other of the parents and a certificate of health signed by the Doctor should be forwarded on the usual form for that purpose.\n\nThe Missionaries could, no doubt, assist you in obtaining a number of new pupils.\n\nThe Department will expect that when this school resumes operations after the summer holidays, that there will be a good enrollment of new pupils, and you should use every endeavor you can with that end in view.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLennan,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. R. Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Arthur, Ont.\nOTTAWA, June 11th, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the attendance at St. Joseph's Orphanage, Fort William.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the Department is taking this matter up with its Agent, Mr. W. R. Brown, Port Arthur, and requesting him, when he visits the Reserves in his Agency during the present summer, to endeavour to secure a number of new pupils for this school.\n\nThere is provision made for a grant for 35 children, while the last return shows an enrollment of only 19.\n\nThe Agent has also been requested to consult the local Catholic Missionaries, under whose charge the various Reserves are situated, with a view to obtaining their assistance in inducing the Indian parents to allow their children to attend this school.\n\nI have to thank you for drawing the attention of the Department to this matter, and it is hoped that as a result of the Agent's endeavours that a decided increase in the enrollment will take place.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLellan,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. M. Bennett, Esq., B.A.,\n47 Bronson Ave.,\nTORONTO, ONT.\nI would suggest that this school be sent its full possible allowance of 35 Indian children. They can easily handle them as there are two classroom teachers and about 9 others for care of them outside the class work. At present there are 31.\n\nThis school is so situated that it should be accessible to more Indians than at present or at least its quota of 35 being kept filled.\nOTTAWA, April 1st, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. J. M. Bennett, Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Fort William Orphanage recommends that this school be recruited up to the full number of pupils for which the grant is allowed, vizt 35. He states that at the time of his visit there were 31 Indian children enrolled, and recommends that the full quota of 35 be regularly in attendance.\n\nI have, therefore, to request that you will endeavour, with the assistance of the school authorities, to recruit a sufficient number of children to keep the average attendance up to the number of grant earning pupils allowed. Care should be taken to see that the children admitted are Native Canadians of school age and in good health. An application signed by one or other of the parents and the certificate of health signed by the doctor should be forwarded for each child obtained.\n\nAs there is a large territory for this school to draw from there should be no difficulty in keeping this school filled to capacity.\n\nYou will be good enough to give this matter your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. R. Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nThis school is under able management. The number of Indians arranged to attend this school is 35. I feel however that since there are only two day schools from Charlevoix to Kenora and Fort Frances, this boarding school could easily be allowed to increase their quota. From Heron Bay, Payette Flat, Missinabie, Jackfish, Long Lake, etc., could be brought many Indian children who are now going to illiterate. I feel that certain schools are the more satisfactory.\nOttawa, April 23rd, 1923.\n\nMadam:\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, who recently visited the Fort William Orphanage, suggests that this Department allow for an increase in the pupilage in order to provide for a number of Indian children from Heron Bay, Pays Plat, Missinabie, Jackfish, Long Lac, etc., who are not now attending any school and are growing up without an education.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will state the number of Indian children for whom you can provide accommodation. At the present time you are aware, I am allowed for 35 children, and if you could take a larger number so would be prepared to favourably consider providing a grant for the full number which your school can accommodate, in order that the children from the Reserves mentioned above can have an opportunity of receiving an education.\n\nI shall be pleased if, at your earliest convenience, you will inform us fully as to what accommodation you can provide, stating the full number of Indian children you would be willing to receive without, in any way, overcrowding the dormitories or classrooms.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister M. J. O'Connell,\nSt. Joseph's Orphanage,\nFort William, Ont.\nOttawa, May 4th, 1923.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, stating the number of children for which accommodation can be provided in the Fort William Orphanage.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is hoped to be able to arrange for a representative of the Department to visit Fort William during the coming summer regarding the question of making provision for the full number of children whom you can accommodate.\n\nIn the meantime, you may accept any orphan or substitute children from the reserves at Heron Bay, Pays Plat, Blackknife, Jackfish, Long Lac and from those Indian families residing along the line of railway. We shall allow a supernumerary grant for any orphan or substitute child taken into the school in excess of the number of vacant places now being provided for. Pro or applications and certifications of health for admission should be forwarded to the office of your local Indian Agent.\n\nAs the funds at our disposal this year have been assigned to the various purposes for which they were provided, it will not be possible to arrange for a rent for 50 pupils, the number which you state you can accommodate, but, if satisfactory arrangements are made, this number of children can be provided for in our estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst.

Please enquire into this case and report. You should state why the boy was allowed to leave the school when he was in a serious condition of health.\n\nUnless in cases of urgent necessity the Principal should not allow Indian children to leave the school without first obtaining the permission of the Department. She should make application through your office to the Department setting forth clearly the reason for requesting the discharge of, or for allowing, pupil back to home. It is considered that there should be very few instances in which it would be necessary for the Principal to allow a pupil to leave the school before obtaining the authority of the Department.\n\nYour early reply regarding the complaint of Catherine Wabas as to the treatment and death of her son will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

G. Burke,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of August 15th, regarding the death of John Wabase, I wish to say that in the earlier part of June he caught \"German Measles\", and in the absence of Doctor Gillie, we called in Doctor Arnaud, who pronounced that the children had a slight attack of \"German Measles\", and that the treatment was, to keep them in bed and warm for four or five days, which was done. As John did not seem to get strong, we again sent him to Doctor Gillie, who gave him a prescription for a tonic, but gave no order to send the boy to the Hospital, and as the Sisters in charge of the boys say that the boy before he went ill, and Doctor who was treating him, said the boy had a very weak chest. When he went out home for the holidays, however, he gained up and returned to school in September feeling very much improved in health, and we naturally thought the same would be the case this year. I did not send the boy home, he only left the School for the holidays as per the usual custom.\n\nAs regards Mrs. Wabase's complaint about the scrubbing of the floor in Class-room, it would be an order from the Teacher, and there would likely be four or five other boys helping him. We also wish to say that Mr. Burke has been very kind and attentive to his duties with the School during the past year.\n\nWe regret that the poor boy died so soon after going home, and I know his mother will miss him, and also get a shock at his sudden death.\n\nTrusting the above explanation will be satisfactory,\nI remain,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nVeronica.\nINDIAN OFFICE\n\nAt PORT ARTHUR, ONTARIO\n\nAugust 20th, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 14th regarding complaint from Mrs. Catherine Wabas of the Pays Platt Band regarding the death of her son, John Wabas, a pupil of the Fort William Orphanage, and in reply wish to say I took the matter up with Sister Veronica, Superior of St. Joseph's Boarding School, and enclose herewith a letter received from her today.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTo The Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, August 26th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, enclosing a letter from Sister Veronica, Principal of St. Joseph's Residential School, with reference to the death of John Wabae.\n\nThe report from the Reverend Principal does not state the condition of the above mentioned boy's health at the time he was allowed to leave the school for holidays.

As the only way of reaching the reserve is by water, there being no overland trail, and the ice not yet being safe, I wired Sergt.

It is noted that there are now ninety-three (93) children on the roll and the March quarter return shows an average attendance of eighty-eight (88). It has been decided to provide grant for eighty-five (85) pupils and, also, allow supernumerary grant for three (3) pupils for the March and June quarters. After the end of June it will still be possible to allow grant for eighty-five (85) pupils at this school. You should inform the Reverend Sister Superior and, if there are any children who could be discharged at the end of June, application should be made to the Department. In the event of any being sent home at that time, it would permit of accommodation being available for any deserving cases, within the number for which grant is provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. D. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nEXTRACT from Inspector Greening's Report on his visit to the FORT WILLIAM INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL on June 17, 1932.\n\nOriginal on File 9-11-6.\n\nThe high state of efficiency previously reported has been maintained at this school.\n\nThere has just been held at Fort William a convention of the Urban School Trustees of Ontario, the convention being also attended by the Chief Director and the Chief Inspector of Public and Separate Schools, of the Provincial Department of Education. The latter spent quite a time at the school, seeing it at work (so that he might see just what was being done) I made sure that the school authorities did NOT know that they were to be visited) and was, I believe, very much impressed with the efficiency shown.\n\nIn addition to the activities mentioned in previous reports, I might mention that Mother St. George has arranged to have an ex-military man give the children instruction in Physical Training. This year he has given all the senior children (from Grade VII up) a thorough course in First Aid. When examined by an outside authority for their First Aid Certificates these children made an average mark of well over 90 per cent.\n\nFort William Residential School offers a much more many-sided instruction than any other Indian School visited by me and well deserves the greatest possible praise and consideration.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the enclosed Quarterly School report received from the St. Joseph's Boarding School, as you will note there are 108 pupils attending the School. This is 23 over the required quota.\n\nOwing to the fact of so much destitution this year the Mother Superior advised that rather than turn the children away they would, if necessary, take them free of charge. I informed the Rev. Mother that I would communicate with our Department to ascertain if a further grant could be made to remunerate the Boarding School.\n\nI may say that there are several cases reported to me by the Missionary, Rev. J. Couture as being unable to provide food for the children. If these children are sent to the Boarding School they are properly clothed, and fed. Unfortunately the blueberry crop upon which the Indians depend to purchase supplies for the fall harvest was total failure, as far as the Indians were concerned. This fact has caused a great deal of destitution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. O. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, October 25th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your 210-84 of the 17th instant, with reference to the September quarter return of the Fort William Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that the number of Indian children at present in residence is 168, while per capita allowance is only authorized for 15. Were these children placed in this school at your request? It is possible to take from the second paragraph of your letter the meaning that the Sister Superior admitted them without consulting you.\n\nThe Department realizes that, owing to present conditions, there is a great demand for institutional care but, before considering per capita allowance for the extra number of pupils, the Department desires to be assured that the parents are not simply imposing on the good nature of the Sister Superior.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. G. Bark, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Arthur, Ont.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 26th ult., file No. 9-11-1, with reference to the number of Indian children enrolled at the St. Joseph's Boarding School, I wish to state that these children were brought to the Boarding School from various points where no schooling is available, during my absence in September. During the summer months the missionary and myself interviewed the parents of these children who were living in destitute and unsanitary conditions, with a view to their sending them to the Boarding School.\n\nOn my return to the office the Sister Superior communicated with me advising that 23 children over the quota allowed had been brought to the School. The Sister requested that I inform the Department of the existing circumstances, stating that they would keep these children free of charge rather than turn them away, but would very much appreciate if some further grant could be allowed.\n\nIn conclusion I may say the Boarding School is doing excellent work, and is very highly recommended by Mr. Greening, the School Inspector. I would recommend that the Boarding School be recompensed for the extra children above the quota.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, November 8, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your 210-9A of the 5th instant, with reference to the number of Indian children enrolled at the Fort William Residential School.\n\nWhen the December quarter return is received from this school and the average attendance for that quarter has been computed, the Department will be in a position to decide the number of pupils for whom per capita allowance can be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. P. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. G. Bark, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Arthur, Ont.\nOttawa, May 4th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the March quarter return of the Fort William Indian Residential School. This shows an average attendance of ninety-five (95) pupils and grant is being paid for this number. In view of previous correspondence in which it was intimated that you felt it necessary to have a large number of children in the school last fall. However, I would point out that, for the fiscal year 1933-34, grant has been provided for eighty-five (85) pupils only at this school and, as our appropriation has been so reduced, it will not be possible to pay for any larger number this year. You should so inform the Reverend Principal and assist her in reducing the number of pupils to the number for which grant is provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ.G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Arthur, Ont.\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDec. 6th, 1934.\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nThe following is contained in a letter addressed to the Minister:\n\n\"I have received a letter from a very prominent citizen at the Head of the Lams in which he says that the allowance to St. Joseph's Orphanage for the care of certain Indian Children has been reduced. This institution is having great difficulty in making things go and while I understand the reduction is only fifteen per cent, it means a great deal to them. I should appreciate it very much if you could favourable consider letting the former grant stand.\"\n\nWill you please furnish the Minister with a report on this matter.\n\nGeorge Buskard\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nP.S.\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nDecember 23, 1934.\n\nMemo:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nI have your memorandum of the 8th instant, regarding the communication addressed to the Honourable the Minister, from a prominent citizen at the Head of the Lakes, requesting that the reduction made in the grant to the St. Joseph's Orphanage, Port William, be restored.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that per capita grants to all Indian residential schools were reduced 10% as from January 1, 1933, and there was a further reduction of 5% from January 1, 1934 - making a total reduction in grants of 15%.\n\nI may say that this institution is privately owned. The Department provides grant for 60 Indian children at the rate of $150 per capita, less 10%. The enrollment of Indian children has fallen off during the current academic year. This will account for a decrease in the amount paid, which is affecting, to some extent, the finances of the institution. Besides the Indian children, the Department understands there are a number of white orphan children in the institution.\n\nRegarding the request that the grant be restored, I have to say that this school should receive the same consideration as other Indian residential schools, which are all subject to the reduction of grant, as mentioned above.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nI have your memorandum of the 8th instant, regarding the communication addressed to the Honourable the Minister, from a prominent citizen at the Head of the Police, requesting that the reduction made in the grant to the St. Joseph's Orphanage, Fort William, be restored.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that per capita rents to all Indian residential schools were reduced 10% as from January 1, 1943, and there was a further reduction of 5% from January 1, 1943 - making a total reduction in grants of 15%.\n\nI understand that this institution is privately owned. The Department provides rent for 150 Indian children at the rate of $150 per capita, less 15%. The enrollment of Indian children has fallen off during the current academic year. This will account for a decrease in the amount paid which is affecting to some extent the finances of the institution. Besides the Indian children, the Department understands there are a number of white orphan children in the institution.\n\nRegarding the request that the grant be restored, I have to say that this school should receive the same consideration as other Indian residential schools, which are all subject to the reduction of rent, as mentioned above.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa: April 24th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the March quarter return of the Fort William Indian Residential School and it is noted that this return is signed by Sister M. Helena as Principal.\n\nThis is the first intimation we have received of any change in Principal at the Fort William School and I should appreciate your advising the Department as soon as possible, whether or not Sister M. Helena has succeeded Sister M. F. Clare as Principal at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. P. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. G.

Helena as Principal.\n\nI may say that Sister M. Helena is now Principal of the Boarding School, as Sister M. F. Clare died about the middle of March.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G.

10th April, 1895\n\nDISASTEROUS FIRE\nFort William Reserve\n\nSt. Joseph's Convent, Orphanage, and Catholic Church Destroyed\n\nSt. Joseph's Convent and Orphanage and Catholic church took fire about half past nine last night morning.\n\nThe fire originated in a bake oven in the back part of the orphanage. All the Indians were at prayers at the time which was very fortunate, as the fire spread so rapidly that the firemen were unable to save anything.\n\nAn alarm was sounded at a quarter to seven from Town Hall, to which our Fire Brigade responded promptly. They were unable to save the Convent, and were driven from the Church by the intense heat. All that is left is the interior of the private house and the outbuildings, which they were able to save, although two firemen were badly burned.\n\nIt is stated that the Indians say \"the Fort William people were quick to come, and managed to save the private house and outbuildings, for which they are much thanked.\"\n\nThe Convent and Orphanage was saved. All the children were gotten safely out of the building, which was saved from the fire by the efforts of Mr. Donnelly who has replaced the school board. The children have been sent to relatives and friends until such time as the Indians may be given a temporary orphanage. The school board has offered their school as a temporary orphanage for the children until such time as the Indians may be given a permanent orphanage.\n\nIf the fire had occurred in the night or in severely cold weather the suffering would have been far greater. There is real cause for thankfulness that the fire occurred at this time when the Indians were up and about and the weather was fine.\n\nThe Convent was built in the district being nearly fifty years old. The main part of the convent was erected about twenty-five years ago. The convent was insured for $6000 and the church for $2000. The orphanage is a building which the Sisters of St. Joseph purchased several years ago. The orphanage was used as a school when opened, but at the time they were closed everything was empty except the school buildings. It is hoped that something will be done to assist the Indians.\nPort Arthur 10th April 1895\n\nSir,\n\nI have to report to your Department that the Fort William Reserve St. Joseph's Convent and Orphanage burnt this morning at 6:30 o'clock A.M. The Roman Catholic Church also, the Sisters were up and dressed, but the children were not, and many of them close and shoes lost. The long school house about one hundred feet away from the orphanage was saved, and is occupied for the present by the Reverend Mother Superior and the Sisters, and the Indians gave them their Council House for school and other purposes, until some other arrangement is made. I expended about three dollars on the Council House by a new lock and some other repair necessary, and bought 47\u00bd lbs of material at a cost of about $10.50 to both the orphan, and about $4.50 to replace shoes, there was also a good deal given and assistance rendered by the Fort William people. This I took upon myself to do for the Department and used very economy and worked hard all day assisting.\n\nI forward also an account of the sale of the Fort William today.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nDeputy Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs\nAttorney\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. Connolly\nI have acknowledged receipt of copy of your letter, dated [date], regarding the Fort Smith Council House. Due to circumstances beyond our control, the Council House is currently occupied by the Department of Indian Affairs personnel.

J. H. Daly, M.P.,\nMinister of the Interior\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI desire to introduce to you Rev. Dr. Casey,\nArchdeacon of the Diocese of Peterborough. He will\ntherefore before you some matters of great importance to the\nIndians of Fort William. On the morning of 18th inst., the\nchurch and orphanage of that place were entirely destroyed\nby fire. Fortunately all the orphans, numbering over\nfifty, were rescued in safety by the Indians in charge.\nThe orphanage was valued at about two thousand\ndollars, but there was an insurance of five thousand\ndollars so that the church was insured for only one\nthousand dollars. You understand that it will be\nnecessary to rebuild both church and orphanage as soon as\npossible, so as to provide for the necessities of the orphan\nand the religious requirements of the Indians. On this\naccount I most earnestly appeal to the Government for\nsufficient aid to enable the Indians to continue the\ngood work they have been performing in educating\nand supporting the orphaned children to help the Indians to\nrebuild the church.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nArchbishop Peterborough\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTo Registrar Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n1.

[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nof the Band pass a Resolution asking that a specific amount be contributed for that purpose, the Governor-in-Council would be free to authorize the same.\n\nHayter Reed\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA 26th April, 1895\n\nHon. T. Mayne Daly,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs\n\nRespecting the letter under from Bishop O'Connor appealing for aid towards the re-building of the Church and Orphanage which were destroyed by fire at Fort William, the undersigned would report that the Deputy Minister of Justice has already expressed the opinion that under Section 70 of the Indian Act, the Governor-in-Council can, without the consent of the Band, make contributions from Indian capital towards the repair, enlargement or reconstruction of a school-house in which a school is to be held attended by Indians. The Fort William Band have at their credit capital amounting to $14,354.77. The undersigned believes that no better use could be made of the moneys at the credit of Indians than expending them in the erection and maintenance of schools, and he would be prepared to recommend that a contribution of $1,000 should be made from the Fort William funds for the erection of a building to replace the Orphanage.\n\nUnder the law we cannot contribute anything from the Indian funds towards the reconstruction of the Church, but, of course, if the Council\nreason) with a recommendation that the extra sum be granted.\n\nAs to the restoration of the Church (and in such a contribution could be made for the purpose) I have through a Resolution of the Band, received the Excellency's Council. . . .\n\nYour Lordship,\n\nT. Macdonald\nSuperintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nHis Lordship,\n\nRev. R.A. O'Connor\nBishop of Peterborough\n\nPeterborough, Ont.\nI am obliged to inform Your Lordship that I have been requested by Mr. Smith, the Superintendent of the Indian Department, to make an inquiry into the state of the Indians in the district of Fort William. He has informed me that there are about 150 Indians living in the district, and that they are in a very poor condition. They are suffering from various diseases, and many of them are unable to work.\n\nMr. Smith has also informed me that the Indians are in great need of assistance, and that they would be grateful for any help that could be given to them. He has asked me to recommend to Your Excellency in Council that a contribution of \u00a31,000 be made from the capital of the Fort William fund to help in reconstructing the Orphanage. However, the Indians desire a larger amount of their money should be expended, and they pass a Resolution to that effect. I should be happy to submit the Resolution to Council (always provided, of course, that the amount to be contributed be within reason).\n**Indian Trust Fund**\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs\n\nTo Joseph Weiden\n\n| Date       | Description                                                                 | Amount |\n|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| April 10th | To goods furnished orphan children beyond our Council House                  |        |\n| \"          | To work + material repairing water closet + repairing log house for orphans, and expenses connected with a drummed Indian Minauash | 34701  |\n| \"          | Do work + material repairing water closet + repairing log house for orphans, and expenses connected with a drummed Indian Minauash | 28491  |\n\n**The Mission Store**\n\nFort William West, Ont., May 1895\n\nJ.

The price is considered too high by the Department and I shall make further explanations. In regard to the item in question, I have been instructed to purchase seed potatoes for the body of the Indian orphanage. It will be necessary for you to furnish me with an estimate of the amount required on this account.\n\nI have noted what was said in the Resolution of Council, which you forwarded as to the loss by the Indians of their seed potatoes, and you may purchase 50 bushels at 50\u00a2 per bushel to replace these. The amount should not in any case be exceeded, and the Indians should be warned to take better care of their seed potatoes in future.\n\nJ.P.

The work at present under contract does not include the completion of the orphanage, but this will depend upon the assistance received from the other Bands with the consent of the Government.

I have since received from Fort William, after giving out the contract for rebuilding, the cost of which will be greater than anticipated. The Indians decided to ask the Government for $500 for the Orphanage, and $500 for the Church. I will prefer this grant from the Government with the Indians consent, to the two thousand Dollars without it. I enclose herewith the resolution of those present at the meeting with their signatures thereto. In the Annual Report of the Indian Department for 1874, I find the sum of $1000 to the Credit of the Office of Lake Superior.

Would it not be wiser to have a larger number of names before we go to Council for a grant to assist in erecting the Church? We have already asked for authority to spend $200.00 for repairs to the Orphanage, but we need only spend $150.00 of this. I do not think it will be a proper course to request any other bands to contribute towards this Orphanage, although they may have pupils in residence there. The account to which the Bishop refers is merely an account capitalized to pay Robinson Treaty Annuities, and could not be touched for any such purpose. The bands on the North shore of Lake Superior contribute to the support of their Day Schools, and as the expenditure from Fort William funds merely transmutes the capital of the Fort William Indians into another form, I do not think the funds of other bands should go to the enrichment of this special band.\nthe satisfaction of Your Lordship. Although the authority of Council has not yet been obtained, I trust that in a few days I will hear of the passage of the grant, and in that case it will at once become available.\n\nI am,\n\nYour Lordship's obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Supt. General,\nof Indian Affairs.\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge Your Lordship's letter of the 16th inst., with reference to a proposed grant for the Fort William Orphanage and Church. It would indeed have given me great pleasure to have met Your Lordship's wishes in this matter, but I had already sent a memorandum to Council requesting that $25,000 be set aside for the Orphanage from the capital funds of the Fort William Band, and I could hardly recall this and constitute another. Although it is my desire to meet Your Lordship's wishes wherever it is possible to do so, I find it impossible to levy any contribution toward the Fort William Orphanage upon the Nepigon and Pic River bands. These Indians have no funds of their own and could therefore not afford to make this contribution. It is questionable whether, in any event, they should be asked to contribute money to a building which forms an asset of another band, even if they received certain educational advantages from such an institution.\n\nI trust that the repairs to the Orphanage may proceed to the satisfaction of Your Lordship.\n\nThe Rt. Rev. H.A. O'Connor,\nBishop of Peterborough,\nPeterborough, Ont.\nExtract from a Report of the Committee of the Honourable the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency on the 10th June, 1895.\n\nOn a report, dated 21st May, 1895, from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, stating that on the 10th April, 1895, the Indian Orphanage school at Fort William was destroyed by fire.

There are 28 children on the roll at this school, which receives a grant of $500 per annum from the Government. The buildings are new and convenient and cost nearly $7000.00, one thousand of which was contributed by the Fort William Band. These Indians get the benefit of this school and pay very little for it, and if their funds would stand a contribution I think they might be asked to assist in paying for this outlay.\n\nSome time ago the Sisters asked for an increased grant, which was not allowed, and it must be drawing pretty heavily on the resources of their Church of their finances to keep up such an institution upon a grant of only $500.00.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Borden\nMemorandum:\n\nFor the Secretary,\n\nThe only suggestion that I can make in regard to assisting the management of the Ft. William Orphanage in meeting the expense of the hen-house and fence, is to pay half the amount from the \"Miscellaneous\" item in the appropriation for schools in Ontario and Quebec.\n\nThis vote will bear the charge; the interest account of the Ft. William Band will not; and I do not take it to be a fair charge against that account, solely as pupils attend the Institution who belong to other Bands in Agent Hodder's district.\n\nI should certainly like to see some assistance given as the school is excellently managed; and its current cost to the Department is very small compared to the value of the work it performs.\n\nOttawa, June 28th\u20141900.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\u2014\nOTTAWA, 26th June, 1900,\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant enclosing a communication from the Sisters of St Joseph asking the Department to assist them in paying a debt of $130 incurred in making improvements at the Fort William Orphanage.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will consent to pay one-half of the expenditure, namely $65.00 upon receipt of duly certified vouchers covering the expenditure of that amount, either for material or labor.\n\nI am kind enough to have this matter attended to as soon as possible as the amount in question will have to be charged against the current year's appropriation, which lapses shortly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

This would make the school in a condition to answer for a great number of years, if the Band funds are not in a condition to allow this, the repairs are absolutely necessary.\n\nMr. Hamer is a reliable contractor and should the Department decide to have the work done at once it would be well to write to him direct as I will not return from my payment trip till the middle of August.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA, 14th July, 1903\n\nMemo. for Accountant:-\n\nYou will remember that the Ft. William were willing to take about one third of their capital to put up a schoolhouse and the Department would not allow them to do so. The present building is in a very bad state of repair, as reported by the Bishop, Inspector, Agent and teacher but it can be repaired and enlarged. The repairs alone would cost $250.00, and an extension would cost $415.00 additional,- or both extension and repairs could be carried out for $750.00. Could the band funds stand this outlay? More room is needed.\n\nMartin Wilson\n\nDeputy Secretary.\n\nThe Port William Band has at C of Capital at $8946.69 from which the Cost of the above mentioned work could be defrayed, under authority of Order in Council, I think however, that there should be some more definite specification of the work to be done before any Contract is let.\n\nK. A. Agent\nOttawa, 15th July, 1903.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nIn the Accountant's memo., under, it is stated that the capital of the Fort William Band could be taken for the purpose of the proposed repairs and extension to the old school-building under the authority of an Order in Council. But as the extension will be in the nature of a permanent improvement, the capital could not be used except with the consent of the band and the sanction of His Excellency in Council. I think that the opinion given by the Law Clerk or Department of Justice did not go any further than to say that we could make a contribution towards schools by the sanction of His Excellency in Council without the band's consent.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, 27th July, 1905.\n\nSir:-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 4th inst., regarding the proposed repairs and extension to the old school building, I am to request that you will be good enough to furnish the Department with a detailed estimate and a more definite specification of the work to be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

The possibility of our receiving an immediate delivery of the goods is uncertain, but we must have a windmill for the purpose of raising water for our crops and all at least $500. We shall be glad if we will receive some help from the Government. Even two or three hundred dollars would be quite a relief to us if it could be given us.\n\nLooking forward to hear from you very soon,\n\nYours sincerely,\nPoveshagen Sacred Heart.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 4th August, 1903\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nThe Principal of Ft. William Orphanage asks if there is any possibility of their receiving immediate help as they are badly in need of funds. He says that besides the improvements undertaken (which cost $3,500.00), they must have a windmill, which with the necessary piping will entail an additional outlay of $300.00; Mr Scott tells me that $1000.00 is voted in the current year's estimates for this school.

In order to use the blackboards, I am obliged to wet the erasers in a pail of water to clean the boards for use and then the pupils can scarcely make out the writing. Some of the men last year plastered the boards and they are so rough that it is almost impossible to write on them, and a great deal of strength is required to rub off the work to put on new work for the class.\n\nDear Sir, kindly do something to change the blackboards.

It may be that the $1000 in question was one of the payments anticipated by you when you made up this estimate, but as the particular items making up this amount of $3800 were not submitted to Parliament, Parliament cannot be said to have specifically voted this grant. So far as the authorisation of Parliament went the expenditure of the amount thus voted was not limited in any way other than it was to be expended on Indian Schools.

Great care has to be taken to provide any sort of pure atmosphere. It also leaves very small space for the hanging of any maps. I was told that no provision whatever had been made for the class room and that this was a sort of make shift. I trust this defect will soon be remedied.\n\nJ.O. Ramedem.\n\nI.I.A.& R.\nOttawa, April 1st, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you that the Department has been advised that there is no proper class-room accommodation at the new boarding school built at Fort William, and on referring to the plans which you were kind enough to leave with the Department it is noted that no provision for a class-room is shown. As it is very necessary that ample class-room space should be provided I have to request that Your Lordship will be good enough to see that arrangements are made for overcoming the difficulty.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. D. J. Scollard, D.D.,\nBishop of Sault Ste. Marie,\nNorth Bay, Ont.\n6/3/1905\n\nOn the basis being as it now stands, I respectfully request the Department not to press us for this extra accommodation for a while, in view of other needs of the school via A.T.\n\nYours ever sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop S.S. Marie\n\nP.S. I wrote in your letter, that only the Indians in the Thunder Bay District can send pupils to this Boarding School. Now there are Indians in the District of Algoma for whom the Fort William School would be more convenient than that at Wiikemikong.\n\nFor instance, there are the Indians at the shipyards at White River, around Chapleau and at Picotaaging for whom the Fort N.W. School would be more convenient. Besides there might be Indians in other places who for some reason would not send their children to Wiikemikong and I think they should be given the option of sending them to Fort William though they might be outside of Thunder Bay District.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your favor of 26th ult., in which you advise me of the decision of the Indian Dept. to raise the per capita grant to two and ten cents, for 35 pupils in the Boarding School at Fort William. I desire to thank the Department for this concession. It is to be hoped you state in reference to some class room accommodation. It is true that classrooms are not marked on the plan submitted to the Department.\n\nThe Class rooms are there called \"study rooms.\" In the building so erected there is no distinction between the boys' study room and the waiting room. These two rooms are thrown into one class room, and though the room so made is somewhat long for its width yet it is well-lighted and has a ceiling of 18 feet high. However it is our intention to give as soon as our resources will permit, with better and larger class room accommodation. In view of the state of affairs it\nmore convenient to reach. For instance, the Indians at Michifiction, White River, Shepian and Picotasing and the Matagama could move easily by means of transportation facilities send their children to Cork William.\n\nYours very Truly,\n\nD. O. Denham\nBishop D. O. D.\nNorth Bay, May 2nd 1910\n\nMr. Frank Dudley,\nDeputy-Left General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nMy dear Mr. Dudley,\n\nI have your favor of 31st last in which you advise me of an increased bounty per annum in the Ten Capita grant to the Fort William Indian Boarding School. While I regret that the Department could not assist in the payment of the deficit the School yet I am very grateful for what has been done. Such a communication about the Ten Capita grant received recently from Mr. McLean it would appear that pupils from the Thunder Bay district only would be admitted to the Fort William School, & thus that this will not be insisted upon, as pupils within the Thunder Bay district might prefer to go to Sherriff's House, and pupils outside of the Thunder Bay district might prefer to go to Fort William. Moreover there are Indians in the District of Algoma for whom the Fort William School would be most\nOttawa, May 8, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 2nd instant, and in reply to that portion in reference to the insufficiency of classroom space in the new Fort William Boarding School I beg to say that the Department will not at present press Your Lordship for extra accommodation, but trusts that you will shortly be able to overcome the difficulty referred to in official letter of the 26th ultimo.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev.

OF INDIAN AFFAIRS.\nMAR 30 1911\nARCHITECT.\nFile 265250-5\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, April 28, 1911.\n\nMemorandum\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\n\nEnclosed herewith please find report on the St. Joseph's Orphanage, Fort William, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nArchitect.\nRecommendation-\n\nI would recommend that, providing the window... in boys' latrine is put in, ventilation for dormitories installed, fire escapes from boys' dormitory (if not already in), the building rank as in the first class. I would also recommend that the school authorities there be asked to provide, as soon as conveniently possible, a more suitable class-room as being in the best interests of the school.\n\nArchitect.\nvided for the boys from attic dormitory, as I overlooked this at the time of my inspection. I am of the opinion, however, that none has been provided.\n\nGeneral-\n\nThe building, as designed, is on the whole excellent, is thoroughly equipped and maintained in a good and satisfactory manner. The school authorities appear thoroughly efficient and earnestly enthusiastic in their work; and are entitled to every commendation; excepting for a few minor details in the arrangement of the building, particularly the lack of sufficient window space in boys' latrine, ventilation in dormitories and contracted class-room space. With regard to the lighting of latrine, I understood the Mother Superior to say that it was their purpose to provide additional light as soon as weather would admit of doing the work also that ventilation would be provided as soon as sketch of Department's requirements was sent to them.\n\nThe principal class-room, while having a floor space to accommodate 56 pupils has air space for 24 only, this might be sufficient for their present needs as this school, like others of its class, giving manual as well as scholastic training, a portion of the pupils taking the classes while the others are engaged in the practical work. Notwithstanding this, I am of the opinion that a well proportioned class-room separate from the building, properly lighted and ventilated is in the interest of the school and, I believe, that on the request of the Department, as soon as financial conditions are favourable, better class-room facilities will be provided.\nDrains and drains-\n\nThe drains, plumbing and plumbing fixtures throughout the building were sanitary and in good condition at the time of my inspection.\n\nWater supply-\n\nThe water supply is from city connection, is portable and ample for domestic use and fire protection.\n\nLaundry-\n\nThe laundry has six stationary earthenware tubs, bakery has portable Gurney oven, capacity 100 loaves, cellar for vegetables, etc., and were all in good condition, ample and well provided.\n\nHeating-\n\nThe building is heated by hot water, one of the Gurney R.I. heating boiler No. 1250, having a capacity of 6500 sq. ft. being used with Oxford Radiators throughout. The building was warm and comfortable at the time of my inspection.\n\nVentilation-\n\nNo special system of ventilation has been provided. It is the intention of the school authorities, however, to establish a system thoroughly ventilating the dormitories as soon as sketch of system required is provided.\n\nLockers and wardrobes-\n\nThere are fitted up in each of the dormitories individual lockers for pupils' clothing in excess of actual requirement and also wardrobe closet adjoining each of the bedrooms and community rooms.\n\nFire escapes-\n\nFire escapes have been erected from the girls' dormitory, access thereto being given from balcony on each flat at left end (or dormitory end) of building.\n\nI am not able to say, however, whether any has been provided.\nfurnished for the girls on first and second flats, each 20' by 35' by 11' = a minimum air space for 33 girls, and boys in attic contains 18144 cubic feet = minimum accommodation for 36 pupils.\n\nLavatories, etc.\u2014\n\nThe washing and bathing facilities are ample, there being in boys' dormitory, 1 W.C., 1 bath and 18 basins, adjoining boys' recreation room 2 W.C.'s and urinal and for girls' use, 7 W.C.'s, 14 basins, 2 baths. In addition to these fixtures are two private lavatories with basin, bath and W.C. (used for children when required).\n\nRecreation rooms\u2014\n\nThe recreation rooms are well lighted having three windows each (see under basement for dimensions, etc.), and are ample for their use, the girls also have a workroom 16' by 22' well lighted by three large windows in addition to basement room. There are also for outside recreation two skating rinks maintained on the grounds during the winter, one in each of the play grounds.\n\nBedrooms\u2014\n\nThe bedrooms, community rooms, etc., are all well and conveniently situated and are large light and airy.\n\nHospital and sick rooms\u2014\n\nNo infirmary accommodation has been provided other than the private bedrooms as no sick children are kept in the school, being provided for in the hospital at Fort Arthur which is maintained by the same Order as is the management of the school. This, in my opinion, is more advantageous for both school and pupils than maintaining an infirmary in the school, and fully meets the intention of the Department's regulations.\nA combined class-room 16'2\" by 35'0\" by 11' and study and class-room 15' by 15' for girls.\n\nThe first floor contains\u2014girls' dormitory 20' by 38', lavatory 6\u00bd' by 15', fitted up with 3 W.O.'s, 7 basins, 1 bath, private lavatory containing, bath, basin and W.C., two bedrooms, community room, chapel, sacristy and large clothes closet.\n\nThe second floor is divided similar to first, excepting that, chapel and community rooms are replaced by five bedrooms and girls' workroom, the dormitory (also girls'), the lavatory adjoining and private lavatory, being of same size and fittings as described for first floor. The attic is fitted up as boys dormitory the first floor dimensions being 30' by 63' with partly diminished ceiling owing to wall in part being finished on under side of rafter. This flat is fairly well lighted and contains minimum area sufficient for 36 pupils.\n\nBasement\u2014\n\nThe basement contains, recreation room for boys and girls, each 21' by 21', adjoining the girls is a lavatory 14' by 21' fitted with 3 W.O.'s, adjoining boys, a latrine 5' by 21' fitted with 3 W.C.s and trough type urinal. The balance of basement is utilized as janitor's room, store room, coal room, heating plant, laundry and vegetable stores.\n\nClass-room\u2014\n\nThe class-room (principal) 16'2\" by 35'0\" by 11' has a floor area of 586 and a cubical area of 6226 = minimum area for 24 pupils, the smaller one has an area of 2475 and accommodates 10. The smaller one apparently being seldom used, except as recitation room and study for girls.\n\nDormitory\u2014\n\nThe dormitory accommodation here is excellent, two being furnished\nI beg to inform you that as instructed by your official letter, dated Dec. 5, last, I made an inspection of the St. Joseph's Orphanage, Fort William, Ont., on 27th and 28th February last, and report as follows:\n\nBuilding-\n\nThe boarding school known as St. Joseph's Orphanage is a solid brick structure, 76' by 40', three stories in height on stone and cement foundation, finished as basement and having attic full size of building.\n\nThere is also a rear wing built similar to main building, one story in height with full sized basement.\n\nSite-\n\nThe building is a comparatively new one in good condition, is erected within the city in a fine central situation, on large lot, affording ample grounds for recreation purposes, school garden, etc.\n\nDesign-\n\nThe design is modern school type and is suitable for purposed work, the ground floor having corridor from end to end of building with a main entrance in central front intersecting corridor the rooms being arranged on either side, the back portion being utilized as dining room for boys and girls with dining room for sisters and kitchen pantry, etc., in extension. The front portion contains waiting room or office.\nSt. Joseph's Orphanage,\nFort William, Ontario.\n\nVentilating flue\u2014\n\nThe ventilation flue to be formed of 24 gauge galvanized iron, re-inforced with angle irons at corners and braced wherever necessary to retain size and shape. The ventilation shaft from boys' dormitory to be kept entirely free from ducts or other dormitories until reaching within a few feet of the apex of roof, when pipes will be connected and carried up as a round pipe through roof and connected with ventilating top of practical design and sufficient capacity to admit a thorough exhausting of air in dormitories, at least, three times during each hour.\n\nVentilation Register\u2014\n\n18\" x 36\".\n\nThe ventilation register to be of Tuttle and Bailey Louvre pattern, japanned or nickel-plated as desired, neatly fitted and strongly secured to framework of ventilation ducts at floor line of each dormitory.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, May 11, 1911.\n\nMemorandum\n\nChief Accountant,\n\nEnclosed herewith please find ventilation plan and specification of the St. Joseph's Orphanage, Fort William, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nArchitect.\nSchools\n\nWhen Mr. Ogilvie has the plan of the ventilation system prepared kindly write to Mr. William Douglas on the reverse of this memo of 25th ultimo.\n\n[Signature]\n\nL.C.S.\nOttawa, May 19, 1911.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the report of its architect upon the Fort William Orphanage building, in which he states that, with three exceptions, the accommodation is up to the requirements. These three are a lack of sufficient window space in the boys' latrine, lack of ventilation in the dormitories and of sufficient class-room space. It is understood that arrangements are to be made to have the additional light referred to provided at an early date.\n\nAs to the ventilation of the dormitories I am enclosing Your Lordship a plan and specification of a ventilating system and I trust that Your Lordship will see that this system is installed as soon as possible.\n\nTo provide adequate class-room space it is thought that a suitably proportioned class-room separate from the main building properly lighted and ventilated should be provided and it is hoped that Your Lordship will be able also to have this accommodation provided before long. In the meantime the school is entitled to draw the grant of $100.00 under the new agreement.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRight Rev. D. J. Scollard, A.M., Deputy and Secretary,\nBishop of Elliot Lake, Marie,\nNorth Bay, Ont.\nOttawa, November 20, 1911.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nOn Nov 19th, last, Your Lordship was communicated with and advised as to the improvements necessary at the Fort William Orphanage to enable it to draw the maximum grant of $100.00 per capita under the new agreement for the maintenance and management of boarding schools. I have to ask Your Lordship to be good enough to advise the Department what repairs, if any, have been made during the past summer.\n\nOne serious defect in the accommodation was the lack of class-room space and the suggestion was made that a separate class-room properly lighted and ventilated should be provided. In addition to the report by the officer of the Department the report of the Separate School Inspector, Mr. O'Brien, has just come to hand. He states that the room is altogether too small to be used for a class-room for so many children, that it is not properly ventilated and that the air becomes vitiated soon after the opening of the school. He furthermore states that this condition of affairs is a menace to the health of the children. If the school is to continue to draw the grant it would appear necessary for the Department to insist upon the erection of a proper class-room building without any further delay and I should be pleased to hear at an early date what steps are being taken to carry out this proposal.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRight Rev. D. J. Scollard, D.D.,\nBishop of Sault Ste. Marie,\nNorth Bay, Ont., Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, December 22, 1911.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to official letter of November 20th, last, in reference to class-room accommodation at the Fort William Orphanage and to ask Your Lordship what action, if any, has been taken in the matter.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. P. J. Scollard, D.D.,\nBishop of Hull &c., Marie,\nNorth Bay, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIt is the intention to provide more classroom accommodation at York Mills Boarding School for Indians.\n\nWith two accommodations will be made by constructing a separate building or by raising the rear wing of present main building high enough to accommodate more than has yet been allocated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nDear Mr. Lean,\n\nIt is my intention to provide more classroom accommodation at Fort William Boarding School for Indians. Whether this accommodation will be made by constructing a separate building or by raising the rear wing of Bishop Strachan's high school, which has not yet been started.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, January 16, 1912.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's communication of the 12th instant in reference to needed improvements at the Fort William Orphanage;\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department would like to have Your Lordship's assurance that this work will be undertaken as soon as weather conditions will permit.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev.

Original on File 153815-6.\n\nBuildings and Premises.\n\nThe children are taught in a room in the large boarding school. The room is very well appointed in every way, but it is altogether too small for the attendance and it is but poorly ventilated.\n\nSgd. Michael O'Brien,\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, July 4, 1912.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nMr. Separate School Inspector O'Brien has again drawn the attention of the Department to the fact that the class-room space at the Fort William Orphanage is inadequate and that the room is very badly ventilated.\n\nYour Lordship will recollect that the Department has had previous correspondence with you in regard to this matter and in the last communication received, dated January 12th, last, Your Lordship stated that it was the intention to provide more class-room accommodation, but the decision had not been reached as to means that would be adopted. As the continuance of the grant to this school is dependent upon the terms of the contract being carried out, I shall be pleased to know from Your Lordship when it is proposed to go ahead with this work.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\n\nRight Rev. D. J. Scollard, D.D.,\nBishop of Sault Ste. Marie,\nNorth Bay, Ont.\nLater on, at the time when the Indian children cannot come to school, she gets as salary only $300 per annum. She comes all the way from Montreal. Bearing in mind the cost of living in this part of Ontario, and especially at Nepigon where there is no competitive transportation, this teacher can save little or nothing on $300. She should have 30 to 40 Indian children in the school, and if the accommodation were better and the teacher paid better more pupils would be found at school.\n\nI would impress on the Department the necessity of getting school buildings here, new desks and better equipment, also better quarters for the teacher, and a salary of at least $400 per annum for the teacher. We will get our school buildings in first class order but the Department while urging us to hang up with improvements should hurry itself up to make improvements on the school buildings which it owns. \"Medicus cura te ipsum.\"\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Date]\nI think taking everything into consideration this Fort William Building must be one of the best in the Country, and I venture to remark, that when our contemplated improvements are completed it will be second to none in the Country.\n\nI am making a tour this year of all the Indian villages on the north shore of Lake Superior, and I must aver that the school buildings in many of these places are very poor, and the equipment of such schools wretched. The school at Jackfish Island on Lake Nipigon well - it is the limit. The school at Helen Leake near this village of Nipigon is in a miserable state, nothing cheerful or inviting about it. The building is old, the foundation is giving away under it. The class-room is hard to keep warm. The teachers quarters are very poor, and the teachers and pupils desks are horrid. I found the teacher named Miss Harrison in charge. She takes her holidays\nMr. J.D. M. Leam\nActing Deputy Secretary of the Dept. of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your favor of this date which was forwarded to me here. In regard to the Fort William Orphanage, I may state, that the enlargement and improvement which it has been decided to make on this building will be on a much larger scale than suggested by your Department. These will cost from $12,000 to $15,000.\n\nThe architect could not get plans and specifications and details prepared in time to start operations early last spring so we decided to put off the proposed improvements and commence early next spring in order to have the new part of the building ready for occupation before the cold weather comes.\n\nIt was in the orphanage a week or so ago and found everything in splendid order and the equipment first class.\nOttawa, July 30, 1912.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's communication of the 15th instant in reference to the additions to the Fort William Orphanage.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the fact that it is Your Lordship's intention to make extensive additions, which cannot be done this summer, the grant will be continued pending the completion of the work.\n\nYour Lordship's remarks with regard to the Lake Helen School are noted and this matter will be taken up with the Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. D.J. Scollard, D.D.,\nBishop of Sainte Marie,\nNorth Bay, Ont.\nNorth Bay, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI remember observing at this time last year, when I visited here, the iron pipe inside the Fort William School some years ago in France. Such a fire escape in writing, I think, would show the Fort William building inspectors.\n\nIf you would kindly refer this communication to Mr. Scott, or to your inspectors who must certainly have seen this pipe escape, and advise me or both of them to which one of the abominations of the fire escape already in use in the present Fort William School, I shall be very grateful indeed.\n\nThe advantages of the substitution can reach to rounds from the dormitories by climbing down the iron pipe escape, in less than half the time it would take to come down an iron stairs. Stairs get covered with ice and snow in the winter, and are dangerous while the iron pipe is always in order, and no accident can occur in its use.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of O.O.M.\nNorth Bay, Ont., Sept. 22nd, 1913\n\nMr. F. Redden,\nSuperintendent-General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nA large addition to the Fort William Boarding School for Indians and their children is in course of construction. A fire escape consisting of an iron pipe was placed on the side of the new building. From the second floor of the new building, the escape could be used by those who needed it. The escape was constructed so that it would not interfere with the operation of the school.\n\nThe teachers and religious sisters in charge of the school were very pleased with the new addition. They found it very useful for the safety of the students. The school is equipped with the same kind of fire escape, and the teachers are pleased with them.\n\nAnother one of the same kind of fire escape was recently installed at the new addition, but the building inspectors of Fort William will not agree to anything but iron stairs for fire escapes on this Fort William building.\nOttawa, September 30, 1913.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's communication of the 22nd ultimo in reference to the fire escapes to be provided on the addition being made to the Fort William Indian Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I have to inform Your Lordship that the kind of fire escape at present installed at the institute, consisting of an iron pipe and platform, meets with the approval of the Department. They are in use on several of our buildings and have given satisfaction.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

APRIL 8, 1924.\n\nSome 20 years ago a teacher's desk was provided by the Department for this school. The vicissitudes of time have brought such damage to it that its joints came apart so I leaned against it; the result was embarrassing. Its drawers have become broken and useless for holding school material.\n\nWould the Department supply a new one? Or have you one to spare in the Department's offices, for anything would be better than the present one and more useful.\n\nJ. M. Bennett, Insp.\nOttawa, April 19th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. J. M. Bennett, the Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Fort William Indian Residential School, recommends that a teacher's desk and chair be supplied, and requests that the Department purchase the same. The Department will approve of the purchase of the teacher's desk and chair, and you should obtain competitive prices from a number of firms and place the order with the one quoting the lowest price. The type of desk and chair as supplied Indian Residential Schools is as follows:\n\nTeacher's Sanitary Desk, Elm, approximately 26x42 inches, with 3 drawers down 1 side and large drawer over knee slide;\n\nTeacher's Arm Chair, Non-tilting, plain, substantial, to match desk.\n\nYou should ask quotations for supplying a desk and chair of the above type.\n\nWhen the purchase has been made, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure, to which should be attached a memorandum showing the names of the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Could this cost at least be\nallowed.\nOttawa, December 16, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nIn an official letter of April 19th last, you were authorized to purchase a teacher's desk and chair for the Fort William Residential School and under separate cover of your letter of May 14th last, you forwarded an account for $30.00 for the above. This account was paid.\n\nThe School Inspector who visited this school on the 13th instant, states that the new desk and chair are not in the school.

Consequently upon receipt of your letter of May 14th last I sent the desk and chair to the Mission Bay Day School, by error.\n\nUpon noticing my mistake I called up the former Agent Mr. Brown and he informed me that the Department did not supply furniture to the Fort William Boarding School.\n\nI intended writing the Department at once regarding my error, but unfortunately overlooked the matter, I regret very much this mistake on my part and would like to know if I should have the desk and chair removed to the Fort William Boarding School at my own expense.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You may arrange to purchase a desk and chair of a similar type from the firm which supplied the equipment which you delivered to the Mission Bay School. It is hoped that you can obtain a desk and chair at approximately the same price, or cheaper if possible, and have it delivered to the residential school.\n\nWhen forwarding the account in duplicate, which should be certified by you, you should state that the desk and chair are for the use of the Mission Bay Indian Day School. We desire to charge the expenditure to that school, in view of the fact that the expense for the previous desk and chair was charged against the residential school.

This machine was taken out on account of its size, and had not been used any more than two or three months.\n\nThis is a 20\" Extractor, similar to the one enclosed and marked. As regards driving this Extractor, we have taken this matter up with our Engineering Department and the motor which you now have on your Washer is not sufficiently large enough to drive the Extractor as well as the Washer. Therefore, it would necessitate your getting a new motor and you could get one large enough about a 3 H.P., which would drive both the Extractor and Washer by having a belt from the motor up to the ceiling to the line shaft, then down to the Washer and Extractor.\n\nThe Extractor and motor would cost you $450.00 F.O.B. Winnipeg, and there also would be some Belting, Hangers, and shafting which you would have to purchase in Fort William for this job. However, it would give you a very nice lay-out in your laundry, and one which would be permanent for some time.\n\nIf you wish, we could send our Mr. Garrett down to look after this installation for you, providing you will pay his Railway fare and expenses while he is in Fort William.\n\nMight state that we are putting these Extractors in most of the Indian Schools and other Institutions, and besides being fool-proof, they look after the wringing in such a better manner than the old type Rubber Wringer.\nSt. Joseph's Industrial Boarding School,\nFort William, Sep. 23/28.\n\nMrs. Russell Ferrier,\nSuperintendent Education, Indian Dept.,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sister,\n\nI am enclosing herewith the correspondence of last Feb., with regard to the \"extractor.\" This machine has now been installed and is giving satisfaction.\n\nAgain thanking you for enabling us to procure this machine.\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely & gratefuly yours,\n\nSister M.

As they had to be isolated she said she would do so providing the Department would pay for special nurses as she didn't have any nurses she could spare to look after these cases. I took it upon myself after consulting with you to put on a day and night nurse. I think this was good judgment as these two youngsters are making rapid progress towards recovery and will be able to leave the Institution in a few days.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) J. C. Gillie.\n\nG/M3\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nJune 28th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter received from Dr. J. C.

This cover must not be folded under.\n\n2. Files should be retained no longer than is absolutely essential. If a file is frequently needed at short intervals, it is better to B.F. it for two or three days than keep it out of Records indefinitely. This ensures its being completed and kept in order and also gives other offices an opportunity of using it.\n\n3. Records must be notified whenever a file is passed direct to another Division.\n\n4. All outgoing letters should bear the official file number and originator's designation.\n\n5. **ONE SUBJECT \u2014 ONE COMMUNICATION**\u2014Where the contents of outgoing letters necessarily refer to more than one subject, the originator will prepare additional copies for attachment to relevant files.\n\n6. Correspondence must not be removed from file, except as provided in the regulations governing the conduct of correspondence.\n\n7. Incorrectly filed material will not be removed without notification to Records.\n\n8. Official office designations are to be used for routing purposes.\n\n9. Disposal entries on file jackets must be initialled and dated.\n\n10. False Docket Slips will not be attached to files without notification to Records.\n\n11.

Smith's letter dated April 12, 1940.\n\nWith reference to a grant of $100.00 for their manual training department I wish to report that the pupils at this school have been doing exceptionally fine work in this department. If an additional grant can be secured, for $100.00 for this purpose, it will enable the school to purchase lumber and tools and thus increase the training possibilities in this department.\n\nExtract from Departmental letter dated April 16, 1940, to Indian Agent Burk.\n\nIt is hoped to be able to give this school some assistance in connection with their manual training work but no expenditure in this regard can be made until after the House meets. You might write to me again about the end of May and at that time you should give complete information regarding the equipment that the Principal of the Fort William School would like the Department to supply.\nOctober 17th, 1940.\n\nMr. J.G.

The one we have is 56 inches and we think the wider Mangle\u201466 inches\u2014would save time in the laundry, particularly in putting through sheets.\n\nTo give you an idea of the cost, we have priced the Connor, 56 inch\u2014Electric Mangle and we were quoted \u00a3350.

I have been requested by the Mother Superior, of the above mentioned school to ascertain if the Department would consider assisting the school with the purchase of a new mangle.

H. Connon and Son, Ltd., for supplying a simplex ironing machine to the Fort William residential school, I am attaching same herewith. Adjustment has now been made in the matter of a 60 cycle motor and I would be pleased if the accounts would be passed for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nOctober 15, 1945.\n\nEX'D\n\nMr. J.C. Burk, Indian Agent, Port Arthur, Ont.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation we have an amount of $300.00 for purchase of new equipment that might be absolutely essential at the Fort William Residential School. It would be appreciated if you would interview the Principal and let me know exactly what is required.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nI would refer you to your letter of Oct. 17th, file number 4645-5, regarding the purchase of equipment for the school.\n\nWould you kindly let me know definitely if the order so usual so forwarded you for the school has been through.\n\nThe Indians at the school have informed me they desire to purchase approximately $120 worth of lumber for the manual training school and they would like to purchase a supply of dishes for the school.\n\nI would appreciate if you could advise me as soon as possible, regarding the above.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 24, 1946.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMr. J.G. Burk, Indian Agent, Port Arthur, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant, the Department did not authorize any expenditure at the Fort William Residential School in official letter of October 13, 1945. We simply asked you to let us know if there was anything needed. In fact, we received a request for books and other classroom material. Many of the items mentioned in that requisition are not usually supplied and, therefore, have not been ordered. However, we did order several of the books and, from information received through the Government Stationery Office, it is evident that some, if not all, of them have reached the school.\n\nIt is not our practice to supply dishes to residential schools that have been in operation for some years and under these circumstances I regret that favourable consideration cannot be given to the request contained in your letter of the 18th instant. However, you may purchase lumber at an approximate cost of $48.00 for the use of the manual training class.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nM.

For instance the exterior woodwork has not been painted for twenty-three years.\n\nI am enclosing an estimate from Mr. John Heilman who, in the past, has done very satisfactory work for us. Mr. Heilman has painting contracts with local schools which are not just ready yet, so he could undertake our painting job immediately, if we had the Department's permission to proceed with the work.\n\nShould this not meet with the approval of the Department- we will submit other necessary improvements to our building such as, repairs to fire escapes,- quotations received for same $297.00, new roof, cost estimated at $3,280.00 and at least three porches for school and play-room entrances.\n\nAn immediate reply will be greatly appreciated.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nSuperior.\nOctober 3, 1949.\n\nReverend Sister Theresa,\nSuperior,\nFort William Residential School,\nFort William, Ontario.\n\nReverend Sister Superior:\n\nThis will confirm the fact that we have provided the following amounts for the Fort William Residential School:\n\n(a) For Repairs and Improvements .......... $600.00\n(b) For Equipment ......................... $600.00\n\nAs I advised you, we can provide the full amount under either allotment.

Burk,\nIndian Agent,\nCustoms Building,\nPort Arthur, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Burk,\n\nAt the time of Mr. Neary's visit here he explained to us the manner in which we were to benefit by the proposed special Grant which is being allotted to our Schools this year. He suggested that we send in our requisitions at an early date, for equipment and maintenance, covering the amount of our allotment.\n\nWe have been informed that our water pipes should be replaced by copper piping. Therefore, we had our local plumber prepare an estimate of the approximate amount of material required for this work, copy of which is enclosed.\n\nWe find that the drying facilities in our laundry are inadequate, so deem it advisable to procure a Tumbler to take care of this work. Our present laundry equipment was procured from the J.H. Connor & Son Ltd., Ottawa. Knowing that St. Joseph's Manor is using one of these Tumblers we contacted them with a view to purchasing its capacity, etc. A few days later when the Company's representative called there they referred him to us. We informed him that while we were interested, we were not in a position to place the order. This was being taken care of by the Federal Government.\n\nIt would facilitate the preparing of our Reports if we had a wide carriage typewriter. We are therefore requesting one of these - an eighteen inch carriage.\n\nOur caretaker has requested fifty yards of half-inch garden hose. This too has been entered on our list.\n\nThanking you in anticipation of your kind attention to the enclosed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFort William Indian Residential School\n\nSister M.

This will help us a lot. We note your remarks re spring basin taps and will act accordingly.

Reference above, I have to report, at approximately 8 A.M., this date, a telephone message was received this morning from the Sister Superior, St. Joseph's Orphanage, Fort William, to the effect that Frank FINLAYSON, a treaty Indian boy had run away from the Orphanage.\n\n2. A patrol was immediately made to St. Joseph's Orphanage and the Sister Superior interviewed, who stated that Frank FINLAYSON, an orphan boy, had run away from the Orphanage on the afternoon of the 3-6-39 and was accompanied by Percy FOWLER, a white boy, both boys being fourteen years of age. Description of these boys were obtained.\n\n3. The Sister Superior further stated that she had received a telephone message from an aunt of the RUNAWAY boy giving the information that while she was visiting friends in Poole Township, both these boys had been seen in the vicinity of a farm owned by the grandfather of FOWLER, now deceased.\n\n4. Acting on this information, accompanied by Sergeant, a patrol was made to the RUNAWAY farm at Poole Township. It was found upon arrival there that this farm had not been used for quite some time, probably since the death of Mr. FOWLER's Grandfather, a fire was smouldering in the shack on this property, and upon making enquiries of a neighboring farmer, information was received that the two boys had been in the shack during the morning and that they had headed up the road about an hour previous. Further that these boys were in possession of a bicycle, one riding said vehicle while the other rode on the cross bar.\n\n5. Making enquiries of the farmers along the road it was learned that the boys had taken to the bush, fearing that these boys might get lost or be pursued through the bush was immediately taken and after an all day search through the bush, around the main lakes and farms of the district, the escapees were sighted crossing a field, they were presently overhauled and taken into custody.\n\n6. The boys were questioned regarding the bicycle they had been seen with and RUNAWAY stated that he had taken the bicycle from a residence at Vickers Heights, just outside of the city of Fort William and further that the bicycle was hidden in the bush in the township of Poole.\n\n7. The boys were returned to St. Joseph's Orphanage and Mr. JURKIN, Indian Agent, Port Arthur Notified of the return of FINLAYSON.\n\n(Cont'd on page 2)\n\nFile numbers, heading and marginal reference are to be properly filled in.\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\nCRIMINAL INVESTIGATION BRANCH\n\n39 D 1274-3-E-9.\n\nOTTAWA June 12th, 1956.\n\nReferred by direction of The Commissioner, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Ottawa.\n\nTO:\nThe Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nJune 21, 1939.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the children at the St. Joseph's boarding school returning to their homes for the summer holidays and also returning to the school in the Fall, I would appreciate if the Department would authorize an amount of approximately $125.00 to cover the cost of transportation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

On checking with their parents I find that they have not sufficient funds to pay the cost of transportation back to the school. I would be pleased therefore if you would authorize me to pay transportation costs of these pupils. It is difficult to estimate the cost accurately, until each case is investigated thoroughly, but every effort will be made to keep the cost as low as possible.\n\nIn the event funds are available for this purpose would you please advise if payment can be made by transportation warrant.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nOctober 28, 1943.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to pupils who have not returned to the Fort William Residential School. In cases where it is absolutely impossible to obtain the necessary funds from their parents, the Department is prepared to provide transportation. If you let us know the approximate amount required, an accountable cheque will be sent. We do not issue transportation warrants used for this purpose.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J.O.

Matters\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 6, 1948.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nThe Department has an application for the admission of Joseph and Paul Jackpine to the Fort William Residential School.

There is another Indian boy by the name of Jack PRIMEAU age 9 who comes around to DURFEY'S at times. He ran away from the Indian Mission at Fort William, Ont. His mother, Mary PRIMEAU, ran off and left him to look after himself and he is now living with Jack BOUCHER at Ignace, Ont. BOUCHER is alleged to be mean to the boy and won't allow him to go to school and the boy is quite anxious to get away from BOUCHER and go to school.\nOttawa,\nMay 25, 1943.\n\nMr. J.C. Burk, Indian Agent, Port Arthur, Ont.\n\nIn a report from the R.O.M.P. regarding a recent patrol to the reserve near Ignace, Ont., reference is made to an Indian boy named Jack Primeau, 6 years of age. He is stated to be living with Jack Boucher at Ignace who is reported to be mean to the boy and does not allow him to go to school. It is further stated that Jack Primeau was formerly a pupil of the Fort William Residential School. If the facts are as stated, the Department feels that arrangements should be made to return him to the Fort William Residential School. As soon as you have definite information regarding this boy you should advise this office.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nMay 25, 1943.\n\nReverend Sister:\n\nOur attention has recently been directed to a boy named Jack Prineau who is at present living near Ignace, Ont. It is stated that this boy formerly attended the Fort William Residential School, but truanted. I should appreciate it if you would advise if you knew this fact and, if so, state his register number when he was a pupil of your school and also the date he left the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nThe Principal,\nIndian Residential School,\nFort William, Ont.\nMay 31st., 1948.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nWe have your letter of the 28th, re Jack Primeau.\n\nOur records show a Jack Primeau and his younger brother were sent here from Crilly, Ontario, September 27th, 1938. They were non-treaty. They remained here one year and did not return the following year. They returned in 1940 and at the end of the year their mother took them out and we have not seen them since that time.\n\nTrusting this information may assist you,\n\nwe are,\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal, Indian Residential School.\nFort Arthur, Ont.,\nSept. 2, 1943.\n\nI am in receipt of a number of requests from widows of various bands in the agency for transportation for their children to enable them to return to the St. Joseph's Boarding School at Fort William. It has been pointed out to the Indians that it is their responsibility to see that the children are returned to the school at their own expense but there are a number of cases, particularly amongst widowed members who are not in a position to bear the cost. In many cases the Indians are members of bands that have band funds and the cost could be charged, where necessary, to same.\n\nEvery effort will be made to keep the cost of the above mentioned, to a minimum.\n\nWould you kindly advise if it will be in order to accept accounts for transportation in this connection.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Indian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 10, 1943.\n\nMr. J. G. Burk, Indian Agent, Port Arthur, Ontario,\n\nIn view of the contents of your letter of the 2nd instant, you may pay the cost of returning some of the pupils to the Fort William Indian Residential School.\n\nIt should be definitely understood that this expenditure is to be kept to the minimum and in a case where they are members of a band that have band funds permission should be obtained from the mother or father to deduct from their payments.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nPort Arthur, Ont.

The two children they desire to have admitted are Doreen, age 11, and Kenneth, age 12.\n\nMr. Macquahway is presently a railway labourer in this area, and the family is living at Horns, Ont. (near Haith), and he advises there is no school in that vicinity where his children could attend school, and he is anxious for them to obtain at least a sound basic education. These two children have progressed thus far to grades II and IV, according to Mr. Macquahway's statement.\n\nWould you kindly confirm as soon as possible that this family is on your Treaty Records and give any other pertinent details, so that we may be in a position to seek authority for their admittance to the Fort William Indian Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.G. Burk, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, 8th January, 1946.\n\nMr. W.J.D.

The pupil's name and date of re-admission should also be shown on Form No. 411.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nFort Arthur, Ontario,\n15th November, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Res., Ottawa, Ont.\n\nAttention: Training Division\n\nMr. and Mrs. John Swanson (Long Sault #2 Band) have been into this office several times within the past month to interview me concerning having their three children discharged from the Fort William Indian Residential School. The names of these children and their ages are as undermentioned:\n\nIrene - 15\nElizabeth - 14\nDorothy - 8\n\nIt will be noted that the Swanson's are members of the Long Sault Band, Fort Frances Agency, and as such, they do not actually come under my administration. However, they have been residing in Fort Arthur for some months, the exact time I have not yet been able to determine, or have been called upon in several instances, to deal with their problems. I endeavoured to obtain their admission to the Indian Residential School at Fort Frances, but was advised by the Indian Agent that there was no room in the school for them. These children have heretofore been attending a local separate school where they did not get along very well and in the summer the parents made up their mind that when the school term started in the fall, they would place them in a residential school and as a consequence, they were admitted to the Fort William school effective September 1st, 1946.\n\nRealizing that any authority for a discharge must be received from you, I have not taken it upon myself to grant the parents request. However, considering this matter from many angles, I do not think it would be in the best interests of these three children to have them taken out of the residential school where they are reported by the Principal to be making good progress in their studies, eating better and improving their appearance and health generally. Upon enquiring around town, I learned that while the children were in attendance at St. Andrew's Roman Catholic School, their attendance at school was irregular, apparently being caused by both ill-health and parental neglect, and that they did not get along well with the white children and that their cleanliness left much to be desired at times. I further understand that St. Andrew's school would be reluctant to have them return to studies there. As far as the conditions in the Swanson home are concerned, I would advise that they are not very favourable for the children's welfare as I learned that there are constantly numerous Indians from outside around the house, keeping late hours and although I do not know this to be a fact personally, I hear there is a certain amount of drinking at times in their house. Mr. Swanson himself appears to be a very fine hardworking and steady worker and I am favourably impressed by him. Mrs. Swanson is, I would estimate, an average Indian woman and I have formed no particular opinion about her one way or the other.\n\nAs Mrs. Swanson said she will be back in the office around the 25th of November, to find out about the discharge of her children, if you would please review this matter and let me have\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nPage 2\n\na decision by that date, it would be much appreciated.\n\nJ.G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nNP/TP\n\nP.S. While it was reported in September that there was no room for these children at the residential school at Fort Frances, in a later communication from the Indian Agent of Fort Frances, I am informed that these children could now be admitted there. However, there seems little to be gained by transferring them from one residential school to another, unless it would make the parents feel happier that they are in a school under the administration of their own Indian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Res., Ottawa, Ont.\n\nAttention: Training Division\n\nMr. and Mrs. John Swanson (Long Sault #2 Band) have been into this office several times within the past month to interview me concerning having their three children discharged from the Fort William Indian Residential School.

The local police in Port Arthur and Fort William were immediately contacted and were not able to locate the children. John Wakates' parents live at Dog Lake, some 40 or 50 miles northwest of Port Arthur and I was informed by a hunter that he had seen the two boys at the edge of Dog Lake. The only way of communicating with the Wakates boy's father, who is a trapper at Dog Lake, would be by dog team or plane, which would be very expensive. The Provincial police informed me it did not come under their jurisdiction.\n\nIn the meantime, an Indian trapper informed me that the boys finally got through to Wakates' father's camp, northwest of Dog Lake and they are now stopping at Little Dog River, some 65 miles northwest of Port Arthur. It would be extremely expensive to send a plane to this location; the plane will have to land and try to locate the cabin in the bush. If a dog team was sent in, it would cost considerable money.\n\nPlease advise what action I should take regarding the boys case, and also what steps should be taken in the case of future similar occurrences.\n\nJ.G.B./tp\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 6th, 1947.\n\nMr. J.G. Burks, Indian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd ultimo, the Department feels that you should satisfy yourself that the two boys who returned from the Fort William School have reached their parents. If so, no action need be taken towards returning them to the school in view of the expense involved.\n\nHowever, if it is possible to have them returned later at less expense, you should do so.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\n9-11-10 (WT.7).\n\nOttawa, May 22, 1947.\n\nMr. J.G.

Burk, Indian Agent, Port Arthur, Ontario.\n\nAttached hereto you will find the June Quarter Return of the Fort William Indian Residential School.\n\nYou will note that where a pupil is not in residence for the full quarter no explanation is given as to why they were absent. Please have this Return rechecked and the above information included in the \"Remarks\" column of the Return.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEnclosure\nIndian Affairs Dr., Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nFor Training Division,\n\nThe quarterly report, 30th June, for the Fort William Residential School, which was returned to this Agency has been re-checked and is now passed back to you herewith.\n\nThe general comment from you to the effect that there were 91 days in the quarter and the pupils are shown as in residence only for 87, 88, 89 and 90 days is noted. Please note that upon checking with Sister Carron she advises that the majority of the pupils departed the school on the 27th or 28th June for their holidays and were out of school for a matter of few days less than the whole quarter. She explained that this to her knowledge had been the custom in the past and expressed surprise at this particular observation. Perhaps you intend the school to take advantage of the full 91 days in future and not to deduct for the odd days missed at the end of June.\n\nIn going over the report she discovered two errors and there has been an adjustment accordingly.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. Burt, Agent.\nSioux Lookout, Ontario,\nNovember 21st, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to advise that we have had a protest from Reverend J.
