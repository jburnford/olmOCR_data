Power Commission, Alert Bay, covers electricity used in the New Alert Bay Indian Day School and Teacherage.\n\nFor the Department's information, when the new school was under construction the Surveys and Engineering Branch had the building hooked up to use electricity. The teacherage was also on the same line. At that time the Company were unable to supply a meter and this was not installed until the beginning of the year. The amount of electricity consumed before the meter was installed was estimated.\n\nAs part of the electricity should rightly be charged to the construction of the new school, we have been endeavouring to get the matter straightened out but without success; so we are submitting the account as is and would recommend that it be paid.\n\n(M.S.

WILSON, Charles Garfield, Cape Mudge Band.\n\nOn October 16th last I was interviewed by Charles Garfield Wilson, ex-soldier, at Courtenay, who had been discharged from the Service under date of Feb. 27th, 1946, after having served in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe. This was the first time I had met Wilson since he returned from Overseas.\n\nHe informed me upon receiving his discharge he made application to the D.V.A. to re-enter high school and take advantage of his educational grant allowed by the D.V.A. to Veterans who had served Overseas. Wilson informed me that after months of effort on his part to obtain the grant he was informed by the D.V.A. that he could not pass the tests and, therefore, he was not eligible and nothing could be done for him; the reasons being as follows:\n\n(1) It seems the D.V.A. grant is primarily for a University education and only nine months high school course is permitted, which is merely a refresher period preparing them for University.\n\n(2) No provision is made for a high school education other than the above, evidently thinking that all Service men would have completed their high school education prior to the time of enlistment.\n\nIn the case of Charles Wilson he attended Alberni Residential School and took his Grade 9 there before being discharged. As his Grade 9 in this school gave him no standing insofar as the Provincial Department of Education is concerned, it was not recognized by the D.V.A. In addition to taking Grade 9, Charles, by his own initiative and expense, went to night school in Vancouver and took three months in Grade 10, while he was working in the Boeing Aircraft, Vancouver, during the beginning of the war; but he found that working and going to night school was too hard and had to give up his studies. He remained employed in the Boeing Aircraft, Vancouver, on war work until he volunteered for Service and enlisted on the 24th day of January, 1944.\n\nWilson has ambition to be educated and to obtain a position in the Civil Service of Canada in the Indian Affairs Branch - that is why he did everything possible to continue his studies through the D.V.A.\n\nAfter Wilson informed me of his disappointment in not being able to receive any benefits from the D.V.A. insofar as helping him with an education, he asked if there was anything the Indian Department could do to assist him.\n\np.t.o.\nThis was already the middle of October and I realized that if any action was to be taken it had to be done at once, otherwise he would lose a complete year. I also felt the Department would not want any deserving Indian Veteran to be deprived of an education on account of regulations which did not apply in his particular case, through no fault of his own. As he was so discouraged and yet so anxious to continue with his studies, I suggested that he come to Alert Bay where I would make every effort to help him.\n\nUpon my return home I interviewed Principal Wickens to see if it was possible for Charles Wilson to be put on the school staff as part-time employee where he could live in the school and take a Correspondence Course. Mr. Wickens was short-staffed at the time and I was under the impression that it would be of assistance to him and at the same time help this lad. Mr. Wickens declined. I then referred the matter to the Principal of the Alert Bay Superior White School, the Provincial School Inspector and the School Board for the area, all of whom were immediately sympathetic to my problem and agreed to accept him as a correspondence student in the school, with the understanding that the Principal was to assist him in his studies. The Provincial Department of Education has also been very co-operative.\n\nThis letter is somewhat lengthy but I have been faced with an unusual situation and wish to give the Department all the facts in respect to same, and felt the Department would expect me to do everything possible to assist this Indian Veteran. It has taken considerable time to overcome all the difficulties experienced because the education he received at the Reserve School could not be recognized by the Provincial Authorities and the D.V.A. I am pleased to tell the Department arrangements were made for him to take up his studies on October 31st last, and he has made good progress ever since. The Principal of the White School has assisted him in reviewing Grade 9 work and he is now taking Grade 10 and should complete it at the end of the term.\n\nIn making these arrangements it was necessary to find a boarding place for him as well as purchase his books and pay for his registration fee with the Department of Education. A statement and voucher covering room and board and books is attached herewith with my recommendation. Possibly I should state Mrs. Daniel Hanuse of Alert Bay agreed to provide him board and room and do his washing for $30.00 a month. This is very reasonable in comparison to other charges made for the same service. Total cost to the Department to June 30th, 1947, will amount to $260.95.\n\nIt is our intention that he immediately start Grade 11 July 1st, 1947, continuing his Correspondence Course. We hope to have this completed by December 31st, 1947. He will also take Grade 12 by Correspondence Course and have it completed by December, 1948. I am not sure as yet what it will cost the Department for Grades 11 and 12 - it will all depend on what arrangements I can make for him, but in any case it would not be more than the amount asked for, for this year.\n\nI am attaching hereto a brief report from Mr. S. J. Heywood, Principal of Alert Bay Superior White School, which will speak for itself. Mr. Heywood has just told me that Charles is doing exceptionally well, that he has seen his marks and is very pleased with the progress he is making. Application for Tuition Grant is also enclosed.\n\nEncs.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6489, file 42156-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am forwarding herewith an application for tuition grant for Charles Garfield Wilson of the Cape Mudge Band and a letter in support of this application from Mr. Indian Agent Todd.\n\nI am writing to Mr. Todd for further information concerning the expenditure of $460.96 as set forth in the application.\n\nThough I am not convinced that the best possible solution was used in this case I consider it advisable that the arrangement be continued until the end of June 1947. The student apparently is making very satisfactory progress and is worthy of support in his efforts to gain an education. A change in plans at this time would not be in his best interests.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: K.19985 - WILSON, C. G.\n\nWith reference to letter from Indian Agent Todd, dated 31 December, 1946, on file hereunder, the Veterans Affairs Department does not provide assistance for education such as that required by Wilson.\n\nIf a veteran has matriculated before leaving the services, grants can be made to assist him in a university course. Should it be necessary, he will be granted a refresher course of one term for the purpose of ensuring that he is capable of keeping pace with his first year. If he lacks one year of completing matriculation, a grant can be made to him for this purpose and continued in the university course. Where a veteran has not the above standards he may receive assistance in vocational or technical training, but there is no provision for assisting a veteran to complete two or three years of high school.\nOttawa, 15 January 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 7th instant regarding an application for tuition grant for Charles Garfield Wilson. It is noted that Mr. Wilson is a member of the Cape Mudge Band and a returned soldier who is not eligible for education advantages allowed to veterans who served overseas.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter and also Indian Agent Todd's communication, we will allow Wilson a tuition grant of $260.96 which it is understood will be sufficient for the period ended June 30, 1947. In your letter you mentioned $460.96 but it is evident from Agent Todd's letter that this was a typographical mistake.\n\nArrangements will be made to pay the two vouchers which you submitted.\n\nBernard F.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. MacKay:\n\nRe Lillian Matilpi\n\nThis letter will confirm our telephone conversation of recent date with regard to the above mentioned girl.\n\nOur staff have been so pleased at Lilly's progress since she came to the Institute for training, that we feel she should be given added opportunity. The Canadian National Institute for the Blind train a certain number of their most promising blind girls as Home Teachers, who go out into the homes of the blind people to teach them Braille and handicrafts.\n\nHowever, before a girl can enter training, she must be at least 20 years of age and have some high school, preferably matriculation. We have discussed Lilly with Mr. C.E. McDonald of the School for the Deaf and Blind, who has agreed that, your Department willing, Lilly should enter the School and take high school work with the understanding that she then be given training under the Canadian National Institute for the Blind as a Home Teacher at the end of 2 or 3 years. Lilly is herself most anxious to take advantage of this opportunity.\n\nThere will not be accommodation available at the School until the end of February, but the lady with whom Lilly is staying, has agreed to act as her guide to and from the School until that time.\n\nWe would appreciate receiving your approval of this plan and any comments you care to make.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"Eileen Scott\"\nSocial Welfare Dept.\n| DATE | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1947 | Grant to enable Lillian Matilpi, blind Indian girl of the Matilpi Band, Kwawkewlth Agency, to attend the Canadian Institute for the Blind at Vancouver, B.C. for month of February, 1947. | $50.00 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nMrs. Pogson, teacher of the Port Essington School, having resigned, the future of the few children at this village has been given consideration. There is a white school in the village. Most of the pupils attending same are of mixed Indian-White stock and are nearly all related to the youngsters attending the Indian school.\n\nI have discussed this matter at length with Inspector E. E. Hyndman and he is prepared to recommend that our Indian school children be admitted to the white school at Port Essington and make it a combined school. He informs me that there may not be enough pupils to keep his school open with whites alone. From our point of view, it is going to be practically impossible to secure a teacher to live in the conditions prevalent at Port Essington. The total cost of a teacher, fuel and all supplies should be in excess of what we would pay to the Area School Board for taking these children in. The white school is as close to the homes of our children as is the Indian Day School. If the deal is put through, the School Board would like to have the use of the oil heater now installed in our School.\n\nThe move is strongly recommended. Average attendance during the year at our school has been 11.06. Will you advise if I may proceed to secure a per capita figure for tuition from the School Board and submit same for consideration of the Department.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nMrs. M. Roper, Secretary-Treasurer, Prince Rupert District School Board, Prince Rupert, B. C.\n\nThe teacher at the Port Essington Indian Day School, Mrs. E. Pogson, will not be returning at the end of the holidays this summer. It is going to be impossible to secure a teacher for this School this fall, bearing in mind the needs in larger villages of the Agency.\n\nThe pupilage by grades at this Indian School are as follows:\n\n| Gr.I | Gr.II | Gr.III | Gr.IV | Gr.V | Gr.VI | Gr.VII | Total |\n|------|-------|--------|-------|------|-------|--------|-------|\n| B.

If so, it will be appreciated if you will advise the per capita tuition fee expected from this Department for the education of these children. The writer would be pleased to discuss this matter further with you or the Board at any convenient time.\n\nfeapb\n\nvcc. Major D. M. MacKay, Vancouver\nMr. E.

Anfield, Esq., Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, B.C.\n\nI have to refer to your letter of June 11th, file 3-11-1, concerning the proposal for a consolidated school at Port Essington. The Department is already operating in other Provinces schools of this type and it is believed that the establishment of such a school at Port Essington would receive favourable consideration.\n\nWould you kindly proceed to secure a per capita figure for tuition from the School Board and submit the same for consideration of the Department through this office.\n\nIt is realized that this arrangement would involve an expenditure higher than the grant usually given for tuition in white schools.\n\n;mh\n\nfor D.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nFurther to Agency file 3-11-1, of July 2, re admitting Indian pupils to the Port Essington Elementary School, I am advised by the Prince Rupert School Board that they will accept these pupils at a rate of $110.00 per pupil per school year less Provincial Government grants estimated at $45.00 per capita.\n\nThis means a net cost of approximately $65.00 per capita. As the average attendance last school year was 9.46 for the four quarterly returns this is actually cheaper than running a school ourselves.\n\nThe offer of the School Board is recommended for immediate acceptance and the Department's instruction requested.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo: The Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nFrom: District Inspector of Indian Schools.\n\nI refer to copies of letters of Mr. Indian Agent Anfield concerning the admission of Indian pupils to the Port Essington Elementary School.\n\nIt is noted that the cost of tuition for these pupils is higher than the Department has been paying in the past, but it does not cover the total cost. The situation at this point is somewhat different, inasmuch as the Indian pupils will apparently make up about half of the school population. The operation of a combined school at Port Essington would represent a saving for the School Board and for the Department over the operation of separate schools.\n\nIt is recommended that the offer of the Prince Rupert School Board be accepted, and that Mr. Anfield be requested to submit applications for tuition grants for the pupils who will be enrolled at this school.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Port Essington Indian Day School\n\nSince the resignation of Mrs. Pogson, teacher of the Port Essington Indian Day School, the matter of the admission of the few children at the village to the Port Essington Elementary School has been the subject of correspondence with Mr. Indian Agent Anfield with a view to their admission to this school. Provincial Inspector Hyndman has approved of the arrangement.\n\nThe Department will find the matter dealt with quite clearly in the attached correspondence and I have no hesitation in recommending that the necessary arrangements be made for the Indian children to attend the Port Essington Provincial School. A reply by airmail would be appreciated.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, August 21, 1947.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O.

Mr. Indian Agent Anfield can submit a voucher each quarter or each year, as the Board prefers, supported by a statement of attendance of the Indian children concerned, signed by the teacher of the school.\n\nThe children should attend this school from the 2nd of September and should not await the outcome of formal negotiations if necessitated by the Board's answer to para 2 above.\n\nBernard F.

WILSON, Charles Garfield, Cape Mudge Band.\n\nOn December 31st last I wrote you at some considerable length in respect to this Indian Veteran recommending that the Department assist him financially in pursuing his education.\n\nThe Department approved and Charlie has now completed his Grade 10 and wishes to proceed to Vancouver and there be enrolled at the Shurpass Schools of Canada, starting September 15th, where they guarantee to put him through Grades 11 and 12 in one year. As Charlie is anxious to complete his high school studies so that he can enter University in September, 1948, under his D.V.A. Grant, I am anxious that the Department assist him this year in order to make this possible. Assistance required is as follows:\n\nFees........... $155.00\nBooks......... 50.00\nRoom and Board 480.00\n\n$685.00\n\nI am, therefore, recommending that the Department approve of this amount and advise me as soon as convenient.\n\np.t.o.\nFor the Department's information I have made arrangements with the D.V.A. for them to extend the time limit until September, 1948, so that Charlie will have an opportunity to complete his high school studies and take advantage of his D.V.A. Grant. This grant should see him through University training.\n\n(M.S. Todd)\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nEnclosed is an application from Mr. Indian Agent Todd\nfor a Tuition Grant for Charles Garfield Wilson of the\nCape Mudge Band.\n\nThis is rather a large application and it is recommended\nonly on the understanding that further assistance from the\nDepartment will not be required by this pupil.\n\nIt is noted from Mr. Todd's letter that this grant will\nenable Mr. Wilson to complete his High School graduation\nand become eligible for assistance from the Department of\nVeterans Affairs.\n\nMr. Wilson has made good progress in his studies at\nthe Alert Bay Superior School where he is taking his\nGrade X course by correspondence, and he has shown con-\nsiderable application in completing his Grade X work.\n\nD. M. MacKay\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\n\n;ms.\nAIRMAL\n\nOttawa, September 10, 1947.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nTuition Grant - Charles Garfield Wilson\n\nCareful consideration has been given to your letter of the 6th instant with reference to the tuition grant for Charles Garfield Wilson.\n\nThe amount mentioned is much larger than we usually allow. However, it has been decided to give favourable consideration to this man's request, and an amount of $65.00 will be allowed for the current academic year.\n\nAll parties concerned should understand very definitely that this is the only assistance that we will be able to give Wilson.\n\nBernard F.

The grant requested for Winnifred amounts to $60.00 made up as follows:\n\nTuition and Registration Fees.... $32.00\nBooks................................. $28.00\n$60.00\n\nWinnifred is living at home and through a special arrangement with Mr. MacAulay, Principal of the Alert Bay Junior Senior High School, she receives part time instruction, with no cost to the Department. The local School Board have been very kind in helping us and due to the fact that Winnifred is not in school full time they are making no charge for attendance.\n\nVouchers Nos. 535 and 536 are attached hereto covering textbooks and tuition fees. I recommend that this pupil be assisted to the extent of $60.00 this year, and the attached vouchers paid. Would you kindly forward them to Ottawa with your recommendation.\n\n(M. S.

Although it would seem preferable for Winnifred Scow to attend High School with the others, it is presumed that there must be some reason which prevents her doing so.\n\nI would recommend approval of the grants requested and payment of the vouchers attached hereto.\n\nThe Agent did not include an \"Application for Tuition Grant\" for Catherine Beans, but I am asking him to forward this as soon as possible.\n\nD.

C., Department of Mines and Resources, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nI have received a request from Reginald Wilson, son of Charles Wilson of Cape Mudge Indian Reserve, who is now attending University of B. C., to assist him in the amount of $211.50. This amount covers University annual fees and necessary books.\n\nReginald Wilson has been attending high school in Courtenay and has made a very good success of his studies and wishes to continue. Possibly I should inform the Department that his father, Charles Wilson, has paid for his entire high school education.\n\nIn view of this and also as the father is paying a considerable amount towards the cost of his University education, I am recommending that the Department assist him to the extent requested.\n\nIt would be appreciated if the Department would kindly forward an accountable cheque in the amount of $211.50 to this office.\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncs.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing a letter dated November 18th from Mr. Indian Agent Todd received here today, together with Application for Tuition Grant for Reginald Wilson, twenty year old Indian of the Cape Mudge Band, who is presently attending the University of British Columbia. This boy is a brother of Charles Garfield Wilson for whom the Department approved a tuition grant, reference Mr. Neary's letter of September 10th (file 103-156), and apparently it was the original intention that the boy's parents meet the cost of his education.\n\nReginald Wilson was interviewed in this office recently and stated that his parents were not in a position to meet these costs and that fees for the first half of the university term, and other expenses, had been paid by himself from his earnings during the summer but that he would be unable to meet any further costs.\n\nUnder the circumstances and providing his academic standing at the University after Christmas warrants continuation of his studies I would recommend that the Department approve a grant of $211.50 in this case. I may say that if his academic standing after Christmas is not satisfactory he will not be permitted to remain at the University in any case. I would therefore suggest that an accountable advance of $211.50 be forwarded to Mr. Letcher, Acting Indian Agent, Alert Bay.\n\nD. M.

Gloria has received a satisfactory report from the principal and will be entering Grade 12 when she returns to high school on September 7th.\n\nAs I am anxious to help this student I am recommending that the Department again assist her to the extent of $450.00.\n\nGloria is a very capable girl, has been working in the Indian Office here during the holidays and I have had an opportunity to really judge her worth, and I believe she has what it takes to succeed if given financial assistance. Gloria is the oldest girl in a family of eight. She has worked during summer holidays to help pay for her transportation to and from school and also to help pay for her clothes, etc. Her father is helping her as far as he can. Her parents are most anxious that she continue with her studies.\n\nAs Gloria will be returning to school at the beginning of September, it would be appreciated if an early reply could be received.

He will be taking third year subjects but will be registered as a second year student because of the necessity of completing the French course which he failed last term.\n\nMr. Scow has requested a continuance of the assistance given him by the Department last year but has asked that the amount be increased from $445.00 to $520.00. This amount is broken down as follows:\n\nFees - $205.00\nBoard - $315.00\n\nMr. Scow will be making a contribution of approximately $250.00. The requested increase is due to an increase in the cost of board.\n\nIt is recommended that the department approve a grant of $320.00 to cover the cost of board and tuition up to the end of December at which time we will obtain a statement from the University as to the results of this student's examinations. This statement will be forwarded to the Department as soon as it is received with a recommendation. It is requested that if the Department approves this suggestion an accountable advance for $200.00 be forwarded to this office.\n\nThis matter has been discussed with Inspector Davey who concurs in the recommendation.\n\nW.S.

Apparently in response to my letter of January 5th an accountable advance of $211.50 was forwarded to the Acting Indian Agent at Alert Bay to cover expenses during the second half of the school term but in the interval due to illness of his father Reginald was absent from University for a period of one month and fell so far behind he did not consider it advisable to continue that year.\n\nHe is again registered at the University this year, however, and has paid $115 in fees and slightly over $20.00 for books. He is able to finance room and board for a period of two months but beyond that requires Departmental assistance. I have discussed this matter with Supt. Todd who agrees that a grant of $200 toward payment of fees for the latter half of the academic year and for some assistance with books, etc., would be warranted. I have interviewed Reginald and feel that he will do his best this year. I would recommend that in this case a grant of $200 be approved.\n\nW.S.

We have also reviewed Indian Commissioner MacKay's letters of December 9th, 1947 and January 5th, 1948.\n\nWe feel that Superintendent Todd should have requested you to advise the Department when Reginald Wilson was returning to University. If you refer to letter of January 5th, 1948, you will note that we were informed that he withdrew from the University at that time because in the opinion of the University authorities, continuation of his studies was not warranted.\n\nCould you obtain a report from the University authorities indicating whether or not an additional expenditure in the case of this boy would be warranted.\n\nAs you realize, we have numerous requests from all parts of the country for tuition grants and as far as possible we must be assured that when we authorize such grants, the pupil has a reasonable chance of success.\n\nBernard F.

These students were previously attending the Heriot Bay High School on Quadra Island which is close to their home and anticipated returning to this school at the beginning of the present academic year. However when they sought admission they were refused by the school board on the ground that there was insufficient accommodation for their own pupils and they could not accept Indian children. On learning this the father of the boys made arrangements for them to attend the King Edward High School in Vancouver. The father is paying the complete cost of board and lodging and is requesting only that the Department pay the tuition fees and cost of books.\n\nIt will be understood that it was impossible for the Superintendent to anticipate this request.\n\nIt is recommended that a grant of $136.00 be approved for each of these pupils.\n\nThese students were interviewed in the Vancouver office by Inspector Davey who has completed the application forms and signed for the Superintendent who concurs in the recommendation.\n\nW.S.

I have had a lengthy interview with this student's father, Chief William Scow, President of the Native Brotherhood. The boy's father states that he realizes that the record of his son's marks on the Christmas examinations is not satisfactory but has given me definite assurance that the boy is making a very determined effort to improve his standing.\n\nI have also contacted Mrs. W.P. Bunt, wife of the United Church Superintendent of Missions for B.C., with whom Alfred is residing. She has confirmed that this student is making a much greater effort.\n\nIt will be noted that there is now only one month until the final examinations will be held at the University. It is therefore strongly recommended that the Department approve a grant of $135.00 to cover the cost of board for the period January 16th to April 30th.\n\nThe above mentioned period includes two months which have passed and I have given Mrs. Bunt assurance that funds will be forthcoming so that she will receive payment for the two months for which she has already provided board and lodging.

Lipp,\nSecretary, Board of School Trustees,\nDistrict No. 72,\nCampbell River, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Lipp:\n\nIn view of the construction plans of the Board of School Trustees No. 72 for the erection of a new school on Quadra Island and the intention of the Indian Affairs Branch to build a new two room school at Cape Mudge it would appear that there is an opportunity for co-operation in the construction of a school which would serve either all or part of the Indian pupils as well as the white community. This suggestion is made because it is felt that the present segregation of Indians is retarding the development of our Native people and that the admission of Indian children to white schools is one of the most effective ways of overcoming this segregation. In addition to this factor, the increased enrolment which would result would make possible a larger school and improved facilities. As your Board is probably aware, School Boards in other parts of the Province have agreed to cooperate in plans of this nature.\n\nAlthough the situation may not be exactly parallel an outline of the procedure which was followed and the basis upon which an agreement was reached in one instance may be of interest to your Board. At Hazelton where the Indian Reserve is adjacent to the white community, both the school Board and the Indian Affairs Branch required new schools. The School Board was approached by the Indian Affairs Branch with a proposal that the public school be constructed sufficiently large to accommodate the Indian pupilage. The Indian Affairs Branch agreed to pay to the Department of Education the proportion of the capital cost which the Indian pupilage bore to the total enrolment. The Indian Affairs Branch also agreed to pay tuition fees for each pupil for whom it is responsible at the rate of the net per capita cost to the school board.\nIt was agreed that the control of the school was to remain entirely in the hands of the Board. The School Board gave assurance that there would be no segregation of Indian children in separate class-rooms. These proposals were agreed to in principle by the School Board but felt that it was largely a local matter and that acceptance should be subject to the agreement of the majority of the rate payers resident in that section of the district affected. A meeting of this group accepted the proposal and the preliminary planning for the new building is now being undertaken.\n\nIf your Board is prepared to consider a similar plan I shall be pleased to submit after further study a definite proposal.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.F.

Davey Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools in B.C.\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPrevious to your letter of January 20, 1949, I was requested by the elected Representatives at their annual meeting held February 4th, 1949 to enquire from the Department of Mines and Resources, if they are prepared to pay a net per capita cost on construction of new schools in any part of District No. 72 which construction at present include Campbell River Elementary-High and Quadra Island Superior.\n\nIf your Department will share the proportion of Capital cost, which the Indian pupilage bore to the total enrolment and the net per capita cost for tuition fees, it is the intention of the Board of School Trustees, District No. 72 to include the enrolment of Indian children at Campbell River and Quadra Island as soon as new buildings are constructed.\n\nThe enrolment of Indian children in any other part of District No. 72 would be decided on application by your Department.\n\nYour letter of January 20th, 1949 covers many points not necessary to include in this letter, i.e. control to remain in the hands of the Board, children's health report, subject to the approval of ratepayers resident on Quadra Island and Campbell River, no segregation of Indian children in separate class-rooms, etc.\n\nThis Board of School Trustees are willing to consider a similar plan as outlined by the School Board of Hazelton.\n\nPlease submit a definite proposal of the Department of Mines & Resources.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nA.C. Lipp,\nSecretary.\n\nS.S., Department of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nEnclosed are copies of correspondence between Inspector Davey and the Campbell River Board of School Trustees. It will be noted that the Board of School Trustees is willing to consider the admission of pupils to their schools on the same basis as the proposed combined school at Hazelton. Would you kindly indicate whether the Department wishes to proceed with this matter.\n\nIn both of the districts referred to the Indian missionary work is done by the United Church of Canada and it is felt that there will be no objection from that Body to the admission of Indian children to Provincial schools.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMarch 3, 1949.\n\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nCampbell River Board of School Trustees.\n\nReference your 6-11-1 (156) of February 21.\n\nI have noted the interest shown by the Board of School Trustees at Campbell River, B.C., in the erection of joint schools.\n\nI am arranging to discuss this matter with the Director but in the meantime could we have an indication as to the immediate building plans of the School Board. Mr. Lipp's letter indicates that they plan a building program at the Campbell River Elementary-High School and the Quadra Island Superior School.\n\nHave you any indication as to the type of building which they plan to erect at these two places and also can you give a forecast as to the number of Indian children who will be involved? I feel that both these questions will be raised when we take this matter to the Minister's office and I am therefore requesting this information now.\n\nBernard F.

During that quarter this school charged $16.30 per month for each pupil. At the end of December, 1948, we were only paying at the rate of $3.50 a month.\n\nThe heavy increase in the monthly rate, which it is presumed will continue in the future, emphasizes the fact that we will be obliged to exercise more strict supervision regarding those for whom we will be able to allow a tuition grant.\n\nConsequently, before August 1st, 1949, you should forward us a list of those pupils for whom you consider a tuition grant should be allowed at the school mentioned above. In the case of those who have already attended, you should let us have a report from the Principal of the school, indicating that they were successful during the academic year 1948-49 and have been promoted to a higher form for the academic year 1949-50.\n\nIn the case of new pupils whom it is considered should enter the Comox Elementary School for the first time during the academic year 1949-50, a separate form should be forwarded.\nfor each pupil. A supply of these forms is enclosed.\n\nThe information requested should, of course, be sent through the office of Indian Commissioner Arneil, to whom a copy of this letter is being forwarded.\n\nBernard F.

Lipp,\nSecretary-Treasurer,\nBoard of School Trustees,\nDistrict No. 72,\nCampbell River, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI refer to your letter of February 11th concerning the possible admission of Indian children from the reserves at Campbell River and Cape Mudge to schools in District No. 72. This matter has been referred to the head office of the Indian Affairs Branch with a request for permission to proceed with negotiations. I have been requested to secure further information as to the approximate number of pupils involved, the type of school to be built at Campbell River and Quathiaski Cove and the approximate cost of each building. I shall appreciate your supplying me with this information if possible.\n\nWith regard to the probable enrolment, will you please include figures for the white population only. I have checked the number of Indian children, both of school age and pre-school age and have attached a copy of a summary of this. The grade placement indicated is for the current year.\n\nAt both Cape Mudge and Campbell River I feel that the Primary Grades (1 to 3) should continue to attend our own schools.\n\nI have requested the Indian Affairs Branch to authorize my proceeding with negotiations with your Board for the\nadmission of the Indian pupils from the Cape Mudge and Campbell River Reserves with standings of Grade 4 and above to the two schools at Quathiaski Cove and Campbell River on the same basis as the agreement reached at Hazelton as outlined in my previous letter of January 20th. At Cape Mudge this would involve the admission of approximately 25 (including the 8 pupils now attending Grades 7 and 8 at the Heriot Bay School) and 16 at Campbell River including the pupil already enrolled in Grade II.\n\nShould your board wish to discuss this matter with me I shall be pleased to attend a meeting at the convenience of the members.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.F.

This girl was formerly a pupil at the Alberni Residential School but failed to return to the school after the holidays last year. As accommodation is no longer available for her at the Alberni school, it is recommended that her discharge from the Alberni school and her admittance to the Fort Renfrew white school be approved.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, February 12, 1945.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant, you may authorize Indian Agent Ashbridge to allow Stolla Jones to attend the Port Renfrew white school. However, I may say that I feel it is a rather doubtful procedure. If the parents were not sufficiently interested to return her to the Alberni School, it is extremely doubtful if they will send her regularly to any day school. The teacher should be requested to watch her attendance and let us know at the end of June just how many days she attended the Port Renfrew School. There is also the probability that it may encourage others to delay returning to the school after the holidays.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nWest Coast Agency\nAlberni, B. C.\nDec. 8, 1945\n\nD. M. McKay, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B. C., Box 70\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nYour File: 215-16-2564\n\nI have to refer to your letter, dated Oct. 18/45, in connection with education of Indian children at the Provincial School at Cespeeco, and to report having visited that point and investigated the matter.\n\nThe present Day School is situated on the Cannery site at Cespeeco; but it is about to be moved to Doctor McLean's property at Esperanza...a matter of 2 miles.\n\nA survey of the children available for the school shows only two who could attend with any pretence to regularity, as the population of the Cannery is composed of Indian families employed during the Fishing season. Only the children of such families not in school during the season are mostly from Ahousat, and they attend school at Ahousat from November to June.\n\nI spoke to the teacher and inspected the school, and also interviewed the trustees, and am satisfied that the school is being conducted according to the regulation of the Provincial Board of Education.\n\nThe children attending regularly are Robert Adams, age 9; and Samuel Adams, age 12; orphans, and have both attended since September 1, 1945.\n\nI would respectfully recommend that attendance be authorized for these children, also for any other children whose parents may be in a position to send them regularly during the school term.\n\nI have requested the school trustees and the teacher to submit names of prospective pupils in order that the applications may be properly investigated.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge\nIndian Agent\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nThe Provincial Government has recently created a school district near Ceepeecce known as the Hecate-Tahsis school district and a day school has been in operation on the Cannery site, Ceepeecce, for some time, but will likely be moved to Esperanza, a matter of two miles, in the near future.\n\nTwo Indian children, Robert Adams, age 9, and Samuel Adams, age 12, have been attending this school since September 1st and Mr. Ashbridge's letter of December 3rd recommending that the Department pay the usual tuition grant for these children is enclosed herewith. It will be noted that there likely are other Indian children who should be attending this school, but pending receipt of a further report from the Indian Agent in this connection I would recommend that the Department authorize the usual grant of $5.00 per annum, based on attendance, for each of these children.\n\nD.

Ashbridge\nIndian Agent\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 103-159\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Phelan's letter of December 13th approving the usual grant of $35.00 to enable Robert Adams and Samuel Adams to attend the Hecate Tahsis school.\n\nArrangements were made with the Nootka Mission Hospital Association to provide midday meals for the white children attending this school at a cost of $6.50 per month, and an enquiry has been made as to whether this service could be extended to include the two Adams children. Mr. Ashbridge's letter of January 31st is enclosed, and inasmuch as Mr. and Mrs. James Adams are tuberculous and unable to provide for their children, I would recommend that the Department authorize a maximum expenditure of $6.50 per month during such time as the two children attend this white school.\n\nD.

Wood, Esq.,\nSecretary-Treasurer,\nAlberni School District No. 70,\nEighth Avenue School,\nP.O. Box 904,\nPort Alberni, B. C.\nSept. 16, 1946.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of the 27th ultimo, addressed to this Department at Ottawa, has been referred to me for attention.\n\nIt is noted that you state that Indian children of elementary school age are being forced to do without an education due to lack of accommodation and that there are approximately forty beginners on the Reserves in the Valley who will not be able to start school. I would advise that this problem was discussed with the Indian Agent at Alberni last year with a view to the construction of a new school on the Opetchesahlt Reserve at Alberni, but unfortunately lack of building material has prevented any development of our plan but I understand that most of the children on this Reserve are attending the Residential School at Alberni.\n\nAs I have no definite information, I am asking the Acting Indian Agent at Alberni for a report showing exactly how many children are not attending school and suggesting that he interview you with a view to securing their admission to the white schools in the neighborhood contingent upon our Department paying the school fees. We circularized all our Indian Agents asking that any Indian children who are not attending school be ensured of immediate attendance where white schools would arrange to take them, without waiting for specific authorization by this office, submitting the details later.\n\nYour interest in the matter is greatly appreciated and it is sincerely hoped that your discussion with Mr. Garrard, the Acting Indian Agent, will result in some alleviation of the condition complained of if it exists.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nE.B. Wood, Secy.Treas.\nAlberni School District, No. 70,\nP.O. Box 904, Port Alberni, B.C.\nI have received a letter from Mac George an Indian of the Kelsemart Band, requesting that his Step Daughter Doris Charlie be allowed to attend the Provincial school at Gee Pee Gee The Esperanza Day school (Nootka Mission).\n\nDoris Charlie 8 years old has not been admitted to the Alberni Residential School, and as the Step Father is working at C.P.C. and expects to stay there I have advised that he have her enrolled in this school, advising the date that she entered.\n\nI have not been in communication with the school trustees at C.P.C. regarding Doris but I imagine that the tuition fee will be the same as for the James boys that is $55.00 per year and an allowance of $.50 per month for one meal each school day.\n\nAuthority is requested for this expenditure under your letter of August 29th, 1946. 215-15-5042\n\nActing India Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 103-1 W.T.\n\nWith reference to your letter of August 8th regarding the attendance of Indian children at Provincial schools, enclosed herewith is a letter from Mr. Acting Indian Agent Garrard requesting that tuition fee in the amount of $25.00 per year, and an allowance of $.50 per month for one meal each school day, be allowed to enable Doris Charlie to attend the Provincial School at Cee Pee Cee, the Esperanza Day School. It is recommended that authority be granted for this expenditure.\n\nD. J. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, 2 October 1946.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nEX'D.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 21st ultimo, the Department will allow a tuition grant at the rate of $35.00 a year for Doris Charlie who is attending the Provincial School at Cee Pee Cee.\n\nWe will also allow the payment of an allowance of $6.50 a month for one meal each day. We understand that this amount will only be required for a period of nine months. In this connection we would refer you to your letter of August 16th and official reply of August 27th with regard to the James boys.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Miss Wood:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 16th instant regarding your letter of the 27th ultimo addressed to the Department advising them that there were approximately forty beginners on Reserves in the Port Alberni Valley unable to start school, I would advise that I am now informed by Mr. Acting Agent Garrard that his investigation shows that there were only eight children of school age not attending school, two of these being medical cases, four being provided for, presumably at the Residential School, and only two, Bobby and Howard George, aged 15 and 9 respectively who have apparently been unable to find accommodation. From this it would appear that there is actually only one child who would be within the category of those reported by you to the Department instead of the forty beginners as stated.\n\nIn view of the problem of providing accommodation for teachers in Indian schools as well as white communities it is considered that this is remarkable. The Indian Agent informs me that he interviewed you with a view to finding accommodation for the Indian children not provided for and was informed that there was no room.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nMiss E. B. Wood, Secy.Treas.,\nAlberni School District, No. 70,\nP.O. Box 904, Port Alberni, B.C.\nD. M. McKay, Esq., Indian Commissioner, Box 70\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nYour file: 215-15-3162\n\nWith reference to your letter of Sept. 16th regarding the lack of accommodation at the Alberni Residential School for Indian children living in this vicinity; and the information you have from Miss S. B. Wood, Secretary of Alberni School District, stating the number of children deprived of education through lack of accommodation in the neighbourhood of 40, I wish to report that her figure is greatly exaggerated. The actual number is 8.\n\nThe following are the names and ages of these children, and reasons of their exclusion:\n\n| NAME    | AGE | FATHER     | REASON                                      |\n|---------|-----|------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| DICK    | James | 11 | John Dick | It was thought there would be no room; but as there is now, these will be placed. |\n|         | Melvin | 10 | \"          | \"                                           |\n|         | William | 8  | \"          | \"                                           |\n|         | Rosie   | 7  | \"          | \"                                           |\n| TATOOSH | Dorothy | 13 | Wm.

I also inquired if it would be possible to have Indian children attend the Provincial School, and was informed that there was no room, as at present the Alberni Schools were sending children they could not accommodate to the Schools in Port Alberni.\n\nAt the present time there are 58 children in this Agency between the ages of 7 and 15 who are unable to attend school. These are from Bands outside the local area, and do not include the Ahousat Band where a Day School is operating.\n\nN. W. Garrard\nActg. Indian Agent\nWhile I was in Alberni I took the opportunity of visiting the Supervising Principal of the Provincial schools in this area and enquiring as to the progress of the four pupils attending the High School from the Alberni Residential School. These pupils travel by the regular school bus which runs within a very short distance of the Residential school. The principal informs me that these students are all fitting in well in the white school both socially and academically.\n\nThe following are the gradings given to these pupils on the basis of their last examinations:\n\nDelmina Charles C\nJames Knighton C\nRowena Ross B\nElizabeth Robinson C\n\nA indicates pupil is in upper 5% of class\nB indicates pupil is in next 20% of class\nC indicates pupil is in next 15% of class\nCf indicates pupil is in next 20% of class\n\nAll of these pupils rank as average or better.\nAPPLICATION FOR TUITION GRANT\n\n1.

Garrard\nIndian Agent\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Garrard's letter of November 21st in connection with tuition grants required for various Indian pupils attending white schools in the West Coast Agency.\n\nThe seven pupils attending Alberni High School are residing at the Alberni Residential School and the only direct cost to the Department in their case will be an amount of $50.00 per academic year each to cover tuition fees payable to the Alberni School District. It is thought that the Department will require forms \"Application for Tuition Grant\" in each case and if so I would ask that the necessary forms be sent to Mr. Garrard.\n\nThe other eight pupils listed by the Agent are attending the white public school at Ceepeecree under the same arrangement as was approved by the Department last year. I would recommend that the Department approve payment of tuition fees at the rate of $35.00 per annum each based on attendance and in addition authorize an expenditure of $260.00 for a hot midday meal for each of the eight children. Although Mr. Garrard states that the meal would be supplied for four months only it is thought that this should be for five months as the $260 asked for is obviously based on the provision of meals to eight pupils at $6.50 per month per child for five months.\n\n- EW\nEncl.\n\nD.

It almost seems she must have extra help or supervised study in this subject if she is to complete the course successfully. Her low Social Studies grade is not now fault as she has not turned in her assigned essay in Mathematics and has shown considerable improvement for this report.\n\nPromoted to Grade VII conditional on success in Government Examination in Social Studies, General Science I, and Mathematics. Suggest Mr. Calumet place this down.\n\nSOCIAL STUDIES (V):\n\n| Work Habits | Achievement |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| V           | N           |\n\nGENERAL SCIENCE:\n\n| Work Habits | Achievement |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| V           | N           |\n\nMATHEMATICS (V):\n\n| Work Habits | Achievement |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| V           | N           |\n\nMUSIC (V):\n\n| Work Habits | Achievement |\n|-------------|-------------|\n|             |             |\n\nART (V):\n\n| Work Habits | Achievement |\n|-------------|-------------|\n|             |             |\n\nLIBRARY (V):\n\n1.

Garrard,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nWest Coast Agency - Tuition Grants\n\nFor the purpose of inclusion in our Annual Report, we are endeavouring to ascertain the number of Indian children who are attending Provincial or Private Schools. A search of our files reveals the information shown on the attached list.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would insert the age on September 1, 1948, of each of the children and their grade in school. We would also like to know if the five children attending Provincial High School, Alberni, B.C., are residing at Alberni Residential School. On file there are references to \"Alberni District High School\", \"Port Alberni High School\", Alberni S.D. No. 70, Port Alberni, B.C.\".

Arneil Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nBox 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Marjory Joseph - 17 yrs\nClayoquot Band\n\nThe a/n is the daughter of Mrs. Edward Joseph, widow of the Clayoquot Band and has expressed a desire to attend High School with a view to obtaining Junior Matriculation and then going into training for a nursing career.\n\nDue to the fact that the school term is two months old this office took the liberty of having this girl take an aptitude test with Mr. Caldwell and Mr. Dunn, the Principal of the Alberni District High School, and the results were very favourable. Mr. Dunn agreed to take Marjory as a Grade 9 pupil and she is now attending as such. It is hoped the Department will approve of our actions in this case.\n\nThe Fee for the Academic year is $50.00, rental of Books $3.50.\n\nMr. Caldwell has no space in the girls dormitory for Marjory regardless of which it was not considered advisable to place a Catholic in a Protestant School even as a boarder. Marjory was formerly a pupil at the Christie Residential School.\n\nPearl Clutesi, an aunt, of the Sheshahlt Band has offered to take Marjory for room and board at a minimum of $35.00 per month ($280.00 for the remainder of the year) as of November 1, 1949. As Pearl is already supporting a family of her own this is considered to be reasonable.

S. Arneil, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nRe: Application for tuition grants\nfor Indian Children attending White\nSchools\n\nIn the enclosed estimates I have listed the approximate number of\nchildren which may be attending the various white schools in this agency.\nSome of these schools I have on previous occasions endeavoured to have\nthe Indian children enroll, and this year I will be making additional\nefforts and hope to be more successful. Following are listed the\napproximate number of children which I hope will be attending white\nschools:\n\nALBERNI GILL SCHOOL: This school has not yet been constructed but\nit is hoped by September 1951, that the pupils now attending the\nIndian Day School may be admitted to this school and it is expected\nthat the tuition fees will be in the neighbourhood of $5.00 per month.\nThe number of pupils expected to attend will be approximately 50,\nmaking a total for the half year September 1950-April 1951-$1750.00.$1750.00\n\nALBERNI DISTRICT HIGH SCHOOL: It is anticipated 10 pupils will attend\nthis school in the 1950-51 year. The rate of this school will\npossibly be $75.00 per pupil per year making the total $750.00.\n\nBAMFIELD ERIC GODSON MEMORIAL SCHOOL: 6 pupils have been attending\nthis school and it is anticipated that a similar number will be\non the roll during 1950-51 year. This school has not sent in an\naccount for their children but I believe if this is done it will be\nat the rate of $5.00 per month for the 10 school months, totalling\n$300.00.\n\nESPERANZO PUBLIC SCHOOL: The attendance of this school varies greatly,\nwhen the cannery is operating a number of Indian Children from Ahoosat\ngo to Esperanza with their parents increasing the number in\nattendance but the average for this school will be approximately 6\npupils and it is anticipated that accounts for their tuition will\nbe submitted, the rate again here being $5.00 per month totalling\n$300.00; in addition at this school a mid-day meal is supplied at\n35\u00a2 per meal totalling $399.00. Transportation is also supplied\nhere at the rate of $1.00 per day, irrespective of how many are\ntransported, this would amount to $190.00.\n\nPORT RENFREW: There are 10 pupils of school age residing within 1\nmile of the white school at Port Renfrew. I have on two previous\noccasions unsuccessfully endeavoured to have these pupils admitted\nto this school, further efforts will be made this year and it is hoped\nwith better success. Fees for this school, it is anticipated will\nbe $5.00 per month a total of $500.00.\n\nN. W.

NOONAN\n\nRe: Voucher 1059 - West Coast Agency\n\nThe above Voucher was issued in favour of Mrs. Matthew Brown, General Delivery, Alberni, B.C., in an amount of $35.00.\n\nOur file shows that this Voucher was forwarded to your office on December 14. We have a telegram from the Indian Superintendent, Mr. Garrard stating that the cheque had not arrived.\n\nIf this cheque has not gone forward, it would be appreciated if you would forward at the earliest possible date.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n13 January, 1950.\n\nMr. N. W. Gerrard,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nPort Alberni, B. C.\n\nTuition Voucher Cheques\n\nThe reason for the delay in connection with the payment of your voucher No. 1059 was the necessity for transferring additional funds to this allotment.\n\nWe have had such a large number of tuition grant payments to make this year that our original funds were exhausted and a transfer was needed. As usual, this transfer took some time to arrange.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. ARNEIL\n13 January, 1950.\n\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nTuition Fees - Port Renfrew School\n\nReference your 16-11-1 (159) of January 10 -\n\nThe Department approves the attendance of nine children of the Pacheena Band at the Port Renfrew Elementary School.\n\nI note that a rate of $10.00 per month per pupil has been arranged. I would suggest that the Indian Superintendent keep in close contact with the attendance of these pupils. In fact I would like your comments on the suggestion that some type of report might be submitted on the attendance of such pupils, to your office. Then Inspector Davey can keep in touch with the average attendance of Indian children at these provincial schools.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1949      | Tuition fees for Indian children attending the white school at Fort Renfrew |        |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

This boy has shown a marked aptitude for woodworking, has been diligent and well-behaved and will, I am satisfied make very good use of such a reward.\n\nPupils Nos.0-171 Anastasia Wycott\n0-168 Agnes Sandy and\n0-165 Mary Margaret John are recommended for sewing machines. I have always found that ex-pupils who receive sewing machines continue to carry on the work taught them in the School, to great advantage, in making economical clothing for themselves and their families. The machines are always properly cared for and constitute their most prized possessions.\n\nWill you kindly inform me if these recommendations are approved and also if the Department issues any diplomas to such departing pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E.Taylor\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept.of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, September 15, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, regarding the request of the Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School that a set of carpenter tools be supplied for ex-pupil No. 171, Charley Thomas Johnson, and a sewing machine to each of ex-pupils Nos. 0171, Anastasia Wycott, 0165, Agnes Sandy and 0165, Mary Margaret John.\n\nRegarding the supplying of sewing machines to ex-pupils, I have to say that these are usually only supplied to girls upon the occasion of their marriage and when they take up housekeeping in their own homes. Please state whether these girls live at home with their parents or with whom they reside, and the reserve on which they are located. Do these girls intend to be married in the near future? Our funds this year are extremely limited, and until we are assured that proper care would be taken of the machines and that they would not be used indiscriminately by other parties, we would not be prepared to supply same.\n\nRegarding the set of carpenter tools for Charley Johnson, you might also state whether this boy would make good use of the tools, and the approximate cost of same, also where he resides.\n\nWhen we have this information, consideration will be given as to whether funds can be provided this year or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nH. E. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWilliams Lake, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have acknowledged receipt of your letter of Sept. 15th last relative to the supplying of sewing machines to ex-pupils of the Caribee Indian Residential School, and a set of carpenter tools to ex-pupil No. 171 Charley Thomas Johnson.\n\nIn regard to the last named, this boy lives on the Alkali Lake Indian Reserve and his father is handyman on the adjoining ranch of Mr. Wyman Johnson, having worked there for many years. The boy will be working with his father and will have ample opportunity to use his most decided aptitude for carpentering work. He made great progress in such work whilst at school. The large church erected by the Alkali Lake Band three years ago, and their improved dwellings show that some of this band have availed their carpentering knowledge to material advantage, and a set of carpentering tools costing approximately $35.00 would, I am satisfied, encourage this ex-pupil to carry on the training he has already received.\n\nRegarding the request for sewing machines for the three girl ex-pupils, these are not yet married and it is not known if they contemplate matrimony in the near future. The Reverend Principal recommends that the matter of supplying them with sewing machines be left in abeyance for the present and he recommends that machines be supplied to ex-pupils No. 132 of Williams Lake Indian Band and No. 209 Ellen Jeane of the Canoe Creek Band. These two girls were discharged last year and are now both married. They were excellent pupils whilst at school and received no reward. It would appear advisable to give sewing machines upon the Principal's recommendation when ex-pupils are married and established in homes, instead of supplying them at discharge. The names of those recommended upon discharge this year will be kept on record and applications made upon their behalf at a later date upon marriage, if their circumstances warrant their receiving sewing machines.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. W. Taylor\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, October 15, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, regarding the supplying of a set of carpentering tools for ex-pupil No. 171, Charlie Thomas Johnson, and sewing machines for two girl ex-pupils, Nos. 0209 and 0152, and stating the present circumstances in the case of each.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase, from a firm on the list to receive consideration, of a set of carpentering tools at a cost not to exceed approximately $35, and have them delivered to Charlie Thomas Johnson. Please forward an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost. This you should attach to a proper voucher form, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nRegarding the request for sewing machines for the two girls referred to above, I regret that, as our funds this year for assistance to ex-pupils have been considerably reduced, we will be unable to provide the expenditure required in applying each with a sewing machine. You might draw the attention of the Department to their case next year, when, if funds are available, consideration would be given to supplying each with a machine.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. E.

Please let me know when this sewing machine was supplied and any other information that you may have regarding it.\n\nWhen replying, her letter should be returned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEnc. 1.\n\nH. R. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWilliams Lake, B. C.\nDear Sir,\n\nI left school in 1928 September. I know they wrote down to you for me a sewing machine and you send a new, but instead of that one they gave an old one. I can not do anything with it; it is standing in my house ever since I could not sew with it, but if they want it they can take it back. I don't want the Indian Department to tell me a lie that they gave me one.\n\nI send it back to the mission twice now to be fixed but they send it back in the same way.\nThat make of the machine is a White.\n\nI told Mr. H. E. Taylor about but he told me the last time it up to you and the priest. So I wrote to Father Rohr about right a way but he never answered my letter last year.\n\nThat was in Father Rohr's time and Mr. H. E. Taylor.\n\nWhen I was in school my name was Roey Thomas Archie and now I am married.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nMrs. Edward John.\nDear Sir;\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th inst. enclosing letter received from Mrs Edward John of the Canim Lake Indian Band.\n\nThis girl was a pupil in the Cariboo Indian Residential School, and left in 1928. At that time the School principal used to ask the Department to supply sewing machines as rewards to leaving pupils, and the machines were shipped direct to the School. Of late years I have had any such machines shipped to me and they are given direct to the pupils.\n\nI consulted Rev. Father Rohr today about this matter and he stated as follows: Rosie Archie, now Mrs Edward John, gave some trouble when in school and it was not thought that she deserved a new sewing machine. Father Rohr was School Principal at the time, and the Sister Superior advised me that the girl had been given the machine which she had worked with in her last year at school. The machine was in good working order. A year or two later Rosie Archie complained that the machine was no good, but it was thought that she had broken it. However they had it repaired for her and put into working order. Last year the girl wrote to Father Rohr and he referred the matter to the present School principal, who advises me that he asked the travelling Singer Machine representative to call in at the Reserve and fix the machine if necessary. The Principal does not know if this was done.\n\nI recall some four or five years ago that when visiting the Canim Lake reserve, Rosie Archie asked me to get her some needles for the machine, which I did. This would show that it was then in use, and at that time she made no complaint to me.\n\nI think it probable that this girl resented being given a second-hand machine when she saw some of the other pupils receiving new ones. In other matters I have found her very prone to complain.\n\nI am returning the letter herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E. Taylor\nIndian Agent\n\nR.A.

You know her well. Whilst at school she was a very industrious and well behaved girl and always gave great satisfaction to her teachers. Since she left us she was a real model to the other Indian women of the Alkali village. Therefore I think it worth while recommending her to you and I would be very obliged if you would forward her request for a sewing machine to the Indian Department.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nVictor Rohr, C.M.I.\nDear Sir;-\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter received from Rev. V. Rohr former principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School, asking for a sewing machine to ex-pupil No. 0157 Lilly Johnson of the Alkali Lake Indian Band.\n\nThis girl was a very good pupil and married an Alkali Lake Indian in June 1936.\n\nIf any funds are available I would recommend that her request for a sewing machine be favourably considered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E. Taylor\nIndian Agent\n\nEncl.\n\nMajor D.M.

Please let me know if her husband and herself are living in their own home and, also, if the husband is making an effort to support his wife. On receipt of your reply, the request will receive further consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nH.H.

I refer, of course, to those graduates who have made proper use of their Vocational Training while in School and are recommended by their Principals for the Department's favourable consideration in this matter.\n\nI would, therefore, recommend that a Singer sewing machine be given to each of the following ex-pupils of the Cariboo Indian Residential School:-\n\nMrs. Walter Gaspard, Canoe Creek\n\" Pat. Chalchel, Alkali Lake.\n\" Felix Stump, Anaham.\n\nI believe that, should the Department decide to provide properly-qualified ex-pupils with such sewing machines, and to those boys who have done well in Manual Training while at School with a small kit of tools and possibly enough lumber to build a simple house, a great impetus would be given to Vocational and Manual Training in our Residential Schools.\n\nIf you and the Director of Welfare and Training agree with me in this matter, I would request that Indian Agents and the Principals of the various Indian Residential Schools be informed of the Department's policy. To encourage the children at present in the Indian Residential Schools, it would, of course, be necessary for the Principals concerned to inform the pupils of the Department's policy.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools for B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6489, file 42160-7, part 2)\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose copy of a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Taylor, dated March 31st, 1938, with reference to sewing machines being supplied to certain ex-pupils of Cariboo Indian Residential School.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to advise that I have received a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Christie endorsing the following recommendation made by the Reverend Father Murphy, O.M.I., ex principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School, for awards to outstanding pupils of the 1942 graduation class, just prior to his departure from the school for a charge in Eastern Canada.\n\n\"That No. 0276 Phyllis Sellars as the best and most efficient girl student of her class and No. 276 Walter Allan Paul as the best and most efficient boy and that the most useful articles the Department could supply these ex-pupils would be a sewing machine for the girl and a set of carpenters' tools for the boy.\"\n\nMr. Christie advises that Walter Allan Paul is exceptionally handy as a carpenter and it may be possible to work him in at the construction of the new Air Base at Dog Creek.\n\nI should appreciate being advised if funds are available for this purpose.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 1, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Phyllis Sellars and Walter Allan Paul\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 27th ultimo, in which you state that you have received a recommendation from the Rev. Father Murphy, Principal of the Cariboo School, that assistance be granted to the above-noted pupils.\n\nYou are authorized to purchase, from firms on the approved list, one sewing machine for Phyllis Sellars and a set of carpenter's tools for Walter Allan Paul.\n\nI feel it is only fair to point out that it may not be possible for the Department to make these purchases at any time in the future. We have recently been informed by the Purchasing Agent that it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure supplies, particularly metal supplies. It might be well, therefore, for us to have an understanding with the Principals of these schools that such assistance would not be recommended by them during the war period.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Coal for Bella Bella Indian Day School\n\nDuring the past two years the following difficulties have been encountered in getting the coal fuel delivered to the above named School:\n\n1. Shortage of labour to handle coal in September and October, the Indians not being back from the Canneries.\n\n2. Shortage of coal in September and October and the inability of Evans, Coleman & Evans to supply the order before January.\n\n3. Due to (2) above, extreme difficulty in getting the empty sacks back for credit and consequent delay in getting accounts vouchered before close of the fiscal year.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties it is recommended that the coal for the 1946-47 year be put in in May which should be (1) the slack season for delivery (2) the month when we are sure of Indian labour.\n\nMay the following order be placed as soon as funds are available:\n\nFifteen (15) tons, Nanaimo-Wellington coal in 100 lb. sacks, to be delivered by first available steamer after receipt of order to Indian Day School, Hospital Dock, Campbell Island, B.C. freight prepaid. Invoices in triplicate to be mailed together with prepaid freight vouchers to Indian Agent, Dept. Mines & Resources, Bella Coola, B. C.\n\nIt costs $2.75 a ton for delivery from wharf to coal cellar, the emptying and return of sacks ready for shipment and the moving back of coal to get entire shipment inside. A sum of $41.25 will be required for this purpose and authority to incur this expenditure is requested.\n\n(over)\nIf sanctioned, an accountable cheque to cover these costs will be required.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letter of April 6th in connection with coal required for the Bella Bella Indian Day School. The fifteen tons required are available from Evans, Coleman and Evans, Ltd., at a cost of $13.05 per ton F.O.B. dock Vancouver.\n\nIt is recommended that authority be granted to place the order and that an accountable advance of $41.25 be forwarded to Mr. Anfield to cover the costs of delivering the coal from the wharf to the school.\n\nFor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, April 25, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant, the Department approves the purchase of 15 tons of coal, at the price mentioned in your letter, for the Bella Bella Indian Day School.\n\nAn accountable cheque for $41.25 will be forwarded to Agent Anfield.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nBella Coola, B.C.,\nMarch 14th, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIn connection with the attached credit vouchers for school fuel and in particular the credit item of $45.00, the following explanation is made.\n\nIn August 1945 the Department secured the rental of a teacher's cottage. I bought the five cords of wood on hand from Day School fuel account intending to move it to the second classroom. When the teacher, Miss Wright arrived, she asked that the wood be left and that if the Department would not supply it to her, she would buy it from the Agency.\n\nAfter correspondence with the Commissioner it was decided that the teacher should buy her own fuel and the sum of $45.00 was refunded by Miss Wright and credited to the Agency Day School fuel account.\n\nF.

M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nYour File: 2-11-2\n\nWith reference to your letter of October 23rd, regarding fuel oil requirements for heating the Mission House at Klemtu, a supply of 15 drums will be adequate for the ten month teaching term.\n\nObtainable at Klemtu, the fuel oil costs $6.75 per drum of 45 gallons. Total cost for the term would be $101.25.\n\nEnclosed herewith is voucher covering amount already purchased by Mr. Wiensz.\n\nJ. A. Findlay,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6490, file 42162-2, part 4)\nBella Coola, B. C.\nOctober 12th, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nIt is understood that Mrs. J. P. Wiensz,\nteacher at the Indian Day School, Klemtu, is to\nreceive a monthly salary of $85.00 plus bonus.\n\nAn account for fuel oil used in the mission\nhouse has been submitted. Will you kindly advise\nif this is to be charged to the Department or\nreturned to Mrs. Wiensz for personal payment.\n\nJ. A. Findlay,\nacting Indian Agent.\n\nJAF/D\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Acting Agent Findlay's letters of October 12th and November 2nd together with Bella Coola Agency voucher No. 258, in the amount of $7.05 covering the purchase of fuel oil for use in the Mission house at Klemtu, which is presently occupied by the teacher of the Indian Day School, Mrs. J.P. Wiensz.\n\nMrs. Wiensz is being allowed a monthly salary of $95.00 plus bonus and is occupying the Mission House at Klemtu without cost to the department. Her salary rate is comparable with the salaries being paid teachers with similar qualifications and for whom the department provides heated accommodation, and to bring her salary more into line it is considered that the department, in this case, should provide the necessary fuel oil for heating the Mission House while it is occupied by Mrs. Wiensz.\n\nThe cost of fuel oil for the term would be approximately $100.00. I would recommend that the attached voucher be approved for payment and that authority be granted for the submission of further fuel oil accounts, not exceeding $100.00 in all.\n\nD. M.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant regarding oil for the teacher's residence at the Klemtu School, voucher 283 will be paid.\n\nAuthority is granted for the submission of further fuel oil accounts not exceeding $100.00 in all.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B. C.\n\nUpon inspection of Indian Day Schools at Bella Coola, I find that the wood supply will not last beyond the end of the calendar year.\n\nEleven and one-half cords of furnace wood were delivered to the schools last March. Ostensibly this was for the current school year but I have been informed that because of extreme weather last spring, this supply was already in use by April.\n\nDue to this and also to the fact that a second (separate) school room is now in use, the eleven and one-half cords were certainly not adequate for both schools. I estimate that eight cords furnace wood will be necessary for both rooms to complete the school year.\n\n8 cords furnace wood @ $8.00 = $64.00\nSplitting and piling = $12.00\n\n$76.00\n\nApplication is made herewith for an accountable cheque to cover costs of above fuel requirements.\n\nJ. A. Findlay,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nJAF/D\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am enclosing Mr. Acting Agent Findlay's letter of November 20th in connection with additional fuel requirements at the Bella Coola Indian Day School.\n\nIt will be noted that the fuel supply will not last beyond the end of the current calendar year in view of which it is recommended that an accountable advance of $75.00 be forwarded to Mr. Findlay for the purchase of eight cords of wood and for splitting and piling same.\n\n[Signature]\nD.

C.,\nNovember 5th, 1947\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., Vancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Fuel for teacherage,\nBella Coola Indian Day School\n\nThe teachers of the above named school have applied to me for fuel, since they state advertisements have appeared in the press from time to time advertising positions in Indian Day schools in this province and stating remuneration at rates equal to those being paid here and including quarters, fuel and light.\n\nMrs. Snodgrass lives in the building which is rented by the department and her annual requirements would be about five cords of twelve inch wood at $12.00 per cord delivered; plus one ton of coal approximately $25.00 delivered, or a total of around $85.00 per year.\n\nMiss Wright has built her own house but has asked for help with fuel. She burns oil and uses sixteen barrels per year. In view of having her own establishment Miss Wright has asked that consideration be given to supplying one half of her fuel or eight barrels, (360 gallons) at around twenty cents per gallon including drayage or $72.00 total.\n\nThe total involved would therefore be about $157.00 per year. No item for this expenditure appears in the 1947-48 Estimates, neither did I make provision to that extent in the 1948-49 Estimates although the teacherage was included in the heading to the column setting forth school fuel requirements. I had anticipated that Mrs. Snodgrass might apply for aid in fuel for the teacherage building and I had included the item of four cords of twelve inch wood with this in view.\n\n(over)\nIt now appears that my estimate was inadequate even for the teacherage alone. I had not made enquiries since I did not wish to raise the point until a policy had been settled. No provision in the estimates were made for fuel allowance for Miss Wright.\n\nMay I have your decision on this matter and authority for expenditure if approved.\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.F. Pruden,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Fuel for teacherage - Bella Coola\nIndian Day School\n\nWith reference to Mr. Indian Agent Pruden's letter of November 5th attached hereto, our files do not indicate that the Department has been previously called upon to provide fuel for teacherages at the Bella Coola school, but as we supply fuel for teacherages elsewhere it is felt that we should be consistent. Under the circumstances it is recommended that an expenditure of $157.00 be approved for the purchase of fuel for the buildings occupied by Mrs. Snodgrass and Miss Wright.\n\nD. M.

Robinson, Esq.\nteacher Kitamaat Indian Day School\n\nWhile I was at Kitamaat recently Mr. Robinson took up with me the matter of fuel, to which he believes he is entitled in addition to salary. He has two oil burning stoves in the Mission house where he lives. He states his annual requirements are twenty drums of 900 gallons at approximately twenty cents per gallon delivered or $180.00.\n\nMay I have your authority to supply Mr. Robinson with fuel as indicated.\n\nW. P. Fruden,\nIndian agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Fuel - Kitamaat School Teacherage\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Pruden's letter of October 31st wherein he recommends that the Department provide fuel oil for the Kitamaat Mission House occupied by Mr. G.W. Robinson, teacher, at a cost of $180.00 per annum.\n\nA review of our records with respect to fuel purchases authorized for the Kitamaat School teacherage and Mission House indicate that fuel costs for the year including fuel oil above-mentioned, amount to in excess of $600.00 which is considered to be exorbitant.\n\nI am writing to Mr. Indian Agent Pruden for an explanation of the apparently unreasonable fuel consumption at this school, but in view of the concessions made to other teachers elsewhere with respect to the supply of fuel there would appear to be no alternative in this case but to recommend that $180.00 for the purchase of fuel oil be approved.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, November 22nd, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant, file 2-11-1, the Department will allow an amount of $180. towards the cost of the fuel oil used in the residence occupied by Mr. G.W. Robinson, teacher of the Kitamaat School.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nBella Coola, B. C.,  \nDecember 4th, 1947\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Coal - Bella Bella Day School\n\nYour 2-11-1 of October 2nd did not arrive here in time for me to get a message to Mr. R. Carpenter who had offered to move our coal free of charge on his seine boat if it arrived before he left for the southern seining ground. He had already gone and has been away ever since, being engaged in herring seining now. The coal arrived and was unloaded at B. C. Packers wharf across the channel from the village. Martin's wharf which is in poor condition would not carry the load. However costs would have been about the same from Martin's.\n\nAs there were only gillnet boats available I made arrangements with a local native to move it. This meant carrying it down the ramp at B. C. Packers, stowing what he could in his boat, crossing to the reserve, wading ashore and wheeling the coal by wheel barrow to the school. He asked fifty cents a sack which I considered reasonable.\n\nSomehow I had gathered from your 2-11-1 of October 20th that only five tons would be sent until the Hospital wharf was completed. On re-reading it now I realize that you had probably not intended that meaning. In any case on my last visit to Bella Bella on the evening of November 20th, I was told that two large shipments of coal had arrived since the first one. We were unable to count the sacks in the dark but I assumed our whole order had arrived and was occupying considerable space on the B. C. Packers wharf. I therefore made arrangements with the same native to continue his former arrangement for the whole lot. Miss Broeker will count the sacks as they arrive at the school.\n\n(over)\nMy request for funds (8-11-7 of August 2nd) assumed labor only from the Hospital wharf, at twenty-cents per sack. I will therefore require an additional thirty cents per sack or $90.00 for transporting the coal from B.C. Packers wharf to the school house.\n\nMay accountable cheque be issued for $90.00 to cover this item of expense.\n\nWPP/D\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6490, file 42162-2, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour File 45-162 (WT 1)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of August 18th approving the purchase of coal required for schools in the Bella Coola Agency and Mr. Indian Agent Pruden's submission of August 2nd wherein he estimated the cost of transporting coal for the Bella Bella School from the dock at Bella Bella at 20\u00a2 per sack, I am enclosing Mr. Pruden's letter of December 4th from which you will note that an additional $90.00 will be required to cover the cost of transporting the coal from the B.C. Packers wharf to the school house. It is recommended that a further accountable advance of $90.00 be forwarded to the Agent.\n\nD. M.

Also used from the $259.00 intended for the Bella Coola School was $19.90 paid for one ton of coal for use at Bella Coola Day School teacherage, see Evans Coleman Evans account paid January 20th, 1948.\n\nWood for Klemtu school was supplied but cost $24.00 instead of $25.00 as estimated.\n\nOnly 1 2/3 cords were supplied for Bella Bella school at a cost of $19.33. No one was found who would cut the balance.\n\nIt was found impossible to get the wood supply for Kitamaat cut. Coal had to be rushed in on two occasions to keep the school open when promised wood was not forthcoming. The funds returned have left the fuel supplies at the schools low and requirements for the 1948-49 year will be somewhat higher than estimated.\n\nP.

The shipment of oil received in January was of very poor quality. Mr. Robinson found that it could not be used in his cook stove and the oil burner was removed and grates replaced in order to burn other fuel. He bought and paid for a half ton of coal himself.\n\nWhen I visited Kitamaat he took this up with me and asked whether he would thus be allowed to change from oil to coal.

There was widespread complaint that prices were far too low and great difficulty was experienced in getting any wood cut, except at Bella Coola where Indians from the interior were glad of this work during their annual visit to the coast and where motor transport is available.\n\nOnly a mild winter saved the schools at Bella Bella, Klemtu and Kitamaat from serious privation. At the latter point where a wood furnace is installed, only seven cords were finally delivered in March after being on order from the previous May. The balance of the wood was not delivered and this resulted in having to order in small quantities of coal from Butedale cannery at heavy transportation costs to cover emergencies. In addition, observation has shown me that for a severe winter fuel requirements in wood as set up last year would be inadequate. I have therefore increased the amounts substantially and raised the price. With the location of this school necessitating heavy freight costs, I believe every effort should be made to use as much wood as possible and I have decided to try for one more year to put in an adequate wood supply before changing over to coal.\n\nIn the case of Bella Bella the amount of kindling remains the same but the unit price has been advanced. Wood at this point comes from drift logs which often must be towed considerable distances, cut on the beach and then transported by wheel barrow one half mile up hill or more to the school house. Conditions at Klemtu are about the same as at Bella Bella. The amount has been increased to partly replace the oil which was formerly burned in the teacherage.\n\nAt Bella Coola, quantities for the schools remain the same with prices increased for cedar as I found the Indians who cut the wood did not do well last year as cedar is not readily accessible. An item of increase over last years requirements is represented by the five cords for the teacherage which is now being supplied.\n\nMay accountable advance of $929.00 be supplied to enable the placing of wood orders at an early date.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6490, file 42162-2, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nBella Coola, B.C.\nApril 22nd, 1948\n\nDept.

S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner for B. C., Vancouver, B. C.\n\nRegarding fire wood requirements for schools of this Agency for the fiscal year 1949-50, owing to the work habits of the people of this agency, it has proved impossible to obtain wood cutters from about mid April each year when activity in fishing commences. There are few men in the villages until about mid November when trapping commences and time must be taken to prepare their own families for winter. Although it may sometimes be possible to have a little wood cut any time from November on during the winter, it has been found that the only time this work is sought by the natives is from about March 1st until mid April and then only on the understanding of fairly prompt settlement. The fiscal policy of returning all funds to Ottawa during March makes it impossible to take advantage of the one time in the year when there are men more or less willing to cut wood. Funds drawn during the new fiscal year usually do not arrive until about June. By which time the villages are empty of people.\n\nWould it be possible to have the funds for 1949-50 school wood requirements sent down now when an effort will be made to get as much of the wood in as possible during the winter. It will probably not be possible to expend the whole amount until late in April. Could permission be obtained to hold these funds over into the 1949-50 fiscal year so that prompt payment may be made for wood cut in April?\n\nFollowing are the requirements of wood for use in 1949-50 fiscal year.\n\nBella Bella, present school and teacherage\n\n3 cords cedar kindling @ $15.00  $45.00\n\nnew school and teacherage\n\n3 cords cedar kindling @ $15.00  $45.00  $90.00\nCarried forward $90.00\n\n**Bella Coola school and teacherage**\n\n16 cords 24\" cord wood @ $12.00 $192.00\n4 \" 12\" \" \" @ $15.00 48.00\n3 \" 16\" cedar kindling @ $15.00 45.00\nSplitting and piling after wood is dry 50.00\n\n$335.00\n\n**Klemu school and teacherage**\n\n4 cords 16\" stove wood @ $15.00 60.00\n\n**Kitamaat school and teacherage**\n\n24 cords 24\" furnace wood @ $12.00 288.00\n2 \" 16\" kindling @ $15.00 30.00\n6 \" 12\" stove wood @ $15.00 90.00\nSplitting and piling after wood is dry 40.00\n\nTotal $933.00\n\nMay accountable advance of $933.00 be supplied with permission to carry a balance of these funds over into the 1949-50 fiscal year since that is the year for which the fuel is required.\n\nW.P.

Pruden's letter of Nov. 15th attached, while it is understood that funds will not be available from the 1949-50 appropriation until after April 1st, it has occurred to me that the Department may have funds available from the current year's appropriation which might be used for the purchase of wood fuel. If so and in view of the circumstances outlined by Mr. Pruden I would recommend that an accountable advance up to $933 be forwarded to him on the definite understanding that the advance would be accounted for prior to April 1st.\n\nW.S.

Ameil, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Kitamaat Day School fuel\n\nI have a letter from Dr. Tennant stating that the Field Nurse has left Kitamaat and left five tons of coal on the wharf there. Dr. Tennant suggests that this coal be taken over for the school. I am writing to Mr. Robinson asking that someone trust me enough to move this coal to the school while a method of paying for the carrying is worked out. I do not know what progress has been made with woodcutting at Kitamaat but if all of the wood on order has been cut, then I have no funds to pay for the carrying of this coal. Fifty dollars will be required.\n\nI have accounts here covering this coal shipment which are being put in order to be vouchered to Dr. Tennant. They are as follows:\n\n| Item                  | Amount |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| 100 sacks coal        | $104.00|\n| Freight to Butedale   | $40.50 |\n\nI have already vouchered an account to Dr. Tennant for $40.00 freight from Butedale to Kitamaat which he may ask you to take over. Total funds to $234.50 will be required then if this shipment is taken over from Dr. Tennant. I have suggested to him that his department might assume about fifty percent of the cost to compensate for fuel used from the school fuel stock up until January 31st when the nurse left.\n\nI trust a satisfactory settlement of this account can be worked out between yourself and Dr. Tennant and I shall hold the accounts until I have your instructions. My most urgent need in this connection is for $50.00 to pay the coal carrier at Kitamaat.\n\nF. P.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have today received a communication from Mr. Anfield, Indian Agent, Bella Coola, within which was enclosed a copy of his letter of May 16th re Gordon Robinson of Kitimat, which was addressed to you.\n\nI should like to state that I was unable to visit Kitimat at the time that Mr. Anfield and I made our original plans to go in to the village, and I have therefore, not seen Robinson. However, I feel that the plan proposed by Mr. Anfield is of such merit that I am going to make every effort to visit Robinson before the end of June.\n\nI may say that I would quite readily endorse the principle suggested in Mr. Anfield's letter to you. The idea of having a married couple, adequately trained, act as leaders in a village has been discussed by Mr. Gillett and myself on many occasions. The plan has been successful in remote and also in backward areas, as well as in more progressive areas.\n\nI have suggested to Mr. Anfield that I think it would be a good plan to postpone formal action on this matter until I have an opportunity of speaking to Mr. Lord, principal of the Normal School, and Dr. Willis, Superintendent of Education. I expect that I shall be able to see these men late in June and I shall communicate with you again after that time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nB. Thorsteinsson\n\nBT/S Inspector of Schools.\nThis is to certify that Gordon Robinson has passed the Grade X examinations with the following record.\n\n| Subject     | Marks |\n|-------------|-------|\n| Literature  | 55    |\n| Composition | 69    |\n| Algebra     | 69    |\n| Geometry    | 62    |\n| Health      | 80    |\n| History     | 79    |\n| Geography   | 67    |\n| French      | 59    |\n| Chemistry   | 68    |\n\nTOTAL 608\n\nAverage 67.5\n\n\"A.

Willis\"\n\nSJW/LW Superintendent of Education.\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\nOFFICE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT\nVICTORIA, B.C.\n\nJune 2nd, 1945.\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo with copies of correspondence from F. Earl Anfield, The Indian Agent at Bella Coola and a letter from B. Thorsteinsson, Inspector of Schools, to yourself attached.\n\nThere would be no difficulty in arranging for the attendance of Mr. Gordon Robinson at one of our Normal Schools if he had higher academic qualifications. We have never admitted to a Normal School a candidate with Grade X standing only. I shall, however, discuss the matter with Mr. Lord, Principal of the Normal School, Vancouver, to see if he would be willing to treat Mr. Robinson's application as a special case.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"S. J. Willis\"\n\nSJW/DS Superintendent of Education\nF. E. Anfield, Esq., Indian Agent, Bella Coola, B.C.\n\nAcknowledging receipt of your letter of the 16th instant with reference to the proposal that we apply to have Gordon Robinson of Kitamaat admitted to Normal School, I would advise that as he has only passed Grade X in an Indian Residential School it would not appear that he would have the necessary educational standard to permit the Department of Education to accede to the request, notwithstanding Inspector Thorsteinsson's endorsement. It is unfortunate that this young man did not take advantage of the Provincial Correspondence Courses to bring his standard up to at least Junior Matriculation, which would then, of course, clear the way for his admission. However, the matter has been submitted to the Superintendent of Education for consideration.\n\nI am extremely anxious that we take no action or suggest that such action be taken to lower the standards of qualifications of persons teaching in Indian schools. I personally feel that we require even higher standards than would a Provincial rural school. However, you will be advised further in the matter in due course.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMay 30, 1945.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letter of the 16th instant, together with Inspector Thorsteinsson's letter of the 23rd instant with reference to securing permission for Gordon Robinson, an Indian of the Kitamaat Band, to attend the next Normal School course. This man, who is 27 years of age, married with two young children, is employed by us as the second teacher at the Kitamaat Indian Day School and according to reports has given very good service. From this correspondence it would appear that he has only completed Grade X at the Indian Residential School formerly at Sardis, B.C., and has apparently not taken correspondence work with a view to improving his standing.\n\nYour views in the matter would be appreciated in due course after you have heard further from Mr. Thorsteinsson.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Superintendent of Education,\nParliament Buildings,\nVictoria, B.C.\nBalla Coola, B.C.\nMay 16, 1945.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\nRe: Gordon Robinson, Teacher, Kitamaat Indian Day School\n\nThe above named Indian was appointed teacher pro tem in December 1944 at the Kitamaat Indian Day School. He is twenty-seven years of age, married with two young children.\n\nHe has done exceptionally well and has the makings of a real teacher. He enjoys good health as does his wife and both are athletically inclined. They have good standing as Indians and are highly respected among their people.\n\nGordon Robinson has expressed the wish to go to Normal School this winter and train as a teacher. I believe he would make a success of such a course if arrangements can be made to admit him as a special student training for Indian school work only.\n\nHe is a first class athlete and has a fine collection of trophies in his home from school sports whilst at Coqualeetza. I would like to see him combine his course at Normal with a course in Pro-Rec training so that when he returned to his village he could put this Pro-Rec programme into the lives of his people. If it were possible for his wife to go to Vancouver or Victoria as well, she could have the women's course in Pro-Rec as well and thus have a Pro-Rec team for both sexes in Kitamaat.\n\nIn Kitamaat morale is low, due in large measure to lack of trained leadership. The Church has had no missionary with a youth viewpoint for some years and it is my firm conviction that in Robinson and his wife, we have the possibility of social reconstruction for this very isolated village.\n\nEducationally this young man has completed Grade X and it will be necessary to secure special permission to admit him as a Normal student. I attach a copy of his Grade X marks.\n\nIf the Normal School will take him, it will be necessary for him to obtain financial assistance in the form a grant as an ex-pupil of a Residential School to meet the expenses of a year in Normal. A condition of any such grant should be an agreement by Robinson to teach at Kitamaat Day School for a stated period of years, say three at least. I would estimate that a grant of $600.00 would be required for the ten months course and I consider it would be money well spent in every way.\nThe third and perhaps most difficult problem would be the securing of living quarters in either Vancouver or Victoria, depending on which Normal School he would be allocated to attend. I believe wholeheartedly that in this matter, the United Church through Rev. W.P. Bunt, would give very real assistance indeed.\n\nTo sum up: (1) Gordon Robinson wishes to train as a teacher. (2) He has in my opinion, the makings of a very good teacher and he should be encouraged and assisted to secure training. (3) A trained male Indian teacher (especially a married one with family) with added Pro-Rec training is the real need for Kitamaat Indian Village and he would be worth more to the village, the Church and the Department, than most of the white female teachers we have had in the past few years. (4) I am convinced that the Indians will never solve their problems (nor will we for them) until they can produce their own leaders, teachers, nurses, etc. In Robinson we have material on which to start such a programme as far as this Agency is concerned.\n\nIt is therefore recommended, if you approve of the plan in principle, that (a) a conference be held with the Principal of the Normal School and Rev. W. P. Bunt to decide whether or not this young man would be accepted in Normal School and on what terms; (I would recommend that no certificate be requested for him until by subsequent summer school courses he has earned them) and whether he and his family could be housed in Vancouver or Victoria. (b) If these matters can be settled satisfactorily, that the Department be requested to make a direct grant of at least $600.00 towards his tuition and expenses (c) if at all possible, it is urged that Mr. Jerry Mathison, Prov. Director of Pro-Rec be included in the conference suggested above.\n\nFor years the Indians have been pleading for a chance to have their young people given opportunities of leadership of this kind. The one obstacle has always been lack of suitably educated personnel to take such training. I think we have a suitable man in Gordon Robinson and I wholeheartedly recommend that the entire situation be surveyed with a sympathetic determination to try and give him an opportunity to receive a Normal and Pro-Rec training, which I firmly believe he has the ability and character to absorb and put to use for his people.\n\nF.E. Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\n\nP.S. Mrs. Evans, the present teacher at Kitsmaat endorses the plan for Gordon and has promised to carry on next year at this School. By that time Gordon should be ready to take over the School.\n\nCopy for Inspector B. Thorsteinsson.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith a file of correspondence between this office, the Bella Coola Agency and the Department of Education with reference to the proposal of Mr. Indian Agent Anfield for admission of Gordon Robinson, an Indian of the Kitimat Band, at present the junior teacher at the school on that Reserve, to Normal School training, requesting Departmental assistance of $600.00 in order that he may returned to the Reserve and take charge of the Kitimat Indian Day School. It will be noted that he is strongly recommended for this course by the Indian Agent and the School Inspector of the locality and that the Department of Education have approved of his entry to Normal School notwithstanding his lack of academic qualification.\n\nUnder the circumstances I would recommend consideration of the application by Department on the basis of an outright non-repayable grant of $300.00 and a repayable grant of a further $300.00, repayment to be spread over three years and recovered from his teacher's salary at the rate of $10.00 a month for the ten school months of each academic year. Further that he be required to undertake to teach at Kitimaat or some other day school for the three year period covered by the loan, subject to the right of the Department to dispense with his services in the usual way.\n\nYou will note from my letter of the 30th ultimo to Indian Agent Anfield that I was not entirely satisfied with the young man's academic standing and his failure to attempt to qualify for Junior Matriculation by correspondence course. I have, however, in mind the unwarranted\ncriticism that has been leveled at the Department for alleged failure to provide advanced education for worthy Indians.\n\nPlease airmail your reply as the Normal School opens on September 10th and due to the inaccessibility of Kitimaat mail service to that point is uncertain.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, June 26, 1945.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for BC.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, enclosing correspondence with reference to the proposal of Indian Agent Anfield to assist Gordon Robinson, of the Kitamaat Band, to attend Normal School during the academic year 1945-46.\n\nI have discussed your letter with Mr. Hoey this afternoon and we are inclined to feel that the amount of $600.00 is excessive. Possibly, in asking for this amount, Robinson is endeavouring to obtain funds for the maintenance of his family while he is absent at the Normal School. There is the further consideration that there is no guarantee that he will be successful in taking the course that is proposed. We do not view with any favour the suggestion that part of the grant be made refundable.\n\nHowever, in spite of the above, we have no desire to hinder this man from attending normal school if our assistance is sufficient. Evidently Indian Agent Anfield believes that he will take full advantage of the course, but, if he starts, I definitely feel that monthly reports regarding his progress should be obtained from the Principal of the Normal School, in order that we may be assured that he is studying. In the event of his taking the course, we are prepared to allow an outright grant of $500.00 for the academic year 1945-46. If he accepts this offer, it should be further provided that\nhe would undertake to teach the Kitamaat or some other day school for two years following his successful completion of the course, subject, of course, to the right of the Department to dispense with his services, if we so desired.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of June 26th regarding a tuition grant for Gordon Robinson, Kiltamasat Band, to enable him to attend Normal School during the 1945-46 academic year, Mr. Indian Agent Anfield has requested that an accountable cheque for $500.00 be forwarded to him in favour of the Bella Coola Agency Trust Account for this purpose.\n\nIt is recommended that the cheque be forwarded as requested, it being understood that the funds will be paid to Gordon Robinson at the rate of $50.00 per month by Mr. Anfield.\n\nFor D.M.

Normal School\n\nThe following has been received as a report in connection with the above named Indian taking special training at the Prov. Normal School in Vancouver.\n\n\"You wrote me some time ago concerning Gordon Robinson and I promised to let you know how he progressed in his Practicum.\n\nAll the members of this staff who saw him teach were pleased with the qualities he displayed. The teacher to whom he was assigned was the principal of the school. He reports as follows:\n\n\"Mr. Robinson showed neat appearance. Good voice and energy. Usually interesting introduction. Good preparation. Naturally enough showed lack of background and scholarship. Satisfactory discipline and leadership. Should do well with more experience and widest reading.\" The final rating was a C plus.\n\nI think I am in agreement with most of this criticism.

C.\n\nTwo boys, Cecil Reid and Taylor Brown of this Agency have made application for high school tuition grants. These boys have done exceptionally well at St. Michael's school, Alert Bay, and Mr. Wickens recommends that they receive further high school education. They completed Grade IX and are ready to enter Grade X.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the fact that preliminary arrangements with reference to these boys were being conducted from the Skeena River Agency, the necessary correspondence only reached me on August 29th. With the opening of the 1946-47 school term but a week away, I made inquiries by wire as to their admission to Langley Prairie High School and as to a boarding house.\n\nThe principal of the school replied accepting the boys for Grade X and Mrs. Askil Johnson, who boarded two boys from the Skeena River Agency last year, has also signified her willingness to take both boys.\n\nThe estimated cost for the academic year for each boy is as follows:\n\n| Item                        | Cost   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| Tuition for ten months      | $50.00 |\n| Text books                  | $20.00 |\n| Board for ten months        | $30.00 |\n| **Total**                   | **$370.00** |\n\nEach boy has deposited in the Bella Coola Agency Trust account the sum of $150.00 as their share of cost of board. It is recommended that the Department approve a grant of $220.00 for each boy, being one-half the cost of board, plus tuition fees and books.\n\n(over)\nI may add that Taylor Brown's parents have furnished the money for their son's schooling, but that great credit is to be given Cecil Reid who worked at Nemu Cannery all summer in order to finance his share, when he found his family not overly receptive to spending money to further his education.\n\nDue to the urgency in having them start the school year on time, I have instructed both boys to proceed to Langley High School.\n\nI trust my action will be approved and strongly recommend that the grant requested by me be made.\n\nEnclosed in duplicate are forms 502-1 and 502-2 being application for tuition grant and physical examinations.

M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., Vancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Rowena Ross - aged 18\n\nThe above named young Indian woman was attending High School from Alberni Residential School last year. She has completed Grade X and for the past year has determined to continue and complete Grade XII with a view to taking up the nursing profession as a career. Mr. Caldwell has spoken very highly of her and from my own observation I would recommend her most highly.\n\nSome doubt existed this spring that her father would assist her with clothing etc. for the current year at High School. I saw the father, Samuel Ross in August and he agreed to give Rowena the necessary aid as her earnings at the cannery this summer were not adequate to fit her out. However it appears that at the last moment Samuel Ross withdrew his support and Rowena was unable to leave for Alberni in time to start the high school term in September. When I visited Butedale late that month I found her still there and still determined to carry through her intention. A half sister had offered her a home at Kitamaat for the winter and she had written for a correspondence course for Grade XII. I suggested to her that she might do better working at one of the Indian Health Service hospitals as a ward aide and cover her correspondence course in her off hours under supervision of the teacher at the hospital. Dr. Tennant was good enough to place Rowena at the Nanaimo hospital. She has gone down there and is established.\n\nI now have a letter from her from which I quote as follows:\n\n\"I just received a letter from Dr. Lucus of the Correspondence Dept. and they're going to forward me the application forms. Do you think the Indian Dept. could pay the cost of my books? They pay for the books that the high school students in Alberni are using, so I don't see why they can't do that for me. I haven't received my books yet. Will you see what you can do, Mr. Pruden? Because you see I have very little money myself. I didn't earn much at the close of the fishing season. What I did earn went to the expense of my ward aide's uniforms and shoes and my fare.\"\n\n(over)\nI still have to buy two more uniforms. I've appreciated all you've done for me and I will try my very best to work hard and study.\n\nIt is my intention that should Rowena be successful this year in completing her Grade XI by correspondence to recommend that she be given full maintenance next year to attend a regular high school and complete her Grade XII. It seems that no help can be expected from her father who appears unable to grasp the importance of his daughter's higher education.\n\nI would recommend that a grant be given sufficient to provide books for the Grade XI correspondence course. To save time, would it be possible for Major Davie to send the books direct to Rowena Ross at the Nanaimo Indian hospital.\n\nI am writing Rowena to suggest that she save as much as possible from her wages during the next ten months in order that she have some money for clothing etc., for next year. I am also telling her that she will be advised from your office whether it is possible to assist her with books this year.\n\nP. Pruden,\nIndian Agent.\nAlberni Indian Residential School\n\nAlberni, B.C.\n\nNov. 17th 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKey,\nCommissioner, Indian Affairs,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe Rowena Ross, former pupil\n\nDear Major MacKey,\n\nI have yours of the 14th inst. re Rowena Ross, a pupil who passed grade 10 in the Alberni high School last year, but who did not return after the vacation to continue her studies, apparently because she could not finance the return fare. Subsequently she became employed at the Nanaimo Hospital as Nurse's Aid.\n\nRowena's intention is to take nursing training. From her aptitude, it is my opinion that she can succeed in her ambition. I agree that she could not take grade XI by correspondence while continuing her present occupation.\n\nHer record in this school is good, and her reports from the Alberni High School were also good. I have taken her case up with Mr. Dunn the Principal of the Alberni High School, particularly as to her taking up Grade XI after losing two months of the term. Mr. Dunn thinks that Rowena has sufficient ability to catch up with the other pupils and he is willing to take her as soon as she can be sent back to school.\n\nWhile we are full in pupil requirement at the residential school, we can always make room for another, especially as some good purpose might be served.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"A.E. Caldwell\"\n\nPrincipal.\nAir Mail\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Tuition Grant - Rowena Ross\nKitimat Band\n\nWith reference to Mr. Indian Agent Pruden's letter of October 23rd attached, following an exchange of correspondence with Mrs. E.G. Castleman, teacher at the Nanaimo Indian Hospital School and Mr. Caldwell, Principal of the Alberni Residential School, it has been decided that it would be preferable for the above-named to stay at the Residential School and attend the High School in Alberni.\n\nA copy of Mr. Caldwell's letter of November 17th in this connection is enclosed for your information and I would recommend the Department approve a grant at the rate of $50.00 per annum to cover tuition fees and an additional grant not exceeding $25.00 for the purchase of school books and supplies. Application for Tuition Grant forms will be forwarded in due course if required.\n\nD. M.

C.\n\nRe: Cecil Reid Bella Bella Band\nTaylor Brown \"\nBeverley Mason \"\nDoris Hall \"\nKenneth Windsor \"\nJames Mack Bella Coola Band\n\nThe above named Indians are students at Langley High School. I have received a letter from the secretary of the school from which I quote as follows:\n\n\"The per capita cost to the Municipality for High School students has been worked out as follows:\n\nNet cost of maintaining the Langley Jr.-Sr. High School during 1947 . . . . . . . . $43,000.00;\n\nAverage enrollment of pupils during 1947 . . . .509\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{43,000}{509} = \\$84.48$, or the annual net per capita cost per student.\n\nIn connection with the above, please be advised that the tuition fees authorized for students attending the Langley Jr.-Sr. High School, will be henceforward, $80.00 per annum.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) L.V.K. Mercer\nSecretary\"\n\nApparently these costs are based purely on maintenance and no account is taken of capital investment. It therefore appears that the amount of $80.00 is most reasonable as a per capita tuition fee for Indian children attending this school.\n\n(over)\nEstimates submitted when grants were requested for the above named students anticipated a charge of $50.00 per student as in the past term.\n\nMay the grant in case of each of the above named pupils be increased by $30.00 to care for accounts from this school when they arrive at the end of the term.\n\nW.P.

Fruden requesting a tuition grant of $400.00 to enable the above mentioned pupil to take a technical course at the Langley High School. This pupil was formerly a student at the Bella Bella Indian Day School where he completed his grade 8 work, last June.\n\nIt is recommended that approval be given for this grant.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nLANGLEY JUNIOR-SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL\nLANGLEY PRAIRIE, B.C.\nCANADA\n\nADMINISTRATION OFFICE\n\nSeptember 9, 1943\n\nMr. W. S. Arneil\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring the past three years we have had a number of Indian students in attendance at our school and have found them willing to work into our school and further found that they have been accepted by our students. This acceptance went so far that the Student's Council wrote to our local Member of Parliament in the last part of June of this year requesting that Indians of our province be given the vote.\n\nI understand from Mr. W. F. Pruden, Superintendent of the Bella Coola Indian Agency that he has recommended that Kenneth Windsor and James Mack continue their schooling although both of these boys did not complete Grade IX here at our school last year. These lads came into Grade VIII much older than their classmates simply because they did not start school at the same time. I do feel that the year of orientation which they obtained here last year will make them better citizens and that any Intelligent Quotient Tests which we could give would not be a fair estimate of their innate ability. My reason for feeling this is that these boys no doubt are aware of many things in nature and in fishing and other things that cannot be measured in routine Intelligent Quotient tests. Further their vocabulary hinders them from actually completing tests of this character.\nMr. W. S. Arneil\n\nI understand that James intends to return to school at Bella Coola and feel that the grounding which he received here should enable him to get his year. I understand further that Ken Windsor will not be able to return unless he has aid from your department and that the policy of your Department is not to grant assistance unless a student passes. I appreciate this policy but do feel that there are, perhaps, exceptions. Ken is not an outstanding student nor ever will he be. I do feel, however, that another year at Langley High School will definitely, with our new Industrial Arts Programme help him to be a useful citizen in his own community later.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nR. R. Brunt\nSupervising Principal\n\nRRB:mg\nFile: S-11-1 (162)\nBella Coola, B.C.,\nSeptember 2nd, 1945.\n\nMr. W. S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Tuition Grants\n\nReplying to your S-11-1 of August 26th, Langley High School where most of the students attended last year do not issue individual report cards. However Mr. Brunt, the principal, has supplied me with the marks of the pupils who attended there last year and a copy of his report is attached herewith.\n\nSince I wrote you, Beverley Mason has decided to remain at home during the coming term. No grant will be required in her case. This is unfortunate as indications were that this student had qualities that would have fitted her as a school teacher in the judgement of her teachers of last term.\n\nTaylor Brown, Cecil Reid and Doris Hall have successfully passed into the next higher grade as indicated by the report. They will be attending and deposits of share of board money have been made with this office to cover the year, Taylor Brown having deposited $150.00 and Doris Hall $100.00. The deposit from Cecil Reid has been promised and is expected in an early mail.\n\nOne new student will be attending Langley High School from the Bella Bella Band as noted in my earlier letter. Peter Mason will be taking Grade IX, the technical course, having passed from Grade VIII at Bella Bella Day School last term. The report for this student is in your office. I have not received a copy. Will you therefore submit details to the Department as required.\n\nRegarding Kenneth Windsor who failed to pass to a higher grade last term, on my last tour of the Agency and before your letter arrived it was necessary to complete all details for pupils leaving for High School in order that they be at school on time. I collected $150.00 from Kenneth Windsor as his share of the board money for the coming year on the understanding that the Department would take care of the additional costs as set out in my letter of recommendation. I realize that I was acting without full authority in this instance, however as I see these students only once each year and a rendezvous had been arranged to settle details for the coming term, and since Kenneth is working on a seine fishing boat and will leave his work at the last possible moment to join some steamer going south, it would be difficult to cancel the arrangement. I believe also that this case warrants further consideration. In my discussion with Mr. Brunt, Principal of the Langley High School, he referred to Kenneth Windsor and James Mack as cases that although they both had failed to pass to the higher grade, nevertheless he felt that they had done very well in view of the problem of reorientation with which they had been faced. Coming as they did from the reserve environment of their homes and the Residential School, a great deal had been required of them that other pupils do not face. No technical course was available last year and Mr. Brunt felt that a better showing might have been made in technical subjects. He urged that both of these boys be allowed to continue their studies as he felt the past year's failure was not indicative of their possibilities.\n\n(over)\nI am writing to Mr. Brunt asking that he express his views in a letter direct to you. Without help, I do not believe it will be possible for Kenneth to continue at school. His share earnings as a crew member on the fishing boat this year have been small. His father will have to aid him with travel fares, clothing and pocket money. There are three younger children and an older sister still in this home in addition to his mother and father. In view of the urgent need for the development of leaders among the native people and considering that from this agency only about one tenth of the young people who should be in high school are attending now, I feel I must ask that Kenneth Windsor be afforded aid so I have recommended for the coming term and will appreciate a reconsideration of this matter. In the mean time he will be attending school. Should a decision be made against this grant then to save time and additional expense, I would appreciate your office making direct contact with Kenneth at the Langley High School or at his boarding house, c/o Mrs. A. Smith, 2468 Lee Road, Milner, B.C., and advising him that the Department's aid will not be forthcoming. Mrs. Smith also should be advised since my arrangement with her was on the basis of the department's paying $30.00 each month on Kenneth's board.\n\nRegarding James Mack, I have not yet had a chance to see him or his family since receiving your letter. It is intended that he live at home and attend the Bella Coola High School. I believe it is possible his father may be willing to finance his tuition fees and books for this year. I have received a letter from the Ocean Falls School Board agreeing to the attendance of James Mack in Grade IX. Mary Hall in Grade VII or VIII and Dennis Snow in Grade VI at the Bella Coola Provincial School. I have not yet been advised what tuition fees will be required.\n\nIn accordance with verbal arrangement made with Mr. Davey, Percy Campbell from Bella Bella has been sent to Alberni to attend Grade IX, having passed from Grade VIII at Bella Bella Jay School. Thomas Humchitt, who graduated from Grade VIII at Alberni Residential School has returned there to attend Grade IX in Alberni High School. It has been customary for Mr. Caldwell to apply for grants for students attending High School and living at his school. This matter has therefore been left in his hands.\n\nW. H. Fruden,\nSuperintendent,\nBella Coola Indian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Kenneth Windsor\nYour file 103-162\n\nAttached are letters from Mr. Superintendent Pruden and Mr. R.R. Brunt, Principal of the Langley Junior-Senior High School concerning the above mentioned pupil. It will be noted that both Mr. Brunt and Mr. Pruden feel that this boy would definitely benefit from a technical course such as can now be secured from the Langley Junior-Senior High School. They appreciate the fact that it would not be wise for Kenneth to continue in a strictly academic course but feel that assistance to enable him to take the technical work would be worthwhile.\n\nInspector Davey is in agreement with this opinion and I would suggest that the Department reconsider its decision in this case and I recommend that the tuition grant of $400.00 previously requested be approved.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAIR MAIL\n\nSeptember 23, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nTuition Grants\n\nWe have your letter of the 15th instant, file 2-11-1, with reference to Kenneth Windsor.\n\nWe have given very careful consideration to both your letter and the letters from Superintendent Prudent and Mr. Brunt, Supervising Principal of Langley Senior High School.\n\nThe following decision has been made regarding Kenneth Windsor:\n\n(a) We are prepared to allow for the period September 1st to December 31st, 1948, an amount of $160.00.\n\n(b) The above allowance is being made on the understanding that his work will be reviewed at the end of December and we will then be in a position to decide if the grant should be continued for the balance of the current academic year.\n\nIt should also be understood that we are making the grant mentioned above in view of the information contained in Mr. Brunt's letter to the effect that he will follow the new industrial arts programme instead of the academic course.\n\nIn our opinion the correspondence regarding Kenneth Windsor brings up an important question which is that the Department is extremely loath to renew tuition grant in the case of any pupil who is not successful.\nIt, therefore, follows that extreme care must be exercised by all parties concerned to give the Indian boy or girl careful guidance regarding the course which they should pursue.\n\nIn this regard I mean that the boys, especially, should be encouraged to follow industrial courses rather than the straight academic courses, except in isolated instances.\n\nWe have also noted the fact that some children are being sent to Alberni Residential School this year in order that they can attend the high school at Alberni. Does this high school offer academic and industrial courses? If so, we believe that Indian pupils should be encouraged to attend this school and live at the Alberni Residential School.\n\nFrom experience in Ontario and other provinces, better results have been obtained when the pupil resides in a residential school close to the high school. The reasons for extra success in such cases will readily suggest themselves to you.\n\nWhen you meet any of your Superintendents during the next few months, and when Inspector Davey visits the different agencies in the course of his regular duties, he should discuss the whole situation regarding tuition grants very carefully with each Superintendent.\n\nWe are anxious to give deserving Indian children advanced education as far as funds will permit, and at the same time I think you will agree that extreme care must be exercised in order that there will be no waste of public funds.\n\nAnother point should be stressed when speaking to Superintendents or others interested in encouraging Indian children to take advanced education and that is that the applications for such assistance should reach head office by August 1st each year.\nIf this procedure was adopted, there would be time for correspondence and discussion before the new academic year commences. In many cases the applications for tuition grants reach us about September lst. This places head office officials in the unenviable position of either refusing a deserving case or delaying a decision until after the academic year commences.\n\nIt is realized that this will be difficult but by constant pressure we should be able to educate our Superintendents to the necessity for following out our wishes as outlined above.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nSeptember 23, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, file 2-11-1, the Department will allow a tuition grant of $400.00 for the academic year 1948-49, to assist Peter Harold Mason taking a technical course at Langley High School.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa,\n\nRe: Tuition Grants\nYour file 103-162 (E.1)\n\nI refer to Mr. Neary's letter dated September 23rd concerning the above, with particular reference to Kenneth Windsor of the Bella Bella Band. This office has been aware of the need for increased guidance to Indian pupils taking high school courses. Inspector Davey is of the opinion that this problem will be simplified somewhat when the cumulative record cards at present being prepared by the Department are brought into use. He has also given some consideration to the solution of the problem of providing for technical courses for pupils who have not the ability to take academic work, and on September 1st he submitted a memorandum advocating the establishment of hostels or residences at Alberni and Vancouver at which points pupils could secure technical education. This memorandum has been delayed pending a conference which will be held in this office on September 28th with Doctor Dorey and Mr. A.E. Caldwell, Principal of the Alberni Residential School at which school the Inspector proposed the erection of a residence. I will write further with regard to this matter after the above mentioned conference has taken place, when I hope to be able to make concrete proposals.\n\nWith regard to the submission of application forms for tuition grants we have previously endeavoured to have Superintendents submit these well in advance of the academic year and have had some success but we shall try in future to have all such applications into the Department by the first of August.\n\nW.S.

This boy left Langley High School on November 20th and returned to his home at Bella Bella. He had been doing quite well at school.\n\nA short time previous to his leaving I had a report that Peter and Kenneth Windsor were not getting enough to eat. I was endeavoring to have this matter investigated when I was informed that Peter had returned home while I was away on an Agency tour. No doubt a factor in his return was that he wished to be present at the wedding of his sister which took place about that time. I wrote Mr. Arneil and reported Peter's action on December 3rd. On December 21st I received a reply suggesting that I interview Peter and report his attitude toward education with a view to his returning to school after the Christmas vacation. At that time I had no opportunity to interview Peter since I was without transportation. I have not yet had the chance to speak to him.\n\nThis boy has a good home background. His parents are anxious that he be educated. He was most eager for the opportunity when he went to Langley at first. I believe it should be remembered that the boy had never been out of the \"Reserve\" orbit before and his action should not be judged too harshly. It was unfortunate that I could not see him soon after his return home. If I find him again eager to return to school and with some evidence of an improved sense of responsibility, I intend to recommend that he be re-admitted to Langley High School next term.\n\nPeter's father is an excellent man, but has a very heavy load financially and I am sure will be unable to finance the boy. During the summer Peter may earn some money himself but could be expected only to pay part of his board. If he is to go to school I will recommend aid similar to that authorized for this term.\n\n(see page two)\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6490, file 42162-3, part 1)\nThe name of James Mack has also been deleted. After agreeing quite eagerly to attend, he did not put in an appearance. I saw him one week after school opened and talked with him. He appeared quite anxious to go to school but again failed to show up. I was away on a tour of the Agency for three weeks and on my return home found that James was away from the village, having followed the fishing fleet. He had been fishing his own gillnet boat and reluctance to leave this fascinating occupation may have had something to do with his not going to school. I enquired among James' pals and was told in confidence that James had said he would not make any progress at school if he were to live at home where there is a considerable amount of drinking. James felt he would not get the needed rest to pursue his studies.\n\nBefore recommending that James attend High School here I had discussed this phase with his father who had agreed that there would be no drinking in the house while James was attending school. He is a man of some character and I accepted his word. He had promised to tell James but now tells me he did not. I have told James' father that I believe that may have been the reason for James' failure to return to school. He has promised to talk to James and if between them they can settle on a plan, then I have agreed to consider James' return to school again. I have little hope in this case.\n\nThe name of Thomas Humchitt has also been deleted. For some months I believed he was at Alberni since all arrangements had been made for his departure. I have not received a list of the pupils who are at Alberni. Recently however I was told that Thomas did not return to school last autumn but is at Bella Bella and I am told he is taking a correspondence course at home. I will endeavor to see him when I next visit Bella Bella.\n\nRegarding Taylor Brown, I saw him after his return to Bella Bella and he stated that he did not feel that his progress this year had been satisfactory and felt that if he had remained at school he would have failed. He therefore decided that it was not fair to ask the Department to make further contributions to his education at this time. I might say that he also wished to return to Bella Bella to attend the wedding of his brother who was being married to Peter Mason's sister. However I saw Taylor in mid November and he definitely stated he did not wish to return to school. I believe that Taylor's leaving Langley as he did influenced Peter Mason since Peter left some days after Taylor.\n\nThe list as attached is complete as far as I can ascertain. There are of course a great many children in the Agency who are not attending school and it is possible that the parents in some cases may have made private arrangements for some of these.\n\nLast year the school at Butedale took in six native children. I have asked several times for accounts covering their tuition but have not received them. That school is without a teacher this term.\n\nW.P.

As the highest enrolment at this school during the past year was only 61, it is to be expected that two teachers should be able to handle the work of the first 6 grades. For those going on to Junior High School work, enrolment at the new Provincial School may be a proper expenditure of funds available for tuition grants.\nA statement of the results achieved by Mary Hall in Grade 8 and Dennis Snow in Grade 6 during the past year, is awaited.\n\nBernard F.

Mr. Levelton's letter suggests that this youth requires persuasion to embark on a University course. Before the increased grant suggested can be considered, it will be necessary to know what this youth's vocational interests and aptitudes are, and what efforts he is making to help himself to realize his ambitions.\n\nBernard W.

As the Provincial School Board increases its accommodation the Indian pupils are being absorbed into the Provincial schools so that within a year or two we will be able to dispense with the most unsatisfactory rented building and also with the services of one of our teachers.\n\nIt will be recalled that this is a Protestant Reserve and that there is no likelihood of any objection being made by the church authorities to the admission of Indian children to the Provincial schools. This is also in accordance with the recommendations of the Joint Committee of Indian Affairs.\n\nIn view of the poor condition of the one building and the possibility of accommodating grades 4 and above in the Provincial school in the near future, I would suggest that it is advisable not to interfere with the gradual absorption of the Indian pupilage into the Provincial system.\n\nW.S.

At that time I was able to persuade the family to allow him to go on to Residential School. However this year the boy himself asked to stay home with his mother. Grade VI is not being taught in the Bella Coola Indian Day School, as accommodation is all filled to Grade V.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMr. Bernard F. Neary  \nSupt. of Indian Education  \nDept. of Mines & Resources  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRE: Indian Children Attending Bella Coola, Prov. School\n\nReplying to your 42162-3 (E3) of 16th Aug., 1949. Following are details regarding children attending Bella Coola, Provincial School. All of these children are living on Bella Coola, Indian Reserve #1 and travel to school 8 miles by school bus. Tuition will be about $100.00 each, textbook rental to $5.00 per year, Other Books about $5.00.\n\nMilly (Mary) Hall, Bella Coola Band. Attended Grade 8 at Bella Coola, Provincial School and passed to Grade 9 last year. Held highest average grade for her class. Intends to complete High School and Normal school to qualify as teacher for Indian Schools. Teachers endorse her adaptability to that profession. She was well received by her white classmates and made an excellent adjustment to the new environment. Parents supplying full maintenance except for students earnings as grocery clerk during vacation. Grant needed for tuition & textbooks $105.00.\n\nWilfred (Dennis) Snow, Bella Coola Band age 15. Completed grade VI and passed to Grade VII, Bella Coola, Provincial School last term. Lives with elderly couple by whom he was adopted Indian fashion. They supply full maintenance. Grant required $105.00 for tuition & textbooks.\n\nDavid Melkus, of Oweekeno Band, Katit Village, Rivers Inlet. Age 16, attended St. Michaels Indian Residential School, Alert Bay, B.C., in Grade VIII last term. Failed to pass. Principal states this is attributable to poor teaching in 1948 (Gr. VII) when there were five different teachers during the term. Principal spoke highly of this boy both as to character and ability. He was discharged from St. Michaels to make room for younger child. His father is paying full maintenance, including board at Bella Coola but has had a poor fishing year, and I do not believe he can pay for tuition. I recommend a grant of $105.00 for tuition and textbooks in view the report that failure to pass is not a reflection on the ability or industry of the student.\n\nRhoda Snow, Bella Coola Band age 16. Passed to Grade VII from Bella Coola Indian Day School last term. Parents supplying maintenance. Grant required $105.00 for textbooks & tuition.\n\nAmelia Snow, Bella Coola Band age 14, passed to Grade VI from Bella Coola, Indian Day School last term. Parents supplying maintenance Grant required $105.00 for tuition & Text Books.\nHjordis Mack, Bella Coola Band age 13, passed to Grade VI from Bella Coola Indian Day School last term. Parents supplying maintenance. Grant required $105.00 tuition & textbooks.\n\nEliza Mack, Bella Coola Band age 15. Passed to Grade VII from Bella Coola Indian Day School last term. Parents supply maintenance. Grant required $105.00 tuition & textbooks.\n\nPercy M. Mack, Bella Coola Band age 17. Passed to Grade IX from Alberni Indian Residential School last term. Parents supply maintenance beyond his own earnings as fisherman during summer. Grant required $105.00 tuition & textbooks.\n\nT. Melvin Mack, Bella Coola Band age 16. Passed to Grade VIII at Alberni Indian Residential School last term. Parents supply maintenance. Grant required $105.00 tuition & textbooks.\n\nGodfrey B. Tellic, Bella Coola Band age 14. Passed to Grade VII at St Michael's Indian Residential School last term. Grandfather supplies part maintenance. Receiving food relief and will need clothing from welfare funds. Educational Grant required $110.00 to supply tuition, textbooks, and scribblers, pencils and other school supplies.\n\nArnold Tellic, Bella Coola Band age 14. Passed to Grade VII at St Michael's Indian Residential School last term. Relatives trying to supply maintenance. May need some welfare aid. Grant required $105.00 tuition & textbooks.\n\nClarence Elliott (Schooner), Bella Coola Band Age 16. Passed to Grade VIII at Alberni Indian Residential School last term. Parents promise maintenance, but may need food relief later. Grant required $105.00 for tuition & textbooks.\n\nJ. Amos Tellic, Bella Coola Band age 17. Passed to Grade VII from St Michael's Indian Residential School in 1948. Discharged at age 16, was eager to continue, but there was no room in Bella Coola Day School last term. He made arrangements to take correspondence course this year, they found there was room for one more in school bus and begged to be allowed to attend Provincial School. Maintains himself but had poor returns from fishing partly because of assuming debt to cannery of aged grandfather. This boy will probably need welfare aid, but his eagerness for education decided me to allow him the chance. Grant required $105.00 tuition & textbooks.\n\nLouise Edgar, Bella Coola Band age 15. Passed to Grade VII from St. Michael's Indian Residential School last term. Parents promise full maintenance. Grant required $105.00 for tuition & textbooks.\n\nAnnie Harris, Bella Coola Band age 16. Passed to Grade VII at Bella Coola Indian Day School last term. I had been notified that this girl would not continue. However her father called on me a few days after school opened, and asked permission for her to attend the Provincial School. Her teacher from last term also spoke on her behalf and I consented. When she had been attending two weeks some of the white parents learned that she lived in the same home as a tubercular sister. A good deal of alarm was spread, and rather than jeopardise the good feeling that exists between whites & Indians...\nI asked Annie to cease attendance. Now everything is being done to move the sick sister to hospital. If this can be accomplished soon, and Annie can successfully pass a further medical check, she will be allowed to return. Parents will give maintenance. Grant of $105.00 will be needed for tuition & textbooks if she returns.\n\nTo summarize the following of Grants are sought.\n\n| Name                  | Age | Grade | Amount |\n|-----------------------|-----|-------|--------|\n| Milly (Mary) Hall     | 17  | IX    | $105.00|\n| Wilfred (Bennis) Snow | 15  | VII   | $105.00|\n| David Walkus          | 16  | VIII  | $105.00|\n| Rhoda Snow            | 16  | VII   | $105.00|\n| Amelia Snow           | 14  | VI    | $105.00|\n| Eliza Mack            | 15  | VII   | $105.00|\n| Hjordis Mack          | 13  | VI    | $105.00|\n| Percy M.

The Senior room has a registration of 27 in Grades III, IV, V. This is a small and old building which is rented from the Indians, it would not reasonably accommodate more than about two additional pupils for which no seats are on hand, although on order for some time. The building is not suitable for a classroom and it is hoped it may be vacated either by new construction by Indian Affairs, or by arrangement for the Provincial Government to construct additional classroom space to care for all Indian children above grade I and II. If this can be done next year it will be necessary to ask for accommodation from the Provincial Government for a total of 65 children, not allowing for children from other villages of the agency who may wish to attend High School here. It is hoped there may be several of these from Bella Bella bringing the total over 80. It is proposed to ask the Provincial Government to construct two new classrooms to take care of the needs of Bella Coola Indian children for next year. Present population figures indicate that about 15 new admissions will be sought for Indian Children to Bella Coola Provincial School each year over the next few years, beyond 1950.\n\nApplication forms and medical reports are attached for all new admissions this year except Annie Nappie. If she is to continue a new application will go forward for her later. It is regretted that this report has been so long delayed. This office has been without clerical help since June and there is much work in arrears. The application forms were lost in the melee over the past three weeks and have just been found.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. P. Frude\nSupt.

Consequently it is felt that the teachers can arrange to have the senior boys and girls assist in sweeping and cleaning the building and thus relieve the present janitor of the extra work that might be required in view of opening a second class room.

She writes as follows:\n\n\"The Council also discussed the question of fireman for the school and feel that the person doing it should get $10.00 per month. Wilfred Grant is doing it at present and is doing a satisfactory job. At present he expects to be here for the winter but if he is only allowed $4.00 at the school he will not promise to stay. From what I have been able to learn there will not be many of the men remaining in the village for long at a time during the winter so that it has been very difficult to get someone to do this job. As I told you when you were here we have to have someone to do this job as I haven't the physical strength to do it. As I said before, the Council feels that for the work involved the fireman should get $10.00 and they would like to take the matter up with the department.\"\n\nMiss Leith has been informed of the Department's ruling in a similar request for Bella Bella\u2014see file 14-162 letter dated December 25, 1939, and that she must not incur any expenses for janitor services exceeding $4.00 per month without the Department's permission.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nWO:MC\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6490, file 42162-6, part 2)\nOttawa,\nDecember 22, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant with reference to the allowance for caretaking at the Kitimat Day School. From January 1, 1942, the Department will allow $5.00 a month for the janitor work at this school. From the same date a similar amount will be allowed for the janitor work at the Bella Bella Indian Day School, if you consider such action necessary. This is the other two-roomed school in your Agency.\n\nAlthough it has been decided to increase the allowance for janitor services as shown above, I still feel that it is most important to direct the attention of all teachers to the contents of official letter of December 26, 1939. For training purposes I believe that it is a good plan to have the senior boys and girls assist in sweeping and cleaning the building.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., Vancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Bella Coola Day School Janitor Services\n\nMiss Wright has been in regarding the above subject. The teachers have been doing the janitor work, lighting fires, etc., for the $4.00 per month per room that has been provided. It has not proved satisfactory to have the children do this work so during the past rather severe winter this task has been an additional burden on the two teachers, neither of whom were in the best physical condition. Miss Wright now feels that she cannot undertake to light fires and do the heavy cleaning any longer, and hopes that the Department will make some provision for janitor service.\n\nI have been considering lately the rehabilitation of an ex T.B. patient, a man of very small and slight stature and quite unfit for any of the heavy work in which most of the Indians engage, but fortunately with a very dependable character. I have a plan which may give this man partial independence of which I will write you further when the details have been worked out.\n\nIt has occurred to me that this man or some similarly placed individual would probably undertake to light the fires in the two school houses and do some of the heavier cleaning for about fifty cents per day for each school or in round figures $25.00 per month for the two buildings. The dusting might be done by one of the pupils on a voluntary basis, although this will probably still fall back on the teachers.\n\nI would recommend therefore that the present allowance of $8.00 be increased to $25.00 per month for janitor service at these two schools.\n\nWPP/D\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6490, file 42162-6, part 2)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Bella Coola Day School\nJanitor Service\n\nI enclose herewith a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Pruden concerning the above mentioned service.\n\nI cannot concur in the recommendation of Mr. Pruden that the allowance be increased to $25.00 per month. A revision was recently made in the allowance for schools in the Skeena River Agency for janitor's services where conditions are comparable to those at Bella Coola. I recommend that the present allowance of $8.00 be increased to $15.00 per month which would bring the allowance at this school in line with those made at similar schools in the Skeena River Agency.\n\nD.

M. MacKey, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Janitor Services - Bella Coola Day School\n\nMay I refer again to your 2-11-8 of April 24th in which authority was given to pay $15.00 per month for janitor services for the two buildings of the above named school.\n\nMatthew Moody, who was nominated to do this work, went to Nama Cannery during the holidays where he is now working as a watchman but will probably be here again this month. When I discussed the school janitor work with him last I thought I detected some reluctance, which it seemed to me had cooled his earlier enthusiasm for the over all scheme for his rehabilitation including the shop repair business. This and the fact that everyone approached avoided taking this work even when willing caused me to look more carefully into what was involved and I have come to the conclusion that no one will do the work without higher remuneration.\n\nIn the meantime one of the older people in the village, Peter Nelson has been lighting the fires only in the senior room each morning for twenty-five cents per day. His services have proved most satisfactory but he is unwilling to carry on any longer without higher remuneration. Miss Wright is continuing to attend to the cleaning but has asked me to get someone for the work as soon as possible. Mrs. Smoakgrass at the senior school house continues to do both fires and cleaning, but should be relieved of this work before the severe weather.\n\nFollowing are details of the work expected of the janitor.\n\nJunior School House\n\nBuilding 40' x 25' consisting of one large classroom (34 desks), 2 large cloakrooms, stairs to basement, front porch with two sets of steps, full concrete basement, two toilets, two wash basins, furnace in centre of basement, wood storage at one end and toilets and wash-basins at the other end. The soil in the playground is fine gravel sand mixed with loam and tracks in freely owing to frequent wet weather.\n\nDaily Work Required\n\nSchool room, cloak rooms, porch, steps, stairs to basement, thoroughly swept; wash basins and toilets cleaned; blackboards washed. A conservative estimate of time required for this work would be one and one quarter hours daily. To light fires, cut kindling, empty ashes and sweep basement, each day roughly one half hour. Averaging 21 school days per month at 1\u00bd hours each 36\u00bd hours.\n\nMonthly Work Required\n\nScrub classroom and cloakroom floors, scrub outside steps, porch and stairs to basement, time about 12 hours per mo.\nWindow cleaning 105 panes inside and out 4 \"\nThoroughly cleaning basement 1\u00bd \"\nMonthly allowance for incidentals as snow shovelling in winter, cutting brush on playground, and attending grounds in summer. 4 \"\nCleaning woodwork, sweeping down cobwebs, etc. 1 \"\nTotal monthly work 22\u00bd \"\nTotal of daily work for month as above 36\u00bd \"\nTotal for Junior room per month 59 hours\nSenior Room\n\nThis classroom is much smaller. It is hoped a cloakroom entry will be added this year, however wood must be carried from a shed at the rear of the building.\n\nDaily Work\n\nSweeping, washing blackboards, cleaning outside toilets, carrying wood and lighting fires one hour per day.\n\nMonthly Work\n\nTo include cleaning windows, dusting down walls, scrub cloakroom and steps with allowance for snow shovelling, cutting brush, etc.\n\nTotal - 5 hours. Total daily work 1 hour @ 21 days per month = 21 hours plus 5 hours monthly work = 26 hours total.\n\nAdding junior and senior rooms total 85 hours.\n\nTravelling time\n\nThe schools are at opposite ends of the village, several trips per day will be made between buildings at \u00bd hour per day = 5 hrs. per mo.\n\nTotal of work required each month = 90 hours\n\nRate of pay at $15.00 per month = 18.66 cents per hour\n\nI believe it will be difficult to have this work satisfactorily done at a rate which would work out at less than 40 cents per hour.\n\nMay consideration be given to increasing the monthly remuneration for janitor work at these two school buildings to $36.00 per month?\n\nWPP/2\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6490, file 42162-6, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFile: 2-11-8\n\nBella Coola, B.C.,\nOctober 31st, 1947\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Janitor Service -\nBella Coola Indian Day School\n\nReplying to your 2-11-2 of October 14th, I wish to thank you for the consideration that has been given this matter and for the raising of the janitor allowance to the maximum amount.\n\nDuring the past month, Alex King, Indian merchant and son of Chief Sam King has been lighting the fires in the junior room gratis. I am endeavoring to find someone to give each of the buildings a special cleaning from the money saved in this way. Each of the teachers will be paid the customary $4.00 for attending to daily cleaning.\n\nReferring to the second paragraph of your letter, I find in each of the native communities a few people who, like Alex King here, have a sense of community welfare and are glad to donate time and money to anything that is of benefit to their village. However these few are likely to become discouraged if they find they are doing all the giving while others who do not think as they do benefit from their efforts without attempting to help. Again these matters can only be adjusted by local government and much time and attention is required before local Indian councils in this agency will be able to govern their own villages.\n\nI have not yet arrived at a conclusion regarding a satisfactory way of making a compulsory tax levy which is the foundation of proper village government. I am now recommending to the Councils that a system of voluntary contribution be started where it is advertised publicly which property owners are paid up and which delinquent. This is not entirely satisfactory but is the best that can be done without consultation. Even this plan will pose difficulties to most of the Councils in this agency and may not prove satisfactory.\n\nI have discussed the janitor service with the two school teachers and in order to do as much as we can for the larger school building where they are only Grade I and II children, Mrs. Smoggrass, teacher of the senior room, has offered to carry on with fire lighting and daily cleaning with the aid of older children in her room. I propose that you pay her payment of $4.00 per month for her work, from the $20.00 you are prepared to recommend, this will leave $16.00 to be devoted mostly to the larger building with a monthly special cleaning at the smaller school. The small children in the larger building will continue to do the dusting and other services will be scaled down to fit the money available. This plan will go into operation when you have given final authority and when Matthew Woody returns to the village, as he still seems the only hope for a steady janitor. He is expected to return within the next few weeks. Meantime Alex King has kindly offered to attend to fire lighting. Daily cleaning will be attended to by the teachers.\n\nAlthough the care of school grounds, etc. will have to be waived and window cleaning, scrubbing, basement cleaning, etc. done less frequently, it is hoped that the $16.00 will do a passable job with the cooperation as indicated of the teachers and pupils.\nHowever when the moneys available for these purposes are increased I would recommend a reconsideration of this item.\n\nMay I therefore have your authority to apply $20.00 per month to janitor services at the Bella Coola Day School as soon as possible.\n\nWPP/D\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6490, file 42162-6, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Janitor Services - Bella Coola Day School\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of April 21st, 1947 (file 14-162 WT 1), approving an increase in the amount for janitor services at the Bella Coola Day School from $8.00 to $15.00 a month, I am enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Pruden's letters of Oct. 3rd and 31st wherein he summarizes the time spent on janitor work at the two buildings used for school purposes in support of his recommendation that the monthly remuneration for this work be set at $36.00.\n\nIn the exchange of correspondence with Mr. Pruden I pointed out to him that the Indians of the Band had some responsibility in this matter themselves and asked if there were no Indians in receipt of relief rations capable of doing the work who might assume responsibility for some of the cleaning required in return for rations received.\n\nYou will note from the Agent's recent letter that he has reviewed the matter and is now of the opinion that he will be able to have the work performed satisfactorily for $20.00 a month. This amount is still in excess of what we are paying elsewhere but in view of the general rise in costs may not be too high and is therefore recommended for approval.\n\nD. M.

Mrs. Snodgrass, teacher of the senior school reports that the services of Rhoda and Betty Schuetze have not proved satisfactory. It is thought that these girls have not sufficient time to devote to this work since besides their High School work they assist with farm work and in the operation of a milk retail route. They are therefore being given notice that their duties will cease as of April 1st.\n\nAn endeavor has been made to secure a native to undertake the work and the only prospects are the older girls in the school. Mrs. Snodgrass has suggested that one girl, Rhoda Snow, aged fourteen be given the responsibility and be paid for the work. Mrs. Snodgrass undertakes to see that when other pupils assist Rhoda that they be paid by her for the proportion of work which is done. The understanding is to be that the $16.00 which will be paid to Rhoda Snow will be for janitor service at the junior school, when it is opened. The janitor work at the senior school will be on a voluntary basis as formerly, Mrs. Snodgrass receiving the regular $4.00 per month to cover supervision and the lighting of fires.\n\nMay I have your approval of this arrangement.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6490, file 42162-6, part 2)\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to: Misses Rhoda & Betty Schmetze\nAddress: Bella Coola, B.C.\n\n1947-48\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Mar. 31 | Monitoring at Bella Coola Indian Day School | $16.00 |\n\nVote: 516-01-103\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and proper charge against the Government of Canada.

A classmate, Lillian Mack has undertaken the work for this month. I had intended to suggest since it seems the individuals may change frequently that the $15.00 be vouchered each month to Miss A. Wright, teacher of the Junior school to let her pay whoever did the actual work.\n\nIn the past mail a letter arrived from Training and Welfare Division returning a voucher which it had been customary to pass monthly in the amount of $4.00 for office cleaning, payable to Miss V. Douglas, Clerk. The explanation given was that no full time employee could receive extra remuneration from any source. As teachers are full time employees I now doubt whether vouchers for Mrs. Snodgrass and other teachers in the Agency for janitor services will be passed. I therefore hesitate to suggest the proposal that Miss Wright administer the $15.00 monthly for janitor service at the Junior School until I have had your advice.\n\nIf in your opinion this proposal would be acceptable I shall ask Miss Wright whether she will undertake this responsibility.\n\n[Signature]\nWPP/D\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6490, file 42162-6, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Janitor Services - Bella Coola Day School\n\nFurther to my letter of March 30th, I am enclosing a copy of a letter dated April 22nd from Mr. Pruden from which you will note that he is still experiencing difficulty in obtaining the services of someone to do the janitor work at the above mentioned school.\n\nIt is my understanding that at other Day Schools the Department makes payment to the teacher for janitor services, the teacher making her own arrangements with the older pupils.

Mr. Grist, teacher of the Seton Lake Indian Day School, is paid salary at the rate of $950 a year and $75 a year for janitor services, making his total compensation $1025.00. When the total compensation is more than $1,000 but does not exceed $1,111, the Act mentioned above requires that the total remuneration that can be allowed is $1,000 a year. On the basis of ten teaching months in the school year, Mr. Grist was entitled to $300 for the months of April, May and June. He has already been forwarded cheques amounting to $265.00, and there is, therefore, a balance due him of $15, a cheque for which amount will be forwarded.\n\nWhat has been said above regarding Mr. Grist, applies also to Miss Blachford, teacher of the Boothroyd Indian Day School.

Taylor at Vancouver Agency and recorded in the Official Cash Book.\n\nAmount $9.45\n\nAgency Receipt No. 32516 dated May 12th, 1947.\n\nPayer Evans, Coleman & Evans on account of refund for coal sacks returned - Homalco School - Revenue 16.\n\nFor Treasury Branch\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver.\n\nRe: Fuel for Homalco Indian Day School.\n\nI would advise that in the past, wood has been purchased for heating the above school classroom and coal has been purchased for the kitchen range in the adjoining teacher's residential quarters.\n\nWood is very difficult to obtain at Church House. The Indians ask $9.50 a cord, and delivery is usually very dilatory and now quite problematical.\n\nCoal has been shipped from Vancouver but difficulties are encountered in getting Indians to haul it from wharf to school, even although they are paid for their work. Last winter two sacks of coal were stolen in transit from the wharf but the thief was not located.\n\nThe coal last supplied was of poor quality as I found when visiting Church House. Furthermore, the coal sacks have to be returned by the teacher to Vancouver in order that a refund be obtained for the Department.\n\nTo obviate these difficulties I would recommend purchase of oil burners for use in both the heater and the kitchen range, especially as a supply of fuel oil is guaranteed by the Yuclataw Traders store on Stuart Island who offer a pot burner type oil heater for $55.00.\n\nLocal quotations were requested for a range oil burner and the only wickless type offered is $44.62\n\n/OVER.\ncomplete with tank stand assembly and all fittings. Wick burners are much less satisfactory and are quoted at $44.50.\n\nIf approval is given I will submit a requisition with details of tenders received.\n\n(H. E. Taylor),\nIndian Agent.\n\nAA.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Taylor's letter of June 25th in connection with difficulties encountered in providing fuel for the Homalco Indian Day School wherein he suggests that consideration be given to the supply of an oil heater and gives assurance that supplies of oil will be available.\n\nIn view of the uncertainty in the matter of the supply of coal and wood I concur in his recommendation for the supply of an oil heater and a range oil burner at a cost of approximately $100.00. If the Department concurs in this recommendation I will ask Mr. Taylor to secure quotations and also to give an estimate of the cost of fuel oil for both the heater and the range for a school term.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, July 3rd, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of June 30th, the Department approves the purchase of oil heater and a range oil burner at a cost of approximately $100.00 for use at the Homalco Indian day school.\n\nYou may also arrange for the purchase of the fuel oil that will be required.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nOttawa, July 7th, 1947.\n\nMr. H.E. Taylor, Indian Agent,\n416 Federal Bldg., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nThe Department does not see the necessity for your voucher No. 519. The coal sacks have been returned to Evans, Coleman and Evans which appears to be the case from their credit note. You should arrange with the firm to send us a cheque for $10.00.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MDG\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to Department letter of the 7th ultimo, from the Supt. of Welfare and Training, re our Voucher No. 519 in favour of Evans, Coleman & Evans for $10.00, I wish to say that this Voucher was sent in error.\n\nA refund of $10.00 was due for returned sacks for coal supplied to the Indian Day School on Homalco I.R. at Church House.\n\nWe now find that Evans, Coleman & Evans omitted to submit an account for $8.00 for freight on the coal when shipped in February, last. A copy of this account is attached herewith. The amount of $8.00 has been deducted from the refund of $10.00, and the balance of $2.00 will be forwarded with our next cash returns.\n\nH. E.
