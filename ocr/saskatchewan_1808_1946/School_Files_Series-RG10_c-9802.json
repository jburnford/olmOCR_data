Newton, Penwood, Sask., called at this office with the above named Indian boy, having picked this boy up on the road between Penwood and Melville.\n\n2. The boy stated that he was from the Cowessess Indian Reserve and that he had been stolen by a man who was driving an automobile and brought up to the Penwood district and thrown out.\n\n3. Contact was immediately made with H.A.W.R McKenzie, Indian Agent, Broadview, Sask., per long distance telephonic communication, and it was arranged that this boy be handed over to him at Grayson, Sask.\n\n4. Pursuant to instructions received from the H.O.O. in charge of this detachment I patrolled per Pol/Car Ford Code No. 1752 to the village of Lestock, whereupon arrival I met Mr. McKenzie. It was noted by Mr. McKenzie that this boy was a runaway boy from the Muscowequan Indian school at Lestock and not the Edward LeRat that he had thought it to be at all. It was learned that there are several of the Indian boys of the Cowessess Indian Reserve bearing this same name. However, this boy is formerly from the Cowessess Indian Reserve, but he had been placed in the Indian school at Lestock sometime during last January, and as a result of further interrogation he admitted that he had run away from the school in question and that his former story was fictitious.\n\n5. In view of the foregoing, the above named was brought back to Melville detachment where he remained overnight.\n\n17-10-38\n\n6. In the a.m. of this date Father George Jeanotte, Principle of the Muscowequan Indian School, Lestock, Sask., was contacted per long distance telephonic communication and informed about this young Indian boy from his school, and in reply to this, he stated that he would be in Melville as soon as possible to take him back to the school.\n\n7.

Muriel Pelletier X\nRosemary Pelletier X\nWaldron, Sask.,\nJuly 14th., 1942.\n\nMr. L. Chase,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI received your letter about the two Pelletier girls, I went to Bangor today, had a talk with my old friend the postmaster, Charlie Wade, in fact it was the Legion boys that put Charlie in as Postmaster. While talking with Mr. Wade, the two girls, Rosemary and Marielle, with their little sister, past by. The little girls were holding hands and laughing, and quite happy. Anyway Mr. Wade called the three girls into the post office and after the girls had got over their shyness, I asked them if they played baseball yet, they said they did but not on the school team yet, then they laughingly told me how they enjoyed themselves at the Bangor Sports, so the girls and I went and had an ice cream cone.\n\nAfter we were all good and friendly I asked them if they liked Bangor or if they wanted to go back to the Indian school, the girls were sure they wanted to stay here in Bangor, anyway Sir, I can assure you that these children are really happy here. When I spoke to them, they had not been near their stepmother, and the three girls were happy together. They told me their ages, Rosemary is 12 years, a fat face, nice, chunky little girl; Marielle told me she was 8 years, kind of a slim young girl, but smart and quick. I paid particular attention to how the girls were dressed. The three girls were all dressed exactly alike, nice clean white dresses, faces clean, hair brushed nicely, and white ribbon in hair, nice white socks, and a kind of running shoes but new, the stepmother I never saw but her character is excellent, a very well educated woman. You see I expect the population of Bangor is around 100 and they all know me, the same as I know them. The letter with the girls' signature is a kiss for their daddy so if you send it on to him he will know. I asked the girls what grade they were in school, Rosemary said Grade 2. By the way she spoke and answered I thought she was about grade 5. Marielle said she was Grade 1 but seemed smart enough for 3 or 4th grade.\n\nWell, Sir, trusting this will help you out at present and I could let you know later on how things are going if you want the information but Sir when I met the children this afternoon they were three nice happy little girls and by the way, Brother, my wife was along and she says they are happy. Goodbye and best wishes,\n\nSgd. F. Cockerton.\nDear Sir,\n\nAllow me to draw your attention to my immediate family affair.\n\nAt the present time I have two little girls, Rosemary A. Pelletier, aged 11, and Muriel D. Pelletier, age 9, who are at an Indian Boarding School at Lestock, Sask. After the passing away of their mother, I was forced under such circumstances to place them in the hands of another family, incidentally, their own grandfather, but no relation existed between the girls and the supposed grandmother, because she was the second wife to the grandfather. Therefore, she favoured Muriel, the youngest of the two girls, and abused Rosemary and eventually she placed her at Crooked Lake Indian Boarding School and I disapproved of a forced parting of the two girls. I was also not in the position to take them under my guardianship because I was looking for a home just then and employed on a local farm which forced me to consent to Muriel's wishes to be with her sister, Rosemary, at school, there was no other alternative decision for me just then.\n\nIn due course I married the now Mrs. Rose A. Pelletier, Banger, Sask., Box 434. Marriage took place June 19th, 1937. She also had a child, Margaret Pelletier. We had good intention of uniting our family, but, unfortunately, the Lestock Indian School management prevented our intentions to materialize, consequently, I began to look to the faults of such school, by looking back on my own experience because I was practically raised in one of them. You might say that I should be glad to have been kept in existence. But I say otherwise, I was brought up at the expense of the government in a semi-civilized manner, while summing up all the expenditure spent on me could have brought me a good education. Ever since I enlisted in the Canadian Army did I realize how urgent education really is and that is one decision I have come to, that these little girls who are at the right age to develop their education as far as their ability will allow, are going to have that privilege and only with your assistance can I achieve any results. I want the girls withdrawn from the school and placed in the hands of my wife, Mrs. Rose Pelletier.\n\nThey will also attend the same public school Margaret is attending at the present time.\n\nMy wife on previous occasions made attempts to withdraw the little girls from the school but the management refuse to consider to such much as allow them to go home for a visit.\n\nAccording to recent rumours, I understand that the standard of education as greatly improved by to my estimation I still do not approve of the strict dictatorial system of\nmaintaining discipline in these schools. Furthermore, my education being financed by the Government paid to the Crooked Lake Indian Boarding School, was not good enough profit for the organization that manage the school, in order to improve this profit, the management harnessed what man-power they can come out of our under-nourished body to the rough and unskilled of the farm, that is to say, in conjunction with the school. If it was a training on a skilled trade I would today greatly appreciate, therefore, with the assistance of your organization to have the two girls of mine discharged from the school I've mentioned can we be able to provide them with an education. I thank you for your kind attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nS.G.D. Samson Pelletier.\nDear Sir:\n\nSome time ago Mr. L.J. Chase, Provincial Secretary of the Canadian Legion of the British Empire Service League, forwarded to me a letter he had received from Samson Pelletier, No. 268 of the Cowessess Band, Crooked Lake Agency, regarding his two girls, Rosemary aged 12 and Muriel aged 8, who were born of a previous marriage. At that time these two girls were in residence at the Cowessess Indian Residential School and they were later transferred to the Muscowequan School at Lestock.\n\nI am attaching copy of Samson Pelletier's letter and you will note that he wishes to have the two girls stay with their stepmother, Mrs. Rose A. Pelletier, his present wife who is living at Bangor, Saskatchewan, instead of on the reserve. I presume her home was at Bangor before she married Pelletier. At the present time the two girls are living with her since it is holiday time.\n\nI was talking to Father Jeannotte a short time ago when he was in the office and I showed him the correspondence in this connection. He was of the opinion that the stepmother only wanted the two girls with her in order to get Dependent's allowance for them. This, however, does not seem to be the case because Mr. Chase had the home conditions of this woman investigated at Bangor, and I am attaching copy of a letter he received from Mr. F. Cockerton of Waldron, an ex-service man, together with copy of a statement from Mr. Charles Wade, Postmaster at Bangor, and statement signed by Muriel and Rosemary Pelletier. Evidently this woman enjoys a good reputation in the town where she lives and is capable of looking after the two girls. It also seems that it is the desire of the two girls to live with their stepmother instead of returning to school.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nYou will note by the attached.........\nYou will note by the attached correspondence from Mr. Chase that reference is made to the Cowessess School. This is where the children were in residence first but they were later transferred to the Muscowequan School at Lestock and their names appear on the roll at this school at the present time.\n\nWhatever steps the Department take in the matter I would ask to be advised so that I can inform Mr. Chase accordingly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nMC/ed General Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n0253 - Murielle Dorin Pelletier Age 3\nFather Samson Pelletier\nMother Elizabeth\nAdmitted to Muscoweygan Feb 2, 1937\n\n0254 - Rose Mary Agathe Pelletier 4 yrs\nFather Samson Pelletier\nMother Mary Elizabeth\nAdmitted to Cowessess June 4, 1936\nTransferred to Muscoweygan Feb 2, 1937\nOttawa,\nJuly 23, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to Rosemary Pelletier, No. 0254, and Murielle Pelletier, No. 0255, pupils of the Muscowequan Indian Residential School.\n\nI am inclined to agree with Father Jeannotte that the real reason for the stepmother's wish to have these children with her is to enable her to secure the dependent's allowance. However, if you feel perfectly satisfied that the stepmother is prepared to give the girls a proper home, the Department has no objection to granting their discharge. I feel, however, that before doing so you should again consult Father Jeannotte and, if he has any objections to the discharge, you should write again before approving the discharge.\n\nA review of our files shows that the girls were admitted to the Cowessess School at the ages of three and four. Apparently the father put them in the school as soon as his first wife died so as to be relieved of any responsibility for them. It is rather amusing to see how much interest he is now displaying in them, even though he is not at home to enjoy their company. I feel certain that you will give this matter very careful consideration along the lines suggested in this letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. M. Christianson,\nGen.

(RG 10, Volume 6320, file 657-10, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir;-\n\nRe letter 121-5-10 of August 31st regards applications to admit children of Albert Cyr of Gordon Band to Muscowequan School.\n\nBarbara Cyr is pupil of Gordons School #0335.\nRachel Cyr \" \" \" \" \" \" 0310.\n\nThese children were taken in by the principal of Muscowequan School this week and I notified him to return them to their home. He knows he should not admit pupils without permission of the Department, at least he has been told but he may have forgotten. I think you should also tell him again of this ruling unless you have cancelled it.\n\nRegards Harriet Cyr. The principal of Gordons discharged her as her behaviour was so bad, I think she had been instructed by the parents to act up. I would say to leave her out of all our schools at present.\n\nI know if one principal steals pupils on another principal he leaves himself wide open for similar treatment, besides the parents will play off one against the other and we will be in a nice mess.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir,\n\nWe have one child going to Muscogee Indian Residential School at Lestock. She was admitted last year. We have three others going to Gordon Indian Residential, admitted some years ago.\n\nWe would like to have them all together in the same school.\n\nAs we are all Roman Catholics, we want to send them all to the Catholic School at Lestock Muscogee Residential School.\n\nOur three girls at Gordon School are:\n\nHarriette Olive - 14 yrs old\nRachel - 12\n11B C.E.\n\nOttawa, September 10, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 5th instant, in which you intimate that Barbara Cyr, No. 0235, and Rachel Cyr, No. 0310, pupils of the Gordon's School, have been without your permission transferred to the Muscowequan School.\n\nIn a letter dated August 22, 1942, signed by Mrs. Albert Cyr, the statement is made that they have one child enrolled at the Muscowequan Residential School. However, we have made a very diligent search of our records here, and there is nothing to indicate that an admission form for the entry of this child to the Muscowequan School has been received by the Department.\n\nYou are aware, no doubt, that it has been the policy of this Department for a number of years to do everything humanly possible to discourage the transfer of pupils from a residential school operated by one church to a residential school operated by another church. Such transfers not only tend to interrupt the pupil's studies but have a most confusing effect upon the pupil from the standpoint of his religious and moral purposes. In the case of the Cyr children, it would appear that they were enrolled at the Muscowequan School without your permission and that no admission forms duly signed and asking for their admission and enrolment have reached the Department. The Department is of the opinion, therefore, that these children should be immediately returned to their home. After they have been returned to their home, their case should be very carefully reviewed by you and, if convenient, discussed with the principals of the two schools concerned. If the parents of these children are Catholic, you should give the approximate date when they became members of the Catholic Church and whether, or not, they are Catholics at this date. You should then carefully review the entire evidence and send in a definite recommendation in respect to the education of these children. If they have been transferred from the Gordon's School to the Muscowequan School simply because the parents have temporary grudge against Mr. Freyling, then you might consider the advisability of leaving them at home for a year, after the lapse of which time their claims for enrolment at a residential school might be carefully reviewed. In any event, it is certainly the intention of the Department to do everything we possibly can to prevent such transfers in the future. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Principal of the Muscowequan School for his information. I am also returning to you copy of a letter received by the Department from Mr. and Mrs. Albert Cyr.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J. W.

Again, Monday afternoon he came and made the same request, and I answered like on Sunday that I wanted to keep the boy till the end of June and that I would talk to the Agent about it. Joe did not want to wait that long apparently, took the boy from the Barn to his home.\n\nI never thought of asking the Dept. permission to keep Mathew till the end of the School year in order to not break the morale of other Pupils and our organizations as Cadets, training etc..\n\nWould the Department tell me if my move was right or not, and if it is possible to have Mathew come back to School?\n\nMay I ask for the same reason as above the permission to keep till the end of June the following pupils:\n\n#216 Desjarlais Albert 21-3-29 Birthday  \n0274 Pelletier Doris 17-2-29  \n\nI remain, Yours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nOttawa, January 27, 1945.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, the Department approves the under-mentioned pupils remaining in the Muscowequan Residential School until June 30, 1945:\n\nNo. 216 - Albert Desjarlais,\n0274 - Doris Pelletier.\n\nIf you desire to retain these pupils after that date, you should make further application, stating your reasons for desiring them to remain in the school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. V. de Varennes, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nMuscowequan Residential School,\nLestock, Sask.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nDepartmental letter No. 1-1-10 dated June 15, 1934 quotes Section 10, 1 of the \"Indian Act\" that a pupil reaching the age of sixteen should remain in school until the end of the school year, which would be some time in June.\n\nRev. de Verennes, Principal of the Muscowequan school advises me that Mathew Wolf, son of Joe Wolf, Muscowequan Band, has just reached the age of 16 and the father has taken his son from the school without permission from the Rev. Father.\n\nJoe Wolf has consulted a lawyer and has been advised that the boy does not have to remain in school after he reaches the age of 16.\n\nPlease advise me if the lawyer is correct or not. I have not an up to date Indian Act and there may be some amendments to the section of the act as quoted above.\n\nR.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 13, 1945.\n\nMr. R. S. Davis, Indian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant,\nwith reference to Mathew Wolf removing his son from\nthe Muscowequan Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is regretted that the Principal of the\nMuscowequan School allowed the father to take the boy;\nbut, as this has now been done, we cannot see any\nreason for returning him to the school. If such\naction were taken, it would simply be the cause of\ntrouble to all parties concerned.\n\nHowever, the Principal of the Muscowequan\nSchool should be very definitely informed that pupils\nshould not be allowed to leave school simply because\nthey have reached the age of 16. You will note that\nSection 10 (1) of the Indian Act mentions \"the full\nage of 16\". This has always been interpreted to mean\nuntil the child reaches his 17th birthday. In any\ncase, we have not authorized discharge of any pupil\nsimply because he or she has reached the 16th birth-\nday during the academic year. In all such cases we\nfeel that the child should complete the academic year,\nboth in his own interests and in the conduct of any\nresidential school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDavid Gordon (Treaty Indian) Indian Act (10)\nGordons Indian Reserve, Saskatchewan.\n\n29-12-44.\n\n1.

This same date while in the district on other Police Duties an attempt was made to contact David Gordon Jr., but it was found that he had not returned to his home and his whereabouts were unknown.\n\n2-1-45.\n\nIn the P.M. of this date the writer patrolled via Pol/Car Ford Code #6494 accompanied by Sgt. M.G. Crawford to the Gordon Indian Reserve where David Gordon Sr. was located and interviewed, when it was ascertained that the father of this boy was in error as to the correct age of David Gordon Jr. The writer pointed out to Gordon that his son would not reach the full age of 16 years until December 27th, 1945 and in compliance with the provisions of the Indian Act he must attend school until that date, whereupon Gordon stated he would return the boy to the school. Notice to return the boy was served at this time to return David Gordon Jr. to the school.\n\n5-1-45\n\n4. This P.M.

Davis, A.A. of Touchwood agency gave his advice to send my children to school and one of them was under school age at the time. He told me to send my children to Muscowequan Residential School however I carried out his instructions with respectful manner and when time came to take my two boys to school Nicholas 10 and Ronald 6. I proceeded with my family to Muscowequan Residential School to where I tried my best to enter my two boys into that school. Rev. Father Principal would not accept the young one although I explain the instructions I have received from the Indian agent to Rev. Father principal and I wanted the boys to go to school together but I made no effort of putting the two boys in the said school so I took them to Gordon's Residential School and I explain my situation to Mr. Fleming Principal of Gordon's School at that time so he accepted my both boys in the school.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Simson commissioner for oaths in and for the province of Saskatchewan. A solicitor Raymond said that my two sons be admitted in to the faith of Anglican communion &c. etc., and lately I was told by the present principal of Gordon school, Mr. Donce, that he had received a letter from Ottawa to deliver my two boys at the office indian agent, and the Indian Dept. has not yet given permission for them to be admitted and the school is receiving no grant in respect to my two boys and I also wish to state that I was brought up at Gordon school, but I married a catholic girl and I be come catholic but now I and my family join the Anglican faith and it should be distinctly understood that we are no Roman Catholic.\n\nI hope that dept. will respect my application under as herein stated matter and oblige yours truly\n\nLuke Evans\nIn the matter of the Indian Act and in the matter of an application to the Indian Department for the approval of the admission of Nicholas Sylvester Ewenin and Ronald Lee Ewenin to the Gordon's Anglican Indian Residential School of Punnichy, Sask.\n\nCANADA\nPROVINCE OF SASKATCHEWAN\nTO WIT:\n\nI, Luke Ewenin of the Post Office of Raymore in the Province of Saskatchewan, Indian, do solemnly declare:\n\n1.

That prior to being married, I was a communicant of the Church of England, and my wife was then a Roman Catholic and both of my said boys were baptised as Roman Catholics.\n\n4. That both myself and my wife have renounced the Roman Catholic faith and we have both applied to be admitted into the Faith of the Anglican Communion and to have our said boys admitted into that Faith.\n\n5. That neither myself or my wife have been influenced in any way by anyone whatsoever in making this choice for ourselves and our sons, but have done so entirely of our own free will and choice.\n\n6.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, August 27, 1946.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis, Indian Agent, Punnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nEnclosed for your information is a letter dated August 19, 1946 from Mr. Lucien Bruce, Spokesman for the Muscowequan Band.\n\nOur records agree with the statement in the letter to the effect that Daniel Bigsby No. 241 will be sixteen years of age on March 22, 1947.\n\nIt appears, also from our records that pupil No. 0241 is sixteen years of age this month and pupil No. 0214 and 0260 are each sixteen years of age. Pupil No. 0269 will not be sixteen years of age until October.\n\nYou should consult the Principal and let me have a report regarding the advisability of discharging these pupils. However, it is not our general practice to discharge a pupil immediately on attaining the age of sixteen. Such pupils are retained in the school until the close of the academic year. For instance, as shown above pupil No. 0241 will not be sixteen until March, 1947 and the Department feels that unless some very strong reason is given for his discharge he should be retained in the school until June 30th, 1947. When children are discharged immediately on attaining sixteen it not only disrupts the pupils own work but it disrupts all the pupils in the school.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to Department letter 121-5-10 (WT1) dated August 27, 1946 regarding letter from Lucien Bruce, Muscowequan Band, requesting the discharge of Daniel Big Sky No. 241, from the Muscowequan Indian Residential School, I would advise that I took this matter up with the Principal, and his reply is as follows:\n\n\"Re the discharge of Pupils No. 0214, 0260 and 0269 you may know that I have recommended their discharge in June and they have been discharged in the course of August, on the 22d I believe (ref. G-11 R.C.)\n\nI do not see any reason to discharge Pupil No. 241 Daniel Bigsky who is going to be 16 only in March 1947. It is true that last year a boy was discharged by Doctor's recommendation, his father being ill. If we discharge Daniel now, it will not help his father to work at home, because he has no farm; it may be to help him to make more home-brew as he is suspected.\n\nLater on I shall submit a list of pupils who are going to be 16 years during this Academic Year 1946-1947.\n\nFor my own part, I do not favor the discharge of pupils under 16 years of age, unless for some special reason, and pupils attaining the age of sixteen should be retained in school until the close of the academic year.\n\nAuthority for the discharge of pupils No. 0214, 0260 & 0269 was given by Department letter #121-5-10 (WT1) dated August 22, 1946.\n\nLetter from L.Bruce returned herewith.\n\nR.S.Davis,\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

His small build and under nourished look is no doubt the result of insufficient food. If he was in school he is assured of good food and plenty of it, which should overcome these defects. One could not expect his I.Q. to be very high seeing his Father is such a bright and Intelligent Gentleman. You might explain to the parents that by sending him to school we hope to improve his I.Q., but he will never be as smart a man as his father.\n\nProviding no more snow arrives it is expected that the Xray Outfit will be visiting Gordons and Muscowequan School this coming week, in which case it should be seen that this boy is x-rayed.\n\nKnowing Mr. Bruce from past experience, the only thing to do providing Father De Varrenes will accept him as a pupil, is to give him 24 hours to place this child in school, and if he does not do so take the necessary procedure laid down by the Indian Act.\n\nYours truly,\n\nsgd A.B.Simes  \nM.D.  \nMedical Superintendent  \nQu'Appelle Indian Health Unit.\n\nMr. R.S.Davis,  \nIndian Agent,  \nPUNNICHY, Sask.\nAug. 24th, 1946.\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nI have personally examined Robert Bruce in will of his parents, desiring to keep him home from school.

Father Dorge advised that this was his third trip to this district to try and get Marjorie TON to return to the school but that he was unable to do anything with her. Father Dorge requested assistance from this force in compelling Marjorie TON to attend school. He advised that her home was on the Nut Lake Indian Reserve east of Rose Valley, but that she had been living at the Chagonees I.R., all summer and practically running wild.\n\nOn the above date, accompanied by Mr. M. Gervais, Agency Assistant at the Nut Lake I.R., patrolled to the Chagonees Reserve via No. 3859. After considerable inquiries had been made about the reserve Marjorie TON was found in company of Maurice Lumberjack. Marjorie was advised that she was to return with me and then be taken to the Lestock Residential School by Father Dorge who would come for her.\n\nOn arrival at Rose Valley, the writer contacted Father Dorge and he was advised that I had Marjorie at Rose Valley. Due to other business he was unable to make the trip this evening and requested that I take Marjorie to her mother's home on the Nut Lake Indian Reserve, which I did. Mrs. TON was most anxious for Marjorie to return to the school this term and advised that she would keep Marjorie at home until Father Dorge came for her.\n\nOn the above date, Mr. Gervais, Indian Agency Assistant at the Nut Lake Indian Reserve, advised the writer that Father Dorge had taken Marjorie TON back to the Lestock school this date.\n\nIndian Affairs.

When making up this list, I took the principals of both of the above mentioned schools, on Poorman's Reserve and visited the homes and interviewed the parents, and in that way made up the list of pupils which should go to Poorman's Day School and those that should go to Muscowequan and Gordon's Residential Schools.\n\nI regret this information was not included in my letter of August 15th.\n\nA.

There is the same possibility if she remains in the school.\n\nI feel you will agree with me that it is simply impossible to operate educational institutions properly if the Medical Services, without consulting us, turn them into semi-hospitals.\n\nBernard F.

As there is some doubt on this matter you should not have admitted these children as grant-earning pupils until a definite decision has been reached.\nAs the September Return has already been paid these children were not taken off the Return.

Later, as you will know, we opened Gordon's as a two-room day school and it still continues to function as such, until such time as your Department discovers water in sufficient quantity for the Residential School to open fully. Mr. and Mrs. McNab are members of our Anglican Church and expressed their distress to our lay missionary, Mr. Robert Hicks, that their boy has been baptized into the Roman Church at Lestock. They now request me, in writing, to ask for his transfer to Gordon's Reserve so that he may attend our day school now in operation. Mr. McNab informs me that when he sent his boy to the Roman Catholic Residential School at Lestock, it was with the distinct understanding that he should not be baptized into the Roman Church.\n\nI attach a copy of the request I have received and should be glad to hear from you at your earliest convenience.\n\nI have spoken to Mr. Nixon, your agent at Punnichy, who informs me that the boy can be brought back at the parent's request.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Qu'Appelle.\n\nMEC/gbp\nAtt.\nGordon's Reserve,\nPUNNICHY, Sask.\nNovember 1, 1951.\n\nMy Lord,\n\nDuring the period that there was no school here, I sent my boy to the Roman Catholic Mission School at Lestock with the understanding that he should not be baptized Roman Catholic.\n\nI understand that he has been baptized by an Roman Catholic priest against my wishes. I would like my boy taken out of the school and sent to the Gordon's Day School and baptized in our Anglican Church if this is possible.

You state therein that: \"Before accepting any child in a residential school for the first time, the principal must have the regular application and certificate of health properly completed, signed by the Indian Superintendent and approved by the department.\" - end of quote.\n\nMay I point out that this practice will involve a great deal of difficulties, and hardship as far as we are concerned. The practice here has been to round up the children at a set date, and have Parents sign a sheet for new pupils at the same time. Now if we cannot bring along these new pupils immediately, who will see to it that the parents have their child examined by a doctor? the health certificate completed? and so on...\nWe have 3 reservations, North of our school one at 8 miles\nthe others at 100 miles from school. So these Indians are\nstill very much attached to their Indian ways, very little in\nfavor of education, this new way of doing will mean, that\nnew pupils will not come in on time, there will be\ndelays of months before they will show up. This will mean\nextra work in the class room, this will be very much detri-\nmental to the school and pupils in general.\n\nIf you can tell us how to go about their new way of\ndoing, it would be very please to read your\n\nSincerely,\n\nP.E.

Havens,\nI/C Indian Agency,\nPunnichy, Sask.,\n\nI have a letter from Father P.E. Tetrault, O.M.I., Principal of the Muscowequan Indian Residential School referring to our circular regarding the admission of Indian children to residential school.\n\nIn his letter the Principal states that there is considerable difficulty in having the physical examination completed prior to sending the children to residential school. The Department realizes these difficulties, however, it is felt that the principals and local Indian Superintendents can make suitable arrangements to have the face of the applications completed and signed by the parents and the Indian Superintendent. When the children are brought to the residential school, arrangements should be made to have the local Medical Superintendent visit the school and perform the necessary physical examinations to have the back of the application form completed.\n\nIt is realized that it is not always possible to have this carried out before September 1st when the children are usually placed in a residential school consequently in such instances, it will be in order to have the physical examinations performed during the month of September or at least\nprior to the Principal forwarding the Quarterly Return for payment. By following this procedure the Principal will be in a position to forward his Quarterly Return together with the applications for admission. When these are received the applications will be considered and if admission is approved, the school will be entitled to full grant claimed.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would give this information to Father Tetrault.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSept.5 1945\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Muscowequan Indian Residential School Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child ____________________________\nEnglish name ____________________________\nAge ____________________________\nName of Band ____________________________\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid ____________________________\nFather's full name and No. ____________________________\nMother's full name and No. ____________________________\nParents living or dead ____________________________\nState of child's health ____________________________\nReligion ____________________________\nDoes applicant speak English? ____________________________\nPreviously attended ____________________________\n\n(Signature of father)\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNOTE.\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

We have checked our records and find the present enrolment at the school is between 37 and 39 and one non-Indian child. In 1950 the enrolment was between 40 and 41.

As soon as Mr. Kitella told them this they got in their sleigh and drove 25 miles to Lestock, and asked to have their religion changed from Protestant to Catholic so that their children would not have to attend a school so far from home.

In view of this information, no further action is taken on her application for admission to the Muscowequan school.\n\nWith reference to Olive Matechuck, it is noted that this girl has been in the Muscowequan school and will now be discharged. In view of this information no action is taken on her application for admission to the Muscowequan school. As the Principal saw fit to admit this girl to the school without first having her admission approved, the Department is not prepared to allow any Per Capita grant for the period this girl was in the Muscowequan school.\n\nWith reference to Helen Matechuck, in your letter it is noted you state that it is not possible to place this girl in the Poorman's school as there is no room there. We have checked our records and find the present enrolment at the school is between 37 and 39 and one non-Indian child. In 1950 the enrolment was between 40 and 41. The present average of attendance is 36. In view of the decreased enrolment from last year...\nwe do not see any reason why this girl can not be placed in the Poorman's school.

Maclean, O'Brien Lake, he says in reply to questions from me:\n\nSix of our pupils are Indians' treaty children, but none of them although we have had them nearly a year is not allowed to be shown on the Register; nor are we allowed any thing better in rations or clothes for them as they are not of school age. Also you know it is a great advantage to all concerned that the children should be taken from the influence of their own filthy homes at an early age as possible.\n\nSince the S.D., we get as follows: $300 per ann. for teaching, and in the way of rations, one pound of flour per day for each child whose age is shown on register. Also since the first day of last May we received 99\u00bd lbs fresh beef, or as near as possible, one pound of beef for the total number of these children on an average during that time.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6320, file 658-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWe also get an allowance of 4 ozs of biscuit every school day, the chief attendants (nothing for Sundays) in the way of clothing we get our little, after 2 yards of cloth (I think) for pants & coat, also 30 yards of ginghams, and 1/2 a cowhide for mocamis, etc all I know, we might have got more in the way of clothes if we begged for it, but I am a poor beggar.\n\nMr. Matheson is a most excellent and devoted man, he is carrying on the school with great self sacrifice.

A. MacKay\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina.\nMy dear Mr. Head,\n\nOn receipt of yours of 26 ult., will therefore return school at Okanagan. I wrote at once to Rev. J.R. Matheson, the missionary in charge and sent him a copy of it. His replies are now before me.\n\nI shall not trouble you by detailing you every detail he says, but shall content myself with giving the substance of it. Apparently, the Agent visited the school on Nov. 26. His first question was put to the young chief as to what was taught there. The boy answered, \"We learn English.\" The Agent then asked, \"Well, what's it doing now?\" This question was answered by the chief. The Agent then turned to a little boy who had been attending the school for a short time. Asked him what kind of day it is. The answer was \"It's cold,\" said Mr. Matheson, ended the scene of the school.\nI make no comment on the matter. I am aware that every since the rebellion it has been a hard struggle to keep the school going and that Mr. Macdonald's efforts all along have not made it easier to carry it on. He has been greatly helped by our late and present missionary if he is, or he should be, most impartial. Mr. Macdonald says \"we have not got our last quarter paid yet owing to a mistake. Believe in the return\u2014a mistake forced upon us by the agent who would not take them till the mistake was remedied.\"\n\nMayor Mr. Cotton is, I am sure quite fair; if his report is at all like the one then I feel assured there is ground for complaint. Mayor Mr. Cotton knows very well what the great difficulties we have experienced in keeping the school going. We have no right to look for favors from the Dept\u2014but I feel you will want justice done. While I have myself no sympathy with an effort which I feel must under the circumstances fail, I do wish Mr. Macdonald's work were not so much neglected. (He is a sufficient teacher qualified in Manitoba)\nto receive justice. And, I understand you have wrote this letter. Mr. Smith wrote Nov. 23rd.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nCynthia Saskatchewan Valley\n\nHarper Reed Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent\nIndian Dep't.\nOnion Lake Park, Feb. 18\n\nDeputy Dept. Chief of Indians Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nIn this part of the country there is no school for the half-breed or white children, some of them the children of employees of the Indian Dept., and it is impossible for us protestants to form ourselves into a school district, and the parents are too poor to build a school or hire a teacher. Under these circumstances would you kindly give me permission to teach them in the mission buildings on this reserve. I will promise that they will in no way interfere with the work of teaching the Indians' children and you agree here would be able at any time to see that the Indians were not in any way put to a disadvantage by our being allowed this privilege by your Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.R. Matheson\n\nHughes Reed Esq.,\nOffice\nIndian Agent's Office,\n\nUnion Lake\n\nMarch 5, 1896\n\nFebruary 18th, 1896\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to herewith enclose a letter from Mr. Macdonald requesting permission to erect a school for a number of Half-breed children in connection with the Indian School here.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeo.

Mayne Daly\n\nIt may be done among\n\nnoting you at this time or\nperhaps it is Mr. Reid & Co.\n\nhave so this to do I know\nyou will be kind enough to\nattribute my mistake to\nmy ignorance & also to request\nthere are three things which\nbring to your notice.\n\n1st The great need of a chimney\nin our school & of having the\nbuilding painted for the protection\nof the building these things are\nrequired especially in the\ndanger of fire which may cause\nloss of life. Although I have taken\nall precautions possible still the\npipes running through dry lumber\nalways are a source of danger.\nThe mission has already spent $500.00 and I personally have spent $208.00 more, besides my own labor and I am willing to furnish all labor for building a chimney and furnishing a building if your dept will furnish the material & allow me a grant of money and I will buy these things myself.\n\nI would also ask that I be allowed to place the names of those two little children, Sarah Theresa aged 4/12 and Samuel Henry aged 6/12 on the school register and be allowed either the usual grant for them or else be given rations from the agency for them. The boy is not paid treaty money, but she is the daughter of a stone blind squaw & her mother lives at our treaty Indians.\nWe have kept both these children for two years without a thank (or any help) and would urge your kind consideration of the matter.\n\nIt is for the advantage of the children that they should be taken at early age separate from their old association and especially in the case of these two children whose mothers are both unmarried women and one of them perfectly helpless and now the mother of another child.\n\nI will not trouble you about the third matter but would earnestly ask your help in these two cases I have brought to your notice.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ.M. MacKenzie\nSir,\n\nReferring to a letter addressed to Superintendent General by Rev. Mr. Matheson asking for certain help in his school, he begs to enclose us to purchase sufficient bricks to build chimneys and paint the buildings. He further agrees to furnish all labour.\n\nMr. Matheson requests also that chimney be built in which he asks assistance in making bricks. We are hereby authorized to make an issue of one pound of flour and one pound of beef to each.\n\nKindly advise Rev. Mr. Matheson of action taken.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs\n\nIndian Affairs.

Their mother is a Treaty Indian and lives on the reserve with her parents, as her husband has deserted her for more than a year, and is hardly likely ever to return, and why should these poor children be refused the privileges accorded to illegitimate or Treaty Indian women outside men, because their mother had the misfortune to be casually married to a white man?\n\nTo my own knowledge the woman was refused permission by the department to abandon her Treaty & to count as a half breed or white woman, although she applied for it more than three years ago.\nAnd the grounds on which her request was refused (and very wisely refused) was that at some future time her husband might desert her, and then she would be in a bad plight and would be outside all help from the department.\n\nThings have turned out as they predicted, and for the simple reason that her children have been born in lawful wedlock. She has hesitated about enrolling them as pupils earning the per capita grant until I had communicated with your department.\n\nHoping for a favorable answer,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.R.

The couple were lawfully married, but the husband deserted his wife over a year ago and is not likely ever to return.\n\nMrs Dillon was refused permission to abandon her treaty relationship and be counted a half-breed or white woman, although she applied for it more than three years ago, her two children are, perhaps, entitled to special consideration.\n\nThe per capita allowance for this Protestant school is limited to 15 pupils, and at present there are only 12 children earning the grant; whereas at the Roman Catholic boarding school on the same Reserve, 50 pupils are provided for and 45 are earning the grant.\nOTTAWA, 9th September, 1896.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Rev. J.R. Matheson, Principal of the Church of England Boarding School at Onion Lake, has applied to the Department for authority to enroll on the school register the names of the two children of William and Ethel Dillon and to include them among the earners of the per capita grant.\n\nMr. Matheson states that Mrs. Dillon was lawfully married to her husband, who is a white man; that the latter deserted her over a year ago and is not likely ever to return; that this woman applied for commutation of treaty three years ago and was refused on the ground that her husband might at some time desert her, in which event she would be outside of help from the Department.\n\nMr. Matheson adds that for some time he has kept these children at the school at his own expense.\n\nI am directed to say that under all the circumstances the Department has decided that these children can fairly be considered as Indian and may therefore be received into the school as pupils, provided there are vacancies.

(RG 10, Volume 6320, file 658-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nI have written Mr. Laird, Indian Commissioner, today regarding a grave difficulty which faces every Indian school teacher or principal in North-West Canada. That is, the impossibility to persuade a copy of the Indian parents' heads their children to school.\n\nOn this reserve & Agency I can easily find about eighty (80) children of school age. (Perhaps one hundred would be much nearer the truth.) In some cases the parents of these children get their weekly rations from the department stores. The teacher or missionary is utterly powerless in the matter of persuading or forcing the parents to send their children to school. The Indians either simply laugh, or point blank refuse; or in some instances take the children away, a copy their own.\naway after they have been in school for some time and all efforts to get them back are utterly futile. The teacher or principal here is simply at the mercy of any Squaw or Indian who wishes to take a child away.\n\nIt has happened often in this school, and either the authorities are afraid to enforce the law or there is no law for them to enforce. Which is it? Our schools are languishing for want of scholars, there are bands of children running all over the reserve, 3 school age. Parents or others can beat a boy away a child from school & refuse to bring it back, and without a request for assistance from the authorities, having the child back is either refused outright, or only grudgingly thereafter performed. In fact they tell us plainly to go to magistrate sooner or a warrant and take all responsibility yourself. Providing a Dominion Police man or other party after the child, and in every way show that they do not want to take any steps in the matter. Have we no authority in the matter? Is the Act Regulations relating to the Education of Indian Children\nas passed by the Governor General and Council Nov 18th 1894, & especially Clause 12 so substituted or enacted April 1st 1895, copies which were sent me by the Indian Department at that time, a dead letter or are we supposed, or allowed to put them in force?\n\nSurely if compulsory education is good for the white race it ought also for the Indians; and if it is necessary to compel white people, by law, send their children to work it is much more as well regard Indians, who cannot be supposed to judge for their selves, and whose whole upbringing for generations has been wholly without educational advantage.\n\nThe Indians know full well we are unable, from some cause or another, to compel them send their children to school and they take very good care to show us that we cannot do so. I plead not only in my own name but in the name of every man who has anything to do with the education of Indian children, that something definite be done in this matter.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Matheson, principal of the Church of England boarding school at Onion Lake, has called the attention of the Department to the fact that there are a number of children on that reserve and agency who are receiving no education, as their parents neglect to send them to school.\n\nThese Indians are in receipt of rations, and it is thought that something might be done through the Agent to induce the parents to send their children to school, and would like you to communicate with that officer with a view to finding out what can be done to have these children educated.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nLast August I made application to your Commission in Winnipeg, for permission to take as pupils of this school, drawing the per capita grant from the Indian Department, certain non-Indian children. I name the names of ten children, some of whom I got from among the Indians, and nearly all of whom are children of Indian mothers, and have been left orphans, or were twin orphans, by the death of their mother by their father, after living with the woman for years. Their case is really pitiful. They are waifs & outcasts among the Indians and have none to care for or provide for them.\n\nThey are in most cases illegitimate, and unless some institution takes them up to care for them, they will undoubtedly form part of our criminal class in the near future.\n\nThere, at anyone's expense, as is well known, care for and education there for where admission has been refused, for some years, but the load is getting very heavy for me. Mr. Laird has definitely refused to admit any one of the ten names submitted to him to be enrolled as pupils drawing any grant from the Department.\n\nI readily grant he is perfectly justified in doing so, on the ground that your department is only responsible for the education & care of Indian children, and have nothing to do with illegitimate waifs, or half breed children.\n\nMarch 19th\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6320, file 658-1, part 1)\nI do not claim that these children have any legal claim on your department. I ask it only, and entirely, as an act of mercy or charity on your part. They are to turn up there who are, to all intents and purposes, Indian children and needing the protection; but through no fault of their own are cast among the Indians, without any of the privileges and advantages given to Indians.\n\nNow what I ask is this, that I be permitted by your department to place on the school register, as Indian children drawing the annual grant allowed to our Boarding School, five of the number at present in this school. I am allowed to draw the grant for twenty pupils, but find it impossible at present to obtain near that number of Indian children.\n\nPromise that as soon as I can get an Indian child proper to put in the place of any one of them, that I will immediately take the name of the non-Indian child off the register and replace it with that of the Indian child, so this is first for me an Indian child, and in all cases preference must be given to Indian children.\n\nI do not often trouble your department for favors or help, and I do assure you that this case is one of great necessity, and if you can by any means make an exception in this case, it will be not only a help tome in this work, but a blessing and help to the children as deeply concerned. At another time I send the names and history, as near as I can, of some of the children.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Cotrell had the children baptized, hence the names, but he actively deserted them, as they were not his, and the mother had died. I do not know where Cotrell is now but think he has left the country entirely. Joseph and Maria Gladien were put by myself among the Moore lake Indians.

Mr. Matheson\nOttawa, February 31, 1907.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nWith reference to the removal of children from boarding or industrial schools by their parents at any time, I beg to say that Indian children once admitted, either under the regulations passed by His Excellency the Governor General in Council by virtue of Sections 137 and 138, 57 and 58 Vic., or with the consent of their parents, cannot be removed without the permission of the Superintendent General, as by an amendment to the regulations, dated April 1, 1896, Sec. 12 was repealed and the following sub-section substituted therefor\u2014(Regulations and amendment herewith).\n\nThis amendment provides that, should any child in an industrial or boarding school leave such school without permission of the Superintendent General, the Assistant Indian Commissioner, or of the Principal of the school, or should any child who has been allowed out fail to return at the stipulated time, an Indian Agent or Justice of the Peace shall, on information made to that effect by any Officer of the school, issue a warrant authorizing the person named therein to search for and take such child back to and again place it in the school in which it had been placed as aforesaid. But notwithstanding anything in this section, it shall be competent for any employee of the Indian Department, or any constable to arrest any child found in the act of escaping from any industrial or boarding school and to convey such child to the school from which it escaped.\nI consider that this amended clause would justify any Principal in refusing to allow a Parent to remove his child without permission.\n\nP. S. There is nothing on file to show that Mr. Agent Sibbald had any authority for making the statement attributed to him by the Rev. Mr. Matheson, Principal of the Onion Lake Boarding School, that Indian children could be taken from school at any time by their parents. In fact the correspondence shows that the Agent was to be instructed to withhold rations from the Parents of children at home who are fit to attend school but are not sent. These instructions were sent to the Indian Commissioner on April 30, last, and I think it would be well to ask him for a copy of his letter to Mr. Agent Sibbald on this subject. As I have pointed out above, the regulations prohibit the removal of a child without permission from an industrial or boarding school.\nOttawa, April 6, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nRev. Mr. Matheson, Principal of the Onion Lake school, applies for permission to enroll six or eight non-treaty children. This school is allowed 20 pupils, but his last return shows that he had only 13 Indian children on the roll. He has a large number of half-breeds and non-treaty children that he has kept at his own expense, and as he is experiencing difficulty in filling up his school with Indian children he wishes to draw the grant for the children named in the list he has forwarded. These are all illegitimate half-breeds, who have been living on the reserve and brought up as Indians. They are not, under the Commissioner's ruling, entitled to be considered grant-earners at the school.\n\nThe case of these children is peculiarly hard, as most of them are orphans, children of Indian mothers by white or half-breed fathers, who deserted them. Mr. Matheson says they are waifs and outcasts among the Indians and have none to care or provide for them, and unless some institution takes them up they will undoubtedly form part of our criminal class in the near future.\n\nWhile the action of the Commissioner in refusing to place them on the roll as grant-earners appears to be justified from his standpoint, it is a question whether the broad ruling of the late Minister in his memorandum of October 18, 1899, would not permit of an exception being made in favour of children of this par-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6320, file 658-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nticular class. His memorandum is as follows:\n\n\"The Indian Commissioner is to be informed, in reply to his letter of the 18th ult., that I have given the subject referred to therein careful consideration, and that I cannot approve of the absolute rule which he has laid down that none but treaty children are to be admitted to Indian schools. A well defined line can be drawn between Halfbreeds, properly speaking, and Indians. While I do not consider that the children of the Halfbreeds proper of Manitoba and the Territories should be admitted into Indian schools and paid for by the Department, I am decidedly of the opinion that all children, even those of mixed blood, whether legitimate or not, who live upon an Indian reserve and whose parents on either side live as Indians upon a Reserve, even if they are not annuitants, should be eligible for admission to the schools. It must be remembered that boarding and industrial schools were not established for the purpose of carrying out the terms of the treaty or complying with any provision of the law, but were instituted in the public interest, so that there should not grow up upon reserves an uneducated and barbarous class. The North West Government cannot provide for the education of non-annuitants upon reserves; and if we exclude them from our schools, they will practically be barred from all means of education.\"\n\nSince the date of that memorandum, the new provincial governments have been established, and although they have no institutions for the care of\norphans and neglected children in operation as yet, I think that the Rev. Mr. Matheson might make application to the local government of the province to which these children belong for a grant to assist them in maintaining them at the school, notwithstanding the memorandum above quoted it would appear to be a bad policy on the part of this Department to in any way put a premium on illegitimacy.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, February 27th, 1907.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Benson.\n\nWith reference to memorandum prepared by you regarding the right of Indian parents to take their children from school, I beg to say that I am informed by the Reverend Mr. Matheson that recently the Agent stated to a meeting of the Indians that they had a right to take their children from school whenever they so desired.\n\nI think that both the Agent and Commissioner should be written to to ascertain if instructions along this line have been issued and if such a statement was made by the Agent.

In fact, the correspondence shows the contrary.\n\nThe amendment to clause 13 of the regulations would justify any principal in refusing to allow a parent to remove his child from any boarding or industrial school without permission, and the Department does not wish the Indians to become possessed of the idea that they can remove their children when they please, as it is contrary to the purpose for which these schools were established and subversive of all discipline.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nM.D. McLean,\nSecretary.\n\nW. Sibbald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo re information received by the Department to the effect that the Agent recently stated to the Indians of the Onion Lake Agency that they had a right to take their children from school whenever they so desired. I cannot from correspondence here make out what this refers to, but I feel fairly sure that the Indian Agent did not convey such information, or at least cannot quote my authority therefor. Such instructions would be against the Department's policy, and I never meant to convey any such meaning.\n\nHowever, a misconception may have been created among the Indians by the conduct of one of them. This one has been having too much his own way, and I gave instructions to the Indian Agent, copy of which letter of the 28th of November last is enclosed. The case referred to was about some pupils retained home by parents without permission and as such considered as deserters.\n\nI may also quote an extract from a letter dated the 21st, Feb. 1906 from myself to the Principal of the Onion Lake C.E. School in a similar case. \"As regards deserters the regulations devolve it upon you to put the law in motion\". This refers to section 12 of the School Regulations, where some officer of the school must lay the information necessary for the issue of a warrant to take back an absentee without leave from the school.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nWhile an Indian Agent can issue a warrant if such information is made to him by an officer of the school, I do not consider he can be called upon to employ constables to take back deserters to school, unless they are in the very act of escaping, without the proper information has been made and a warrant issued.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 8th instant respecting the Badger children. I very much regret the trouble that has arisen about their attendance at the R.C. School. In my letter of the 16th October expressing a trust that they would soon be returned to school, I scarcely meant that you were to use the Police; but only your best influence.\n\nFrom the notes of statements made by the Indians before you on the 8th instant I feel that, if true, they have some reason to complain of the treatment the pupils receive in school. Not only putting the boys to help at washing, overworking young girls when nearing maturity, but the ear-twisting for punishment should be dropped, the latter absolutely. When the children have sore necks or are tender about the throat, this sort of punishment is cruel.\n\nI think it would be well to call the meeting of Indians you propose, speak to them in a persuasive manner, assure them the overwork and ear-twisting will be discontinued, and tell them the Indian Commissioner and the Department are most anxious that they should send their children to school.\n\nSection 7 of the School Regulations does not apply to Boarding Schools. Sections 9, 12, and 13 principally apply to taking and keeping Indian children of school age in Boarding Schools. We do not wish to apply force, if we can avoid it; yet we urge them to send their healthy children to be educated. The Government has helped the Indians a good deal, and they ought to listen to its advice, and give their children a chance not only to speak, read, and write English, but also the girls to cook and sew, and the boys to garden and tend cattle.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake Agency.\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\n(Signed) D. Laird,\nOttawa, March 30, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th inst., with enclosures, relative to a statement alleged to have been made to the Onion Lake Indians that they had a right to take their children from school whenever they so desired; and in reply I beg to say that your explanations are satisfactory, but as the complaint referred particularly to the Church of England school, the Department will await a reply from Mr. Agent Sibbald, who was written to for an explanation as to how the Indians obtained this erroneous impression before further action is taken.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D.

There are 12 heads of families altogether who have children fit to be admitted to school, of whom 3 receive rations regularly, a widow, an aged man, and a man becoming blind, 3 receive rations frequently and 6 very seldom, only when really in want.\n\nThere are a number of Indians at Island Lake who draw treaty, but receive no help from the Department, they live by hunting and fishing and have a good many children of school age, and again at Long Lake there are a few children of school age, but the parents are self-supporting.\n\nSince your letter was written, two applications for admission to the R.C. School have been sent you and today I have had the promise of another.\n\nIt would be well I think if you would instruct me not to give assistance in the way of food or clothing to any who have children of school age, not attending school, leaving me some discretionary power where circumstances are pressing.\n\nHon.

In your opinion, would it be judicious for pressure to be brought upon these Indians, to induce them to do their duty in the above respect, by informing them that as the Department is anxious that their healthy children of school age should be in school, that unless such children, for whose support at home rations are in part supplied, are sent to some school of their own choice, the rations to such families will be cut down or entirely withheld?\n\nBe good enough to answer at an early date according to your best judgment.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) D.

This is a hardship of which they could relieve themselves by complying with the wish of the Department and sending their children to the school of their choice where they would be fed and clothed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, April 11, 1906.\n\nRev.

This apparent hardship, he says, would be relieved by the parents' complying with the Department's wishes to send their children to the boarding schools, where they would be fed and clothed.\n\nAs this is about the only way in which the schools can be filled up in this agency, I would recommend that the Commissioner's suggestion be given a trial.\nOttawa, April 30, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th inst., with enclosures, making certain suggestions as to what might be done to induce the Indians of the Onion Lake Agency to send their children to school, and in reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your suggestion that the Agent might be instructed to withhold rations from the parents for children at home who are fit to attend school but are not sent, and this suggestion might be given a trial.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa,_________________________190_\n\n1753-3-1 - 20 Apr '06 (p 380 of 601\ndo 12 Feb '06\ndo 20 Oct\n\nDr. M.B.

Sirs\u2014\n\nWith reference to your verbal statement, made in February, last, to the Deputy Superintendent General of this Department, that the Agent at Onion Lake had said at a meeting of the Indians that they had the right to take their children from school whenever they so desired, I beg to say that both the Agent and the Indian Commissioner, who were written in reference to this matter, state positively that they never conveyed any such idea to the Indians.\n\nThe regulations relating to the education of Indian children are very plain in regard to this, and any Principal would be justified in refusing a parent to remove his child from any boarding or industrial school without permission, and the Department has been careful not to allow the Indians to become possessed of the idea that they can remove their children when they please, as it is contrary to the purpose for which these schools were established and subversive of all discipline.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. J. R. Matheson,\nPrincipal,\nOnion Lake (C.E.) Boarding School,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nApril 9th, 1877\n\nI am indeed glad to hear that you have made a strong impression in regard to the matter of the Indians having rights to move their children from school when they please. I certainly understand distinctly that that was the gist of what you said at their meeting. It was just simply told that at their meeting, it was just simply told that the interpreter, Mr. Wilson, did not understand what Mr. Wilson said, or he deliberately misconstrued the interpreter's words.\n\nI believe that interpreter was quite capable of making such \"mistakes,\" and the fact that he is no longer interpreter for your agent, gives great satisfaction to all of us here.\n\nThe Indians spoke their minds, and wished me interpreter for them because they said they \"knew their words were not rightly interpreted.\"\n\nThere is very little danger of any mistakes being made with the present interpreter.\n\nSincerely thanking you for the trouble you took in this matter, and knowing now our real position we stand in regard to the children.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Principal is inclined to lead the Department to believe, that a misunderstanding may have arisen thro' misinterpreting, either accidently or purposely. However in duty to the interpreter and myself, it is right to inform you, that such in my opinion, is not the case, and the Rev. Father Cunningham, who was present at the meeting - when I spoke to the Indians on the subject - states that I did not say anything that would lead the Indians to have any such impression.\n\nFather Cunningham, who speaks Cree perfectly, also states that nothing was interpreted incorrectly, and that if any serious mistake, such as the one implied had been made, he would not have let it pass without some remark.

Hibbald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nDear Mr. Lean,\n\nThe management of the East School has been recently disturbed by the illness of the Rev. Principal, Mr. Matheson. The circumstances are such that I think it better to report unofficially.\n\nMr. Matheson left here about Aug. 14th, as I understand, for Edmonton, suffering in his usual health, at least so far as those outside the mission could judge. I heard nothing more about him until Saturday, 26th Aug., when I learned that Dr. Matheson, his wife, had received a telegram from him, from Winnipeg, saying that he had to undergo an operation on the eye. Dr. Matheson consequently started, in short notice, for Lloydminster to take train for Winnipeg. Enquiries made by wire from here revealed that Matheson had left Winnipeg for Rochester Hospital, Minnesota, and had started before Dr. Matheson reached Winnipeg. That is the last I have heard of Dr. Matheson and it is surmised that she has followed her husband to the hospital; he evidently does not know that his wife has followed him because the last mail received here in 2nd Inst. brought a post card from the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6320, file 658-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nhospital, addressed by him to his wife to the effect that he would shortly undergo the operation.\n\nI am somewhat in the dark as to the actual position but his having had to go on from Winnipeg to Red River hospital makes things look serious.\n\nWith regard to the school and mission Mr. Matheson (35) has left a trustworthy woman in charge, Mrs. Broubridge, the wife of a settler in the neighborhood, and a new teacher has been engaged for the school, Joseph Chamberlain by name, an ex-pupil of the Battleford Industrial School. The pupils had hardly all reassembled after the summer holidays, when Mr. Matheson seems to have realized his condition. Now there are only 3 Indian children attending, besides these there are 11 non-Indian children attending.

This boy was a pupil of this school since immediately after the July holidays, or even during the holidays, so his request was made along side of us, and he had to go back next school term. The request was made the first day he began when he came here for a short while to help his father. School is still in full swing, but there is no grant for the two quarters Sept. & Dec., 1911. It was no fault of mine, or negligence on my part, that you had not received the papers necessary to place him here, lying in a hospital in Medicine Hat, a considerable part of the first half might have come here for me.\n\nSincerely yours,\nH.M.

Newnham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa, August 26, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan has recommended the closing of the Onion Lake (C.E.) school and the substitution therefor of an improved day school where a teacher and a field matron would be employed, as is done in a number of other instances.\n\nThe Department would like to have your opinion as to the probability of the success of a day school at this point. You should report on the number of children of school age, the distances they reside from the school and give such other information as you can regarding the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. Sibbald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of Aug. 26th, No. 1175557 regarding the question of substituting an improved day school for the present Church of England Boarding School.\n\nBefore expressing a positive opinion on the matter, I would like to be clear upon the manner in which the improved day schools are conducted. The only information I have regarding them is that contained in your letter of Oct. 19th, No. 304033 but in that letter nothing is said about a \"field test.\" I have not until today had a prospect of speaking with Mr. Maclean, the Principal of the existing boarding school, about this proposed change in schools, he also is ignorant as to the management of these and is unable to express an opinion. I would be glad if you would kindly advise me with regard to the manner in which they are conducted.\n\nYou will remember that the\nIndians of Keku were recommended Long Lake have frequently petitioned for a day school but have not received any encouragement of late towards getting one. Not long ago I met His Lordship Bishop Lefebvre in conversation with whom he spoke unfavourable of the day schools and as you know he encouraged the opening of one at Keku Reserve. Often it must not be forgotten that a fairly successful R.C. Boarding school exists at Onion Lake which would not be benefited by the opening of a day school at Keku.\n\nIt does not follow however that an improved day school at Onion Lake would not be better for the reserve than the existing R.C. Boarding School. Though it behooves us to take any steps in the best interest of the Indians with the best intentions now I can speak with the Indians whose feeling in the case favor. I think should be recognized but before doing so would like to understand the nature of the proposed day school.\n\nI am\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.O. Baldwin\nIndian Agent\n\nP.S.

In the diocese of the Bishop of Saskatchewan there are several schools conducted in this way and they have proved quite successful. I might mention John Smiths, James Smiths, Sturgeon Lake and Ahtahkakoops and in the near future Red Pheasants and Little Pines. At the reserves just mentioned the Department has provided or is providing residences for the teachers as well as suitable class-room accommodation and in some instances where it is absolutely necessary transport of the children to school, particularly during inclement weather.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

It is my impression that these improved day schools are not conducted in close connection with an established mission; that is, the mission has nothing to do with the management of the school beyond taking a natural interest in an institution under the auspices of the church it represents.\n\nI enclose a list of children who may be looked upon as likely pupils for a day school, but would point out that the distance, in many instances, from their homes to the present boarding school, is considerable; some six, some five miles; for instance, the first four are 6 miles in one direction; two of the Roman Catholics are 5 miles in another, and the four referred to in third paragraph - two 78/119 and two 72/119 - are each family 6 miles distant in different directions. It would mean at least the engaging of three teams daily, unless some would supply their own conveyance.\n\nA most important phase in the whole matter that must not be overlooked, is that frequently many of these families are away from the reserve, hunting and on other pursuits taking their families with them; so that a very regular attendance could not be looked for. Under the circumstances I think it is very questionable if a day school would be as successful as a boarding school properly conducted.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 24th ultimo, No.117555/1, and to report as follows:\n\nI arranged for a meeting of the Protestant Indians of Onion Lake reserve on Saturday the 18th instant for the purpose of speaking about the establishment of an improved day school on the reserve, to take the place of the present boarding school. Very few, however, attended and some of the information I have gathered from conversing separately with those that did not attend.\n\nI have had the promise of 10 boys and 3 girls - Protestant children - and 1 boy and 3 girls, Roman Catholic children; besides these 2 Protestant (Meeseehow 78/119) and 2 Roman Catholic (Pahtaykan 72/119) children that very probably would attend. There are also three children, Alice Faithful, Agnes Waskahat and Annie Mathias, from Frog Lake, now at the boarding school, which the principal would be willing to arrange still to clothe and board at the C. of E. Mission and allow to attend the day school.\n\nIn speaking with the Rev: J.R.Matheson, he says that he is willing to agree to anything that will be to the benefit of the Indians, and to give the new proposition a years trial, and, if wished, to give kitchen and schoolroom accommodation. Arrangements could also be made for accommodating the teacher and field matron.\n\nI do not know how such an arrangement would meet\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant with reference to the proposed closing of the Onion Lake Boarding School and opening an improved day school and in reply, I beg to say that the Department is in favour of this proposition being carried out, but it would prefer for the reasons you give that Mr. Matheson's resignation should come in through you rather than that the Department should ask for it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLennan\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Mowinckel, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am sorry that I forgot one matter which I wished to mention to you when I was with you the other day. It is about the closing of the Onion Lake Boarding School and the opening of a day school instead. When the I.D. spoke of doing this both Archdeacon Mackay and myself agreed that it might well be done, because the school was not sufficiently staffed and had a very small list of pupils. The I.D. has not notified myself or Rev. J. R. Matheson as to an indefinite date of closing. The I.D. wished me to call on Mr. Matheson to resign. I have not done so, and I took ground that it is not my duty to do so. When the I.D. finally closes the school, that will naturally do away with any need for resignation. Considering Mr. Matheson's age, and the faithful work he has done for many years, I did not feel that I could ask him to resign. I have had the school and mission visited and inspected lately, with the result that I would ask for further consideration, or delay, in closing the boarding school, for the following reasons:\n\n1. Mr. Matheson is in very bad health and cannot possibly continue to hold the position very long; meanwhile it would break his heart, and probably really kill him to close the school.\n\n2. There are now seventeen pupils on the roll, and more expected. The Indians are beginning to value the school more than they did.\n\n3. The staff is now ample for that number of pupils, and more efficient than for some years past. Miss Cunningham, the teacher, did very good work for us formerly at Lac la Rouge school. She also takes some of the supervision of the school. There is also a trained nurse there, assisting in the work of the school. There are also a man and his wife, the man looking after the out of doors or farm work, and his wife taking charge of the laundry. In addition they have the services of Mr. Matheson's eldest daughter, who has had experience in various branches of school work for some years.\n\nI would ask you to recommend to the I.D. that the closing of the boarding school be dropped for the present. It is the only residential school in all that portion of Saskatchewan, and if the present rate of teachers and pupils be kept up, the I.D. might wait at least until they see what is being done next summer.\n\nCommending this to your kindest consideration, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. A. Saskatchewan\n\nBishop.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the suggestion contained in the letter from His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan that the Onion Lake (O.E.) Boarding School should not be closed for the present I beg to say that, for the reasons stated in His Lordship's letter, I consider the Department would be quite justified in acceding to his request.\n\nRev. Mr. Matheson, the Principal of the school, has devoted the best portion of his life to Indian work and is deserving of consideration. Mr. Inspector Chisholm's last report on this school shows that there were eighteen pupils present, which is the number now enrolled. Although Mr. Matheson is not by any means as energetic in his management as he once was fair work is being done and Mr. Chisholm's reason for recommending the conversion of this school into a day school was that it is doubtful whether another competent man to replace Mr. Matheson could be found to take it. Mr. Agent Sibbald in his report on the proposed change, made a year ago, points out the difficulty in securing a regular attendance at the day school.\nschool on account of the distance the children live from the school. He says that it would mean at least the engagement of three teams daily, unless the pupils supplied their own conveyances, and also that many families are away from the reserve, hunting among other pursuits, taking their children with them, so that a very irregular attendance would have to be looked for.\n\nIn view of these conditions I think the boarding school might be continued, as they have a competent staff and the school is economically managed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is about the future of the Union Lake School.\n\nRev. J.R. Matheson is helpless upon his bed, will never again be able to do any work. His wife & Miss Cunningham with the staff are carrying on the school. The school is full & they could take nine children if allowed, but the grant is only for 30. But Miss carrying on the work by women only & without a responsible head is not satisfactory. I am just waiting to see if Mr. Matheson is taken to his long & last home, as I do not wish to spoil the peace of his last days by turning him out, or letting him know that others must take his place. But I am looking about & inquiring as to a suitable sub-\n\nBut before I can take any action I must know what the S.D. intends to do. Are you willing to keep the school on as a Residential school, or do you intend to keep only a day school? I have had occasion to change my mind as to the need, after my last visit to the school & the Indians of the surrounding Reserves.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6320, file 658-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFrog Lake is the only one of the large group that has a day-school & many of the children there live too far to attend it. The Indians of Frog Lake, Island Lake, etc., begged me to have the Residential School maintained. We have some children from Thunder Child's could get more. I am not very keen about Residential schools but it would seem advisable at Onim Lake unless the S.D. will multiply the Day-schools, & give more encouragement & help for the children to attend.\n\n2. If you keep it on as a Residential School there must be certain new conditions before I can accept the charge. (a) All these years the S.D. has had the use of our Bldgs. without any Charge\u2014 I believe the S.D. spent a little, a very little on them. (b) Then Mr. Matheson has always maintained that the grant of $100 per head, for only 30 children was quite insufficient, that he has every year spent a lot of his own money on the work, besides all the money that the Church spent.\n\n(a) I think that the S.D. should either buy the bldgs. or pay a liberal rent. Best to buy them, then alter & add to them to bring them up to the standard you want. I am told that your Inspector said that they were almost what was needed, that it would not take much to make them quite so. (b) I think that there should be a more liberal treatment in per Cap. grant, more pupils allowed & the grant $120.\nYou doubtless know that Rev. J. R. Matheson has always been hard to handle, so that it was impossible to get full accurate financial statements. But at any rate he did the work, kept the school going out of debt, claims were partly with his own money. In the same way he & his wife claim that they found nearly all the money for the various buildings, so that in consequence nearly all the property is theirs. We on our side, though we may object somewhat to this claim have nothing to say against it. I do not think they intend to claim eventually much of the property, but to make it over to the Church Board; but they state that they can claim it. This will perhaps somewhat mix things if we keep on the school, & the S.D. does not buy the property. The kernel of the matter is that the Church settled down there long ago, so that they had a claim on the land has been virtually allowed. That the S.D. has spent little or nothing all these years beyond the per Cap. grant. That the Church has carried on the work, & desires now to be relieved of the part of the burden that it ought not to have to carry. I should like as full an answer as possible, as to what the S.D. will do.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\nJ. A. Saskatchewan\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. Sibbald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nMEMO re ONION LAKE BOARDING SCHOOL\n\nWe are met with an immense financial problem at the very start of this school under new auspices.\n\n(1) This school has been erected and maintained for 15 years without, (I believe) any grant from the I.D. towards erection, maintenance in repair, purchase of live stock for farmland gardenland equipment for ditto. The I.D. has had the use of this without any rent being paid. The amount received per capita grant was for many years very small, and only this year reached 30 pupils or $3,000.\n\nIt is plain then that the Church, or someone acting for the Church, has for 15 years carried a load which belonged to the I.D.\n\n(2) The Church as a Corporation could do, and did, comparatively little for these buildings and stock. Various Churchmembers may have contributed at times; but Rev. J.R. Matheson was responsible for the revenue and expenditure, he never once called on the I.D. to pay his deficit or overdraft, but put his own personal income and earnings into the School property for the time being. Neither the Church nor the I.D. had a right to expect him to do this. We owe a debt to his family.\n\n(3) On the death of the Rev. J.R. Matheson, the widow consented to carry on the school till I could find a successor. I have only lately done so, a Mr. and Mrs. Ellis, with some little previous experience in Alberta Indian School, and Mrs. Matheson has resigned, and is handing over the premises and management to us.\n\nThe School will henceforth be managed in a more orthodox manner according to I.D. rules and regulations. Previously, in view of the fact that Mr. Matheson was finding the finances, and that no one else could have run the school without greater aid from the I.D. and Church, he was allowed a pretty free hand by us.\n\nNow Mr. Ellis is responsible to the I.D., and also to myself and my committee, and the usual returns must be kept and rendered.\n\nI believe Indian Agent Sibbald and his Assist. Mr. Turner are inclined to have confidence that Mr. Ellis will make good, if he has half\nThe buildings are\n\n(a) the original house, for Principal, some of staff, dining rooms and kitchen and girl's dormitory.\n\n(b) the new building, class rooms, boys' dormitory, and the rest of the staff.\n\n(c) a neat little hospital, where Mrs. (Dr.) Matheson attended sick pupils, or sick Indians.\n\n(d) Two (I think) stovesheds; woodsheds &c; stables and barn &c.\n\nMrs. Matheson desires for herself and family some reasonable compensation for b, c, d, (above) and for live stock. I think we must admit this to some extent, as I have said above.\n\nFurther, while I believe that your Inspector approved of the buildings, in many respects, as complying with I.D. regulations, yet the following are absolutely required at once:\n\nentire new floors (on ground floor)\n\nfurnace for big building and\n\nstorm-sashes (double windows) throughout.\n\nYou will note that all this expected outlay coming now is really an accumulation of what should have been done or paid for during past years.\n\nI am prepared to take a good deal of risk and responsibility in reopening this school along the lines I have mentioned. I could not bear to think of closing a school which is so much needed.\n\nOur Indians beg me not to let it be closed. I believe we can fill it up to the 56 pupils allowed. Of course our Roman Catholic neighbours who have lots of money, are waiting to pounce on our children if we step out. I am prepared to make a stiff effort to keep the school open at the $110 per capita grant, calling on the Church to do what the I.D. grant fails to do. Mr. and Mrs. Ellis are prepared to take hold cautiously, to begin slowly and self-denyingly, and to risk their reputation as managers and workers. And the Church and the Indians look to me to do this. But I have not, and the Diocese of\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6320, file 658-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSaskatchewan has not the money (about $5,000 perhaps) required to recoup the Matheson family, to carry out the alterations and repairs, and to provide stock of groceries, &c., to begin work with. I am appealing strenuously and persistently to friends and Churches in Eastern Canada, and may get some relief perhaps.\n\nBut I do feel it is up to the I.D. to stand by us, and to take a share in the load. And, I ask you, my dear Sir, to advise me how I can best put this before the Authorities with a view to winning them to make a grant. I know what you're \"up against\"; but you see what I'm up against. Tell me\n\n(1) what to ask for,\n(2) of whom to ask if, and\n(3) how best to set forth the above need.\n\nBut further than that, I want to ask you, Mr. Scott,\n\n(1) Will you authorise (and instruct the new Principal accordingly) a payment of a certain proportion of the per capita grant each month as you have done to other schools. I believe that you have sometime paid per cap. $10 first month, $10 second month, and $5 for third (final) month each quarter ($25 per quarter for $100 per cap.)\n\nIf you will do this for us it will help a little.\n\n(2) Will you kindly inform me whether the I.D. has really consented to allow Onion Lake the $116 per cap. grant up to 55 pupils? I am told it is so, but can't find any formal notification.\n\n(3) Is it absolutely impossible for us to get a title to the 35 or 40 acres we occupy? About two or three years ago I understood that the I.D. and the Land Department had agreed that we could have Title, and I remember well the Land Department telling me that it would instruct its surveyors to survey and mark out our piece. The Indians would willingly give us Title. It is difficult to get Church people to heartily build and support bldgs. on land not our own.\n\n(4) Can you without much worry or labour find out how Mr. J.R. Matheson obtained Title to a Ranch he used for the school (for stock)? I can't give you sec. R.Tp. &c., but it was only a few miles outside of the Reserve, and I believe he could tell you whether...\nhe bought it from the Government, or obtained it as a grant.\n\nThese four pages of Memo on Onion Lake School are earnestly commended to your consideration, and your advice is awaited.\n\nJ.A.

During his absence a young R.C. Indian tried seven 3 girl pupils, for immoral purposes. The police were informed & brought the girls back after they had been away two nights. Mr. Ellis informed your Agent, Mr. Seibald, who said that he could not do anything because it was a Criminal Case. So Mr. Ellis left the police, who had it in hand, to finish it. In due time he was summoned to attend the Court at Battleford. The case was dismissed!! because the girl particularly in question in the charge, against whom the offence was committed had previously misbehaved with the same man, & was therefore of uncleanly character!! How can we hope to teach our Indian pupils chastity when the law administration thus encourage immorality? The young Indians have very lax ideas on the subject. It seems to me that the previous\nmisconduct \"with the same man\" did not excuse him but rather increased his guilt. I am not attempting to teach a judge law. Possibly he was technically justified. But that the result is a blow to morality & decency, & hinders our work, is very evident.\n\nWas Mr. Libbald right in refusing to interfere? Did not the police & the Judge grossly mismanage the case? I fear such a case is mismanaged something by the police purposely. What can your department do to rectify this wrong?\n\nBelieve me\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. A. Saskatchewan\n\n[Signature]\n\nWilliam P. H.\n\n5/2\nOttawa, 20th February, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant with reference to the girl pupils from the Onion Lake Boarding School, and note your observations with respect to the proceedings and your enquiry as to whether the Department can do anything in the matter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the charge was evidently laid under the provisions of Section 211 of the Criminal Code but failed because it was established that the girl was not of previously chaste character. If action were to be taken against the offender for the first of such offence, it would have to be brought within one year according to Section 1140 of the Criminal Code.\n\nWith respect to the question as to whether Agent Sibbald could have done anything in the matter, I beg to say that he has magisterial jurisdiction to take the preliminary hearing in such a case but he would have been compelled to dismiss the case if it had been established to his satisfaction that the girl was not of previously chaste character.\n\nThis occurrence is greatly to be regretted, but apparently the only legal action that could be was taken. It does not appear from the facts set forth in your letter that there was any irregularity in the legal proceedings. The Department is not aware of any action which could be taken in respect to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. J.A.

Kindly furnish a full report regarding this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Asst.

Boarding School; and, in reply, to inform you that this outbreak was discovered on November 1st, and Dr. Macrett, of Lloydminster, immediately telegraphed for. The doctor arrived at Onion Lake next morning, and pronounced the complaint from which 4 of the Indian pupils were suffering, as a mild type of smallpox.\n\nThe names of the 4 children first attacked are:\n\n- Robert Chief, Onion Lake band\n- Arthur Montana, \" Frog Lake band\n- George Pechowe, \" Frog Lake band\n- Sam Abraham, \"\n\nThe doctor superintended the quarantining of these children, and left instructions as to treatment for these and any subsequent cases that might develop. He also vaccinated every unvaccinated child at the school.\n\nThe children were quarantined on the upper floor of the school building, and were kept strictly isolated. Three other Indian children later developed the disease, and were quarantined with those first attacked. Miss Cunningham, a member of the school staff (who has had considerable experience in nursing) nursed all the sick Indian children, and they have now all fully recovered.\n\nAbout the same time as the last three Indian children...\nChildren were attacked, the two small children of the principal, Mr. H. Ellis, also developed the disease; these were nursed by their mother who isolated herself with them, in one of their own bedrooms.\n\nThe names of the 3 Indian children last attacked are:-\nJohn Chief, Onion Lake band\nMathias, Frog Lake band\nEva Abraham,\n\nIt will be seen from the foregoing that, including the principal's two children, 9 children at this school contracted the disease. These have all now fully recovered, and the rooms occupied by them thoroughly fumigated with formalin on December 19th. The clothing and bedding was well washed and disinfected.\n\nI am pleased to state that the disease was confined to the C. of E. school, and did not make its appearance elsewhere on the reserve.

This will make a total of 36 pupils for which the grant will be paid.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform the principal of the approval of the admission of the three Baptiste children and of the increase in the number allowed to provide for them.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nOnion Lake,\nSask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6320, file 658-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI regret to have to report that for sometime past the Indians have been complaining with respect to the food supplied to the pupils at the Onion Lake Church of England Boarding School.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to my school report for January past, in which mention is made of a complaint that the food supplied the pupils at this school was insufficient. At the time of my January visit the pupils had a good meal with white bread, but I spoke to the principal, Mr. Ellis, about giving the children something to drink with their mid-day meal, and he promised to give them some tea. The practice they had been following was for the children to drink from the well either before or after eating.\n\nMr. Sibbald inspected the school on Feb. 25th. and was not satisfied with the food. He told me that the bread was very dark and that the only utensil the children had to eat their dinner with was a spoon, there being no knives or forks, and they had only water to drink.\n\nYesterday, just before noon, Joseph Quinney, one of the Onion Lake Councillors, asked me if he could be allowed to visit the school and see the children at their dinner. After he had gone I thought it better to do myself also, so as to be able to judge the correctness of any complaints Quinney might make. The children had a fair meal consisting of beef stew, potatoes, and carrots, followed by rice pudding. There was nothing to drink upon the tables and no knives and forks. The bread was very dark and on my speaking to Mr. Ellis about it, he informed me that it was made from shorts. I may say there was not a sufficiency of bread upon the tables, but on my mentioning it more was supplied.\n\nDuring the afternoon the Chief and Councillor (Jos. Quinney) came to the office and told me that they were going to circulate a petition to the Bishop of Saskatchewan, asking that Mr. Ellis be removed and a new principal put in his place.\n\nI thought it better to inform the Department of these happenings and would respectfully suggest that a letter be written Mr. Ellis informing him that these conditions must be improved.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nApril 1, 1921.\n\nDear Canon Gould,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith for your information a copy of a letter which has been received from our Agent at Onion Lake with respect to the food supplied the pupils of the Onion Lake (C.E.) Boarding School.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will inquire into the complaints made by the Indians through the Agent as to the food furnished the pupils of this school. The Principal should be informed that it is expected that the children will be provided with good, substantial and well cooked food. The bread should be made from a good quality of flour and the children should be given tea, cocoa or milk at their meals, also the necessary table utensils, including knives and forks, should be supplied. I shall be pleased, when you have had an opportunity to make inquiry, to have a report from you as to the food provided.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

I am sending your letter, together with the inclosed copy of communication from Mr. Lang Turner, Acting Indian Agent, to Dr. Westgate, requesting him at the earliest available opportunity to pay a personal visit to the Onion Lake school, and to take up the matter indicated, together with any other urgent matters concerning the school, and also to submit a requisition for the necessary table utensils, etc., etc., concerning the supply of which by the Missionary Society, if the complaint is well grounded, there will be no question. As far as my information goes I think that the Principal, Mr. Ellis, is a satisfactory man; he has been under the very great difficulty of trying to make ends meet with insufficient means.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nS. Gould,\nGeneral Secretary.\nMEMORANDUM OF THE FIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C., ON HIS VISIT TO THE ST. BARBARA INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL ON THE ONION LAKE RESERVE IN THE DIOCESE OF SASKATCHEWAN IN MAY 1921.\n\n1. THE OBJECT OF THE VISIT.\n\nThis visit, which partook of the nature of an investigation, was undertaken at the request of the General Secretary M.S.C.C. (See his letter Apr.5th) who had been informed by the Indian Department that Indians on the Onion Lake Reserve had forwarded to them through the Onion Lake Agency, a complaint against the insufficiency and inferiority of the food and dishes provided for the children in the Church of England Boarding School.\n\n2. DATE AND ARRANGEMENTS\n\nAs the transfer of the School in question from Diocesan control to that of the Society was still incomplete, the Field Secretary felt that the investigation should not take place without the approval of the Bishop of the Diocese. This approval the Bishop very cordially gave and appointed the Ven. Archdeacon Mackay to represent the Diocese in the investigation.\n\nThe Field Secretary left Winnipeg on Saturday evening, May 7th, and spent Sunday May 8th, at Dauphin where he assisted the Rector at the early morning celebration of Holy Communion, preached at the 11 A.M. and 7 P.M. services. Leaving Dauphin at 4:30 A.M. on Monday, May 9th, he arrived at Lloydminster at 1:30 A.M. on Tuesday, May 10th, and here he was joined by Archdeacon Mackay who had journeyed all the way from the Pas in Manitoba right across the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\n3. FROM LLOYDMINSTER TO THE SCHOOL\n\nThe shortest route from Lloydminster to the Onion Lake School, lies along the meridian which forms the inter-provincial boundary line of Saskatchewan and Alberta, and covers a distance of about 35 miles. The Rev. Henry Ellis, Principal of the School, sent his assistant, Mr. Parker with a span of horses.\nand a democrat to meet the visitors and travelling together in this manner on Wednesday, May 11th, and along the route referred to, they accomplished the journey in twelve hours, ten of which were spent in actual travelling, and the other two in resting. About two-thirds of the way, namely as far as the North Saskatchewan River, which is crossed by ferry, progress was exceedingly difficult and toilsome owing to the heavy condition of the roads. From the River to the School, travelling was easier, but speed was out of the question partly owing to the darkness of the night and partly to the weariness of the horses. All supplies for the School are carried along this route at a cost of 65\u00a2 per 100 lbs.\n\n4. THE SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND PROPERTY.\n\nOn Thursday morning, May 12th, a careful examination was made of the School buildings, and these were found to be as follows:\n\n(1) THE BOYS' HOUSE. This is a rectangular, frame building, about fifty feet to the side, three stories high, and beneath which the soil has been excavated and a furnace installed. As the bottom and sides of the excavations were unprotected by brick, stone or cement, or even wood of any kind, water had soaked in and flooded the whole area to a depth of fully two feet, completely obscuring the ash-pit of the furnace, and reaching nearly half-way up the fire-box. A small, hand worked suction pump was being used by some of the older boys in an endeavour to draw the water out.\n\nThe ground floor of the building is divided into two class rooms with a hall between them. Two classes were under instruction, one in each room, the more advanced being conducted by Mrs. Benjamin, and the elementary by Miss Halkett, a young Cree Indian woman who has been transferred from the staff at Lac la Ronge when the buildings there were destroyed by fire.\n\nThe equipment of the class rooms, while not of the best, was not, so far as was observed or ascertained, seriously lacking in many respects. The text books in use were those prescribed for use in the Province by the Provincial Authorities, and evidence was not lacking that effectual work was being done.\n\nThe atmosphere, at the time of the visit was so cold,\nand a fire being impossible, the Archdeacon asked the Principal to suspend instruction for the day.\n\nThe ascent from the ground floor to the second storey is made by an outside stairway, more picturesque than secure, placed at right angles to the west side of the building, the upper end resting against a verandah which encompasses two sides of the house. This storey is divided into a number of small rooms, two of which are, or may be used by members of the staff, and these, along with a room for clothing are separated by a hall in which a box-stove is placed, from two other rooms, one of which is used as a day room for the boys.\n\nThe top storey which is reached by a narrow inside stairway is used as a dormitory.\n\n(2) THE GIRLS' HOUSE.\n\nLike the Boys' House this also is a wooden structure, and although it is only two storeys high it covers a larger area, possesses a small tower at one corner, has a cellar underneath, and was apparently built in sections. An examination of the cellar revealed it to be a dismal and dangerous place, where it was not possible to remain any length of time with a feeling of security. The beams have so far decayed that quantities of their outside parts could easily be broken off with the fingers, and numerous wooden posts had to be inserted to support them.\n\nThe space on the ground floor is cut up into so many rooms that it is not easy to describe them, but the following more important ones may be mentioned,\u2014a dining room for the children, a dining room and sitting room for the staff, a kitchen, a pantry, a large hall used as a printing room with a printing press installed and working, and the Principal's office which also serves as a dispensary. These rooms are heated by wood-burning stoves, the wood, mostly poplar, being purchased on the Reserve, and cut into short lengths in the School yard by a circular saw run by a gasoline engine. The floors are greatly worn and in one place, namely, between the kitchen and the staff's refectory, so uneven owing to decay and subsidence that a difference of about twelve inches was noticeable in the altitude of the surface.\nMEMORANDUM ON ONION LAKE SCHOOL.\n\nAn inside stairway leads to the upper storey which has a balcony running along the south side of it, and is divided into dormitories for the girls and rooms for the lady workers on the staff.\n\n(3) THE PRINCIPAL'S RESIDENCE.\n\nThe Principal and his wife with their four children reside in a small frame cottage situated on the north side of the School compound, close to another small building, part of which is used as a store room for supplies and the remainder as an open shed.\n\n(4) THE CHURCH.\n\nAt the eastern end of the compound stands a neat little frame Church with a square tower, carefully kept and in good repair. Most, if not all of the furnishings, were provided by local contributions, and at the time of the visit a large number of new seats arrived, which when put together and placed, would complete the seating accommodation.\n\nClose to the Church is the graveyard with tombstones marking the resting places of Whitesman and Redmen alike who have finished their journey and are waiting the great day when the elect number shall be perfect and God shall be all in all. Notable among these was the grave of J.R. Matheson who lived so long and laboured so indefatigably as a good shepherd seeking the lost and wandering sheep in this remote part.\n\n(5) THE BARN.\n\nApart from the latrines which stood in different parts of the School grounds and were quite unworthy of an Institution of this kind, only one other building remains to be mentioned and that is the barn and stable, the original part of which was made of logs with a number of framed additions.\n\n5. THE MEETING TO INVESTIGATE THE COMPLAINT.\n\nOn Thursday, May 12th, the Principal was requested to ask the Chief and Councillors who had lodged the complaint with the Department, to come to the School, and this request was responded to at 1:30 P.M. by the arrival of Chief Robert, Councillors Joseph Quinney and Josiah Calling Bull, and another Indian.\nMEMORANDUM ON ONION LAKE SCHOOL.\n\nDuring the Meeting two other Indians arrived, but as it was determined that they had no children in the School, and were, themselves members of the Roman Catholic church, they were courteously asked to retire.\n\nDuring the whole of the proceedings the Ven. Archdeacon MacKay was present and presided, and with him were the Field Secretary M.S.C.C., the Rev. Henry Ellis, Principal of the School, and for part of the time the Rev. Edward Ahenakew who has just returned from Edmonton University where he had completed his second year in Medicine. The retiring Indian Agent, Mr. Sibbald was ill, and acting Indian Agent, Mr. Turner, was absent from the Agency, and consequently neither were able to attend.\n\nThe Chief was asked his reasons for complaining, and these may be briefly be summarized as follows:-\n\n(1) WITH REGARD TO TABLE EQUIPMENT.\n\nHe stated that he occasionally visited the Roman Catholic School, which is only about three hundred yards away, and observed that the children there were provided at meals with knives, forks, napkins, and other table equipment which he found were wanting when he visited the Church of England School.\n\n(2) WITH REGARD TO THE FOOD.\n\nWhen asked if the complaint was only about dishes and table equipment generally, he replied that the children in the Roman Catholic School were better fed, being given butter, or a substitute for butter, but that this commodity was not in evidence on the occasion of his visit to the Church of England School.\n\nWith regard to the first of these complaints, namely, The Table Equipment, while it has regrettably to be admitted that the Church of England School was not as completely equipped as it should have been, it should be stated that the responsibility in this respect did not rest so much with the Principal as with those who were responsible for the equipment and maintenance of the School.\n\nIt is also but fair to state that before the Chief and his colleagues visited the Roman Catholic School, they gave the Head of that School two\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6320, file 658-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nweeks' notice of their intention, whereas their visit to the Church of England School was made without any previous intimation, whatever.\n\nSteps have already been taken to supply the School with the cutlery, dishes, &c., which were required by despatching nearly $100.00 worth of household equipment and further cause for complaint along this line need not be anticipated.\n\nWith regard to the second complaint namely, The Food, a glance at the children themselves furnished ample proof that they had not greatly suffered, and the Chief appeared somewhat confused when the healthy and flourishing condition of his own daughter Sophie, a pupil in the School, was alluded to in this connection.\n\nAn examination of the School Ledger showed that lard compound as a supplement to, or a substitute for butter had been used to the extent of 150 lbs. per quarter, and that in 1919 the sum of $2055.28 had been expended on the item of food alone, and in 1920 no less than $3168.26 had been spent for the same purpose. This was for a staff of six Europeans and forty Indian children.\n\nWith regard to the care taken and the general state of the children, the Chief was asked how he accounted for the fact that during the severe epidemic of influenza which visited that district some time ago, no less than nine children died in the Roman Catholic School whereas none died in that of the Church of England, but to this he could give no satisfactory answer.\n\n6.

JOHNSON, ON CHURCH OF ENGLAND BOARDING SCHOOL,\nOHLAN LAKE.\n\n(Original on File 109 X-3.)\n\nInspected school Dec. 1st. Teacher Rev. H. Ellis.\nAttendance 38; Temp. of school 68; Ventilation very poor;\nFire drill once weekly; School clean; Building extremely\npoor, floors being worn through in places; Cellar stairs\nunsafe. This building I consider very unsafe for children.\nThe boys were much dirtier than the girls, the latter fairly\nclean. Children are provided with toothbrushes. All were\nwarmly clothed and clothing clean.\n\nMilk is very short, have only two cows milking.\nUse assorted vegetables, food fair but well cooked.\n\nMR. COMMISSIONER GRAHAM'S NOTE:\n\nThe Nurse's attention has been drawn to the fact\nthat she did not spend long enough time at the school. She\nshould at least put in two days at a school of this kind.\nOttawa, January 5, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to draw your attention to a matter arising out of the report of the travelling nurse on the Onion Lake C. K. Indian Boarding School.\n\nMiss Johnston has reported that the ventilation was very poor and that, while the girls were kept quite clean, more attention should be paid to the condition of the boys. It was also reported that the school was very short of milk, as but two cows were milking at the time of her inspection (December first). You might draw the attention of the Principal to these facts and the extreme desirability of remedying conditions as soon as possible.\n\nWhen you are talking with the Reverend Mr. Ellis, you might point out that the Department is aware of the extreme difficulty under which he is labouring, due to the condition of the building, and that this communication is not in the nature of a complaint, but is to urge him to do the best that is possible for our Indian wards under his care.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nMEMO. FOR FILE:\n\nArchdeacon J. A. MacKay, of Prince Albert, is aware of the M. S. C. C.'s request for a large Church of England residential school in Central Saskatchewan and, in the event of such a plan being carried out, he strongly advises that the Onion Lake School be continued.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6320, file 658-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a letter received from Rev. H. Ellis, principal of the Onion Lake C. of E. Boarding School, with reference to the Department increasing the pupilage at that school from 36 to 42.\n\nAt present the grant allowed this school is for 36 pupils, and there are 26 boys and 14 girls on the roll, a total of 40. There are two boys dormitories measuring 35' x 25' x 10' 4\" and 17' x 14'6\" x 9'6\" a capacity of, roughly, 11400 cubit feet. The two girls dormitories measure 31' 4\" x 23' x 7'6\" and 19x10x8, a capacity of, roughly, 6600 cubit feet. However, the last mentioned dormitory can be more than doubled in size by the taking down of a partition and using the space occupied by the cook, Miss Marshall, as a girl's dormitory. Mr. Ellis informed me that he intended to apply for admission to do this, and to remove Miss Marshall's quarters to another part of the building.\n\nIf the Department can see its way to increase the pupilage at this school, it would have my recommendation.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring the interview which the Rev. Canon Gould, General Secretary of our Society, held with Mr. Scott, Deputy Superintendent General, on Friday, the 15th instant, the question of increasing the pupilage of the Onion Lake School from 36 to 41, and that of the Pelican School from 35 to 40, was placed on the list of items to be considered. As the memorandum which I had prepared for the General Secretary in this connection did not make it sufficiently clear as to whether it was expected that the buildings in question should be enlarged so as to accommodate the larger number of pupils, or whether it was intended that authority should be given, with the present accommodation, to admit the larger number if they could be secured, I now beg to state that the latter object was the one in view. I have taken this matter up with the Principal and the Agents at these two Schools, during personal visits, and as they were in favour of the increased pupilage suggested I shall be obliged if you will furnish me with an authorization to that effect.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.B. Westgate\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTRW/ECG.\nOttawa, July 13, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to your No. 99-21 of October 7th, last, relative to increasing the pupilage at the Onion Lake C. of E. Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that the Department will make arrangements to allow the grant for 41 pupils, as from the first of October, on condition that the principal tears down the partition in the girls' dormitory and recruits girls only. Not more than 26 boys should be allowed in residence. Please inform the principal accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S. Williams,\nFor Asst.

Boarding School.\n\nI have to inform you that we have had some correspondence with the Indian agent in this connection, and it has been decided to increase the pupilage at this school to 41, on the condition that the girls' dormitory is enlarged by tearing down the partitions. Our representative has been instructed that not more than 26 boys should be allowed in residence and that the recruiting should be limited to female pupils.\n\nThe question of increasing the pupilage in the case of the Peigan C. of E.

NEW AND ENLARGED MAIN SCHOOL BUILDING, WITH OUT-BUILDINGS, LAND, ETC., ON ANOTHER SITE, TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THOSE OCCUPIED AT PRESENT.\n\nPart I.\n\n(a) The present buildings are old, unsatisfactory, antiquated in design, and incapable in every way of accommodating the number of children awaiting admission.\n\n(b) The site which they occupy on the seepage side of a slough renders the basement of both buildings liable to flooding, a condition which has already existed, and is, in consequence, unhealthy.\n\n(c) The land attached to the School at present is inadequate and unsuitable for extensive farming operations.\n\n(d) No out-buildings of any consequence such as a stock-barn, granary, poultry-house, pigery, implement-shed, etc., have ever existed at this School.\n\nPart II.\n\nIt is suggested\n\n(a) That a new site be selected during the winter or early in the spring, by representatives of the Department and the Society.\n\n(b) That the new main school building should have a capacity of enrolling not less than 100 pupils.\n\n(c) That the out-buildings mentioned under sub-section (d) above should be provided.\n\n(d) That not less than one section of land should be attached to the new institution.\n\n(e) That provision be made in the estimates for 1924 for providing the school with a good strain of milking cows, not less than fifteen in number, 100 hens, and a couple of pigs.\n\n(f) That these requirements be given precedence over all others included in the list on page 2 of this docket.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We only get two slices of bread and one plate porridge. Seven children ran away because there are hungry, two from Saddle and one from Frog Lake, and two from Snake Plain, 3 girls and 4 boys because are always hungry too. I sold all my clothes away because I am hungry too. Try and send me some money, $2.50, please to buy something to eat and send me picture those I left in the wagon.\n\nI am not sick. I hope you the same too. I am going to hit the teacher if she is cruel to me again. We are treated like pigs, some of the boys always eat oats and wheat. I never ask anyone to give me anything to eat. Some of the boys cried because they are hungry. Once I cry too because I was very hungry. If you have no money try to get from somebody or chief or instruction.\n\nTry and send me soon because I am always hungry. I near ran away too because I was very hungry that time. I want $2.50 please. I am always very lonely and hungry, but still I will say Happy Christmas to all and Happy New Year to all.\n\nSo good by to all of you\nfrom Edward B.\nJanuary 11, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Mears,-\n\nWith reference to the attached letter from the Indian boy, presumably at one of our schools, I have to inform you that we cannot trace any Edward B. on the roster of our two schools at Onion Lake. I am sending a copy of the letter to the Indian Agent there and am asking him to look into it. There is a plentiful supply of food at both of these schools, and I am sure there is no cause for complaint. The whole point of the letter as I see it is an attempt to work up sympathy from his parents in order to get $2.50 in cash for some purpose or other. I see no reason whatever for publishing the letter, and I will advise you immediately of the answer that I receive from our Agent. If I knew who sent the letter I would communicate direct with him. Ninety-nine per cent of the Indian children at these schools are too fat.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nP.C. Mears, Esq.,\nPress Gallery,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nJanuary 12, 1924.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am inclosing herewith copy of a letter which has been forwarded to the Department written by an Indian boy, presumably at one of our schools at Onion Lake. We cannot trace any Edward B. on the roster of our two schools there. I should be glad if you would look into this matter and let me have a report. I am quite certain that there is a plentiful supply of food at both of these schools and I think the object of the letter is to work up sympathy from his parents in order to get $2.50 in cash for some purpose or other.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nRecords to file\n\nPlease return to Mr. Scott as soon as Agent Turner heard from.\nDear Sir,\n\nA copy of letter written to you by your son Edward, a pupil at the Church Of England School here, has been forwarded to me. In it he complains of being always hungry and that he is not given enough to eat. This is not true, your boy is well fed and clothed. I visit the school frequently and it is one of my duties to see that the children are well looked after.\n\nI hope this will re-assure you with respect to Edward.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nK. A. Baptiste,\nPaynton, Saskatchewan.\nAt first the boy stoutly maintained that the $2.50 which he asked his parents to send him was for the purpose of buying food, but admitted that he had fixed upon that amount as it was half of his treaty money, and that many of the children at the school, whose parents live on the Onion Lake reserves, are given half of their treaty money at treaty time, by their parents, and there is no doubt in my mind but that Edward was actuated to write the letter with the idea of being on a par with most of the other boys in this respect.\n\nWith respect to the teacher being cruel I would say that she is one of the gentlest little ladies one could possibly meet. On my questioning Edward on this point, he could only say \"she gives me too hard lessons\".\n\nEdward is, I think rather a small boy for his age, 15\u00bd years, but his body is well nourished. To ascertain this I had him partly strip in the office and afterwards took his weight which is 118 lbs.\n\nThe only statement with an element of truth in his letter is that seven children ran away from the school. This was at last harvest time, when the Indians were all in tents. The children were away only a few hours; it is no unusual thing for Indian school children to run away at that time of year. Edward's letter is the first intimation that I have ever had that the children ran away because they were hungry.\n\nConcurrent with your letter I received one from the Toronto Star, enclosing another copy of Edward's letter and in reply am sending it a copy of this.\n\nIn conclusion I would say that the Onion Lake C. of E. Boarding School is conducted in a very satisfactory manner. The children are well fed, well clothed and good discipline is maintained.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nOttawa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, enclosing copy of a letter written by an Indian boy, Edward B., to his parents.\n\nThe boy's proper name is Edward Kemakawtay; he belongs to Little Pines reserve, Battleford Agency, and is pupil No. 74 at the Onion Lake (C. of E.) Boarding School. I have made enquiries respecting the complaint in his letter and so far as underfeeding is concerned, can state emphatically that there is no truth in the charge. I visit this school frequently, at least once a week - it is situated only about 200 yards from the Agency - and often go into the dining room and see the children at dinner or supper and always find them with an ample meal. I made a point of visiting the children at dinner-time today and found that they each had a plateful of beef and potato stew, followed by apple pudding. There was also a large kettle half full of the stew for those who required a second helping, a good supply of bread upon every table, and a cup of hot tea for every child. The cook informed me that there was, almost invariably, a large quantity of scraps left over from each meal which went to feed the pigs.\n\nBefore leaving the institution I asked that Edward be sent across to the Agency Office as I wished to see him alone. On his arrival I questioned him in respect to the letter he had written. He maintained that the children did not get enough to eat for breakfast, but admitted that they did get plenty at dinner and supper. I asked him what he had been given for breakfast this morning and he replied \"a plate of porridge and two slices of bread and jam.\" I received the impression that he complained of the breakfast as he knew that that was a meal which I had never attended.\nJanuary 26th, 1924.\n\nMy dear Mears,\n\nI am sending you herewith a copy of letter which I have just received from our Agent at Onion Lake with reference to the letter which you so kindly showed me.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nP. C. Mears, Esq.,\nThe Press Gallery,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nDecember 14th, 1923\nGlen Lake, Saskatchewan\n\nDear Parents:\n\nWe are going to tell you how we are treated. I am always hungry.

Residential School which goes forward by this mail; in which it will be seen that there is a larger number on the roll than is authorized.\n\nI paid a visit to this school this morning to see what arrangements had been made for sleeping quarters for the extra pupils and found that, so far as accommodation for the boys is concerned, there was no overcrowding. With regard to the girls, however, I found that ten of the smaller children were occupying five beds, two in each.\n\nIn this connection I should report that the Rev. H. Ellis, the principal, has never yet complied with the condition upon which the Department increased the pupilage from 36 to 41 - Vide Department letter dated July 13th, 1923, No. 135-1-1 - which was that a partition be set down at once between the boys' dormitories. On receipt of the above quoted letter I sent Mr. Ellis a copy of it, and have spoken to him on the subject several times since, but the work has not yet been done.\n\nI should add that Mr. Ellis has informed me that the Rev. Canon Westgate, D.D., is writing the Department on the subject of the extra pupils, who are being recruited in readiness to occupy the new school when it is built.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 14th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, reporting on your visit to the Onion Lake C. of E. Indian Residential School and enquiring as to what arrangements had been made by the Principal to provide dormitory accommodation for the extra pupils.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that there is no overcrowding in the space provided for the boys, but that the Principal has not complied with the conditions upon which the Department increased the pupilage from 36 to 41 - that a partition in the girls' dormitory be torn down. If this partition can be removed without undue expense, the Principal should have the work done at an early date. In view of the fact that a new building is being erected, we do not desire the Principal to be put to any undue expense in making alterations in the old building. However, it is considered that he should have carried out the conditions upon which the increased pupilage was granted. We note that you have drawn the Principal's attention to this matter on several occasions. You will be good enough to again inform him of the conditions imposed when the pupilage was increased. It is considered in view of the present accommodation that no pupils should be recruited until the new school is ready for occupation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRegina, Sask.\nREPORT\n\nHenry Ellis - Onion Lake, Sask.\n\nPrairie Fire, Onion Lake Indian Reserve.\n\nOn May 19th 1926, while on patrol at Onion Lake Indian Reserve I was requested by the Indian Agent, Mr. L. Turner to investigate a case of an infraction of the regulations governing the setting of Prairie Fires, which fire had apparently started from the Onion Lake Indian Mission School on the Reserve.\n\nI accordingly patrolled with Police Team 1602-1603 to the Reserve and found that several Townships had been burned over, quite evidently from the fire which had started from near the School, and several of the Indians had lost granaries and other small outbuildings containing grain for seed purposes by the fire.\n\nI interviewed several of the pupils of the School, one of whom was working in a field close by when the fire started, and none of them saw the fire actually started, but Mr. Mitchell, the Instructor to the boys gave me a statement, as follows:\n\n\"On April 27th 1926, I was out fixing fence near the main trail inside the School fence. About 10 Mr. Ellis came out to me. He helped me with the fence for a while and then we started for home. When past a slough I said I would like to burn the foot tall grass when we should get a suitable day for the purpose.\"\n\nMr. Ellis said \"Stop the Car and we will light now.\" I did so and Mr. Ellis got out and went across the slough and lit it. It burnt steadily until it was soon out of hand so I came to the School House fighting the fire. In spite of our united efforts it got out of control and burned in an eastern direction.\n\n\"After the fire had been started by lighting a backfire to prevent running against the School - under Mr. Ellis' suggestion. The fire burned for several days and nearly all the rain fell on it all day unsuccessfully.\"\n\nI interviewed Mr. Ellis, who is the teacher at the School, and he denied having set fire to the School, and he denied having seen anyone that he had first seen the fire from the School and had hurried to put it out. He stated that he knew who had started the fire but that he had passed through a woman, but that he had been unable in finding out who they were.\n\nI informed Mr. Ellis that he had started the fire, but he denied any knowledge of it, so on stating the case to the Indian Agent I asked him to take the necessary action to...\nOn May 25th 1926 I laid an information against the Reverend H.

It is undenominational, Protestant in its character in Canada and had its commencement more than 40 years ago at the invitation of Mr. Robert Wilson, missionary of the Churches of England in India. For a quarter of a century the school was well and truly laid for the work of the present time by the influence exercised by this man of God among the Indians. Much devotion to missionary labor among the western redmen. He was elevated to the episcopate while still engaged in the labors of his mission. The famous old mission school has been in use for many years. The article which follows is from the pen of a traveller who has recently made a visit to the Onion Lake district.\n\nBy WILLIAM BLEADELL CAMERON\n\nI WAS walking along the trail flanked by the north by the building shining above the school for Indian children conducted by the Church of England at Onion Lake, on the border line between Alberta and Saskatchewan. From stable and corrals across the trail a stove belched steam glassed the clairvoyant clink clink rimmed glasses and a clerical collar was approaching.\n\n\"I stopped.\"\n\n\"You connected with the institution here?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he nodded. \"Yes.\" He came near. I halted at twelve feet.\n\n\"Who are you?\" I asked.\n\nThe man had turned gray face, \"I know you,\" he said. His broad head bent only looking out on the westward road. After a moment, I knew that this man was one whom I knew.\n\nThis was my introduction to Rev. H. E. Ellis, the first missionary sent to the new Onion Lake Indian residential school. He had been working among the Cree Indians south of both the Rocky Mountains and the lake he named after himself. As I held out my hand, the young man seized it. I had heard much about this missionary.\n\nAt the missionary dinner to which he had been invited. This evening, if I was told, was an evening of great importance to him. An opportunity offered to meet members of the St. Chad's family or members of the congregation since the school opened was more than a opportunity to renew acquaintance or make a visit.\n\nTo welcome him in the name of his fellow parishioners, the committee had arranged. H. E., a young man who impressed himself upon me, stood before this missionary and his wife fell as they walked at our side.\n\nSuccess Centered on Parents\n\nBut after all this should be given an education equivalent to that afforded by the best provident schools. It was a privilege during the afternoon to watch children doing their work there, undertaking the duties of a real home, doing their best against parents who have treated them unfairly. It was easy to see how this work fitted into the needs of the country, but a school like this is not easy to maintain. It costs money to keep the school running, and the parents have no idea or thought what a good opportunity this school offers. How good are these parents? What is wrong with them? Is it the lack of interest?\n\nFrom Seven to Eighteen\n\nIndian Affairs.

Turner Aug. 20, 1926 on -12-1.\"\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM DR. WESTGATE, Winnipeg,\ndated May 7, 1927.\n\nIn preparing their estimates for next year, they find that even with a slight increase in the per capita grant they will still have a heavy cash expenditure to make over and above all cash receipts including the per capita earnings. In endeavouring to discover a way whereby this condition of things could be remedied, they concluded that the best, if not the only course to pursue, was to have the enrolment increased from 80 to 100 pupils, and I was directed by them to refer this matter to you and ask that an enrolment of this number of pupils be sanctioned immediately. The building has a capacity of 100 pupils and the principal is of the opinion that he will have no difficulty in securing this number. I respectfully beg to request, therefore, that you give this matter your most careful and favourable consideration, and furnish me with the authorization requested at your earliest convenience.\nOttawa, May 17, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the heavy expenses incurred by your Society at the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School. I note that you are in need of financial assistance in this connection. I regret that your proposal to relieve the situation cannot be approved, as the dormitories can accommodate not more than 80 pupils. If you have any suggestion as to how the Department can assist at this time, I should be pleased if you would let me have a recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. G. C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nI presented your letter of May 17th (115-1-5) to our Commission at a meeting held on the 14th inst. and was instructed to inform you that in their opinion the only satisfactory way in which our Society could be provided with the financial assistance required to operate their Onion Lake School, without embarrassing overdrafts, is through an increase in the capacity of the main school building. It stands at present at 80 pupils and if increased to 125 pupils, the annual increase in the per capita earnings would furnish the necessary financial relief. Our Commission realize that such increase may not be possible during the current fiscal year, but they can see no possibility of a satisfactory and permanent solution of the problem until such action has been taken. Our Society has been made well aware of the fact that residential schools with an enrolment of 100 pupils or less are practically incapable of being properly staffed and operated without a deficit, on the present per capita basis, and it is for this reason that they desire schools with a capacity of not less than 125 pupils to be built in preference to any others. It is recommended and requested, therefore, that as a measure towards securing the permanent financial relief required for our Onion Lake School, the capacity of this school be increased, not later than during the next fiscal year, from 80 to 125 pupils.\n\nReplied to m/s file with information held noted for Sst. M.T.\nOur dear Principal Mr. Ellis:\n\nWe are here where the prisoners kept for two or three days in little rooms. This afternoon we went to the court at South Battleford. We sure are having a good luck about this business. The Head Man of the Court say to us. If we were to go to Prince Albert Court or to finish right now. We said right now. He told us we are sure in good luck because we are young and we are Indian boys too that's why. Well we are going to Prince Albert Jail only for five months. We think we will be there about at August. But we are to be reported to the Mounted Police every two months when we get out of jail for a year. We are hoping you come out and see us very soon. Please Mr. Ellis tell the boys not to get silly about all the things. It's very hard once a boy is in jail can't get out again because irons are all around the prisoner. Every time we go to bed we kneel down and pray to God that's is in heaven - since we left our dear school. Oh my we are very very sorry for it, but it is our own trouble anyhow can't help it. We are very glad that we are not in jail for live, or so many years. We think we can't very well talk once when we get there at the school again, because we are always talking english now. Our time will come yet when we will be out of jail again. It will never happen again such a foolish thing we been doing. Can you sent us some stamps and writing paper too please. Please tell the boys and girls to come and write to us some letters. And tell the staff to come and write to us too, please.\n\nWith very best love to you all who are in that school. So we must close now its time for supper now. So good-bye, our Principal.\n\nTo Mr. Rev. Henry Ellis, from your school boys Mr. Gilbert Saskamoose and George Peechow.

I have, therefore, carefully examined our office records, and find the following data bearing on the subject:\n\n(1) Letter from Mr. Ellis, the Principal, to Mr. Indian Agent Turner dated August 20th, 1926, of which a copy is enclosed herewith.\n\n(2) Letter from Mr. Indian Agent Turner to Mr. Ellis, dated September, 1926, copy of same being enclosed herewith.\n\n(3) Letter from Mr. Ellis to me, dated September 27th, 1926, copy of same being enclosed herewith.\n\nYou will note from Letter No. 1 that the Principal states there were 90 pupils in residence in the June Quarter. The grant for that Quarter, however, was only paid on an average attendance of 80 pupils, as you will see from the Departmental letter No. 129-2-3 written by Mr. Ferrier on October 20th, 1926 to Mr. Williams, our Society's accountant in Toronto.\nThe School has accommodation for 100 pupils, and as the Principal had recruited considerably over the capacity allowed and was then obliged to discharge them, our Society has lost in revenue accordingly.\n\nI trust that you may be able to reconsider this matter, and increase the pupilage from 60 to 100 not later than the beginning of the next fiscal year, and at an earlier date, if at all possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nEncs.\nOttawa, July 24th, 1928.\n\nRev.

Indian Residential School are being trained in milking cows. As most of the graduates of your school will return to reserves that are largely farming communities, it is very important that the girls be fully competent in this particular. The Department expects that the older girls, under proper supervision, will be given a course of instruction in milking, and I shall be pleased to learn that suitable arrangements have been made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Henry Ellis,\nPrincipal,\nC. of E. Indian Residential School,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from our Auditor, in which he informs me that no books are kept at the Onion Lake Indian Residential School (C.E.), and that all figures in connection with the finances are kept in Winnipeg.\n\nIt seems to me that this is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs. However, if the Department does not wish a record kept at the schools there is no necessity for an Auditor visiting these institutions. My idea of having the Auditor visit the schools is to see that the public money that is received as a grant is properly accounted for and that it is spent in connection with the work at the schools. At a school where no record is kept we have no way of finding out if the entire amount of the grant is spent on the children. For instance, the children might be poorly fed or clothed, and if there was a surplus of money it might be diverted to other branches of the church work and we have no way of checking up on this. I believe that the money earned at the schools should be spent there, and we should be in a position to say that it is if the question were asked. As it is now we have no record of what money is spent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, October 24, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 309-11 of the 5th ultimo, reporting that no books showing the finances are kept at the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School. As you are, no doubt, aware all residential schools that are administered by the Missionary Society of the Church of England have a central system of financing - Dr. Westgate's office doing the buying. All per capita grants are paid to the Treasurer in Toronto. From time to time the Department receives chartered accountants' reports concerning the expenditures made by the Society. It would, therefore, appear unnecessary to have Mr. Rayner visit the schools that are administered by the M.S.C.O.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. W. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th instant No. 115-1-1 with reference to the Auditor's report on the Onion Lake C.of E. Indian Residential School.\n\nI note that all per capita grants are paid to the Treasurer of the M.S.C.C., in Toronto and that from time to time the Department receives Chartered Accountants' reports concerning the expenditures made by the Society. I was aware that the cheques covering grants earned by the various schools were handed over to the Missionary Society of the Church of England, and that the finances were not controlled by the schools. Might I ask the Department if it has been reported to them that at certain schools where grants are earned, the amount of the grant so earned is not spent exclusively on that particular school? This seems to me entirely unfair; the grant is only sufficient to finance the school at which it is earned, and if there is a surplus in any one term, such surplus should be at the disposal of that school. No school should be called upon to help out with their grant money the finances of another school where the management is inefficient, at the expense of the children. There is no reason why a school earning a certain grant should not get the full amount of it back from the central financing system, and this is one reason why I feel that an Auditor visiting the schools would be able to give the Department valuable information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 22nd, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department understands that the attic in the Onion Lake C.

The Superintendent of Indian Education requested me to secure from the Principals of the Mackay and the Onion Lake Schools a statement showing the amount of cubic air space in each of the dormitories in the schools under their supervision. This information has just been received from the Principals themselves, and enclosed herewith you will find a copy of the statements they presented embodying the same.

The world Lloydminster has a particular significance for Cobourg citizens as the town was named for Bishop Lloyd, father of Dr. F. P. Lloyd.\n\nThe graphic description of a residential Indian School of some one hundred and twenty or thirty pupils, as given by Miss Margaret Armitage, a member of the staff for three years, conveyed a vivid word picture of everyday life there.

Although the day was very cold, about 40 degrees below zero, the school was warm and comfortable. The unit for supplying water and light at the school was working in a very satisfactory way.\n\nThere were 106 pupils in residence on the day of my visit, 55 girls and 51 boys. I visited the classrooms and noted the appearance of the children. They looked clean and healthy.\n\nThere are two qualified teachers engaged, Miss Dunn and Miss Buxton. They appear to be doing very satisfactory work. It may be interesting to note that 10 of the pupils passed the Grade 8 examinations last year.\n\nThe Reverend H. E. Ellis, Principal, has proven to be a good business man and a strict disciplinarian. I am of the opinion that this school is being very well managed.\n\nFire protection is provided by stand pipe and hose on each floor, connected with pressure tanks in the basement. There are fire extinguishers placed at easily accessible points throughout the building.\n\nA farm is operated in connection with the school. In the 1934 season their crop consisted of 25 acres of wheat which yielded 592 bushels, 80 acres of oats yielded 1,927 bushels, 15 acres of barley yielded 300 bushels, and they obtained 16,461 sheaves of green feed from 30 acres. In addition to this they put up 50 tons of hay. Nine acres of potatoes yielded 392 bushels, sufficient for their requirements.\n\nTheir livestock consists of 51 cattle, 8 horses, 27 hogs, and 150 poultry. Nineteen cows are being milked regularly. The children are given all the milk they care to drink.\n\nThe affairs at this school appeared to be running quite smoothly and harmoniously at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Hill, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nMEMORANDUM OF AN INTERVIEW BETWEEN MEMBERS OF THE INDIAN & ESKIMO RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL COMMISSION, M.S.C.C., AND THE HON. T.A. CRERRAR, MINISTER OF MINES & RESOURCES.\n\nActing on the suggestion made in a letter dated Ottawa, April 6th, by Dr. Harold V. McGill, Director of the Indian Affairs Branch of the Department of Mines & Resources, that an effort be made by our Commission to interview the Minister during his visits to Western Canada, arrangements were made for him to receive as many members as were able to attend, in his office in the Federal Building, Winnipeg, on Monday April 18th, 1938, at four o'clock in the afternoon.\n\nThe members present were as follows:\n\nHis Grace, the Archbishop of Rupert's Land\nRev. Canon H.D. Martin\nRev. C. Carruthers\nRev. H. Sherstone\nMrs. R.O. Taylor\nMrs. A.J. Thorne\nJ.W.E. Armstrong, Esq., K.C.\nH.B. Smith, Esq.,\nE.J. Brownlee, Esq.,\nCol. E.W. Hermagen\nand Rev. T.B.R. Westgate, Secretary.\n\nPrior to proceeding to the Federal Building the members assembled in their Board Room in the Bible House, and agreed that the subjects to be discussed with the Minister be as follows:\n\n(a) The situation at Fort George where the Roman Catholic School had taken 25 Anglican Indian children into residence,\n\n(b) White Fish Lake School where children who were still enrolled as pupils at our Society's School were admitted to the R.C. School at Grouard,\n\n(c) The injustice of limiting the Church of England in the Province of Saskatchewan to three Residential Schools for 3004 Anglican Indians while nine Schools were provided for 5637 Roman Catholic Indians.\n\nWhile it was the unanimous opinion of the members that these subjects should be brought to the attention of the Minister, it was agreed that special emphasis should be laid upon the need of an increased enrolment on a per capita grant earning basis, at the Fort George School.\n\nAfter His Grace, the Archbishop of Rupert's Land had offered prayer, the members proceeded to the Federal Building where they were very kindly received by the Minister shortly after four o'clock.\n\nThe Secretary, acting as spokesman for the Commission thanked the Minister for the opportunity of discussing some of their problems with him in person. He conveyed to him the regrets of the other members who were unable to attend, namely, His Grace, Archbishop Matheson, Dr. R. Fletcher, Hugh Phillips, Esq., K.C., Chancellor J. Preudhomme, K.C., Osborne Scott, Esq., and Mrs. T.A. Gray.\n\nBefore proceeding to deal specifically with the subjects previously agreed upon, the Secretary referred to the personnel of the Commission, making special reference to the representatives of the Dominion Board of the W.A., whose Dorcas Department alone contributes between forty and fifty thousand dollars a year to the Indian Residential School work.\nHe also briefly outlined the unified system of administration, as vested in the Commission and which superseded the system of Diocesan control.\n\n1. FORT GEORGE\n\nIn dealing with the situation at this centre, the Secretary mentioned that the Anglican Church had been at work at Fort George and other places along the Eastern shores of James Bay for over three-quarters of a century, while the Roman Catholic Church did not appear in Fort George until about 15 years ago. As the Government had made it a rule of policy not to erect school buildings in unorganized territories, the Bishop of the Arctic, working in collaboration with the Executive Committee, M.S.C.C., decided to build a School at Fort George with Church money, fully expecting that the ruling given in the following Departmental letter from the Deputy Superintendent General, would afford protection against competition from the Roman Catholic Church:\n\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nDecember 26, 1927.\n\n\"Dear Dr. Westgate:-\n\nI beg to draw your attention to the fact that the expense of education for the native population is upon the increase, and while the Department desires to provide a reasonably adequate system, it is essential that the outlay should be controlled. It is thought that the denominations should respect the zones of interest which have been established and not encroach upon them by the extension of missionary effort upon which a demand for separate educational institutions might be afterwards based. This view seems to me truly reasonable, and in future the Department will not recognize requests for new educational institutions unless by pre-arrangement and assistance must not be expected for institutions which encroach by the extension of missionary effort upon territory already provided for.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) Duncan C. Scott.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\"\n\nWhile the School built by the Bishop of the Arctic has a capacity of 60 children, the Commission were amazed to find, after it had been transferred to them for administration, that the Department would not allow a grant for more than 35 children. Despite earnest requests that they reconsider the matter, the Department did not grant the increase on the grounds that no funds were available. On purely humanitarian grounds fifteen children were taken into the School over and above the 35 for whom the Department had agreed to pay the grant, the cost of maintenance and tuition of these being met by the Executive Committee, M.S.C.C.\n\nAfter the Department had refused to increase the pupilage at our Society's School beyond 35, the members of the Commission learned, not without consternation, that several Anglican Indian children had been taken into the Roman Catholic School at Fort George, and were informed that this action had been taken with the approval of the Department and that the per capita grants which should have been available for the additional fifteen children in the Society's School were being paid for Anglican Indian children to be maintained and educated in a Roman Catholic School.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6320, file 658-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFull details of the children in residence in the Roman Catholic School reached the Commission on March 19th of this year in a letter from the Rev. B.S. Greene, B.A., Principal of our Society's School at Fort George, and dated Jan. 25th, 1938. In this letter Mr. Greene gives the names of 28 children in the School. Although he was able to give the dates of the admission of 18 only, as some of them came from Rupert's House and East Main, he emphatically declares that \"ALL THE CHILDREN ON THE LIST ARE ANGLICAN CHILDREN\".\n\nTo further prove that the children admitted to the Roman Catholic School must have been Anglican Indian children, the Secretary quoted from an article written by the Roman Catholic missionary at Fort George (P\u00e8re Gilles Marchand, O.M.I., Provincial Oblate) which appeared in the magazine \"Le Mauricien\" under the title \"Fort George, Mission de Peine\". The article stated, in part, as follows:\n\n\"Our Missionaries have been up against a lot of calumnies, sarcasm and fanaticism on the part of the minister of error; the Powerful Company, whose full control has been established upon these rich fur regions, has certainly not helped us in any way in showing its favoritism in the error which is being committed of maintaining the suspicion of the Indians towards our priests and so much so that after fifteen years of hard work our mission does not as yet count one single Catholic\".\n\nThey mention that although none of the children are as yet Catholic, nevertheless, several of them are hoping to become converts very soon and quote:\n\n\"They are looking forward to the day when they may be able to join our Church and bring with them their parents who are still under the control by the prestige of the Powerful Company and of the riches of the Country.\"\n\nAfter reading the above quotation, the Secretary stated the Commission did not feel that our Society had been fairly treated in this matter, and that they considered the Department should immediately arrange for an increase in the pupilage at our Society's School at this centre from 35 to at least 60.\n\nThe Minister asked if he might have a copy of the article written by the Roman Catholic priest at Fort George, and the Secretary promised to furnish him with the same. Mr. Crerar promised to look into the situation when he returned to Ottawa and to take up with his colleagues the question of granting an increased amount of money in order to the difficulty of having supplementary estimates passed by the House of Parliament, and to the comparatively large amount which was being spent this year in combating T.B. That the Minister was keenly interested in all the work of the Indian Affairs Branch of his Department the members of the commission who were present had no doubt. They assured him of their willingness to co-operate with him and his Department in any way that would benefit the Indian peoples of this country, and expressed the hope that the Roman Catholic Church might be restrained from taking Anglican children to their Schools as they had done at Fort George, and other Anglican children from White Fish Lake School to their School at Grouard, in open defiance of Section 10, sub-section 2 of the Indian Act which reads as follows:\n\n\"Such school shall be the nearest available school of the kind required, and no Protestant child shall be assigned to a Roman Catholic school or a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices, and no Roman Catholic child shall be assigned to a Protestant school or a school conducted under Protestant auspices.\"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6320, file 658-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Secretary stated that it would surely be a sad day for Canada when any Church or Society could disregard the authority of the Federal Government, as the Roman Catholic Church appeared to be inclined to do.\n\n2. WHITE FISH LAKE\n\nIn dealing with the situation at this centre, the Secretary gave the names of eleven Anglican Indian children who had been taken from the White Fish Lake district to the Roman Catholic School at Groverd, 40 miles away. Of these eleven he reported only five of seven children were still on the register at our Society's St. Andrew's School. He mentioned that he had referred this situation to the proper Departmental officials at Ottawa, in a letter written on Oct. 27th last.\n\nThe Secretary of the Indian Affairs Branch, replying to that letter on Dec. 17th last stated that instructions were being issued to have those seven children returned to their parents. In a letter recently received from the Principal of our School at White Fish Lake, and dated April 6, 1938, he stated that the order given by the Department for the seven children to be returned \"to the Reserve has so far been utterly ignored\".\n\nWith regard to the number of schools provided for the Anglican and the Roman Catholic Churches respectively in the province of Saskatchewan, the Minister stated that he had not been aware that so great a difference existed, and undertook to look into the matter.\n\nThe interview with the Minister ended shortly after five o'clock.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nWinnipeg, April 21, 1938.\nThe Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission\nof the\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nGENERAL SECRETARY, M.S.C.C.\nRev.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIn keeping with the understanding reached during our interview in Ottawa on the 21st instant, I am now writing for the specific purpose of asking that the official pupilage at our Onion Lake School be increased from 100 to, at least, 110.\n\nIn support of this request I desire to point out that while the enrollment at the end of the last quarter (September 1938) was 116, the per capita grant is limited to 100.\n\nI further desire to point out that when two new school buildings were provided on the Onion Lake reserve, one for our Society and one for the Roman Catholic Church, it was my understanding that there was no difference in the official capacity of these respective buildings.\n\nI now find from page 4856 of Hansard for June 30, 1938, that while the pupilage of our Society's School is limited to 100, that of the Roman Catholic School is 120.\nIn addition to this apparent, though probably unintentional discrimination against our Society, I wish to again direct attention to the fact that while there are 3900 Anglican Indians in the province of Saskatchewan, and 5637 Roman Catholic Indians, the Anglicans have been allowed only three Residential Schools, while the Roman Catholics have been allowed nine Schools of this class. (See Hansard as referred to above). Even if the United Church Schools be added to those of the Anglican Church, the number of Schools granted the Roman Catholic Church is proportionately larger than it should be from the standpoint of equity.\n\nAs this and other matters of like importance were discussed by representatives of our Commission at a meeting with the Minister of Mines and Resources in Winnipeg on April 18th last, I am sending you herewith a copy of the official record of that meeting, and from the closing part of the same you will note that the Minister undertook to look into this situation.\n\nWhile I am not dealing specifically or primarily in this letter with this particular problem, I consider it necessary to mention it, on account of the bearing it has on the pupilage of our Onion Lake School.\n\nAs the Roman Catholic Church has been provided by the Government with more Residential Schools proportionately than they are entitled to have in the Province of Saskatchewan in comparison with the Anglican and United Churches, and as their Onion Lake School is allowed an official pupilage of 120, whereas our School on the same reserve is allowed only 100 pupils, I trust you may see that our request for an increase in the pupilage from 100 to 110 is a decidedly modest and reasonable one, and take immediately whatever steps are necessary to secure the same.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBRW/KH\nOttawa, December 28, 1938.\n\nRe: Inspection of Onion Lake C. E. and Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential Schools.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 19th instant and also reports of Inspector Brennan on the above noted schools, enclosed therewith.\n\nThe records here indicate that the Onion Lake R. C. School is allowed per capita grant for 120 pupils and the Onion Lake C. E. School per capita grant for 100 pupils. I was somewhat surprised therefore to learn from the Inspector's report that the enrolment at the C. E. residential school had reached 122. I am convinced that it is wholly impossible to ask an inexperienced teacher such as Miss Sherstone to give instruction to 62 pupils with any hope of success.\n\nI note that there appears to be no provision whatever for vocational instruction or manual training at this school, despite the fact that the present Minister is constantly reminding us that the courses at our Indian day and residential schools must become increasingly more vocational in character.\n\nIn view of the comments contained in the Inspector's report, I am anxious that a survey of the educational needs in the Onion Lake and Battleford agencies should be undertaken by the Indian agents in cooperation with the principals of the residential schools. The Anglican authorities have asked for an additional pupilage of 10 at the Onion Lake school, but no provision has been made in the 1939-40 estimates for this or any other increases at\n\nDr. Thomas Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nresidential schools. I think it would be in the interests of all concerned if you could discuss the situation with the principal of the Anglican school and suggest to him that the enrolment at the school be reduced to 100 at the opening of the next academic year, in September, and that it be kept at that figure unless permission is obtained from the Department for the enrolment of additional pupils. In addition to this, provision should be made at the school for vocational instruction - carpentry work, auto mechanics, hand loom weaving, etc. It is my hope that the 5% deduction in per capita grants may be restored with the coming session of Parliament. If such restoration takes place it ought to be possible for the principal to make provision for vocational instruction at his institution.\n\nThe report on the Onion Lake C. E. school is on the whole one of the most unsatisfactory that has reached me since I entered the Department two years ago. It is simply impossible to promote a worthwhile educational program at a school with an enrolment of 123 pupils with only two teachers in charge.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to yours #115-1-1 of December 28th, Residential Schools, Onion Lake, I expect to visit Onion Lake within the next two weeks where I will take up the matter referred to in the above letter and will submit a report on my return.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector Of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nMontreal Lake I.R. 106,\nMontreal Lake, Sask.\nDec. 30, 1938\n\nDear Mr. Ellis:\n\nI meant to write you every day for the past few weeks but have been very busy indeed. I want to know if you have room to admit any pupils at present.\n\nNorah and Lillian Roberts, two sisters of this Reserve, aged eleven years and ten years respectively, are poor little orphans. Their mother is dead, and the stepfather married again so that now they have a stepmother as well. She (the stepmother) gave one away to be little slave to her sister's family. I want these children taken away to school with the least possible delay. Can you take them as soon as it can be arranged?\n\nMr. Davis was here today and asked me to get in touch with you at once, and ask you to let him know if you have room for them now. There is another family of one girl and one boy (both illegitimate) who need to be taken away from an immoral mother. The ages are ten and eight. Mr. Davis would approve of their removal too. The names are Harriet Bird and Harry Bird.\n\nPlease do what you can for these children. There are at least three others who ought to be sent away but their cases are not so desperate.\n\nWith kind regards, and best wishes for a happy 1939.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) Mrs. Agnes B. Stenhouse.\n\nP.S. I can arrange regarding getting those children to Prince Albert for you, if you can accept them.\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of Nov. 29th last and your personal reply to the same on Dec. 20th last, I beg to state that the Chairman of our Commission, the Most Reverend S.P. Matheson, wrote to the Honourable the Minister of Mines and Resources on Dec. 30th last about a number of matters which he stated had caused him and our Commission very serious concern for some time.\n\nOne of the matters he specifically mentioned was an increase in the pupilage at our Onion Lake School from 100 to 110. As the School at this centre had 112 children enrolled at the end of the December Quarter, 1938, I am sending you herewith a copy of a letter just received from the Principal this morning and addressed to him, which furnishes further strong evidence of the urgent need of the increase requested. The writer of the letter is either the teacher or field matron engaged by the Diocese of Saskatchewan on the Montreal Lake Reserve, and you will note that she had been in touch with Mr. Indian Agent Davis, who approved of the removal of the four children mentioned.\n\nIn view of the urgency of the situation, the Rev. Principal Ellis is being authorized to receive these...\nchildren, and I very earnestly hope that this action may be approved by your Department, and every possible effort made to have the official capacity of our Onion Lake School increased from 100 to 110.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nEncl.\nTBW/KH\nOttawa, January 21, 1939.\n\nRe - Additional pupilage, Onion Lake C. of E.\nIndian Residential School.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 13th instant, in which you discuss the desirability of an additional pupilage allowance at the above noted school.\n\nI am not in a position at this time to state what provision, if any, will be made in the supplementary estimates of this year for additional pupilage at Indian residential schools. In view of the fact, however, that the restoration of the 5% deduction is now under consideration by the Government and in view of the money required for the promotion of the T.B. campaign, I am not at all hopeful that an additional appropriation for increased pupilage grants will be forthcoming.\n\nI made a careful study of the files relating to the erection of the C. E. and R. C. Residential Schools at Onion Lake. I have found that at the time the schools were erected the Onion Lake R. C. Residential School was built much larger than the Onion Lake C. E. School; consequently, the air space in the dormitories of the former is approximately 22,000 cubic feet more than in the dormitories of the latter. According to the plans on file at this office, the air space in the dormitories of the C. E. School is 35,426 cubic feet. Possibly the school management is using an attic or some room other than the regular dormitories for dormitory purposes. If so, the air space will be slightly larger than the figures just quoted. At the same time, to provide adequate air space for 110 pupils it would require 35,000 cubic feet. As a matter of fact, I am inclined to feel that with an enrolment of 100 the air space at the Onion Lake C. E. School is hardly adequate.\n\nI regret to state that Inspector Brennan's report on the C. E. school at Onion Lake, which reached the Department in December, 1938, is one of the most unsatisfactory reports that has reached this office since I entered the service of the Department two years ago. At the time of the inspection the enrolment had reached 123, with two teachers responsible for the instruction. It was the Inspector's opinion that to ask an inexperienced teacher such as Miss Sherstone to give instruction to 62 pupils was asking a young teacher to accomplish a task wholly beyond her powers. In addition to the Inspector's comments,\n\nI have -\n\nReverend T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nIndian & Eskimo Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C.,\n38-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nI have learned that no provision whatever has been made for vocational instruction at this school. All this information of course would have to be carefully reviewed and submitted to the Minister before the enrolment at the school for per capita grant purposes could be increased.\n\nI have already written to Dr. Robertson, Inspector of Indian Agencies for Saskatchewan, asking him to undertake a survey of the educational needs of the Onion Lake district, in cooperation with the Indian agents, just as soon as he can conveniently do so. It is altogether likely that Dr. Robertson's report will reach the Department in the course of a few weeks.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A.

January 31, 1939.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI am grateful to you for your letter of the 21st inst., #115-1-1, and have noted the misapprehension under which I was laboring and that the R.C. School on the Onion Lake Reserve has somewhat larger air space than that provided in our Society's School on the same Reserve. My understanding rested on information I received from the late Mr. Gurney Orr, who drew the plans for both schools, and informed me that the plans were almost identical.\n\nWith regard to Inspector Brennan's report on our Onion Lake School, which reached you in December last, more particularly that part of it dealing with the services of Miss Sherstone, one of the teachers, the Principal, writing to me on the third inst. stated, in part, as follows; \"It is unfortunate that the Public School Inspector inspected her classroom work when she was new to the children and the work\".\n\nIn another letter written earlier last year, the Principal states that \"In speaking to the Public School Inspector last week, he stated that he had suggested making an additional classroom to his Department three years ago, and appeared surprised that no word had been sent to you from Ottawa. Both teachers have too many pupils in their rooms at present, hence the only solution to the problem is the extra classroom\".\n\nAs the Principal states that one of the sewing rooms can be converted into a third classroom our Commission have decided to appoint a third teacher to this school from the 1st of March next. This teacher will take charge of the Senior\nGrades and Miss Sherstone will have charge of the Intermediate Grades. I have instructed the Principal to apply through the local Indian Agent for the necessary classroom equipment for the third room, and I trust that this may be granted promptly by your Department. The appointment of the third teacher will surely place all the classroom work on a satisfactory basis. Although the third teacher has not yet been appointed our Commission have in view for this position a fully qualified and experienced person.\n\nWith regard to your information \"that no provision whatever has been made for vocational training at this school\" I desire to point out that the majority of the children in this school will live on farms when they graduate and I am not aware that any of our schools has a more successful record in general farming activities than our St. Barnabas' School at Onion Lake. To me and to our Commission, a good grounding in mixed farming cannot but be of great benefit to the boys especially in their post graduate career. The girls are also taught all branches of housekeeping, and as a fully qualified nurse holds the position of Head Matron, expert care is taken of the children's health.\n\nOur Commission are in full sympathy with your Department's desire to enlarge the scope of vocational training, but the members have no suggestion to make beyond the very practical one they have submitted for many years past with their list of annual requirements, that detached classrooms be provided with space for vocational training underneath. Our Society, with its heavy bank overdraft, cannot provide such a building, and until such building has been provided, it will be impossible to institute any vocational training course in carpentry, blacksmithing, mechanics, etc., which will be worthwhile. As our Commission has purchased the school with a complete threshing outfit, I think you will see that we are doing as much as we possibly can with our resources to help fit your wards for the life they will have to live when they leave the school.\n\nWith very good wishes,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.B.R.W/H\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nP.S. An increase of even five in the pupilage at this school would help us in meeting the cost of the third teacher.\n\nT.B.R.W.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 6, 1939.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo with reference to the Onion Lake C.E. Indian residential school.\n\nI am very pleased to know that it has been decided to open a third class room.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission,\nM. S. C.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn conversation with Indian Agent Dr. Hill of the Onion Lake Agency the other day, I gathered that you are under the impression that no vocational training is given whatsoever at the C. E. Indian Residential School.\n\nBy what means or how you have come to this conclusion, naturally fails me.\n\nI want, however, to correct that impression - for we teach both sexes all practical phases of work which the children here will be able to apply themselves after leaving school.\n\nThough I readily admit that our resources and equipment are not of the best, yet I venture to state, without fear of contradiction, that the instruction given is systematic and lasting.\n\nIf the Department will furnish us with the necessary equipment, so that we will be able to 'make bricks with the straw', I feel confident that we will not be lagging behind in this branch of definite vocational training.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nOttawa, February 6, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 31st ultimo, in which you refer to your interview with Dr. Hill, with respect to the instruction provided at the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School.\n\nI cannot recall to mind having written to Dr. Hill at any time in regard to this matter, but I did write to Inspector Robertson and to Dr. Westgate, immediately following the receipt of the School Inspector's report dated October 25, 1928. In my letter to Dr. Westgate I intimated that the Inspector's report on the Onion Lake C. E. School was one of the most unsatisfactory reports that had reached the Department since I entered the service of the Government two years ago. The Inspector was particularly critical of Miss Sherstone's work, the discipline in her classroom, the number of pupils for the instruction of whom she is responsible, etc. It was his opinion that to ask an inexperienced teacher to undertake the instruction of 62 pupils was asking her to undertake an impossible task. It was the Inspector's view that Miss Sherstone was handicapped in that she was wholly unfamiliar with the Saskatchewan curriculum.\n\nThe Inspector in his report of the preceding year, in commenting upon the instruction provided, stated:\n\n\"I feel that less stress on the academic part of the education and more on the practical, such as training in agriculture, home economics, manual training, etc., would prove of value to these pupils and better fit them for life. I should like to point out that both these teachers have far too many pupils with whom to do first-class work. If they keep up at the pace they are going\u2014\n\nReverend Henry Ellis,\nPrincipal,\nOnion Lake Residential School,\nLloydminster, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6320, file 658-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\ngoing, I fear for their health.\n\nIn view of this comment, it was my hope that there would be something in the Inspector's report of this year to indicate that steps had been taken to make greater provision for vocational instruction. However, there is nothing in the report now before me to indicate that vocational instruction in an organized and systematic sense forms part of the regular studies.\n\nI was delighted to learn from Dr. Westgate's letter of January 31 that it is the intention of the Commission to provide an additional teacher. I feel confident that the appointment of this teacher will result in a substantial improvement in conditions at the school.\n\nThe Minister is constantly reminding us that courses of study provided for Indian children must become increasingly more practical and vocational in character, and I feel that it is my duty to emphasize the Minister's opinion in this regard from time to time. Your reference to the equipment needed for such instruction is noted. It is scarcely necessary to remind you however that the funds required for the purchase of such equipment are not provided by the officials but by Parliament itself. Requests for such equipment from time to time should be submitted to the Indian Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, January 24, 1940.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nMr. W. D. Brennan, Inspector of Schools, Province of Saskatchewan, in a report on the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School, dated December 27, 1939, states:\n\n\"It is to be regretted that there have been so many staff changes. There have been six different teachers employed in the last three years. There were three new ones since my last visit, and one of them was planning to quit at Xmas. One of the additions this year was a young lady right out of normal school without any experience. While she tried hard and seemed to be doing good work, she had difficulty in adjusting herself to her new surroundings. I would strongly advise that in future only experienced teachers be engaged, the experience not necessarily being with Indians. This is the second case of this type in two years and the work of the school is bound to suffer therefrom.\"\n\nIn view of the criticism that reaches me from time to time in respect to the courses of study provided at our Indian residential schools, I feel it is only fair that you should be furnished with the critical comments that reach us from inspectors of these schools in their annual and semi-annual reports.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. T. B. R.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have received your letter of the 24th ult. and have carefully noted the excerpt embodied therein from the report of Inspector Brennan on the change of teachers at our Onion Lake School during the last three years.\n\nIn this connection I desire to make it quite clear that it is the aim and policy of our Commission to secure, so far as possible, staff agents who contemplate permanency of service in the Indian & Eskimo residential school work, and in this important matter a gratifying degree of success has been attained. For your information I may say that all inexperienced workers are placed on three months probation. Should their services during that period be satisfactory to the Principal and to our Commission they are then asked to sign a written contract specifying a definite period of service, and the notice which must be given by either of the contracting parties before such contract can be terminated. You will readily understand that certain conditions may arise which make it necessary to alter the contract, and this is precisely what happened at Onion Lake. Two of the teachers for health reasons, asked to be released, and another was promised a transfer to a school nearer her home whenever a vacancy was available for her. To fill one of the vacancies thus created, a fully qualified teacher who had for some years been serving at this School as a Supervisor, after teaching for several years at two of our other Schools, was given charge of one of the classrooms.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6320, file 658-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Inspector might have reported, but I see no reference to it in the extract embodied in your letter, that the Senior Teacher at this School is a university graduate, and is really doing a highly creditable work in developing amongst the children in the School and the Indians on the Reserve some of their finer arts and crafts. She has arranged for the sale of their products through the Arts and Crafts Society in Saskatoon. Our Commission are pleased to have the services of one so capable and so willing to give or her very best to this work.\n\nIt is inevitable that some workers must be engaged who have not had previous teaching experience, and after all, I think it must be admitted that the best place to secure the required training for the residential school work is in the school itself.\n\nSince receiving your letter I have been in communication with the Superintendent of Education in the Province of Manitoba (Mr. Low) and have learned from him that the average period of service given by a public school teacher in the province is from one to two years. He stated that while the tenure varies considerably in different parts of the province, the average would be as stated.\n\nWhile our Commission always welcome constructive criticism of their work, I would again like to point out that one of the most urgent needs at our Onion Lake, our Mikahom, our Lac la Ronge and certain other Schools, is the provision of a detached classroom block, with space made available in the basement of the same for manual training. Our Society feels keenly the disadvantage under which their Indian educational work is being carried on in the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan due to the lack of sufficient residential school facilities. While the provision of the buildings requested may take some time, the members are still earnestly hoping that your Department of Government may soon be able to give to this important matter the careful and sympathetic attention it undoubtedly demands.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBW/KH\nApril 18th, 1941.\n\nThe Dominion of Canada,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nRe: St. Barnabas School, Onion Lake Indian Reserve\nOnion Lake, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe have been advised by the Reverend H.

In the case of the Onion Lake C.E. School the management is under the direction of the Church of England.\n\nThis Branch was definitely informed in December, 1937, that the Saskatchewan education tax does not apply to purchases made by Indian residential schools.\n\nI am not certain what arrangements have been made by the Indian residential schools in connection with securing exemption from the gasoline tax in the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nDuring our recent interview in Winnipeg I mentioned the request of the Principals of our Onion Lake and Sioux Lookout Schools for movie picture projectors, and you suggested that I write to you in this connexion.\n\nThe value of this means of instruction has been recognized by our Commission, and during the past year 16 m.m. projectors have been provided for our Blackfoot and Moose Factory Schools. The expenditures involved in providing these have left us without funds to secure those now requested, and it will be fully appreciated if your Department can find some way of doing this on our behalf.\n\nThe projector recommended in each case is known as the \"Filmo S.T. Projector\" for 16 m.m. films, with 750 watt, 110 volt lamp, 2 inch F. 1.6 lens, and these may be purchased (at a special rate) from the General Board of Religious Education of our Church, at 604 Jarvis St., Toronto, for $142.00 each.\n\nWhere schools are located near a town or city, the staff and pupils are able to take advantage of the motion picture facilities they provide. Neither Onion Lake nor Sioux Lookout are so located, and it is easy to understand the great help the projectors would be to them, especially during the winter months.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBW/kh\nOttawa,\nSeptember 17, 1941.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nRe: Purchase of moving picture projectors for Onion Lake and Sioux Lookout Indian Residential Schools\n\nYour letter of September 3, addressed to Dr. McGill, has been passed on to me for consideration and reply. Dr. McGill is, at this date, absent from the office and is not likely to return for several days.\n\nI regret to state that, inasmuch as no provision was made in the current year's appropriation for the purchase of moving picture projectors, it will not be possible to purchase projectors for the Onion Lake and Sioux Lookout Residential Schools this year.\n\nI may state, however, that a great deal of earnest thought and consideration has been given to the best ways and means of providing visual instruction at Indian day and residential schools. You will be interested to learn also that I am today communicating with Mr. John Grierson, Government Film Commissioner, in the hope that a couple of the officers of the Welfare & Training Division can interview him at an early date and secure from him the most up-to-date information on visual instruction.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission,\nM. S. C. C.,\n38-43 The Bible House,\n164 Alexander Ave. East,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nAbout two years ago a moving picture projector somewhat similar to the one requested in your communication was purchased by the Department for extension work on a number of reserves in the Province of Ontario. We discovered a few months ago, however, that it was impossible to secure films suitable for instruction among Indians with the result that we sold the projector and purchased a well equipped lantern for this work. I have been informed that in British Columbia, particularly the City of Vancouver, only sound projectors are now in use and that it is almost impossible to secure silent films suitable for instruction at schools. There is also the problem of electrical energy and the question of direct and alternating currents. These are all matters that we intend to discuss with Mr. Grierson.\n\nYou can readily appreciate, of course, that it would not be possible for the Government to purchase projectors for one or two schools and refuse similar requests from others. I am simply writing at this time, however, to inform you that, while it is not possible to purchase the projectors requested by you, the matter is receiving consideration by the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nActing Director.\nRegina, September 15, 1943.\n\nREPORT ON ST. BARNABAS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nI wish to advise you that I visited the above mentioned school on my last trip to the Onion Lake Agency.\n\nSince it was August when I was there the summer holidays were still on and only a few children were at the school at the time of my visit. However, Agent Cameron and I spent the best part of an afternoon visiting this school. Last June there were 116 children in residence.\n\nOne thing I noticed was that the barn is leaning badly and the north end has moved at least six inches off the cement foundation. The stall posts throughout the building are also leaning badly towards the east. Something should be done this Fall to straighten and brace the building to prevent it from blowing over because there is certainly a danger of this happening when some of the high gales that are prevalent in that part of the country come along. A Mr. Comish from the Surveys and Engineering Branch at Banff visited the school last Spring and took photographs of the barn in question, therefore our Branch can get the required information from him as to an engineer's point of view. There is a man at Onion Lake who probably would be able to put the necessary repairs on the building. I understand he is not in very good health at the present time but he is a good practical carpenter if his services can be obtained.\n\nThis barn accommodates 21 cows and 8 horses, and has a loft that holds 30 tons of hay. Mr. Ellis, the Principal, would like to use that portion of the barn now occupied by the horses for calves and young stock and to build a separate log barn for the horses. This would cost $400.00. The Principal's request has already been submitted to Ottawa by Agent Cameron.\n\nThe school owns 52 head of cattle and milks 26 cows. They have 11 pigs and keep 125 head of poultry and 6 work horses.\n\nThe school farms 220 acres of land. Of this 170 acres is under cultivation and 50 acres have been summerfallowed. The crops are fair and the gardens are fair. They have 11 acres of potatoes this year.\n\nLivestock\n\nFarming\n\nExterior Painting - The exterior...\nThe exterior of this school was last painted in 1930, thirteen years ago. You can therefore imagine what condition the buildings are in now. There are places where no paint is left on the siding at all. The roof is in even worse condition as there is not a bit of shingle stain left on the shingles, and this is causing them to warp, resulting in the roof beginning to leak in the odd place. Consideration should be given to painting the exterior of the building and the roof as soon as the money is available. I hope our Branch will make a note of this because you will realize that not having been painted for thirteen years it is in pretty bad shape.\n\nThe interior of the school is in very fair shape. However, I might suggest that some paint be supplied to the school annually, say $50.00 worth, for interior decoration. This paint could be put on by the older boys.\n\nThe machinery at the school is in good condition with the exception of the high pressure boiler which has been condemned by the Provincial Boiler Inspector. The jacket heater is worn out but I was informed by the Principal this could be dispensed with for the present time. However, the high pressure boiler will have to be replaced and Mr. Cameron is submitting a report and estimate on the boiler for your information.\n\nI wish to bring to your attention here that the bake oven is in the laundry and I do not think this is a very satisfactory arrangement but of course it must remain where it is for the present. However, when funds are available I think this should be placed somewhere else.\n\nM.

SCHOOL CULTIVATING BUILDINGS SAVED AIR LETTER FOLLOWS\"\n\nWednesday, December 1st., about 6.00 AM, I was notified by telephone that the Onion Lake Anglican Residential School was on fire and that the fire had taken quite a hold. I immediately called Mr Lockhart, farming instructor, and asked him to accompany me to the School, which is about 6 miles from the Agency. I also called Corp. D. A. Dunlap, R.C.M.P. and requested him to come and at the same time ascertained that all available help had already been summoned by phone.\n\nWhen we arrived on the scene it was evident that there was no further hope of saving the building, in fact, it was more than half gone then. We assisted in measures taken to save the Principal's house and the barn and outbuildings. By 8.00 A.M. the school had burned to the ground. The alarm had been turned in by the night watchman, who woke Mr W. Waterhouse, engineer, at about 4.00 A.M. Mr Waterhouse found that the fire was in the laundry room located on the east side of the building. The whole staff was called and chemical extinguishers were used to put out the fire in the laundry room, but it was found that the fire had got between the ceiling of the laundry room and the floor of the Chapel located just above. The general alarm was then turned in and the firemen used to fight the fire. The laundry had a tin ceiling and this made it more difficult to get at the fire burning between the joists, and the fire spread westward and throughout the building.\n\nAll the pupils, 115 in number, were quietly removed from their dormitories to the play room, where they dressed and were then taken to the R.C. Indian Residential School and cared for by Father Pascal until the morning of December 2nd., when they were conveyed to their homes on the various reserves.\n\nRev. Mr Ellie, the Principal, had been in the building about 2.00 A.M. and had found everything normal. There was a fire in the bake oven and one in the laundry stove, also a fire in the furnace. The two former are located in the laundry and the latter in the North-west corner of the building. Every effort appears to have been made by the staff to save the building and the efficient manner in which the children were safely evacuated and taken care of is very creditable to those in charge.\n\ncontinued overleaf\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am anxious, therefore, that Mr. Ellis should retain, if at all possible, the members of his staff until a decision is finally reached.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A.

R. A. Hoey, Esq.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Onion Lake School\n\nI beg to confirm telegram sent from the office on December 1st, and regret that I am not yet able to give you any further information in regard to this tragic loss. I take it that telephone communication has probably been broken and can well imagine the turmoil in which the Principal must find himself at such a time. We shall send you a full report of the matter just as soon as it is received.\n\nIn regard to the future, I have received a telegram from the Bishop of Saskatchewan offering the use of the splendid building formerly used for St. Alban's College in Prince Albert. This is a brick structure which was thoroughly repaired not many years ago, and stands in ample grounds on the southern outskirts of Prince Albert. It is not in use at the present time and could be made immediately available. As this building was used as a boarding school for boys, it would appear to be admirably suited for the purpose until such time as reconstruction can be considered at Onion Lake. I understand that Mr. Ellis has estimated that the building would readily accommodate 80 to 100 children and I note that the majority of the present pupils come from reserves that are within easy distance of Prince Albert.\n\nI understand that an approach was made to the Department at the beginning of this year to have the building used as an Indian Residential School but the objection was raised to its location in the city. From my knowledge of the local situation I do not feel that this objection is of sufficient weight to offset the enormous advantage of carrying on the Onion Lake work without a serious break. I wired Principal Ellis yesterday, passing on the Bishop's suggestion and asking for his personal opinion. I felt that it might influence him in holding some of the children together and especially in retaining the services of his staff. No reply is yet to hand but I think it well to write you now so that this suggestion may be fully before you with the least possible delay.\n\nI am personally acquainted with the situation in Prince Albert and shall be glad to run up there at any time to secure further information on the spot, if you think well of the suggestion. I may say that\nthis further loss by fire is a heavy blow to me personally. The Onion Lake building was comparatively new, and was very well pleased with many things in the work there. I certainly feel that in our Principal we have an experienced and most capable administrator, and I feel confident that every possible care was taken to avoid the hazards of fire. The one redeeming feature, of course, is the fact that 120 children were safely taken from the building at 4:30 in the morning.\n\nAs our staff is practically complete, it would seem altogether too bad to allow the work to come to a stop if your Department can feel satisfied to accept the offer of the Bishop and to allow the work to carry on for the present in Prince Albert.\n\nI shall write further as soon as possible. Meanwhile, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.A. Alderwood\nSecretary.\n\nHAA:A.\nOttawa, December 7, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Onion Lake Residential School.\n\nI am sending forward herewith a letter received from Dr. H. A. Alderwood, Secretary of the Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission of the Church of England.\n\nMay I direct your attention particularly to the suggestion made in the second paragraph of Dr. Alderwood's letter? You may remember that a somewhat similar proposal was submitted to the Minister by the Bishop of Saskatchewan in January, 1942. At that time, however, the Department was asked to take over the building at Prince Albert known as St. Alban's College on the understanding that it would be operated under the auspices of the Church of England as an additional residential school for the Anglican Indian pupils of northern Saskatchewan.\n\nCanon Dixon, in a letter to the Minister dated January 15, 1943, submitted full and complete information with respect to the service that such a school might render and also gave the actual dimensions of the building. This letter reads in part as follows:\n\n\"We would further propose and recommend that such a school be housed in a building already available in Prince Albert. This building is the property of the Diocese of Saskatchewan and is situated on a piece of land measuring 250 ft. by 250 ft., on a hill overlooking the city and quite near the Prince Albert Collegiate High School.\n\n\"We believe this building and property would be well suited to the purposes of the school. The building...\"\nis of brick construction throughout. The cubic contents are 234,800 cubic feet. It is 46 ft. high and has two wings, measuring 75' x 55' and 72' x 33', respectively. It is equipped with steam heating, hot water, sanitary plumbing and electric light. It would accommodate from 75 to 100 children with the necessary staff. It is in good repair throughout but would require certain plastering, redecorating, etc., that would not cost more than $2,000.00.\n\nThe last census report (1938) indicates that there are, in the Battleford, Carlton, Duck Lake and Onion Lake agencies the following number of Indians:\n\n| Agency     | Total Population | Church of England | Roman Catholic Church | United Church | Presbyterian |\n|------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|---------------|--------------|\n| Battleford | 2470             | 664               | 1775                  |               |              |\n| Carlton    | 2592             | 1770              | 538                   | 53            | 137          |\n| Duck Lake  | 1140             | 537               | 408                   | 80            |              |\n| Onion Lake | 1390             | 249               | 1078                  |               |              |\n\nIn addition to those classified as Anglican, United Church and Roman Catholic, there is a number classified as of aboriginal beliefs.\n\nThere are at present 14 residential schools in the province of Saskatchewan, with an authorized enrolment of 1650 pupils. Three of these schools - Gordon's in the Touchwood agency, Lac la Ronge, in the Carlton agency and Onion Lake in the Onion Lake agency, are operated under the auspices of the Anglican Church. Two - File Hills, File Hills agency, and Round Lake, Crooked Lake agency - are operated by the United Church. The other nine schools are operated under the auspices of the Catholic Church. The Lac la Ronge School, in the Carlton agency, is approximately 200 miles north of the city of Prince Albert.\n\nThe Onion Lake school, at the time of its destruction by fire on December 1, had an authorized enrolment of 100 pupils and an actual attendance of 125.\nThe Lac la Ronge school has also an authorized enrolment of 100. Our records indicate that the pupils enrolled at the Onion Lake School at the time of the fire were recruited from the following agencies:- Onion Lake 30; Carlton 54; Battleford 40; Duck Lake 4 and Saddle Lake 7. It will be noted that only 20 pupils were recruited from the Onion Lake agency. In view of this fact, it is just possible that an educational survey of the Onion Lake agency might be undertaken with the object of deciding what type of school should take the place of the one destroyed by fire. In view of the comparatively small number of pupils in attendance at the residential school, it is just possible that an improved day school might meet the needs of the Indian population.\n\nThe subject matter of Dr. Alderwood's letter has been very carefully discussed and reviewed with the officials of the Welfare and Training Division. In view of all the circumstances, I recommend,- (1) that the offer of the Bishop of Saskatchewan be accepted and that the necessary steps be taken to operate the St. Alban's College building at Prince Albert as a residential school, with an enrolment of approximately 100 pupils; (2) that, in lieu of rent, the expenditures for repairs, redecorating, etc., amounting to approximately $2,000.00, be borne by this branch.\n\nIt is altogether likely that the Principal, Mr. Ellis, will be anxious to retain the members of his present staff and it would be appreciated if we could have a decision in respect to this matter at an early date.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa December 7 1943\n\nReverend Doctor H.

(RG 10, Volume 6320, file 658-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, December 8, 1943.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nThe proposal submitted by you, on behalf of the Bishop of Saskatchewan, in your letter to the Indian Affairs Branch of December 4 - that the building at present available in the city of Prince Albert, known as St. Alban's College, be operated as an Indian residential school - has been given very careful consideration.\n\nWe are naturally anxious that the education of the pupils for whose instruction provision was made at the Onion Lake Residential School until the destruction of that building by fire should not be interrupted. We are disposed to think that the St. Alban's College, provided certain re-adjustments can be made, might prove suitable for the accommodation of these children, until an educational survey has been undertaken at the Onion Lake agency and a building program, designed to meet the educational needs of the Indian population, decided upon.\n\nWe have noted that the land available at the Prince Albert College, for gardening or for instruction in elementary agriculture, is somewhat limited, and it is our hope that additional lands can be secured at a reasonable cost. We are anxious, also, that the courses of study provided at this school, and indeed at all our Indian day and residential schools, should become increasingly more vocational and practical in character. With this thought in mind, it is our hope that arrangements can be made by the Principal of the school, whereby the senior pupils can receive instruction,\n\nReverend H. A. Alderwood, B.D.,\nSecretary, Indian & Eskimo Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C.,\n38-42 The Bible House,\n164 Alexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\neither by the employment of a man qualified to provide vocational instruction on a half-time basis, or by the attendance of these pupils at the Prince Albert Collegiate or some other vocational centre. A number of our residential schools, established close to cities, have succeeded, in co-operation with the public school authorities, in working out a well-balanced course of study for their pupils, and we see no reason why such a course cannot be worked out at Prince Albert.\n\nIn view of all the circumstances, we are prepared:\n\n1. To authorize the operation of the St. Alban's College as an Indian residential school for a five-year period;\n\n2. That certain repairs, such as plastering, redecorating, etc., at an estimated cost not exceeding $5,000.00, be borne, in lieu of rent, by this department;\n\n3. That the enrolment of 100 pupils and a per capita grant of $170.00, allowed at Onion Lake, be authorized at St. Alban's.\n\nAn attempt will be made to have the necessary repairs undertaken at the earliest possible date and thus enable the school to open for the reception of pupils early in the new year. It is our desire that the teachers who have been employed until now at the Onion Lake school should be re-assured by the Principal that they will be re-employed immediately following the re-organisation of the school at Prince Albert.\n\nIt would be appreciated if we could have from you an expression of opinion with respect to these proposals, at an early date.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Dr. Alderwood.\n\nHe approved of accepting the offer of the Bishop of Saskatchewan to use the building formerly used for St. Albans College at Prince Albert and that the children formerly in the Onion Lake Residential School be transferred there, at least as many of them as can be accommodated.\n\nThe Minister suggested that in making arrangements with the church it should be clearly understood that they are only of a temporary nature and that the situation should be reviewed after the war.\n\nThe Minister also authorized expenditures being made up to the sum of $2,000 to carry out the necessary repairs and decorating.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nOttawa, December 8, 1943.\nLoss $100,000 in school fire\n\nA three-story Indian residential school in the Onion Lake agency, valued at about $100,000, was totally destroyed by fire early yesterday morning, according to information received by Mr. Christianson, Regina, superintendent of Indian affairs in Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Onion Lake agency is approximately 40 miles north of Lloydminster.\n\nAll the inmates and children living in the school were able to get out of the building without injury or serious distress.\n\nExact number of children living in the school is not known, Mr. Christianson said, but there were 120 enrolled at the close of the June term.\n\nBuilt in 1925\n\nThe school, a wooden-frame structure built by the government in 1925, was operated under the auspices of the Anglican church, Mr. Christianson said.\n\nAccording to word received from D. H. Cameron, Indian agent at Onion Lake, the children and other inmates from the reserve were removed from the school and temporarily housed at the nearby Fort Chipewyan Indian school. Children living nearby will be returned to their homes until suitable accommodation is found for them.\n\nNo details are available as to how the fire started.\nOnion Lake Indian School Destroyed\n\nExclusive to The Edmonton Bulletin\n\nLLOYDMINSTER, Dec. 1\u2014According to information reaching Lloydminster, the Anglican Indian residential school at Onion Lake, about 40 miles north of here, was completely destroyed by fire this morning.\n\nThe building, which it is estimated cost about $300,000 to build, is now nothing but a mass of smoldering debris.\n\nRev. H. Ellis is principal of the school and up till the present no cause of the fire has been made known locally.\nOttawa, December 8, 1943.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nThe proposal submitted by you, on behalf of the Bishop of Saskatchewan, in your letter to the Indian Affairs Branch of December 4 - that the building at present available in the city of Prince Albert, known as St. Alban's College, be operated as an Indian residential school - has been given very careful consideration.\n\nWe are naturally anxious that the education of the pupils for whose instruction provision was made at the Onion Lake Residential School until the destruction of that building by fire should not be interrupted. We are disposed to think that the St. Alban's College, provided certain re-adjustments can be made, might prove suitable for the accommodation of these children, until an educational survey has been undertaken at the Onion Lake agency and a building program, designed to meet the educational needs of the Indian population, decided upon.\n\nWe have noted that the land available at the Prince Albert College, for gardening or for instruction in elementary agriculture, is somewhat limited, and it is our hope that additional lands can be secured at a reasonable cost. We are anxious, also, that the courses of study provided at this school, and indeed at all our Indian day and residential schools, should become increasingly more vocational and practical in character. With this thought in mind, it is our hope that arrangements can be made by the Principal of the school, whereby the senior pupils can receive instruction,\n\nReverend H. A. Alderwood, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian & Eskimo Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C.,\n38-42 The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\neither by the employment of a man qualified to provide vocational instruction on a half-time basis, or by the attendance of these pupils at the Prince Albert Collegiate or some other vocational centre. A number of our residential schools, established close to cities, have succeeded, in co-operation with the public school authorities, in working out a well balanced course of study for their pupils, and we see no reason why such a course cannot be worked out at Prince Albert.\n\nIn view of all the circumstances, we are prepared:\n\n1. To authorize the operation of the St. Alban's College as an Indian residential school for a five-year period;\n\n2. That certain repairs, such as plastering, redecorating, etc., at an estimated cost not exceeding $2,000.00, be borne, in lieu of rent, by this department;\n\n3. That the enrolment of 100 pupils and a per capita grant of $170.00, allowed at Onion Lake, be authorized at St. Alban's.\n\nAn attempt will be made to have the necessary repairs undertaken at the earliest possible date and thus enable the school to open for the reception of pupils early in the new year. It is our desire that the teachers who have been employed until now at the Onion Lake school should be re-assured by the Principal that they will be re-employed immediately following the re-organization of the school at Prince Albert.\n\nIt would be appreciated if we could have from you an expression of opinion with respect to these proposals, at an early date.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRAH\n\nIndian Affairs.

OUTBUILDINGS INTACT FULL REPORT LATER - ELLIS\n\nOn Wednesday 1st at 4.30 a.m. Miss Watkins came over to my bed-room in her night clothes and stated the school was on fire. I immediately went over and found the fire on the north wall of the chapel, about twelve feet high and two feet wide. I immediately then checked the children who had then left the dormitories and were in the recreation rooms. I proceeded to connect three lines of hose and took them across the roof of the engine room and played the water on the fire. I managed to put this fire out in about 15 to 20 minutes. It then broke out on the roof of the storm porch on the east door of the laundry. This was also put out, but I could see that it was still under the chancel in the chapel.\n\nMr. Waterhouse and Miss Watkins had already turned in the alarm, and Mr. Smith with Mr. Waterhouse had been putting out the fire in the laundry with three hand chemical extinguishers. Mr. Waterhouse then left to start the pump down at the engine house near the lake shore.\n\nMr. Swandt and Mrs. Ellis took a fire hose and began to cover the laundry ceiling which is also the floor of the chapel. Mr. Swandt took the ceiling down in places while they took turns in handling the hose.\n\nI noticed then that the roof had caught fire, about a foot square. Owing to the gable ends, I think this was only partly put out, as I left the hose with an Indian in order to get the interior organised with the hose.\n\nWe then proceeded to work inside of the building. Little headway was made because of the heat and smoke. I then began to realize that I was beaten, but did not give up hope, hence nothing was removed from the building until the possible last chance. By the time the chapel was an inferno, fire for about sixty feet.\n\nHaving been beaten about 6.00 and knowing that we would not be able to save the building, the children were ordered outside with blankets and measures were taken to protect all outside buildings. We placed wet blankets on the roof to protect the residence. A slight wind was now blowing from the East.\n\nAt about six thirty the Onion Lake pupils were sent home.\nwith their guardians or parents and about one hundred children were taken over to Rev. Father Pascal at the R.C. School with three lady members of our staff.\n\nThat afternoon with the Indian Agent I visited Rev. Father Pascal and made arrangements to take all the children off their hands the next morning. That day, Thursday, December 2nd, all the children from the outlaying reserves had been delivered to their homes and I returned to the school Saturday at 10 p.m. Mr. Waterhouse took the children for the Battleford area and I with the driver and truck from the R.C. School took the children for Sandy Lake and the Prince Albert area.\n\n**SALVAGED:**\n- Main Building Heating Boiler\n- Hot Water Boiler\n- Two large compression tanks\n- High pressure steam boiler\n- Electrical pump and motor.\n\nAll these have been drained to prevent damage by frost.\n\nThe night watchman, who was relieving as Mr. Smith had been working on days to line the pump house with cement was reliable and had a printed list of duties to carry out. It was his first night.\n\nI am of the opinion, that the fire started in the laundry, either from the clothes hung up or an over-heated stove pipe, which caused the tin to fire the roof lining.\n\nI had left the office about 1:15 a.m. myself having spent the evening in placing the ration coupons on the summited sheets. I washed my hands in the bathroom and went down to the engine room and laundry before going home and I did not at any time detect smoke or fire. I was in my bedroom when I saw the night-watchman go over to the house, which was exactly at two o'clock the time that was set for to cover this point. I am fully satisfied in my own mind that the night watchman was reliable and as soon as he smelt smoke he immediately notified the engineer. The trouble must have happened between the time that he went down to the pump house, having his supper and then in the kitchen. It was when he left the kitchen to visit the laundry again that he found the clothes which were hanging up to dry were alight and burning. It is evident that the clothes around the bins in which the clothes dried were placed started the fire to its proportion.\n\n**PERSONAL LOSSES:**\n\nMost of the staff have lost all their personal belongings, such as glasses, false teeth and clothing and about $248.00 in cash which belonged to the school and staff. I have lost all my robes, communion vessels, etc. besides other things which was the means of giving the children much pleasure.\n\n(Sgd) Henry Ellis\n\nP.S. I am preparing this report under difficulties, hence will have time later to check more fully. E.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I was delighted to receive your message this morning and feel confident from my knowledge of the building that it offers a very valuable opportunity of continuing the work which otherwise may be left undone for a considerable period. I shall, of course, communicate with you fully after our inspection and conference with Bishop Martin and Principal Ellis and it will be most satisfactory if your Agent can be with us at the same time.\n\nWe have just received the first report of the fire from Mr. Ellis and I beg to enclose a copy in case you have not received one direct. I shall value the opportunity of being able to discuss the matter in person with our Principal.\n\nMeanwhile, with kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH. A. Alderwood\nSecretary\n\nDictated but not personally signed because of absence from the office\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of Dr. McGill's telegram of the 8th instant in connection with the Indian and Eskimo School Commission meeting in Prince Albert on the 9th instant.\n\nI wish to inform you I left Regina on the evening of the 8th instant for Prince Albert, arriving there the following morning, and attended a meeting of the Commission that afternoon at which were present Reverend Doctor H. A. Alderwood, the Right Reverend Bishop Henry D. Martin, and the Reverend H. Ellis from Onion Lake. We went over to St. Alban's College to look over the building and although this was a school at one time they have disposed of everything that was in the institution, therefore there is nothing there but the bare walls, the furnace, and a jacket heater. You have the size of the building, cubic contents, etc., therefore I will leave that out. I asked for a photograph of the building but nobody seemed to have one. However, Bishop Martin is having a photograph taken of the outside of the College as it appears from the street and he will furnish our Branch with this.\n\nThe following is a description of the building as I found it. It is a three-storey building with a basement, and it was erected about thirty-five years ago. It is built of red brick and has high ceilings on all floors. There is a full sized concrete basement which is divided up into several rooms. The furnace, I believe, is in good shape and I noticed that the grates were practically new. The information I received from Bishop Martin regarding this was that the City of Prince Albert had made an offer to purchase the building and had sent their engineer to check up on the heating plant. Upon looking around I noticed that the registers had been disconnected, and the Bishop stated the City Engineer had informed him the furnace had a heating capacity over and above what was required to heat this building, which is a good thing. The floors are all in pretty fair shape and I noticed that the Auditorium had a hardwood floor. The walls were also in fair shape. Some plaster was broken and would have to be patched up, and the plaster in the top storey might have to be replaced on account of the frost getting into the building but in the other rooms there is only a patch here and there that I consider will have to be attended to. Of course all of the walls would have to be kalsomined. There is a nice suite in the west end....\nis a nice suite in the west end of the building for the Principal.\n\nThe greatest cost in putting this building in shape would be replacing the windows. A great many of them are broken. Apparently boys from the street have thrown stones through these windows and we noticed whiskey and beer bottles throughout the building where fellows had gone there, had a party, and then maybe thrown their beer bottles through the windows. I also noticed some storm windows that had been trampled on lying on the floor. However, a great many of the storm windows are piled up inside of the building and these probably are in pretty good shape, but there is no use of me saying any more about this because if it is the intention of our Branch to turn this building into a school naturally we would have to get an estimate from someone on what it would cost to replace the glass etc., fix up the plaster where it is broken, and do some kilosmining and painting. As the furnace appears to be in good shape and the building is connected with the City sewers, City Water Works, and City Electric Lights a great deal of the cost is saved right there. The building appears to be well put up and is still in good shape outside of the glass that has been broken, but replacing the glass might cost a considerable amount.\n\nThere were approximately 116 children in residence in the Onion Lake School when it burned down and I thought it would be interesting to note that in the event this building was turned into an Indian Residential School it probably would be more centrally located than where it was before. In any event it would save a great deal of hauling.\n\nThe 116 children attending the Onion Lake School were from reserves in the following agencies:\n\n| Agency               | Reserve          | Number |\n|----------------------|------------------|--------|\n| Battleford Agency    | Thunderchild     | 21     |\n|                      | Sweetgrass       | 6      |\n|                      | Red Pheasant     | 8      |\n|                      | Little Pine      | 4      |\n|                      |                  | 39     |\n| Onion Lake Agency    | Frog Lake        | 1      |\n|                      | Onion Lake       | 14     |\n|                      | Loon Lake        | 4      |\n|                      |                  | 19     |\n| Carlton Agency       | Sandy Lake       | 30     |\n|                      | Montreal Lake    | 15     |\n|                      | Round Plain      | 3      |\n|                      |                  | 48     |\n| Saddle Lake Agency   |                   | 7      |\n| Duck Lake Agency     | James Smith      | 3      |\n\n116 pupils.\n\nOutside of the fact...........\nOutside of the fact that there were 19 children from the Onion Lake Agency attending the old school the present site would be more central for the remainder of the pupils. Naturally the Bishop and the Secretary of the Commission are very anxious to keep the school going and the only way that can be done is to take over the building in Prince Albert.\n\nIf there is any more information I can give you I will be willing to do so but I think I have covered the ground fairly well and naturally, our Minister will make the final decision in the matter.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa,\nDecember 15, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. J.C. KELLY,\nSALVAGE OFFICER.\n\nThe Indian residential school at Onion Lake, Saskatchewan, was destroyed on the 30th ultimo by fire and the Anglican Church has offered us a building owned by them in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. In order to furnish it the following will be required:\n\n1. 150 single beds with mattresses and pillows, also blankets and sheets, if possible.\n\n2. Kitchen equipment, including large range and other kitchen utensils.\n\n3. Tables and chairs suitable for dining rooms.\n\n4. Miscellaneous equipment would be required to furnish reasonably a building which would be occupied by approximately 150 persons, including adults and children.\n\nI realize that the above is a rather large order, but I thought that it might be possible to secure some of the equipment that would be required for refurnishing this building and I feel certain that you will give the matter your kind consideration.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, December 16, 1943.\n\nMr. M. Christianson, General Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Building, Scarth & Victoria Streets,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRe: Operation of St. Alban's College,\nas Residential School.\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 13 and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nIn this connection I am sending forward herewith, for your information, copy of a letter dated December 8, 1942, forwarded by the Minister to the Reverend H. A. Alderwood, Secretary of the Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory. In view of the definite proposal submitted in this communication by the Minister, it is altogether likely that a decision will be reached with respect to the operation of the school at an early date.\n\nActing Director.\nHon. T. A. Grerar,\nMinister of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA,\nOntario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to thank you for your letter of the 8th, and for your willingness to authorize the use of the St. Alban's College building in the city of Prince Albert as an Indian Residential School to take care of the pupils hitherto provided for at Onion Lake.\n\nI note that if satisfactory arrangements can be made with the Diocese of Saskatchewan, the Department is prepared to use this building for a five-year period, with an enrolment of 100 pupils at a per capita grant of $170.00. This is eminently satisfactory to our Commission, and we are most grateful to you for the prompt consideration given to our suggestion.\n\nAs the property belongs to the Diocese of Saskatchewan, I have no authority to speak in regard to the terms on which the building is available, but have immediately passed on your letter to the Rt. Rev. H. D. Martin, D.D., the Bishop of Saskatchewan. I have already been assured by the Bishop that it is his desire that the building should be used for such a purpose and that it will be made available on the most reasonable terms possible. I cannot quite understand the use of the term \"in lieu of rental\" in your letter, and imagine that Bishop Martin will be glad to have some clarification of this. I note that necessary repairs will be undertaken by the Department at a cost not to exceed $2,000.00, but scarcely think that the phrase \"in lieu of rent\" refers to the whole five-year period. I assume that it refers to the first year, leaving the rental for subsequent years to be mutually agreed. My understanding is that the Diocese has had to pay a considerable sum annually for taxation but that this will be much reduced if the building is used for educational purposes. There will, however, still be an annual charge to be made, and I feel sure it is the intention of the Department to provide a reasonable amount to cover this and other expenses. To save time, may I suggest that discussion of this point be undertaken directly with Bishop Martin?\nHon. T. A. Gr\u00e9rar - 2.\n\nDecember 13, 1943.\n\nI have just returned from a visit to Prince Albert, and may say that I was much impressed with the building and the opportunities it seems to offer in this emergency. The question of securing some additional land for farm and garden purposes would not seem to be too difficult, and is being investigated locally.\n\nI have noted carefully your hopes in the matter of vocational instruction, and can assure you of my personal cooperation in working towards this end in all our schools. Prince Albert should offer considerable advantages in this matter, and we shall certainly do our best to use them.\n\nThe loss of the Onion Lake School has naturally been a heavy blow to us. From my investigation I feel confident that under the direction of Principal Ellis, the school was efficiently administered and all possible care was taken to prevent fire. I am also satisfied that everything possible was done to extinguish the fire when once it had been discovered. We are profoundly thankful that no life was lost, and are now hopeful that the instruction of the pupils may speedily be resumed. The members of our staff are being retained, and we shall do everything possible to co-operate with the Department in preparing for the resumption of the work at the earliest possible date. Principal Ellis was inquiring if you desired him to do anything in regard to securing the necessary equipment. Possibly your Department will be communicating with him direct in regard to this.\n\nAgain thanking you, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nN.A. Alderwood\n\nSecretary.\n\nHAAT\u00c1.\nMEMORANDUM\n\n16th December, 1943.\n\nDeputy Minister,\n\nI am attaching for departmental attention a letter addressed to the Minister by the Reverend H.A. Alderwood, D.D., Secretary of the Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission of the Church of England in Canada, on the subject of the use of the St. Alban's College building in the City of Prince Albert as an Indian residential school to take care of the pupils from Onion Lake.\n\nYou will note his remarks regarding repairs borne by the department \"in lieu of rental\".\n\nEncl.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nDr. McGill -\n\nFor attention.\nOttawa, December 17, 1943.\n\nDear Bishop Martin:\n\nIt is my understanding that Dr. Alderwood has sent forward to you a letter dated December 8, 1943, received by him from the Minister of this Department. Dr. Alderwood, in his letter of reply, dated December 13, suggests that time might be saved if we communicated with Your Lordship, with respect to the subject matter of the Minister's communication.\n\nWhen the Minister stated in his letter that repairs at the St. Alban's College would be undertaken by the Department, at a cost not to exceed $2,000.00, and that this cost would be borne by the Department, in lieu of rent, he had in mind, of course, the repairs that were urgently needed and the rental that might be allowed for the first year or so. We have now before us Mr. Christianson's report, immediately following his inspection of the building, and it is just possible that the repairs, plastering, new windows, flooring, etc., may amount to a sum exceeding $2,000.00.\n\nWe have at this date 76 residential schools in operation. Of these, 26 are the property of the Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches. The records here indicate that the Department has not at any time paid rent for school buildings. The only exception to this, that I can find, is an allowance made for the rent of a dwelling house at Carcross immediately following the destruction of the Carcross School by fire a few years ago. Residential schools, when built or established by the Churches, are operated on the understanding that the Government will pay a fixed per capita grant, supply the school with the necessary equipment and keep the building in a reasonable state of repair. In practice this policy appears to work out to the satisfaction of all parties concerned. Unless the St. Alban's College building, therefore, is\n\nRight Rev. H. D. Martin, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nin an exceptionally good state of repair at this date, the amounts required to keep it in repair and supply the necessary equipment during the next five year period would, in all probability, equal, if not exceed the actual rent of the building if it were operated on a rental basis. I have not, however, sufficient information at my disposal to express a worthwhile opinion on this matter.\n\nChurch-owned residential schools, with one exception, appear to be established in unorganized districts and consequently not subject to municipal taxation. The exception is the Roman Catholic residential school at Squamish, in northern Vancouver. The Department paid municipal taxes on this building for a number of years. Two years ago our right to do so was challenged by the Treasury officials, who took the position that crown property or property in use by the Crown was exempt from such taxes. However, you will naturally be anxious to avoid any controversy with the city of Prince Albert on this somewhat delicate subject. I am confident that the city will be prepared to accept a nominal tax when they are assured by Your Lordship that the building is being used for the education of Indians recruited in the main from the Prince Albert district. Whatever the tax may be, however, it should not be borne by the Diocese or by the M.S.C.C. We could probably meet the levy by an adjustment of our per capita grants, although we are naturally anxious not to establish a precedent by increasing grants at a time when a number of residential schools are experiencing difficulty in financing their operations.\n\nI am anxious that you should, at your convenience, turn these matters over in your mind and let us have an expression of opinion in respect to these tentative proposals.\n\nWe are communicating with the Principal and asking him for a list of the equipment that may be required.\n\nI am sending forward a copy of this letter to Dr. Alderwood, for his information.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nActing Director.\n\nCopy sent to Dr. Alderwood\nOttawa,\nDecember 20, 1943.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nRecent information indicates that if the St. Alban's College is taken over for residential school purposes it will be necessary to secure all the equipment that is required.\n\nWe have already taken up with the Salvage Officer the question of securing beds etc., if these are available.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would let me have, at the earliest possible date, a complete list of the equipment and furnishings that you consider would be required in the event of our taking over St. Alban's College. You should give this list by rooms; for instance, the number of beds etc. for the dormitories, the equipment required for the kitchen, the equipment required for the staff rooms and the equipment required for the classrooms. With reference to school desks, these can be secured as follows:\n\nSize No. 5 - small\n\" \" 3 - medium\n\" \" 1 - large\n\nYou will note that the above are the only sizes that we can obtain at the present time and the number of each size should be stated.\n\nYou may also let me know the length of blackboard that you consider is required in the classrooms.\n\nRev. Henry Ellis,\nPrincipal,\nOnion Lake C.E.

I am delighted to know that there seems, according to Mr. Christianson, such good prospects of the Indian Residential School at Onion Lake being rebuilt. It at least gives us the opportunity of reminding you - which, of course, we do not need to do - that in January, 1941, two school-rooms were burned at Alberni, and some time later the school-room at File Hills was burned down. We would not want to prejudice the chances of our Anglican friends of having their school at Onion Lake rebuilt; but we presume that these reconstructions will be placed in order of time.

I can assure you, however, that when the Government's post-war rehabilitation program is under review, the claims of the Indian Affairs Branch for additional educational facilities will be given earnest consideration.\n\nIt is unnecessary to state that I agree with you, that schools destroyed by fire as far back as 1941 should have the first claim when appropriations are available.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\n\nRAH\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, December 21, 1943.\n\nMr. M.

I am sending forward also a clipping from the Regina Leader, of December 11, enclosed by Dr. Dorey with his communication to the Minister.\n\nYou are, no doubt, aware that the limited appropriations at our disposal have not enabled us to build either day or residential schools at any time during the last three year period, and no provision has been made in the 1944-45 estimates for the construction of such buildings. In view of these facts, no consideration has been given by the Minister or the officials of this Branch to the rebuilding of the residential school at Onion Lake.\n\nWe are anxious, however, to have an expression of opinion from you with respect to the statement contained in the first paragraph of the news item taken from the Regina Leader. It will be necessary to have this statement before a satisfactory reply to Dr. Dorey can be prepared for the signature of the Minister. In this connection may we refer to a letter to you dated March 8, 1942, and signed by the Director. In the penultimate paragraph of that communication the Director suggested that before statements on departmental policy were made to the Press, these statements should be sent forward to this Branch to be checked. You might return the newspaper clipping with your reply.\n\nYour immediate attention to this matter will be very much appreciated.\n\nActing Director.\n1. At 6:00 AM this date the writer was notified by D.H. Cameron, Indian Agent, that the Indian Residential (Anglican) School was afire and getting out of control. The Agent advised that he was proceeding there, and I informed him that I would leave immediately. Patrol was made accompanied by Alex Finlay only available help at Onion Lake village. The school in question is located about 7 miles east and south of Onion Lake village.\n\n2. On arrival at the school it was seen that the fire had consumed more than two thirds of the entire building, that there was no possible chance of getting it under control. The only measures possible were prevention of its spreading to the residence of the Rev. Ellis, principal of the school, and other surrounding buildings. This was accomplished and fire was confined to the main building. By 8:00 AM the main building was burned level to the ground.\n\n3. The building in question was of wood construction, the western wing three stories high. At the time of the fire the school apart from the staff housed 115 Indian pupils, 59 boys and 56 girls, ranging in age from 4 to 16 years. All the pupils had been safely removed from the building by the teaching staff, and were conveyed to the R.C. Residential school two miles away, there cared for by Father MacCall and his staff.\n\n4. Concerning the outbreak and possible cause of this fire, I was informed by Rev. Ellis that he had been called at about 4:30 AM by the school matron Miss Watkins. The fire was then confined to the laundry, situated in the north east end of the building. The fire was being fought by the engineer waterhouse, farm instructor Schmidt and regular night watchman Smith. According to Rev. Ellis the fire was got under control in the laundry, but it was then seen that it had spread between the ceiling of the laundry and the floor of the chapel immediately south and above the laundry. The laundry ceiling was lined with tin the heat underneath had spread fire to the chapel floor and floor under the chancel of the chapel. Efforts to control this fire by Rev. Ellis and his staff failed, fire then spread the entire length of the building. Efforts to control the fire may be deduced from the following, upon the outbreak of fire the children were immediately removed from the dormitories to the play-room, remaining there for over an hour with the teaching staff until it was finally realized that the fire could not be controlled.\n\n5. Further according to Rev. Ellis, he had been in the main building until 2:00 AM, and found everything normal at that hour with no suspicion of fire. Shortly after retiring to his own residence he heard the night watch on his rounds also, check the fire in the Ellis residence. Over\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6320, file 658-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe night-watch on this night in question was Stephen Hyman, a senior pupil at the school. This was his first night and only a temporary measure as the regular night watchman Jack Smith had been employed the entire day before on concrete work in the boiler-room. Hyman aged 16 years has been a pupil of the school for seven years, has a younger brother and two younger sisters also attending the school. They are natives of the Sandy Lake I.R. According to Rev. Ellis, Hyman was well acquainted with his duties for the night, having a regular schedule drawn up for him. This included check up of the boiler-room, pump-house and laundry.\n\nAt the time of the fire the laundry room contained the clothes of the girl pupils washed the previous day, and were on drying lines and racks. The laundry contained a bake-oven and stove for laundry drying purposes; both had fires in them, and maintained and checked by the night-watch. The other fires over which watch was kept being the furnace in the boiler-room and fire in the pump-house. The Rev. Ellis did not suspect anyone of starting the fire, and believed it to be entirely of accidental origin, possibly from a spark igniting the clothes drying in the laundry, or possible overheating of a stove-pipe, although all the latter had been cleaned at a recent date. Subsequent investigations did not reveal any reasons to suspect arson or that the fire had been started by any person with view to sabotage.\n\nStephen Hyman who had been removed with other pupils to the R.C. school was seen and the following statement obtained after questioning in the presence of the Junior Teacher Mrs. Davies:\n\n\"Last night November 30th, I was night watch at the school. I started work at seven o'clock. My job was to check the boiler-room, laundry, pump-house and other parts of the building. I checked the laundry and other parts during the evening. I last checked the laundry after two o'clock in the morning after I had been to Mr. Ellis's house. That time I put six sticks of wood in each of the fires in the laundry, that is the bake-oven and the laundry drying stove. From there I went to the play-room and stayed about half an hour, then checked the boiler-room and the pump-house. When I came back from the pump-house I went to the kitchen and had my supper, then I went to the play-room. I stayed only a short time in the play-room then checked the boiler-room and returned to the play-room. Shortly after I returned to the play-room from the boiler-room I smelled smoke. I then called Mr. Waterhouse that would be about four o'clock. The last time I went to the laundry-room was after two o'clock when I put wood on both fires. I put about six sticks of 12\" wood in each. I don't remember if I checked the draughts on the two fires. I didn't smell any fire then.\"\n\nThe pump-house which Hyman refers to is situated about 300 yards south east of the main building, contains the engine which pumps the water to the compression tanks contained in the main building immediately north of the boiler-room.\nIMMEDIATELY NORTH OF THE BOILER-ROOM. The laundry adjoined the part of the building containing the compression tanks and the boiler-room but was not directly connected with them.\n\n9. From Mrs. Mother K. Davies, junior teacher, it was ascertained that she had been awakened by smoke around four or four thirty A.M. She ran immediately to the matron's room then to the farm instructor, awakening them. At that time she saw a glow of fire through the laundry window. The balance of her time was occupied attending to the pupils and their eventual removal from the building.\n\n10. The engineer Wilfred Waterhouse was seen, and gave the following statement:\n\n\"I went to bed about 11:30 P.M. on the 30th, before that I had checked the building and found everything in order. Young Hyman was night-watch; he is a good reliable lad. The first notification I had of fire was in the night when Hyman woke me up. I don't know what time it would be. He said there was something burning in the building. I got right up and found the fire in the laundry. All the clothes were alight on the drying lines and racks; also, the clothes bins on the east side were alight. We got the fires out with the chemical extinguishers. When we got rid of the smoke we could see a red glow in the ceiling and the chapel floor. The laundry had a tin ceiling with a wooden floor immediately above it. The fire had got under that. General alarm had been turned in, and it was then we used the hydrants, the hydrant from the boiler-room was used first then the one situated in the ground-floor of the building, but we couldn't get at the fire properly to control it. It got out of hand and spread the length of the building.\"\n\n11. The hydrants mentioned by the engineer were connected with the compression tanks situated just north of the boiler-room, in the main building. When the fire spread westwards from the laundry it will be realized that it enveloped the boiler-room and part containing compression tanks, and would interfere with successful fighting of the fire. Had the entire fire-fighting equipment been contained in a separate unit from the main building better control of the fire might have been accomplished.\n\n12. Investigations failed to reveal any evidence that the fire originated from any other means than accidental or through the carelessness of anyone. Every effort apparently was made by the Rev. Ellis and his staff to save the building. Great credit is due to the teaching staff under Miss Watkins assisted by Miss Potter and Mrs. Davies in the manner in which they safely evacuated all the pupils from the building without loss of life or any personal harm.\n\n13. This school involves considerable loss to the department concerned, and was not insured, as I understand, is not the practice of the department to do so. All the teaching staff lost their entire belongings, none carried any insurance. No further action will be taken Detachment unless otherwise instructed.

Police, Regina, Sask.\n\nFORWARDED: It is noted that the fire started in the laundry room of the school and spread to the chapel where it could not be controlled. Apparently neither the building nor the contents were insured. Possibly the fire started from an overheated stove in the laundry room and, as it enveloped the boiler room and compression tanks, it hampered the fire fighters.\n\nIt would appear, under the circumstances, that no further police action is necessary in the matter and, unless I have your instructions to the contrary, I will consider the file closed.\n\n4-12-43\n\nCommanding N.-Battleford S/Div.\n(F.

I was becoming most anxious as to what action was being taken with regard to the rehabilitation of St. Albert's College building here. Dr. Alderwood sent me a copy of the minister's letter to him and so I was awaiting further word from the Department.\n\nIn the first place I think I should tell you something about this building. It was built at a cost of approximately $80,000, and is of solid brick construction throughout. It has a splendid heating equipment which includes a boiler of ample capacity installed in recent years, of tubular steel construction, and also a large jacket heater and tank of 220 gallons capacity. The foundations are in perfect condition and the building itself shows no signs of deterioration. There will be some necessary repairs to be undertaken before occupancy particularly with regard to plastering and minor repairs. Unfortunately some boys have recently broken a number of windows which will add to the expense.\n\nThe Diocese will need to secure $500 for arrears of taxes on the building to be paid by December 31st. We are hopeful of securing this amount and we are most desirous that the building should be occupied for the carrying on of the education of these Indian children. The main taxes on the building are:\n\nLocal Improvement Tax 100.74\nProvincial Public Revenue 38.21\n\nmaking a total of 138.95\n\nThe city of Prince Albert is not in a very affluent condition financially. It has a large bond indebtedness which keeps our taxes high. Moreover, they have been most kind to us in past years and I rather hesitate to go to them asking further considerations. Also, of course, there is the matter of insurance on the building; we have always kept the building insured and of necessity we shall have to increase the coverage when it is occupied as a residential school.\nIt is not my desire to in any way embarrass the Department by asking it to establish a precedent, and if you think that an adjustment of the per-capita grant in this particular instance would do this, may I therefore make the following suggestion: The Department is already using the term \"in lieu of rent\" with regard to the approximate $2000. for the necessary repairs and the rental that might be allowed for the first year or so. I would therefore suggest that the same term, namely \"in lieu of rent\", be applied in regard to further amounts paid to the Diocese of Saskatchewan for the use of the building. I do not think that the Department would wish a diocese such as ours to bear this cost. Neither do I think I can apply to the R.S.C.C. for the necessary money.\n\nI am not quite sure from your letter just what action you wish me to take. Do you wish the Diocese to set a yearly rental? If so, I shall be pleased to call our Finance Committee together and name an adequate rental but if the Department would prefer to set the amount they think adequate and fair, then I feel quite sure that this Diocese will agree. What we are all most anxious about is that the work of repairs should be commenced as soon as possible and that the Indian children concerned be enabled to continue their education. I am sure also that this is the desire of yourself and the Department and more especially the minister.\n\nI hope I have adequately answered your letter and given you the information you require. May I again say how anxious I am that this work of repairing the building should go ahead with as little delay as possible.\n\nWishing you the season's greetings, I am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6320, file 658-1, part 2)\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, December 23, 1943.\n\nDear Bishop Martin:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st instant and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nThe fact that the St. Alban's College building is the property of the Diocese of Saskatchewan and that the school, when re-opened, will be operated under the auspices of the M.S.C.C. is apt to make the initial financing a little awkward. However, we are today communicating with the Principal, in the hope that the repair work can be undertaken under his supervision, at once. I feel sure that Mr. Ellis can undertake and carry through these repairs much more speedily than we can. It so happens that we have no Indian agent in the city of Prince Albert.\n\nI have noticed Your Lordship's reference to taxes, and the city levy appears to me to be very reasonable. Would it be acceptable to the Diocese if we spent a minimum of $2,000.00 on the school, in lieu of rent, for the year 1944, and allowed you the sum of $2,000.00 annually for the next 4 years, on the understanding that any repairs that might be necessary would be undertaken either by the Diocese or by the Principal and that the taxes also would be paid by the Diocese? If this allowance is acceptable to you, it might be advisable to submit a voucher for one half the amount semi-annually.\n\nMay I embrace this opportunity to express the hope that you will spend an enjoyable and restful Christmas.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRight Rev. Henry D. Martin, D.D., Acting Director.\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOTTAWA, December 17, 1943.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, relative to equipment required to replace that destroyed by fire when the Indian Residential School at Onion Lake, Sask., was burned.\n\nYour request is being taken up with the departments of the Service most likely to have such equipment available for transfer, and we shall be pleased to advise you further with respect to our efforts to supply this equipment.\n\nFor J.C.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nEPG/CB.\nOttawa, December 20, 1943.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of December 15 and also a clipping taken from the Regina Leader, sent forward therewith.\n\nIt is, to me, a matter of regret that the funds at our disposal for the administration of Indian affairs have not enabled us to undertake the construction of Indian day or residential schools during the last three year period. I can assure you, however, that when the Government's post-war rehabilitation program is under review, the claims of the Indian Affairs Branch for additional educational facilities will be given earnest consideration.\n\nIt is unnecessary to state that I agree with you, that schools destroyed by fire as far back as 1941 should have the first claim when appropriations are available.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 8, Ont.\n\nRAH\nWhen you mentioned that Mr. Smith was looking for furnishings for the school which is located at Prince Albert, I said that we had some extra desks here. Besides 7 double desks, which it might be prudent to keep, I said that we have 20 single desks (desk tops 30\" from the floor) and 5 double desks (25\" from the floor). If there are any uses, please send them. I am told that all are in good condition.\n\nWith every best wish,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6320, file 658-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI have to refer to an article in the Regina Leader Post of February 27th regarding an interview given by you respecting the Saskatchewan Indians and their part played in the present war. I have noted your statement that the regulations bar Indian enlistments in the Royal Canadian Air Force and that there are no enlistments in the Navy\u2014not, however, being due to regulations, but because the Indians do not try.\n\nOur information is that Indians are not accepted in the Navy because it is a strict rule that all personnel must be of pure European descent and of the white race, and among other things because the confined living spaces of naval rating do not lend themselves to satisfactory mixing of the white races with Indians.\n\nI may add that this is confidential information.\n\nIn regard to the Air Force, Indians are eligible on the same basis as members of any other race. A number of Indian applicants have been accepted and are now in the Air Force; others have been rejected due to lack of educational qualifications or because they cannot pass the physical test, but not on account of the fact that they are Indians. It is suggested that before making any observations on a question of this kind in the press, the subject of the proposed statement should be referred to this Branch to be checked.\n\nAccording to our records only three Indian girls have enlisted in the Canadian Women's Army Corps\u2014Margaret Stonechild of the File Hills Agency, and Mary Greyeyes and Gladys Breaver of the Carlton Agency. I note you state that there are twelve Indian women who have enlisted, and I should be obliged if you would advise me of the names and agencies to which these girls belong.\n\nDirector.\nOTTAWA, December 29, 1943.\n\nWith further reference to your communication of the 15th inst. and our reply thereto relative to the replenishment of household goods for the Indian Residential School at Onion Lake, Sask., I may advise that the Department of National Defence for Air have placed at our disposal the following Bedsteads:\n\n| No.   | Equipment Depot | ea. | ea. |\n|-------|-----------------|-----|-----|\n| No. 1 | 50              |     |     |\n| No. 2 | 48              |     |     |\n| No. 5 | 110             |     |     |\n| No. 7 | 15              |     |     |\n| No.12 | 42              |     |     |\n\nIf the above-mentioned Bedsteads are not suitable, bedsteads double tier can be made available with the old type mattresses and pillows. These bedsteads are available at No. 7 and No. 11 Equipment Depots.\n\nRegarding kitchen equipment, No. 7 Equipment Depot have in stock at present a used single fire, 2 oven range, ref. 21C/284 which could be disposed of.\n\nThe Department of National Defence (Army) have also replied to our inquiry and state that they could supply various items of household goods, etc., on prior approval of the Deputy Minister of that Branch.\n\nKindly advise whether the above-mentioned bedsteads will suit your requirements and if so, arrangements will be completed for their transfer to your Department. I would also suggest that you submit a complete list of items required for the Institution concerned. Upon receipt of the said list, we will again contact both the Army and R.C.A.F. to determine whether these items may be procured either on repayment or without payment basis.\n\nJ.C.

As I said in a previous letter, we are all most anxious to co-operate with the Government to the fullest extent of our facilities in order that the education of these Indian Children should be forwarded. Our Committee voted to accept the terms, as outlined by you in your letter, for the use of the St. Alban's College building; namely that for the year 1944 the Government will spend a minimum of $2000. on the school in lieu of rent and that the Government allows the Diocese of Saskatchewan $2000. annually for the next four years on the understanding that any repairs that might be necessary would be undertaken either by the Diocese or by the Principal and that the taxes also would be paid by the Diocese. It is also noted that we would be required to submit a voucher for one-half that amount semi-annually. I note in your letter that there is reference made to insurance on the building. This, I take it, will be the responsibility of the Diocese. I might also add that our Committee decided to secure $500. in settlement of past taxes and pay this amount to the City of Prince Albert before December 31st. This means that the building is free of all encumbrance as from December 31st, 1943.\n\nMr. Ellis has been in the city since last Monday and has been most active in interviewing tradesmen of various kinds with a view to rehabilitating the college building.

It is our earnest hope that the school will be in a position to open at the earliest possible date.\n\nI did not refer in my letter of December 23 to the taxes on the school building for the simple reason that the Government has never insured Government property at any time and it is exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, under existing Treasury regulations for us to make such payments.

Mr. Ellis has been here all week and has been very busy about many things and with many people.\n\nThere is one question regarding which I must ask your advice, and it is this. Mr. Ellis is receiving estimates from men who will do the necessary repairs to the building. When this work has been accomplished and the accounts are rendered, is it your wish that we forward these accounts for payment direct from the Department, or is it your wish that we submit a voucher to you for any given amount and pay the accounts here. Mr. Ellis asked me this question this morning and as I could not give him a definite answer I thought it wise to write you and get your advice. You probably have a set policy on matters such as this.\n\nWishing you a Happy New Year\u2014and may we have Peace before the beginning of 1945,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Henry Ellis)\nSt. George's to Accommodate 80 Pupils as Indian School\n\nSt. George's college will open early in the new year as an Anglican residential school for Indians to partially replace school facilities which were destroyed by fire recently at Onion Lake, Saskatchewan.\n\nIn a communication to city council last night the Anglican diocese of Saskatchewan asking a reduction in outstanding tax arrears stated that they hoped to open the building which had been vacant for more than a year as a residential school for Indians.\n\nWith the promise of full settlement of the arrears in taxes he written off upon the opening of the school Alderman C. S. Lacroix moved that $500 be accepted in full settlement of taxes to the end of 1943.\n\nThis provides for the payment of approximately $500 against total arrears in taxes of approximately $2,074. The $500 is approximately the total improvement tax portion of the arrears.\n\nA large amount will be spent by the department of Indian affairs in converting the old building for use as an Indian school.\n\nIt was pointed out that it would be of advantage to the city to have the school occupied since the teaching staff will be brought into the city and supplies will be purchased here. Council was advised by Rev. Canon W. E. Payton, who was present at the committee session, that approximately 80 pupils will be accommodated in the school.\nREPORT ON ONION LAKE AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER, 1943.\n\nEX'D.\n\nGeneral:\n\nOn December 1st and 2nd I spent a great deal of time at the C. of E.

This unfortunate occurrence was reported both by wire and by air mail at the time.\n\nDonald H.

He has further advised that radiators, piping, fire escapes and metal beds could be sold.\n\nNo information other than the above has been furnished this Service regarding the fire; but the building, except for concrete basement walls, was of frame construction, and is stated to have collapsed during the fire. Under such circumstances, it might be expected that much of the equipment, and other material referred to, will be buried in wreckage and could not be examined.\n\nIn this connection, not only heating equipment, but lighting plant units, and water supply equipment were in use at the school. No reference has been made to the present condition of this equipment.\n\nWe feel that if present weather conditions at Onion Lake permit, radiators, fire escapes, metal beds, piping and any other damaged metal articles should be removed from the wreckage and stored under the supervision of the Indian Agent. The former boiler room, and engine room should be cleared of rubbish and all heating, lighting plant and pumping equipment completely exposed to view. The Indian Agent should then prepare an inventory embodying both the equipment which does not appear to have been damaged, and material no longer usable.\n\nCopies of this inventory should be furnished to this Service, by the Indian Affairs Branch, for the use of our officer, at such time as an inspection can be carried out.\n\nIt will be appreciated that unless it has been possible to protect equipment installed in the former Boiler Room and Engine Room, from the weather, and from ice produced by fire-fighting operation, no inspection should be attempted before the spring. The Indian Affairs Branch should advise us in this connection as soon as possible.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector\n\nIndian Affairs.

In view of the fact that some of the equipment wasn't destroyed in the fire and the farm set-up in conjunction with the school is still available it would seem the logical place for re-building would be the former site.\n\nTrusting your Department will give the above matter your earnest consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nLloydminster & District Board of Trade.\n\n[Signature]\nGeorge W.

Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: St. Alban's School-Prince Albert\n\nThere seems to be some misunderstanding as to responsibility for the necessary work involved in placing this building in good order for use as an Indian residential school. It has been our understanding that the Diocese of Saskatchewan were handing over the building to the Department for a period of five years and that the Department would spend a minimum of $2,000.00 on the school in lieu of rent for the year 1944 and a like sum annually for the next four years. The Department would be responsible for the expenditures incurred in necessary repairs at the beginning but the Diocese would take care of these and all the taxes in subsequent years. We received a copy of your letter Ref. #115-1-1 to Rev. H. Ellis dated December 23rd, in which he was asked to act as the agent of the Department in putting the necessary work in hand. We learned that Mr. Ellis had gone to Prince Albert for this purpose and had arranged for the work to be done.\n\nOur Principal has now written to us about various necessary work and seems to be in doubt as to financial responsibility. He desired some partitions to be removed to provide dormitory accommodation for the boys at a cost of $150.00. We referred him to the Bishop of Saskatchewan, whose permission we felt should be secured before any structural alterations were made. He also reports that the heating plant and water system had to be placed in order at a cost of $282.40, and now speaks of laying a cement floor in the laundry and installing drain pipes so that the equipment may operate safely and efficiently. Mr. Ellis also who is to pay for these changes and declares that the Diocese has no money. Our feeling is that these are items which should certainly be included as part of the necessary cost of making the building ready for use. We have no idea as to the amount that has been spent for the initial repairs but cannot feel that the Commission should be asked to face these matters at all. Our understanding is that an arrangement has been made as between the Department and the owner of the building and that our responsibility really commences when the school is in operation. I believe there are about 50 children now in residence and that the staff is complete. Only lack of some necessary equipment has prevented the Principal from bringing in the remainder of the children to the school.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6320, file 658-1, part 2)\nI shall be grateful for your reply to these questions as our Principal seems to be in perplexity, and the Bishop of Saskatchewan also speaks of lack of a clear understanding.\n\nThanking you, and with kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.A. Alderwood\nSecretary.\n\nHAA:WS\nOttawa, April 19, 1944.\n\nRe: St. Alban's School,\nPrince Albert, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 12th instant and note with interest the opinions expressed therein.\n\nIt is my experience that misunderstandings are apt to arise when schools are administered in part by the Bishop of the Diocese, the Indian Residential School Commission and the Government. However, I shall attempt to give you a brief outline of our commitments at St. Alban's as I understand them. In this connection I am sending forward copy of a letter dated December 28, 1943, addressed by me to Bishop Martin and a copy of the Bishop's reply thereto.\n\nI may state that when the Minister was asked to authorize the operation of the St. Alban's College as an Indian residential school, following the destruction of the Onion Lake School by fire, the request came at a time when we had made no provision whatever in the estimates for the amounts necessary to repair and furnish the college. The Minister's authorization was granted on the understanding that we would attempt to take the amounts necessary for repair work and furnishings from the comparatively small amounts allotted to other residential schools, and this has been done. The sum already spent - and the accounts have not yet been all received - for labour, repairs\n\nReverend H. A. Alderwood, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian & Eskimo\nResidential School Comm., M.S.C.C.,\nThe Bible House, Alexander Ave. E.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nrepairs and equipment amounts to $14,294.30. This, I feel sure you will agree, is quite a substantial amount. I must state frankly that from the reports we had received on this college, both from the church authorities and from Mr. Christianson, we were of the opinion that the full cost would not exceed 50% of this amount. You can readily realize, therefore, that with no provision made for such an expenditure in either last year's estimates or this year's appropriations, there is a limit beyond which we cannot possibly go.\n\nI can only state that in view of the conditions confronting us at St. Alban's, we shall attempt to do all that is possible with the limited funds at our disposal and in so doing express the hope that your Commission will be prepared to assume at least a small amount of the expenditures necessary for the reopening of this school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, April 24, 1944.\n\nThe Regional Oil Controller, 1706 Hamilton Street,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nI enclose herewith letter from Rev. Henry Ellis to this Department, letter from you to Rev. Henry Ellis and the special category application referred to.\n\nPrincipals of Indian Residential Schools are not employees of this Department and while we have a general knowledge of the work done we have no such detailed information as would permit the completion of the necessary certificate.\n\nThis certificate should, apparently, be signed by the Chief of the Indian and Eskimo School Commission, 184 Alexander Ave., E., Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training.\n\nEncl. Letter 14th April from Rev. Henry Ellis\n\" 10th April from A.B. Sexsmith, Director, Gasoline Rationing for Oil Controller Regina, Special Category signed by Rev. Henry Ellis.\nAttention Mr. R.A. Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nMay 2, 1944.\n\nRe St. Alban's School, Prince Albert.\n\nI have read with interest your letter of April 19th and may say that I had the pleasure of visiting the school on the same date.\n\nMy impressions on the whole were most favourable and I was particularly gratified with the excellent quality of the equipment supplied by the Department. The Principal and his staff had worked hard to get the building ready for use, but had been handicapped by the piecemeal manner in which the equipment had come to hand. They had on the day in question some 50 children in residence and I gather than a number of others have since arrived.\n\nI was disappointed to find that a rainstorm had revealed that the roof was in need of some repair, as the rain had entered at one or two points and had spoiled some of the decorating recently carried out. A more serious lack concerned the wooden fire escape which appears prominently in the photograph which I believe you have received. This had been neglected and allowed to rot so that the top section was entirely out of use. Not stopping to discuss the question of responsibility for the expense, I instructed the Principal to see that this was attended to without delay. I have also been in touch with Bishop Martin in regard to it and he assures me that the matter has been put in hand.\n\nIn regard to expenditure incurred, I would gather that this has been largely for the equipment necessary to conduct the school. I have most of the figures from our Principal as to the cost of repair and decorating work and it seems to me that this has scarcely exceeded the $2,000.00 amount authorized by the Department. Such further expense as may be entailed in putting the fire escape and roof in good repair is a matter that may have to be discussed with the Diocese of Saskatchewan. I note that at the time your letter was written the Department had spent $14,294.30 on this building, and agree that this is a very substantial amount. It had been my impression, however, that the Government has adopted the policy of not insuring its buildings and I took it that some other provision would be made to cover the cost of replacement and that the purchase of new equipment would be provided by this means.\n\nAs I hope to be in Ottawa on Thursday, May 11th, I shall\nlook forward to the opportunity of discussing this matter more fully.\n\nMeanwhile, with kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.M. Alderwood\n\nSecretary.\nREPORT ON ONION LAKE INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH APRIL, 1944.\n\nVisiting Reserves;\n\nOn April 6 and 7, and again on April 14 and 15, I made a trip to Lease FlI to visit the Indian trappers and inspect their work.

(RG 10, Volume 6320, file 658-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAttention Mr. R.A. Heey,\nActing Director, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Heey:\n\nI visited this school over the weekend and went fully into a number of points of difficulty. I mentioned to you when in Ottawa that we were deeply concerned that our Principal had admitted 150 pupils in spite of our reiterated instruction that he should keep as closely as possible to 100. We knew that the capacity of this building was limited and did not wish to overcrowd it.\n\nMy impression of the school was distinctly good and I am happy that many things have been well done and I am hopeful for the future. It was evident, however, that there are too many children there at the present time, and I discussed fully with Principal Ellis how we might reduce the number. He insisted that he had not recruited this large number and that he could have obtained many more. He claimed that the various Agents concerned had sent the pupils in and that he had been unable to refuse them admission. Dr. Morrow, who has been most interested and helpful in the establishment of this school in Prince Albert, kindly came over for a conference with us. He agreed that the school was overcrowded but felt helpless in view of the demand on the part of Indian parents.\n\nWe agreed to attempt the following methods of reducing the number. Principal Fisher of Lac la Ronge has a margin of accommodation at the present time and I have asked him to visit Montreal Lake and endeavour to secure the consent of some of the parents there to the transfer of their children from Prince Albert to his school. This should be easier now in view of the fact that the troops in Prince Albert are travelling continually to Lac la Ronge and the trail should be in splendid condition from now on. The journey in a covered truck can be made in reasonable comfort in six hours. The difficulty seems to be with the Indians, who have preferred to go south to Prince Albert, as there has been a good road while up to the present it has not been possible to travel easily to Lac la Ronge.\n\nAnother suggestion is in line with the request of the Bishop of Saskatchewan for a Day School to be established at Onion Lake. I have no doubt you are giving consideration to this\nand I desire to support the request, as I believe it will tend to relieve the difficulty created by our removal from Onion Lake since the fire. If a dozen or more of the Onion Lake children could be taken home from Prince Albert to attend a Day School it would serve to relieve the congestion. We have carried out certain changes in the school building which will make it possible to handle 125 children safely, and the two proposals outlined above should reduce the pupilage to this figure.\n\nIn laying this situation before our Commission on Tuesday, I was instructed to make an earnest request to the Government for an increase in the authorized pupilage at Prince Albert to 125. We believe this to be reasonable in view of the large number of Anglicans in the vicinity of Prince Albert and the strong desire of Indian parents to send their children to the school. May I couple with this request the suggestion that our authorized pupilage at Elkhorn be reduced by 25? We have for a number of years been authorized to receive 155 pupils and you will recall that the report of Dr. Simes criticized our overcrowding of the building although we had just about 130 pupils. We have instructed our Principal not to take any more pupils and believe that 130 would be a fair figure to allow for the Elkhorn building.\n\nCommending these matters to your usual kind attention,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.A. Alderwood\n\nSecretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey\n\nActing Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI recently made request that the authorized pupilage in this school should be increased to 125 in view of the manifest demand for fuller accommodation for Anglican children in Northern Saskatchewan and the fact that 150 children are now in residence. Apart from this permanent change I have now received a request from the Principal that we should ask for a special grant for this year to cover supernumerary pupils. Mr. Ellis asks for assistance on behalf of 40 pupils now in residence for whom no grant is being received, and declares that they have all been sent in by various field agents of the Department. He further states that when visiting the Department recently he was advised that a request for special assistance would be given full consideration.\n\nThanking you, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\nST.

We have 147 children in residence.\n\nI herewith attach the cubic feet area of each dormitory.\n\nYou will note there is an area of about 61,441 cubic feet of air space. Allowing about 500 cubic feet per child, gives us a capacity for 122 pupils. As many of the children are very small, the additional pupils do not suffer any inconvenience.\n\nAt the present time, I am living in the main school building, but should my family move out, then additional space will be provided for extra staff and an infirmary.\n\nTrusting the above information meets your full requirements.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, January 2, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nThe Elkhorn Indian Residential School, at Elkhorn, Manitoba, and the St. Alban's Indian Residential School, at Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, are both operated under the auspices of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada. At the Elkhorn School provision has been made for some years for a pupilage of 135, and at the St. Alban's School, which replaces the Onion Lake Church of England Residential School, destroyed by fire December 1, 1945, grant for a pupilage of 130 is provided.\n\nOwing to conditions existing at Elkhorn, as outlined in the report of Dr. Simes, it was mutually agreed between the officers of the Indian Affairs Branch and the officers of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada that not more than 130 pupils should be enrolled in future at the Elkhorn School.\n\nOn the other hand, the St. Alban's Residential School has at the present time an enrolment of 147 pupils. Both the Principal of the St. Alban's School and Dr. Alderwood, Secretary of the M.S.C.C., advise that this large enrolment is due to the fact that the Indian agents in Saskatchewan have found it necessary to send several children to the St. Alban's School this fall and, as a consequence, their enrolment is considerably above their authorized pupilage. The cubic feet air space in the dormitories at the St. Alban's School is sufficient for 125 pupils. A request has been submitted to us to transfer the grant of 25 pupils, which is not being used at the Elkhorn School, to the St. Alban's School. This would mean that in future the authorized pupilage at Elkhorn would be 130 and at the St. Alban's School, 125. This change would\nnot result in any increased expenditure, as the per capita rate at both schools is the same, namely $170.00. In view of the conditions existing at both schools, I recommend that the pupilage at St. Alban's be increased to the extent by which we can reduce the authorized pupilage at Elkhorn.\n\nArrangements are now being made by the Principal of St. Alban's School to return to their homes 22 children, so that the enrolment may be reduced to 125, for whom, as stated above, there is accommodation in the dormitories.\n\nActing Director.\nJanuary 2, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER.\n\nThe Elkhorn Indian Residential School, at Elkhorn, Manitoba, and the St. Alban's Indian Residential School, at Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, are both operated under the auspices of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada.

We have recently increased the cubic capacity in the Elkhorn dormitories by the removal of cupboards which have now been placed in the children's play rooms.\n\nThanking you for these concessions, which will assist us materially, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.A.

My impression was that last year this payment would be used in effecting repairs etc., in this building, and therefore I did not bring this matter to your attention in 1944. But as we have now entered the second quarter of 1945, and as to date no remuneration has been received, I thought I should write to you regarding it. As you know the Diocese of Saskatchewan has been put to considerable expense with regard to this building; also, there are certain fixed charges such as taxes and insurance which must be provided for. I shall be most happy, therefore, to hear from you in the near future in connection with the payment for this building.\n\nWith kindest regards, I am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nBp/B\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Frank Heathen, who originally undertook to perform this service never did do it. Ever since the School opened October 2, 1945, another Indian, James Cook, has been doing the work.\n\nIt has been pointed out to me a good many times that $20.00 is not sufficient pay for this job, especially in the winter months. In addition to this, James Cook has to travel a greater distance than Frank Heathen had agreed to do, as he lives farther away on the route and has to make one extra call to pick up a pupil. At a Band meeting held February 8th, the matter was brought up and it was stated that James was having a hard time to carry on due to the heavy snow and bad roads, and had had to hire an extra team at times. I agreed to take the matter up with the Department and request that $30.00 be paid for each of the remaining winter months (February, March and April). I consider that therequest is reasonable and necessary, and would therefore recommend that it be approved.\n\nDonald F. Cameron,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 21, 1946.\n\nMr. Donald H.

Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n414 Federal Building, Regina, Saskatchewan.\n\nI am not certain if you have visited the St. Alban's School at Prince Albert recently. If not, I would appreciate it if you would inspect this school as soon as you can conveniently do so.\n\nOur agreement with the Right Reverend Henry D. Martin, D.D., provides that we allow an amount of $2,000.00 a year in lieu of rent, but it was understood that the Bishop would keep the building in good repair so that the children would not be unduly inconvenienced.\n\nI have also been a little concerned about the number of children that are being accepted at this school. Possibly there is plenty of accommodation for them, but, on the other hand, they may be over-crowding the school. Perhaps you could look into this feature of the matter as well, when you visit the school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 1st instant, No. 115-1-1, I visited the St. Alban's School at Prince Albert on the 21st instant and examined the building accompanied by Mr. E.S. Jones, Indian Agent, Carlton Agency.\n\nThe building is in a reasonably good state of repair with the exception that the interior is badly in need of redecorating and the floors are in poor shape.\n\nIn connection with the third paragraph of your letter referred to this school is very definitely overcrowded. Nineteen senior girls sleep in single beds in approximately 8,000 cubic ft. of air space; 53 intermediate girls sleep in approximately 12,000 cubic ft. of air space in 39 cots. Fifteen of these cots have two girls sleeping in each one. Thirty-nine junior boys sleep in approximately 7500 cubic ft. of air space in twenty-three cots, and sixteen of these cots have two boys sleeping in them. Twenty-two senior boys are sleeping in approximately 2500 cubic ft. of air space with one boy in each cot. Some of the classrooms are very decidedly overcrowded and there is insufficient seats for the pupils and no room for the necessary desks if they had them. There are therefore one hundred and thirty-three children sleeping in the building with thirty-one cots having two children sleeping in each one.\n\nThe ceilings in the dormitories are very low, that of the intermediate girls being 8'6\", the senior boys 8'10\", the senior girls 10'3\", and the junior boys 10'3\".\n\nThere seems to be no thought about the health of the children when such a large number are permitted to sleep in crowded quarters. Instructions should be sent out to reduce the number of children in residence to not over one hundred for the beginning of the next term.\n\nIt is my duty to point out also that there is an extreme shortage of playground space for the children. Reverend Mr. Ellis, the Principal, informed me that he has the use of the Collegiate Grounds when not in use but this is not satisfactory as the grounds are a distance away from the school and have been in continuous use for some time. The boys informed me that they had been permitted to play on these grounds only three times in the last month. There is much truancy amongst the boys and I believe that having insufficient space for recreation purposes and possibly not very good supervision by the Boys' Supervisor is the chief reason for truancy. While I was at the James Smith's Reserve the following week after my visit to St. Alban's School two truant boys arrived there, having run away from the school and walked across the railway bridge near Fenton. This bridge is anything but safe for pedestrians and they might easily get caught by a train as the bridge is very long and there is no safe place on it for a pedestrian if a train is passing.\n\nThe floors of the whole building are of soft wood and are badly in need of paint in many places. They will never be satisfactory unless covered with a suitable surfacing material, such as \"mulsumastic\", manufactured by the Tremco Company, or some similar material which can be washed and kept clean. The cost of laying this over the whole building would probably be in the neighbourhood of $2,000.00.\n\nWhen discussing the condition of the interior walls of the building with Mr. Ellis he showed me an estimate of the paint, varnish, and brushes required to do the work at a cost of $462.70 for material only. He said the work could be done by the school staff.......\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6320, file 658-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\ndone by the school staff. He informed me that a request had been made to Bishop Martin for authority for this expenditure but that he had received the authority on the date of our discussion, i.e., last April. On the same date I visited Bishop Martin and drew this to his attention. He informed me that on the previous Sunday, which would be the 14th of April, he had given Mr. Ellis authority to spend $125.00 on material and Bishop Martin informed me this was all that Mr. Ellis had asked for. The Bishop was somewhat annoyed with Mr. Ellis' action in this connection and telephoned to him in my presence, reprimanding him both for saying he had no authority and for asking for only $125.00 while leading me to believe that he had asked for $482.70. The Bishop also instructed Mr. Ellis over the telephone to write to me confirming the fact that he had authority from the Diocese to spend $125.00 on materials for interior decorating. (Over a week has passed and I have not yet received this.)\n\nI am not at all satisfied with the manner in which the St. Alban's Residential School is being managed. Reverend Mr. Ellis informs me that he understood he had to report only to our Department. Later he found that he had to take his orders from the Indian and Eskimo Commission. Now he advises that because the building is owned by the Prince Albert Diocese of the Church of England he has to depend upon the Bishop and the Diocese for maintenance of the building. The building itself is not suitable and it is certainly not satisfactory from the point of view of our Branch that we do not know who is to blame if things are not in order.\n\nIn conversation with Bishop Martin I criticised the building as a fire hazard. I am sure that if a fire started in the building there would be a great probability of considerable loss of life because of narrow corridors of dry, inflammable material and not easy access to fire escapes or the stairway. Mr. Ellis informs me that the Fire Chief of the City of Prince Albert inspects the building once every month. I think it should be inspected twice monthly to save loss of life if a fire started. I would recommend that a night watchman be on duty the whole of the school term and not just during the winter months. I would also recommend that he be supplied with a time clock with a patrol register for twelve points in the building. It is not necessary for me to point out to the Department that fires can start in Indian residential schools whether there is a fire in the heating plant or not. More than one disastrous Indian school fire has been started by the pupils themselves in an effort to obtain their freedom from a school which they did not like. The number of truants in this school would certainly indicate much dissatisfaction and there are hundreds of places in the building where irresponsible Indian boys might start a fire very easily.\n\nI realize that the Anglican Church was permitted to re-open the St. Alban's School in their building at Prince Albert after the Onion Lake fire and that the need was urgent and more or less a temporary war measure. However, I do not think that this school should be permitted to continue very much longer in a very unsuitable building amongst unsuitable surroundings. Certainly the enrolment should be considerably reduced and I would say that the dissatisfied boys, who are, in my opinion, a menace to the lives of the other children, should be the ones discharged and as soon as possible.\n\nIt would be unfair to criticise this school to the extent to which I have criticised it without stating; that in Mr. Ellis' favour he is, in my opinion, a good manager trying to make the best of a bad situation. The children are well fed and well clothed and I believe receiving some education although the classroom conditions are poor. There is very little chance to give them anything other than the regular classroom work because of the shortage of facilities for the other necessary training.\n\nJ.R.B.

I feel we should accept Mr. Ostrander's recommendation, that the pupilage be reduced to 100, effective from September 1, 1946.\n\nIn view of the fire hazard, we are prepared to allow $40.00 a month towards the salary of a night watchman, on the understanding that he will be engaged for a full year. We are instructing Mr. Ostrander to secure and forward to Mr. Ellis a watchman's clock.\n\nPlease notify Mr. Ellis that in reducing the number of children enrolled he should send home the dissatisfied boys. I realize that this action may make discipline difficult in some instances, but we must take every possible precaution to avoid any trouble along the lines mentioned in the second last paragraph of Mr. Ostrander's report.\n\nI feel that you will give the whole situation your immediate sympathetic consideration and that you will cooperate with us in every possible way to improve conditions.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend H.A.

Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n414 Federal Building, Regina, Saskatchewan.\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, reporting on your inspection of the St. Alban's School at Prince Albert on April 21. The contents of your letter have been discussed with the Director and we are communicating with Dr. Alderwood, Secretary of the M.S.C.C., and Bishop Martin.\n\nI do not understand why Mr. Ellis thought that he would not come under the direction of the M.S.C.C. The school at Onion Lake, which was destroyed by fire and of which Mr. Ellis was Principal, came under the jurisdiction of that Commission and the St. Alban's School was opened to replace the one destroyed by fire. The only additional complication in the matter is the fact that in allowing rent for the building the Department provided that the Bishop would be responsible for keeping the building in reasonably good condition.\n\nWe are advising Dr. Alderwood that a night watchman should be employed the year round. Please secure a proper watchman's clock and forward it to the Principal.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, May 11, 1946.\n\nDear Bishop Martin:\n\nI have just received a very lengthy report from Inspector Ostrander with reference to his recent visit to the St. Albans School. Mr. Ostrander points out that the building is in a reasonably good state of repair except that the interior is badly in need of redecorating and the floors are in poor shape.\n\nIt is evident from the report that the building is over-crowded. We are communicating with Dr. Alderwood regarding the matter and instructing him to reduce the enrolment to 100, effective from September 1, 1946.\n\nI understand that Mr. Ostrander recently interviewed you and pointed out the fire hazards that exist. I am advising Dr. Alderwood that we are prepared to allow $40.00 a month towards the salary of the night watchman, provided a watchman is employed the year round.\n\nI feel certain that you will co-operate with us in improving conditions in this building, so that the children may be reasonably comfortable and that the extreme danger of fire will be removed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRight Reverend Henry D. Martin, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Saskatchewan.\nMay 17th, 1946.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your 115-1-1 of May 11th in regard to St. Alban's School, Prince Albert.\n\nI have carefully read the report of Inspector Ostrander which follows very much the lines I have followed in my own reports. Our Commission has never felt that St. Alban's was suitable for Residential School purposes except as an emergency measure awaiting the rebuilding of the Onion Lake School. When visiting the school at the beginning of February I was really distressed at the difficulties under which the work was being carried on, but it was hard to see what could be done. We have urged our Principal to rent or lease a piece of ground for garden purposes believing that this would be a wholesome outlet for the boys. We have also urged that anything possible should be done to secure one of the Army huts if they were made available so that something in the nature of a recreation building or manual training shop might be provided. Apparently the buildings at the two training camps in Prince Albert are not as yet being disposed of.\n\nIn the matter of overcrowding we have been deeply concerned. About a year ago we had serious trouble with our Principal, who apparently disregarded our explicit instructions that not more than 100 children were to be admitted. The matter went so far that Mr. Ellis tendered his resignation but this was later withdrawn when we realized that he was not wholly responsible for the admission of additional children. The authorized pupilage was increased to 125 when changes were made which utilized part of the auditorium for classroom purposes. A new girls' playroom was then created and additional dormitory accommodation provided which made us feel that we could care for 125. There were 130 children in the building at that time and we then instructed our Principal that for the future the limit must be 125. I think it well to emphasize the difficult position of our Principal in this matter when there are no other institutions provided for homeless Indian children. Mr. Ellis has been at the mercy of the Agents and Doctor of the Department who send orphans or other needy children to the school, sometimes without any consultation or agreement. Mr. Ellis has several times advised us of the arrival of children by train or by road who were landed at the school and he had nothing to do but accept them. While I was\npresent in the building he was forced to take in two more girls whose mother had just been admitted to the sanitarium for an indefinite period. He protested against this but the Doctor insisted that there was no other place to which they could be sent. When we are condemned for overcrowding I think it well that these facts should be borne in mind. When this school was carrying almost 150 children we were only being paid for 100.\n\nI am glad that this inspection has taken place and am grateful for the provision of a Night Watchman's salary as the fire hazard is certainly great under these conditions. We are immediately notifying Mr. Ellis that the number of children should be reduced to the present authorized enrolment and that he should use his discretion as to the boys to be discharged. From September 1 we shall accept your ruling that the limit must be 100.\n\nIn regard to the state of the building there has been difficulty by reason of the unwillingness of the Diocese of Saskatchewan to assume full liability for repairs. It has been arranged that Bishop Martin shall meet with our Commission to arrive at an agreement in regard to this question and we trust that this will be accomplished on June 4th.\n\nOur experience in Prince Albert has made it very plain that there are a very large number of children in northern Saskatchewan who require the privileges of a residential school. I trust that the Department will give serious consideration to the rebuilding of St. Barnabas, Onion Lake and that a larger pupilage will be authorized there to meet the need. The site is an admirable one, the out-buildings are already constructed, the farm is fenced and a good deal of land has been brought under cultivation so that only the main school building is required to re-establish a good school in healthy and convenient surroundings. Our Commission will be greatly relieved when the emergency conditions at Prince Albert can be replaced by something better.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH. A. Anderson\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, May 28, 1946.\n\nMr. J.F.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n414 Federal Building, Regina, Saskatchewan.\n\nWith reference to your letter of April 30 and my reply of May 10, regarding your inspection of the St. Alban's School, I am now in receipt of a letter from Dr. H.A. Alderwood, Secretary of the M.S.C.C., in which he states that the Principal of the St. Alban's School has been instructed that no more children should be accepted and that he can use his own discretion regarding the boys to be discharged.

I am glad to learn that Mr. Ostrander finds the building in good repair. The interior walls are, I understand, being painted. Naturally, the floors are being subjected to considerable wear and tear owing to the large number of boys and girls who are continually traversing these floors. Their boots and shoes tend to wear down any material.\n\nI am inclined to agree with the suggestion of overcrowding but of course this matter is not within my jurisdiction. On the other hand I cannot fully agree with Mr. Ostrander regarding the lack of fire escapes. After receiving your letter I again went to the school and I find that apart from the stairs, there are three excellent means of exit. This building was erected as a boarding school for girls, and all its history has been used for that purpose, or as a school for boys. Consequently, the lives of the children were safeguarded as far as it is possible. I can assure you that I will do all in my power to co-operate with you so that the children in residence will be thoroughly well cared for and that as far as is humanly possible every danger of fire will be removed.\n\nAgain, I assure you of my interest in this important matter, and also of my co-operation.\n\nI am, faithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBp/e\nRegina, May 28th, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith regard to that part of Department letter of the 10th instant, No. 115-1-1, which refers to the purchase of a watchman's clock for the St. Alban's Indian Residential School, I have to say that I have been unable to purchase one of these as there are none in stock in the city.\n\nHowever, the J.H.

As the result of my recommendation instructions have gone to the Principal of the St. Alban's School to accept more than 100 pupils in residence for the next term. The principal for the Gordon's School has not yet completed his staff for the next term. He promises to replace the Indian Farming Instructor with a capable man and to obtain the services of a suitable Sewing Matron and Kitchen Matron. All three of these positions were filled with unsuitable appointees during the past term and the work was not at all satisfactory. The appointment of Engineer was changed several times and Mr. Ireland was holding the appointment at the end of the June term. His services might be satisfactory if the machinery and equipment of the school was in good condition but I do not think that he is a good repair man and he was unable to cope with the regular difficulties with the machinery. Both of the Lister engines have been shipped to Winnipeg to be repaired and a requisition is going forward for new batteries for the lighting plant. The difficulty with respect to water supply has still not been met but the new well is being cleaned out in the hope that it will furnish an adequate supply. A further report on this will be forwarded shortly. The other residential schools have been operating in a fairly satisfactory manner during the past quarter.\n\nJ.P.B.

In this connection, I may say that we have just received a letter from our principal, the Rev. G. W. Fisher, pointing out that the number of pupils is too high and expressing the hope that the new quarters for the Lac la Ronge school may soon be opened in order that the surplus number may be transferred.\n\nMr. Fisher tells us of the continual pressure under which he is labouring and confirms what our former principal said as to the difficulty of keeping down the number in this particular school. He claims that in visiting Lac la Ronge recently he found everywhere a desire to send children in and had thirteen requests from Stanley alone. He has been receiving a great many requests from the reserves which formerly sent children to the Onion Lake school and has been asking many parents to keep their children at home until new school is opened.\n\nThis Prince Albert Situation has been a difficult one ever since St. Alban's was opened and Mr. Ellis used to claim that various Agents and the doctor of the Indian Health Services would insist upon pupils being admitted when the school was already over-crowded. The situation can apparently only be relieved by opening the new school and I trust that we may soon have the satisfaction of doing this.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH. A.

I was there two Sundays ago, and the children seemed very happy and contented, and well fed and clothed.\n\nWhile writing I wonder if this is the time to ask if the Department has any plans regarding buildings at Pelican Narrows. Our school teacher last summer worked under many and great difficulties, both with regards to the school building and also the teacher's residence.

I know personally that many visitors, who were there this summer have been very outspoken about the lack of accommodation. I do not wish to bother you about conditions in Northern Saskatchewan, but in view of the report sent to me by our teacher, I thought I should inquire from you as to whether any building programme was contemplated.\n\nI was sorry not to be able to be present when the deputation from our Church met with the Minister and yourself and others some two weeks ago, but it was impossible for me to get away at that time.

(RG 10, Volume 6320, file 658-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI realize that there will be some delay in establishing the new school at Prince Albert, and in the meantime the dormitories at the old school will be over-crowded to the detriment of the children sleeping in them and increasing the fire hazard. Please advise me whether or not I should insist that sufficient of the children be returned to their homes to reduce the number in residence to 100 pending the opening of the new school. These extra children should not have been admitted to the school, but they are there now and there will be some difficulty in contacting their parents with a view to returning them to their homes.\n\nWith regard to that part of Mr. Fisher's letter where he refers in the third paragraph to the purchase of cooking utensils, etc., I have to say that I located a quantity of these utensils which could be purchased from a surplus in the hands of the Provincial Government, Department of Rehabilitation, taken over by them from War Assets Corporation. A list of these utensils was prepared and is held in this office as I am awaiting unit prices from the official in charge here in Regina. Mr. Fisher misunderstood me when he says that he understood that arrangements were made for their purchase. I propose submitting the list to the Department and recommending their purchase as soon as prices have been received. I expected to receive these prices today but they have not yet arrived. The list is not the complete requirements for opening a school of 120 pupils. Some of the articles were in sufficient quantity for our requirements, others were not. As soon as authority has been received to take over the utensils in question I intend to check over the list with Mr. Fisher, ascertain what further quantities are required and submit the necessary requisition to the Department.\n\nI have not yet been officially informed that the proposed school will be operated in the near future. I note that Mr. Fisher's letter indicated that a definite arrangement has been made.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan\n\nCopied:\nCS\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\n\nThere are at present about 30 children in residence at the St. Alban's School in excess of the authorized 100. The Reverend Principal informs me that he is going to have considerable difficulty financing until the opening of the new school unless these extra children are accepted as grant earning pupils. Of course I realize that they should not have been accepted into the school, and I was particularly concerned over the question of over-crowding and the additional fire hazard resulting therefrom.\n\nBuilding No. 30 at Ex-122 Basic Training Centre, which will shortly be prepared for the opening of the new Prince Albert School, can be prepared for temporary use by connecting the water and sewage. Mr. Fisher is going to immediately purchase additional coal, and the Department of Public Works will make immediate arrangements to re-connect the water and sewage, after which 30 boys at St. Alban's school, will be moved to Building No. 30, the new school, and Mr. Fisher will arrange for a staff member to sleep in the building for supervision purposes.\n\nI am assuming that we are taking the beds and bedding from the Department of Reconstruction, and sufficient beds will be moved into Building No. 30 for this purpose.\n\nI would recommend that Mr. Fisher be allowed grant for 30 additional pupils at St. Alban's School for the present, and that if it is considered necessary to take an additional 10, grant will be authorized for them also, until such time as the new school is prepared and properly opened.\n\nUntil the opening of the new school, the pupils will sleep at Building No. 30 but will attend classes at St. Alban's School, and also receive their meals there.\n\nJ.F.B.

P. B. Ostrander with reference to supernumerary grants made for children in excess of one hundred now attending this school.\n\nThese additional grants are very much appreciated, and will go a long way towards easing the difficulty I have been finding in financing the school, due to the increased costs of nearly everything we have to purchase.\n\nOn every side I am being pressed to take in additional children, and if, with the Department's approval, I am allowed to use, for the time being, as an annex to this school, one of the buildings offered us in which to open a temporary Lac La Ronge School, it might be possible by housing all the boys in the annex, to accommodate up to 100 girls in St. Alban's. This would be looked on as a temporary measure only, and immediately the new school is opened, normal conditions would be restored to St. Alban's, with a pupilage of about 60 girls, and 40 boys.\n\nI shall be glad to know if the Department will approve this plan.\n\nI am,\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nPERSONAL:\n\nJanuary 30, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Ostrander:\n\nI have had an opportunity of discussing the fire at the Thunderchild Residential School with the Director. At first I recommended that Mr. Phelan visit Saskatchewan with a view to discussing the following educational problems with you:\n\n(1) To select a site for the proposed new Lac la Ronge Residential School.\n(2) To inspect the work done at the Gordon's Residential School.\n(3) To inspect the work done at the Prince Albert Army Camp.\n(4) To discuss with you the steps which can be taken with regard to the children left without schooling as a result of the fire at Thunderchild.\n\nHowever, the Director does not wish Mr. Phelan nor myself to leave Ottawa for any length of time, because of the fact that the Educational Sub-Committee will soon start their work and he is anxious that we both be present for all its deliberations.\n\nTherefore, there is a possibility that he may ask you to come again to Ottawa to discuss the above problems and also your day school building program. Therefore, it is very likely that you will hear from him in this regard. In fact, I would suggest that you write him and advise the best time for your proposed visit. In the meantime, he has suggested that if at all possible some decision be reached with the Bishop of Saskatchewan as to the best location for the new Lac la Ronge Residential School.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

The agreement for renting this building at the rate of \u00a32,000.00 a year will end at the end of the current calendar year.)\nJune 19, 1948.\n\nFile: 115- -1\n115- -5\n\nNote: The Cold Lake Indian Day School is now located in the Saddle Lake Indian Superintendency.\nRegina, June 21st, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith reference to Department letter of the 21st ultimo,\nFile No. 106-0-1/132-2-1/115-1-1 (E), regarding accommodation for pupils at\nthe proposed Prince Albert Indian Residential School, and my letter of the\n5th instant, File No. 1021-303-11 ACE, on the subject, I have to say that we\nhad a meeting at Prince Albert on the 19th instant to discuss the whole question.\nGeneral Turner, Major G.A.F. Clarke, Mr. E.S. Jones, Superintendent, Carlton\nAgency, Reverend C.W. Fisher, and the writer were present.\n\nSince writing my letter of the 5th instant on the subject\nMajor Clarke has received information that the Elkhorn School has to be closed\nentirely, resulting in approximately 130 pupils having no school. In addition\nthere are 161 pupils in residence at the present combined St. Alban's Indian\nResidential School and Prince Albert Residential School. In the Pelican Narrows\narea there are approximately 200 pupils; Lac la Ronge area 125 pupils;\nStanley area 161 pupils; Chitek Lake Area (the subject of another letter) 30\npupils; Red Earth and Shoal Lake areas (also the subject of another letter)\n55 pupils.\n\nIn view of these figures it will be seen that if we extend our\npupilage for the Prince Albert Residential School to 600 pupils we will still\nnot have sufficient room to accommodate all of the children who should be accommodated.\nIn view of this fact our conclusions were that immediate steps should be taken to\nallocate to the Prince Albert Residential School sufficient funds to prepare all\nof the buildings mentioned in my letter of the 5th instant on the subject, for 400\npupils by the last of January, 1949, and for a further 200 pupils by the last of\nSeptember, 1949.\n\nMajor Clarke is reporting to the Department in this connection\nand General Turner, who will be in Ottawa shortly, intends to discuss it with\nCanon Cooke and Department officials. In the meantime I would recommend that the\nfunds which were allotted for replacing the Lac la Ronge School be used toward\nrepairing the buildings at Ex-122 Army Camp for a large residential school.\n\nIf we decide upon a 600 pupil...\nIf we decide upon a 600-pupil school at Prince Albert the Church Authorities should be pressed to place a business manager in charge as it will be a large institution and require the very best of business management to be successful. The matter of assisting the Prince Albert Residential School in a part of the cost of transporting pupils should also be considered.\n\nJ.F.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nCarl W. Begg\n\nPlease note letters from us on\n115-1-1\nand\n107-7-5\nDear Mr. Fisher:\n\nIt may assist you to have advance information of what Dominion and Provincial Officials concerned with the inspection of schools will expect to find when the two establishments under your principalship have achieved a settled routine.\n\nIt is expected that, as the schools are within easy walking distance of each other, activities will be unified rather than duplicated. We shall not object to your proposal to operate St. Alban's for the time being as a school exclusively for girls if the resulting duplications are kept to the minimum.\n\nIn assigning girls to the two schools, you are, we expect accommodating at St. Alban's all girls who will attend high school. The rest of the girls for St. Alban's should be selected so as to reduce the number of grades taught by each teacher in the two schools. It would invite adverse criticism to have one teacher at St. Alban's assigned to a classroom of girls in grades 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 while at the barracks another teacher has a roomful of boys in those grades. We think that the academic work will be better handled if boys and girls are taught together in the upper grades. This will probably require the girls of those grades to live at the barracks.\n\nWe appreciate the effect which this composition of classes may have on the organization of household duties, Girl Guides etc., but we feel sure that you can re-arrange these activities satisfactorily, particularly as among the three hundred pupils resident at Prince Albert there are likely to be many bigger girls who, although they have done little book work, are intelligent and capable of being trained quickly to be useful around the school.\nIt is recommended, therefore, that the classes at St. Alban's be as nearly as possible homogeneous groups of girls initially of low academic rating but grouped with consideration for the factors of physical and social development, intelligence and reading readiness. Thus grouped they should be able to advance more rapidly than the children in institutions where these factors may not be given the consideration they deserve. In this appraisal we hope to provide assistance early in the academic year, (by \"assistance\" I mean the provision of test materials and help in their administration and interpretation). It may be supposed that the handling of this new and large concentration of Indian pupils will be watched with intense interest by educationists and others who will, no doubt, expect that the best educational procedures will be adopted.\n\nThe provision of vocational training for pupils at Prince Albert is another aspect that is receiving attention. We hope to provide a cow-barn, pasture and garden land. We look forward to seeing the subject of animal husbandry handled in the classroom and on the farm in such a way that boys will take part in the calf clubs associated with the Prince Albert Cattle Fair and in other ways develop an enthusiasm for adult activity in animal husbandry.\n\nSimilar integrated activity should be possible in poultry husbandry and vegetable-raising. Garden plots for boys and girls could be projects of the classwork in nutrition, agriculture and home-making for all pupils.\n\nFor the girls we should like to see one of the schools provide a specially-equipped room where the teaching of sewing and allied subjects can be concentrated under the most competent person available. This should not be allowed to become a repair shop where mending and darning dominate the proceedings, although the need for these activities is recognized.\n\nThe walking involved in the passage of the girls from one school to the other should provide an opportunity to improve the lackadaisical posture and gait of pupils in whom these defects are not chargeable to dietary deficiency. Supervised walks are, of course, only one aspect of a physical education programme which we expect will include regularly...\nappointed classes and organized games calculated to exploit each child's allotment of recreational time. The homogeneous grouping which should improve the standard of work in other subjects should serve to make easier the conduct of games engaging all pupils.\n\nSince space is likely to be ample in the barracks, the provision of library facilities, distinct from a combined games and recreational reading room, should receive early attention.\n\nFinally, to assist in coping with the problem of pupil-supervision which you anticipate will be more difficult in a school where the pupils are not confined to one building, we recommend the immediate introduction of classroom lessons and discussions to prepare the pupils for the early election of group leaders who will share in the government of the student body. During the early weeks the presence of the upper grade boys and girls in the barracks should permit the appointment of monitors pro tem who may not, however, prove permanently acceptable to yourself or to their fellow-students. We would draw your attention to the series of articles on extra-curricular activities which appeared in last year's Indian School Bulletin.\n\nWe feel that you welcome this opportunity to demonstrate what can be done in the light of all the criticism and advice which the Department has received concerning the conduct of its schools. We look forward to the success of an experiment where it is possible to select and develop traditions and practices that may serve to guide our procedure elsewhere.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

In reviewing our files, I find that Mr. Hoey wrote you as follows on December 23, 1943:\n\n\"I have noticed Your Lordship's reference to taxes, and the city levy appears to me to be very reasonable. Would it be acceptable to the Diocese if we spent a minimum of $2,000.00 on the school, in lieu of rent, for the year 1944, and allowed you the sum of $2,000.00 annually for the next 4 years, on the understanding that any repairs that might be necessary would be undertaken either by the Diocese or by the Principal and that the taxes also would be paid by the Diocese? If this allowance is acceptable to you, it might be advisable to submit a voucher for one half the amount semi-annually.\"\n\nI understand that this lease was to run for the period of five calendar years and that it will expire on December 31, 1948.\n\nIn view of increased costs of repairs and general rental rises, I would like to suggest that the amount of\n$2,500.00 a year be considered as the amount of the new lease on this building for the next five years. I would also like to suggest, in view of the possibility of the Department purchasing this building, that the lease be subject to cancellation by either party after one year's notice.\n\nMay I, in closing, express my appreciation for the courtesy of your recent visit and hope that we may again have an opportunity of discussing mutual problems with regard to Indian welfare and education in the near future.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDear Colonel Nassy:\n\nAmongst those making application for the appointment of day school teacher at the Nut Lake Reserve was Mr. Harry Kapusianyk, who came to my office for a personal interview.\n\nMr. Kapusianyk had many talents which I thought would be wasted at the Nut Lake School, and which were badly needed at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School at Prince Albert, consequently I referred him to the Church of England Authorities for consideration.\n\nYou perhaps have heard that he was offered $45.00 a month maintenance, which was protested, with the result that he commenced his duties as Boys' Supervisor at $1,000.00 per annum and maintenance.\n\nI asked Superintendent E.S. Jones to guide him in his duties as I knew that Reverend Mr. Fisher would know little about what the duties of a man of this type should be. He has done excellent work so far as he is able, but I have just received a letter from him, and I am enclosing a copy of it for your confidential information.\n\nAs there seemed little possibility to promote much in the way of skating for the boys during the winter, with the exception of skating and hockey, I suggested to Mr. Kapusianyk that he endeavour to persuade Mr. Fisher to provide skates for the children. Apparently he has not been very successful. Mr. Jones also caused a message to be broadcast from the radio station in Prince Albert inviting contributions of secondhand skates. Apparently this was not very successful either.\n\nIs there anything that you could do to assist us in this connection? As you are no doubt aware, there is a lot more these days to purchasing skates than simply having the money available, especially when about 200 pairs are required.\n\nMr. Kapusianyk's letter would be amusing, if the matter was not so terribly serious. Please note that part which states:\n\n\"The school has no organization whatsoever. Nobody seems to have any authority to say yes or no to anything. I have been going ahead partly on my own and partly under Mr. Jones with very little help from Mr. Fisher.\"\n\nI have no doubt that some of the statements in Mr. Kapusianyk's letter are very near to reports on similar matters relating to that school submitted by Mr. Clark. If you have had a chance to talk to Mr. Clark since he visited the Lac la Ronge School perhaps he could tell you more than...\ntell you more than he would tell you in a regular report. What can be done to remedy the situation is completely beyond me. I sometimes feel like recommending that the school be closed, that a new Principal be appointed, and that the whole staff be re-organized. If this is not done I am afraid this school will be a disgrace to all of us.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nB. F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nTHE BESSBOROUGH\n\nSaskatoon, Sask.\n\nAll Saints School,\nP. A. Sask.\nNov. 26, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Ostrander:\n\nWell, I've been here a week and my results are still not too good. I now fully understand your problem here, and it will exist until there are some changes made on the staff. I have now contacted all the staff, and here is what I find. The school has no organization whatsoever. Nobody seems to have any authority to say yes or not to anything. I have been going ahead partly on my own and partly under Mr. Jones, with very little help from Mr. Fisher. I can't say exactly where the trouble lies and if I could I wouldn't for other reasons where you understand. I myself have no time for organizing sports, as you can see. I am supervising 46 senior boys. This, in itself, is a full job as the supervisors handle laundry, clean up, etc. & etc. I have, however, started a recreation hall which should be functioning within a week even on a limited scale.\n\nRegarding those skates you mentioned to me while I was talking to you. The rink should be completed this week but there isn't a pair of skates to be had.\n\nI'll be waiting to hear from you.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nSgd. Harry Kapusianyk.\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nDecember 8, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMajor MacKay,\n\nPrince Albert Indian Residential School.\n\nYou will recall our recent discussion with regard to the complaints made by the Reverend Mr. Fisher to Canon Cook concerning departmental cooperation in the operation of this school in temporary quarters at Prince Albert.\n\nPlease find attached a personal and confidential letter received from Mr. Ostreuder with regard to the conduct of the school. Under this letter on the file you will find a telegram which I have sent to Mr. Ostreuder, requesting that he meet Canon Cook as soon as possible concerning conditions at this school.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEnclosure.\nNovember 30, 1948.\n\nMajor D. M. McKay,\nDirector of Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Major McKay:\n\nFollowing my conversation with you and Colonel Neary on Tuesday last November 23rd, I am putting in writing the matters we discussed; and I am listing them in the following order.\n\n1. St. Albert's School, Prince Albert.\n   I first of all made application for the cheque due in lieu of rent of the last half of 1948. We also discussed the renewal of the lease on this school which expires at the end of this year. Both the time period of the lease and the new rate of rental were left with the Department to decide; and you were to advise me of your decision.\n\nWe also discussed the future of this school and mentioned two possibilities. First, the possible purchase of this building by the Department; and second the use of this school as a future High School for Indian children here in the West.\n\n2. Residential School at Onion Lake.\n   From our conversation together, my understanding is that the question of the rebuilding of this school was under consideration by the Department; also that the building of this school was linked up with the building of day schools in the Onion Lake vicinity.\n\n3. Residential School at Lac la Ronge.\n   I understood from our conversation that estimates had been passed this year for the building of a combined dormitory-school unit in consultation with the Government of the Province of Saskatchewan. I also understood that you were awaiting the return of your Mr. Clark from this area to ascertain further particulars; and also looking forward to an interview with the Minister of Education for the Province of Saskatchewan. You will recall my concern that in the event of the education of these Indian children at Lac la Ronge being placed in the hands of the Provincial Government, I should have the assurance that the teachers appointed would be of our faith.\n4. Day School at Loon Lake.\n\nMy understanding was that provision for the erection of this day school was being made in the estimates for 1949; and that it is definitely expected that this school will be actually built next summer.\n\n5. Day School at Chetek.\n\nThe cost of erecting this school was in the estimates for 1948 and this amount will be re-voted this session. It is to be hoped that this school will be built next summer.\n\n6. New Schools at Red Earth and Shoal Lake.\n\nI understood from our conversation that the erection of new schools at these two points will be investigated. I pointed out to you the needs in these two places and I sincerely hope that something will be done for these Indians.\n\n7. I also discussed with you the very vexed question of supplies not being forwarded to the schools, stating how frustrating this was to the school teachers; and how difficult it was for the children to do their lessons without the proper equipment. I understood that this matter was already causing you considerable concern and that we could look for great improvement immediately.\n\nThank you so much for giving me your time and counsel and I do want to assure you of my desire to help in every way possible in the education of our Indian children.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Martin, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nDear Bishop Martin:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of recent date with regard to the various matters discussed at our recent meeting in my office.\n\nWith regard to the Onion Lake Residential School, presently being operated in the St. Alban's College building in Prince Albert, you will shortly be receiving a separate letter from us concerning the future use of this building. Arrangements are being made to forward you, in the near future, a cheque covering the lease rent for the last half of 1948.\n\nMr. Clark will shortly be returning from northern Manitoba and we will then be in a position to consider his report with regard to educational facilities in northern Saskatchewan. We have recently had some correspondence with the Minister of Education for the Province of Saskatchewan in this regard.\n\nAs I advised you, we have included amounts in our next year's Estimates for the erection of day schools at Loon Lake and Chitek Lake.\n\nWe are also investigating the requirements for schools at Red Earth and Shoal Lake.\n\nWith regard to school supplies, I feel certain that all outstanding requisitions have now been forwarded if stocks have been obtained from the publishers. There are still certain books which are not being printed in large quantities and, as a result, we are only able to ship out limited quantities of these particular texts.\n\nIn conclusion, may I extend my thanks for the\ncourtesy of your visit and hope that we will be able to have other such meetings to discuss common educational and welfare problems.\n\nActing Director.\nOttawa, December 6, 1948.\n\nRt. Rev. Henry D. Martin, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Saskatchewan.\n\nRe: St. Alban's College, Battleford, Sask.\n\nDear Bishop Martin:\n\nYou will recall our recent discussion with regard to the renewal of the lease on the above building. In reviewing our files, I find that Mr. Hoey wrote you as follows on December 23, 1943:\n\n\"I have noticed Your Lordship's reference to taxes, and the city levy appears to me to be very reasonable. Would it be acceptable to the Diocese to spend a minimum of $2,000.00 on the school, in lieu of rent, for the year 1944 and allowed you the sum of $2,000.00 annually for the next 4 years, on the understanding that any repairs that might be necessary would be undertaken either by the Diocese or by the Principal and that the taxes also would be paid by the Diocese? If this allowance is acceptable to you, it might be advisable to submit a voucher for one half the amount semi-annually.\"\n\nI understand that this lease was to run for the period of five calendar years and that it will expire on December 31, 1948.\n\nIn view of increased costs of repairs and general rental rises, I would like to suggest that the amount of $2,500.00 per year be considered as the amount of the new lease on this building for the next five years. I would also like to suggest, in view of the possibility of the Department purchasing the building, that the lease be subject to cancellation by either party after one year's notice.\n\nMay I, in closing, express my appreciation for the courtesy of your recent visit and hope that we may again have an opportunity of discussing mutual problems with regard to Indian welfare and education in the near future.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Healy,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6320, file 658-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nTo be returned to Col. Neary with comments.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nAttention of Colonel Neary\n\nI am in receipt of Department letter of the 9th instant, File 658-1 (E), enclosing draft letter which it is intended to send to Bishop Martin regarding the rental of the building at Prince Albert now being used as St. Alban's Indian Residential School.\n\nI am quite agreeable with the suggestions made in the letter, with the exception of the possibility of the Department purchasing the building. I had not heard that this was being considered, but I may say that the building should be very thoroughly examined by a well qualified person, as I have no doubt it would be, before a decision is made.\n\nI believe that the building is unsuitable, and would require an enormous amount of re-arranging of the interior before it could be made suitable. Of course this is reasonable if the purchase price was low enough.\n\nIn the meantime, when considering the purchase of the building, a possible cost of $50,000.00 to prepare it for use, plus a considerable reduction in the dormitory space to have the dormitories as they should be, must be kept in mind.\n\nThe draft letter is returned herewith.\n\nJ.P.B.

The Bishop asked me if I'd ask that the Indian Affairs Branch decision on the new rental rate could be given him in the near future. I fully meant to tell you about this when I visited you but other matters drove it from my mind.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHenry G.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Prince Albert Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended 30th September 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 14th October 1944.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Prince Albert Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended 30th September 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 14th October 1944.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

(RG 10, Volume 6321, file 655-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Alban's (Prince Albert) School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 8th, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paginating No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Prince Albert (St. Albans) School for the Quarter ended 31st March 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 5th April 1945.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Prince Albert (St. Alban's) School for the Quarter ended 31st March 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 5th April 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return, the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Prince Albert (St. Albert's) School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 10th July, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 10th\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of day pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Prince Albert (St. Alban's) School for the Quarter ended 30th September 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 20th October 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm 22\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT of the Prince Albert (St. Alban's) School at Prince Albert**\n\nReserve for Quarter ended 30th September 1924.\n\n| REGISTER No. | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND No. | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 325         | Leslie Ahenakew       | 15  |     |      |          | 5 2 5 7 5 1 7 2 1 | 5 5               |                         | Sep: 7:44                | 62         |                                                                                                 |\n| 326         | Jacob Bird            | 8   |     |      |          | Montreal L.    |                   |                         | Sep: 1:44                | 92         |                                                                                                 |\n| 327         | Clarence Bear         | 15  |     |      |          | Wm.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Prince Albert (St. Alban's) School for the Quarter ended... 30th September... 1945.\n\nPrincipal...\n\nDated... 20th October 1945.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at... this... 19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, piling it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 400\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter for all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Prince Albert (St. Alban's) School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 23rd 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Prince Albert (St. Alban's) School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 2nd July 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils (or which grant is allowed).\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Prince Albert Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 4th, 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Prince Albert Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 4th, 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 10\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Alban's Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 12th 1947.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...St. Alban's Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended...30th.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Albans, Prince Albert School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 16th, 1947.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated this ........................................... 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Alban's, Prince Albert School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1947.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nJanuary 10th, 1948\n\nDated:\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n\nR. 3444\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Alban's, Prince Albert School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 10th, 1948.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nthis\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the Average attendance of pupils during quarter by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Alban's Anglican School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1947.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated January 10th, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nR. 3444\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n### Agency\n**REPORT of the St. Alban's Anglican School at Prince Albert on Reserve for Quarter ended December 31st, 1947**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n|                 | Brought forward |     |     |      |                |                   |                          |                             |            |\n| 349             | Leslie Bear     | 12\u00bd | \u2022    |      | John Smith     | \u2022                  |                          | 4.9.45                      | 92 - 55    |\n| 350             | Cecil W.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Alban's Anglican School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 10th, 1948.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipal will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA-403\nR. 3444\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Agency**\n\nREPORT of the St. Alban's Anglican School at Prince Albert on Reserve for Quarter ended December 31st, 1947.\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 240             | Percy Bird      | 15  | *   |      | Sandy Lake     |                    |                         |                           | 27.8.37    | 50/28 Returned Nov. 7.                                        |\n| 251             | David Brown     | 14  | *   |      |                |                    |                         |                           | 1.9.38     | 50/30 \"                                                        |\n| 257             | Lawrence Meetoo | 13\u00bd | *   |      | Thunderchild   |                    |                         |                           | 5.11.39    | 92/56 \"                                                        |\n| 250             | Tommy Bird      | 13\u00bd | *   |      | Montreal L.    |                    |                         |                           | 1.9.40     | 92/56 \"                                                        |\n| 266             | Absalom Frenchman| 10\u00bd | *   |      | Thunderchild   |                    |                         |                           | 12.9.41    | 92/54 \"                                                        |\n| 294             | Patrick King    | 11\u00bd | *   |      | Littlepine     |                    |                         |                           | 1.9.41     | 92/56 \"                                                        |\n| 296             | Jerry Ballentyne| 11  | *   |      | New Reserve    |                    |                         |                           | 13.9.42    | 92/56 \"                                                        |\n| 297             | Peter Ballentyne| 12\u00bd | *   |      |                |                    |                         |                           | 1.9.42     | 92/56 \"                                                        |\n| 298             | Baptiste Bird   | 10  | *   |      |                |                    |                         |                           | 1.9.42     | 92/56 \"                                                        |\n| 300             | Francis Paddy   | 10  | *   |      | Thunderchild*  |                    |                         |                           | 16.9.42    | 92/56 \"                                                        |\n| 303             | Stephen Frank   | 11\u00bd | *   |      | SweetGrass     |                    |                         |                           | 1.9.43     | 92/56 \"                                                        |\n| 308             | Roderick King   | 10\u00bd | *   |      | Littlepine     |                    |                         |                           | 1.9.43     | 92/56 \"                                                        |\n| 309             | Elias Ballentyne| 15  | *   |      | Sturgeon L.    |                    |                         |                           | 1.9.43     | 00/00 \"                                                        |\n| 313             | William Whitehead| 14  | *   |      | Jas.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Alban's Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended 31st March 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 18th April 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Alban's Anglican School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 8th, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Alban's School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1948.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated January 20, 1949.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at Indian Agency, February 2, 1949.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. IA. 403\nR. 3608\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Carleton Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the St. Alban's School at Prince Albert on Reserve for Quarter ended December 31/48**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n|                 |                 |     |     |      |                |                          |                             |            |\n| Brought Forward |                 |     |     |      |                |                          |                             |            |\n| 0378 Mary Halkett | 14\u00bd | \u2022 Jas.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained, by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Alban's School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 20, 1949.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Indian Agency, February 2, 1949.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Alban's School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1949.\n\nand Principal\n\nDated Apr. 11, 5, 1949.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at April 5, Prince Albert, Sask.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Alban's School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1949.\n\nDated April 5, 1949.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at Prince Albert, Sask., this April 5, 1949.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return, as ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Alban's School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at JUN 30 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Alban's School for the Quarter ended Oct. 17, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 17, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at OCT. 31, 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|-----|----------------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n|                |                 |     |     |     |                |               |                  |                        |                             |            |\n| 0307           | Julia Whitehead | 11  | x   |     | James Smith    |               |                  |                        |                             |            |\n| 0308           | Flore Sanderson | 12  | x   |     |                |               |                  |                        |                             |            |\n| 0311           | Evelyn Beer     | 10  | x   |     | John Smith     |               |                  |                        |                             |            |\n| 0315           | Rita Ahenskew   | 10  | x   |     | Sandy Lake     |               |                  |                        |                             |            |\n| 0316           | Doris Burns     | 10  | x   |     | James Smith    |               |                  |                        |                             |            |\n| 0317           | Ruby Moostos    | 10  | x   |     |                |               |                  |                        |                             |            |\n| 0318           | Abigail Bird    | 12  | x   |     | Montreal L.    |               |                  |                        |                             |            |\n| 0321           | Eva Poundmaker  | 7   | x   |     | Foundmaker     |               |                  |                        |                             |            |\n| 0322           | Rosie Bear      | 8   | x   |     | John Smith     |               |                  |                        |                             |            |\n| 0324           | Laura Constant  | 13  | x   |     | James Smith    |               |                  |                        |                             |            |\n| 0325           | Irene Head      | 14  | x   |     |                |               |                  |                        |                             |            |\n| 0326           | Hazel Head      | 12  | x   |     |                |               |                  |                        |                             |            |\n| 0329           | Margaret Ballentyne | 7 | x   |     | Montreal L.    |               |                  |                        |                             |            |\n| 0330           | Marta Roberts   | 13  | x   |     | Montreal L.    |               |                  |                        |                             |            |\n| 0331           | Melinda Bird    | 10  | x   |     |                |               |                  |                        |                             |            |\n| 0332           | Mary L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

(RG 10, Volume 6321, file 658-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Albans School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Jan. 6, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at JAN 10 1950\n\nthis Indian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Alban's (Onion Lake) School for the Quarter ended MARCH 31st 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 1st 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at CARLTON APR 12 1950\n\nIndian

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Alban's (Caiman Lake C.of E.) School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30th, 1950.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at this Indian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 408\n## Indian Residential School Quarterly Return\n\n**Carleton Agency**\n\n**Report of the St. Alban's (O'Brien Lake C.of E.)

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Alban's (Colon Lake Cref E.)

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will any claim be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Albans (Omiom Lake C.of E.)

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nIndian Residential School Quarterly Return\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Alban's (Onion Lake C. of E.)

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nIN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Alban's (onion Lake C. of E.) School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 14th, 1950.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at OCT 16 1950\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Carlton Agency**\n\n**REI of the St. Alban's (Ohion Lake C.of E.)

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Alban's (Onion Lake C. of E.)

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for whose grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per pupil grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated OCTOBER 5, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated OCTOBER 7, 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entering the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINT'S RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 30 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 5, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at: OCT 7 1950\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 5, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: OCT 7, 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n### Indian Residential School Quarterly Return\n\n**Report of the All Saint's Residential School at Prince Albert**\n\n| Register Number | Names of Pupils | Age | Boy/Girl | Band or Reserve | Class or Study | Standing in Class | Trade or Other Industry | Date of Entry into School | Attendance |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|----------|-----------------|---------------|------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 02 Evelyn Bird  | 15              | 1   | Sandy Lake |               |               |                  |                         |                           | 1939       |\n| 04 Marina Ahenakew | 16            | 1   | \"         |               |               |                  |                         |                           | 1940       |\n| 07 Louise Ysyakekoot | 16          | 1   | \"         |               |               |                  |                         |                           | 1941       |\n| 08 Myra Frenchman | 16             | 1   | Thunderchild |             |               |                  |                         |                           | 1941       |\n| 011 Florence Meetoo | 14           | 1   | \"         |               |               |                  |                         |                           | 1941       |\n| 015 Freida Fineday | 16             | 1   | Sweetgrass |             |               |                  |                         |                           | 1939       |\n| 018 Helen Charles | 14             | 1   | Sturgeon Lk. |             |               |                  |                         |                           | 1942       |\n| 019 Louise Hunt   | 16             | 1   | Montreal Lk. |             |               |                  |                         |                           | 1944       |\n| 022 Verna Sanderson | 15           | 1   | Jas.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINT'S RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 5, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at OCT 7 1950\n\nIndian

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Carleton Agency**\n\n**Report of the All Saints School at Prince Albert**\n\n**Reserve for Quarter ended September 30th 1950**\n\n| Register Number | Names of Pupil | Age | Boy/Girl | Band or Reserve | Class or Study | Standing in Class | Trade or Other Industry | Date of Enrolment to School | Attendance |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|----------|-----------------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 126             | Benjamin Ballentyne | 14  | 1        | Peter Ball      | # x           |                  |                        |                             | 6:9:48     | 92/954 |\n| 127             | Louis Musasskapew   | 8   | 1        | Sandy Lake      | x             |                  |                        |                             | 6:9:48     | 92/19 |\n| 128             | David Charles      | 9   | 1        | Amos Charles    | x             |                  |                        |                             | 6:9:48     | 92/17 |\n| 129             | Walter McKenzie    | 10  | 1        |                 | x             |                  |                        |                             | 7:9:48     | 92/18 |\n| 130             | David McKenzie     | 18  | 1        |                 | x             |                  |                        |                             | 7:9:48     | 92/17 |\n| 131             | Semson Ratt       | 12  | 1        |                 | x             |                  |                        |                             | 14:9:48    | 92/17 |\n| 132             | Roderick McKenzie  | 13  | 1        |                 | x             |                  |                        |                             | 14:9:48    | 92/17 |\n| 133             | Norman Dorion     | 13  | 1        | The Pas         | x             |                  |                        |                             | 18:8:42    | 92/17 |\n| 136             | Victor Fineday     | 10  | 1        | Sweetgrass      | x             |                  |                        |                             | 9:10:48    | 92/17 |\n| 137             | Jack Fineday       | 7   | 1        |                 | x             |                  |                        |                             | 9:10:48    | 92/19 |\n| 138             | Clarence B.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated October 5, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at CARLTON this OCT 7 1950 Indian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|----------------|----------------|-----|-----|-----|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                |                |     |     |     |                |                    |                        |                           |            |                                                                                  |\n| 51             | Frank Hunt     | 10  | 1   |     | Wm.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly period ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils shown on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Alban's (Onion Lake C.of.E.)

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

In fact these things were not thought of sooner about till after the erection of the building, and then all saw the great necessity for both chimneys and paint in order to protect the building from fire and weather and to save both parties from danger and loss as well as to secure the greater health of the school children. For these reasons I offered to do all the necessary labour if the Department furnished the material, which I...\nThis is all that could be expected of the mission.\n\nRe not sending in names of children to be carried off the 72c. School say nothing as it is easily rectified now by the action of your Department in kindly making the offer they do in regard to the first two quarters, and I send you the names of some whom we wish and expect to be carriers of said grant.\n\nRe agreeing to adopting at our effort etc., a glance at the names of the children on the Register, and the exact attendance of the children will bear me out, and I am sure you can bear me out when I say that it was no lack of effort on my part to retain those we had or to get new ones when these left that caused the deficiency.\n\nI am glad to know that you will investigate it, as I believe new and increased forces have been given you in the matter.\n\nBelow are names of children at present expected to be carriers of the 72c. grant:\n\nBoys 66\n1. Charlie Quinney\n3. Alex. Gut\n4. George Marshall\n\nGirls 57\n1. Maria Murray\n2. Minnie Paired\n3. Maria Crookshank\nEllen Singer\nWe cannot give the names of all but give those we have respect to get and hope yet to obtain the full number allowed by your Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6321, file 658-5, part 1)\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter no. 31 D. of the 17th January '95, Re Protestant School, Reference marginal note I beg to forward enclosed a letter from Inspector Mcgibbney Repub that he and the mission had expended on this school over $100.00 on the school building. To the Department I rather think Mr. Matheson has valued his services very highly.\n\nThe approximate cost of material for chimney and painting would be $100.00. The building would certainly be improved by a little paint and a chimney. There were no promises made at the time of erecting this school, that the Department should go to any further expense which Mr. Matheson's letter brought out. It appears to me that Mr. Matheson is asking for this as an extra appropriation from the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) George Mann\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am too poor to buy them myself and the price is a terrible job to keep the wooden bedsteads clean in fact almost impossible they are a constant source of annoyance trouble money above all necessity would make me trouble you in this matter.\n\nHoping for a favorable answer\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ.

B.M.) of matched lumber for flooring and ceiling of the building erected some years ago by the Department and the Mission to be used as a school for Indian children on this reserve. The flooring is about entirely worn out, and there never was any ceiling put in, as I always was too busy and too poor to put it in. The building needs these repairs badly.\n\nWhen the building was erected your Department furnished all the lumber and I did all the work, without any further expense to the Department.\n\nThis arrangement still holds good so far as I am concerned, i.e. I will put in the floor and ceiling at my own expense if they furnish the material.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(sgd) J.R.

You should arrange for the purchase of the material as mentioned by the Principal. If possible, competitive prices should be obtained, and the material purchased from the firm quoting the lowest price. Besides the material for the eavestroughing, you may purchase and have supplied 5 - 150 gallon tanks. The total cost should not exceed the estimate submitted by the Principal, viz: $183.20.

These were asked for in the last requisition from the school but were not supplied by the Department.\n\nIn looking over the dormitories and wash places on the occasion of my visit, I did not notice any toothbrushes and asked the Sister Superior if the pupils had any. She replied that they had not, and asked me whether the Department would supply them. If the Department can properly supply these toothbrushes I would ask that five dozen be sent this school. If not, I will ask the Sister Superior to try to purchase some out of per capita grant or other funds, as they are articles the pupils should certainly have and be taught to use regularly.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 21st, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, and in reply beg to inform you that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of two map pointers and a bottle of \"Fixatif\" and a diffuser for same, for the use of the Onion Lake R.

You may, therefore, arrange to purchase the same. Competitive prices should, if possible, be obtained from a number of dealers, and the purchase should be made from the firm quoting the lowest price. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded, together with a memo, attached showing the names of the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted. No unnecessary expense should be incurred in the purchase of this equipment.\n\nThe Department will be pleased if you can arrange to have the account covering the cost of this saw submitted before the end of the present fiscal year, viz: March 31st, next, in order that same can be paid from the appropriation for the current year before our books close.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Indian Residential School; and asking for a recommendation as to the number of pupils that should be provided for.\n\nThis school has always, in a large measure, been recruited from outside Agencies and whilst I cannot write positively with respect to this, I believe that during the last few years recruiting from these outside Agencies has been restricted to the number that the school could accommodate, and that many more pupils could have been obtained if the school had been able to take them.\n\nThere are at present 42 children on the roll at the school, 25 boys and 17 girls; this number is made up of children belonging to the following Agencies -\n\n| Agency            | Number |\n|-------------------|--------|\n| Onion Lake Agency | 19     |\n| Battleford        | 4      |\n| Carlton           | 8      |\n| Saddle Lake       | 11     |\n\nOf the above, eight Saddle Lake children are being transferred to the Edmonton Indian Residential School, and their places are being taken by eight more children from this Agency, which will leave the total the same, i.e. 42, but made up as follows -\n\n| Agency            | Number |\n|-------------------|--------|\n| Onion Lake Agency | 27     |\n| Battleford        | 4      |\n| Carlton           | 8      |\n| Saddle Lake       | 3      |\n\nThis number should easily be increased to 50 with recruits from this Agency, and in speaking over the probabilities of recruits from other Agencies with the Rev. M.Ellis, the principal, he informed me that he felt sure he would have no difficulty in making this number up to 80 from those sources; therefore 80 is the number we are both agreed the Department should be asked to provide for in the new school.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n**Onion Lake Agency**\n\nDate: March 11th, 1924\n\nDominion Government\n\nVote No. 7\nTreaty No. 6\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nBOUGHT OF\n\nTHE T.

You are of course aware that the proposition is to change the site of this new school some miles away from the present school. This means that provision will have to be made for a residence for the Principal, as it will be impossible to erect a school for $40,000 that will provide accommodation for him in the school, especially in view of the fact that there is a staff of four or five and the principal has four or five children. You could not begin to consider having the Principal living in the school proper. I would suggest that $4500.00 be arranged for in some way, to erect this Principal's residence.\n\nNo provision, you will notice, has been made for the erection of stabling. This is essential.\n\nIn your letter you also drew my attention to the fact that the Church authorities have requested you to consider the erection of the school at Lac Sioux instead of Onion Lake. I am satisfied that conditions could not be worse than they are at Onion Lake, and the Department should not consider, for one minute, the substituting of the money for a school at Lac Sioux. Even if this were needed, it could be put off for one year. The school at Onion Lake has suffered untold inconvenience for many years. It is insanitary, damp and is just hanging together. I am glad that you are not able to agree to this change.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 9, 1924.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nConsiderable thought has been given to the subject matter of your letter of March 14th. The Department considers that conditions at the Onion Lake C. of E. Indian Residential School will allow no postponement to building operations and I wish to urge you to agree to the programme which was outlined in our Estimates for this fiscal year.\n\nProvision for a new school, to be conducted by the M. S. C. O. in the Lac Seul area, will receive the serious consideration of the Honourable the Superintendent General when our plans for next year are being discussed. I trust that $40,000 will be available towards the buildings for the Onion Lake Institution. Next year it may be possible to complete and furnish the buildings, to erect a principal's residence and the necessary outbuildings.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, M.D., D.C.L.,\nGeneral Secretary, M. S. C. O.,\n604 Jarvis St.,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, May 9, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your No. 309-11A of the 3rd instant, with reference to the amount in our Estimates for the new Church of England Indian Residential School at Onion Lake. I wish to inform you that the $40,000 which will likely be provided is for the purpose of making a start on the main building which will accommodate 75 or 80 pupils. Next year I trust the Department can make provision for the completion and equipping of the buildings, for a principal's residence and for the necessary outbuildings. The activity could be transferred to the new building and farm in the fall of 1925. I note your recommendation that the Onion Lake building programme should proceed and that the appropriation be not diverted for a school in the Lac Seul area.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott.\n\nI should be pleased if you would decide concerning the accommodation in the new Onion Lake C. of E. Indian Residential School. Commissioner Graham thinks we should make provision for 75 children. The Principal and the Agent recommend a pupilage of 80. Inasmuch as the Anglican Church are not pressing for a Central Saskatchewan school because of the new building at Onion Lake, I believe we should provide accommodation for some children from the Carlton and Duck Lake agencies. The Principal and the Agent have studied the question carefully and I wish to recommend a pupilage of 80.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nJune 4, 1924.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Orr,\n\nDr. Scott asked me to speak to you concerning commencing the new building for the Onion Lake C. of E. Residential School. He wishes the work undertaken as soon as possible. The following information concerning the site is contained in a telegram from Dr. Westgate (File 115-1-9): It is situated on the shore of Long Lake; has an altitude of 100 ft. above lake level, with excellent drainage. He recommends capacity for 80 children.\n\nI wish to draw to your attention that the road from Lloydminster north to this site (35 to 40 miles) is up and down hill and freighting facilities will be bad.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

You will observe that accommodation has been provided for eighty pupils.\n\nAs the new School will be located thirty miles from the nearest railway station and in hauling materials it will be necessary to ferry across the North Saskatchewan River, the style of the building will necessarily have to be of frame construction on a concrete foundation. Every care will be exercised in the preparation of the specifications to see that the school is warmly built. It will be heated by a low pressure steam system of heating. The level of the basement floor will be four feet below grade, and with a ten foot ceiling ample light and ventilation will be provided for this entire floor.

They requested\nme to make application on their behalf in this respect\nand this I have pleasure in doing.\nDear Mr. Scott:-\n\nPlans for new C.of E.School at - Onion Lake.\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 7th instant, No.116-1-5, relative to the proposed new Onion Lake School, I beg to state that a number of the members of our Commission have examined the blue print sketches which you so kindly forwarded, and which are being returned herewith.\n\nThe members of the Commission who have examined the sketches have desired me to convey to you an expression of their appreciation of the care which has so obviously been taken to make this institution as comfortable and convenient as could well be managed for an institution so remotely situated from railway facilities. While expressing their approval of the plans in general, they requested me to incorporate in my reply to your letter a few suggestions concerning certain requirements which, although not indicated in the sketches, they have no doubt the architect may, in his own mind, already have arranged to supply. They are as follows:\n\n1. Basement Plan.\n\n(a) Dairy Room.\n(b) A Coal bin in or near the boiler room.\n(c) Doors leading to the outside from the Recreation rooms.\n(d) They observed that the food from the staff dining room must apparently be carried through the Pupils' dining room, but appreciate the Architect's difficulty in altering them.\n2. Ground Floor.\n\n(a) That there should be a door leading to the outside from the Chapel, preferably on the right hand side of the entrance from the passage.\n\n(b) As the Chapel, so called, will probably have to be used as an Assembly Room as well as for religious services, they were of the opinion that the room could be made to serve this dual purpose if one end of the Chapel were screened off with folding doors to serve as a Sanctuary.\n\n(c) As no Indian room, so called, appears to have been provided, they suggest that one of the staff bed-rooms at the front end of the passage be set apart for this purpose.\n\n3. The First Floor.\n\nThe centre room in the front might be fitted up with shelves as a library and reading room for the children.\n\n4. The Second Floor.\n\n(a) Toilet and closets to be added to the dormitories and bedrooms.\n\nAs no front elevation accompanied the sketches, the members were unable to ascertain the use which was to be made of the spaces above the boys' and girls' dormitories. They presumed that it was your intention that the elevation of the ends of the building would cease at the top of the boys' and girls' dormitories and be covered with the temporary roof in order that the elevation of those ends might be extended to the same height, should necessity arise, as the roof of the second floor. If they are right in this opinion, they wondered if it would not be better to have the walls around the spaces referred to extended upwards to the same elevation as the central part of the second floor when the building operations are in progress, rather than have this extension made at a subsequent date.\n\nAs you state in your letter that the building must be of frame construction on a concrete foundation, it was also suggested that the thickness of the foundation should project sufficiently to admit of having the building brick veneered, should this, at any future date be found necessary.\n\nThe above suggestions I beg to commend to your sympathetic consideration, and remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBK/W.K.

There are one or two small changes, however, which I would suggest be made.\n\nBasement Plan\n\nIt is a long distance from the kitchen to the staff dining room, and the food for the staff would have to be carried through pupils dining room in full view of the pupils. Would not an improvement be made by closing opening which I have marked A, making one at B and putting counter at C.\n\nFirst Floor Plan\n\nIn the infirmary quarters on this floor only one doorway is shown leading to the corridor, and this doorway is placed as far as possible from the stairs. Would it not be much safer if additional doors were put in at points which I have marked X. These extra doors would be quite close to the stairs and would be an aid to egress from that part of the building in case of fire.\n\nGeneral\n\nIt is noticeable that no provision has been made for open air sleeping porches for the pupils. I would suggest that these be put in on the first floor as outlined by me in red pencil. The centre porch could be used by infirmary patients.\npatients and would also serve to effectively cut off all communication between the boys and girls porches. The second floor does not lend itself so readily to the placing of sleeping porches, but even here some small provision of the kind could be made. This I have marked also with red pencil. These porches could be supported by pillars from the ground floor.\n\nThe blue prints are being returned you by concurrent mail, under separate cover, and I hope that my comments upon them will be found of some little assistance in making the final plans.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nP. S. I should mention that arrangements have been made for boring a well which will be situated in a suitable place to be covered by room marked lighting plant, pump, etc. This work will be commenced in the course of the next three days.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJune 24, 1924.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th returning sketch plans for the proposed new Onion Lake School, and I note your comments on same. With reference to your suggestions I would say as follows:\n\n1. Basement Plan:\n   (a) We will try and arrange to provide a dairy room.\n   (b) Coal bin: Will you please advise me if it the intention to use coal or wood. If coal is required a bin will be provided.\n   (c) Doors will be provided in the recreation rooms.\n   (d) By placing a door in the passage leading to the scullery it will be possible to serve the staff dining room without passing through the pupils dining room.\n\n2. Ground Floor:\n   (a) Outside door will be provided to chapel.\n   (b) Folding doors can be arranged.\n\n3. Second Floor:\n   (a) Toilets and closets will be provided.\n\nWith reference to your remarks regarding the space over the dormitories, I would say that there will not be sufficient room over these dormitories under the roof to provide additional accommodation. The rooms in the centre portion of the building will only be nine feet high, as they are principally occupied by the staff, but the end portions of the building will necessarily have to be eleven feet as they include the class rooms and dormitories. This will make it possible to provide dormitories on the top floor in the centre portion as shown on the sketch plan.\n\nThe foundation will be so planned that the building can be brick veneered if it is so desired at some future date.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report that the Rev. H. Ellis, principal at the Onion Lake Church of England Residential School has asked to be supplied with a set of weighing scales, with graduated measuring rod in order to enable him to take the correct weight and height of the pupils.\n\nI enclose a cutting of the kind of scale required.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Scott.\n\nPlans and specifications have been prepared for the proposed new Church of England School on the Onion Lake Indian Reserve, Sask. In planning this building it has been necessary to keep in mind the site for the building which is located on the Onion Lake Reserve, approximately 35 miles from a railway station. The building, as planned, is of frame construction on a concrete foundation, with a low pressure steam system of heating. In the specifications for the building care has been exercised in providing only what is absolutely necessary for the operating of the school. Everything is included in the plans and specifications with the exception of the water supply and sewerage system. It is impossible to include these items as we have not sufficient detailed information in order to prepare the necessary plans and specifications.\n\nIt is rather difficult, owing to the location, as all materials have to be transported a distance of 35 miles and ferried across the river, to arrive at an accurate estimate of the cost, but I am of the opinion that the building can be built for approximately $75,000. The plans have been approved by Doctor Westgate and Canon Gould. Accommodation is provided for 80 pupils.\n\nWill you please advise me the newspapers in which advertisements may be inserted, inviting tenders for this building. I beg to submit for your approval that we advertise in Edmonton, Calgary and Battleford.\n\nARCHITECT.\nMemorandum,-\n\nHon. Charles Stewart.\n\nJuly 10, 1924.\n\nI beg to send herewith a memorandum from the Architect of the Department, with reference to the proposed new Church of England school at Onion Lake, Sask. This memorandum is intended to show that your instructions have been followed with reference to the style of building, and the economies practised in designing it.\n\nI shall be glad to receive the names of the papers in Edmonton, Calgary and Battleford in which we are to advertise.\n\nIn a day or two I will be sending you a like memorandum with reference to the Roman Catholic boarding school at McIntosh, Ont. These two buildings and the wing to the new building at Kamloops will finish our contract work for this year.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General;\nToronto: Ottawa 9th July, 1924\n\n41-43 The Bible House, Alexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., C.M., G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nIn reply to the question raised in your letter of the 24th ultimo (No. 115-1-54) as to whether coal or wood would be burnt in the furnace in the new Onion Lake School, I beg to say that until the Turtleford to S. Paul de Metis Railway has been completed wood will be used on account of the prohibitive cost of hauling coal. Once the railway has been completed coal will be used.\n\nI am of the opinion that if a furnace with interchangeable grates could be procured this would be the best kind to have installed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/IMC.\n\nIndian Affairs.

School at this Agency.\n\nMr. Stean, owner of a well boring outfit in this neighbourhood, was engaged to bore two wells on the new school site; but after boring 22 feet at one spot and 16 feet at another, he was forced to abandon the attempt owing to the sandy nature of the earth, which was so fine that it fell through the bucket before it could be lifted to the surface.\n\nThe wells are now being drilled and at this writing one hole is down over 100 feet, and the well driller has informed me that there are good indications of striking water soon.\n\nThe vouchers enclosed are for meals for Mr. Stean and for 1000 feet of well cribbing which I had to purchase in preparation for Mr. Stean. This cribbing, however, can be made good use of at the Agency.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMr. J.
