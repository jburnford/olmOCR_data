A. J. Bray, of Montreal. The Company has a capital of $50,000.\n\nApplications for Letters Patent have been made by the Manitoba and North-West Coal Mining Company, the North-West Lumbering Company, and the Alberta Lumbering Company. The latter Company has not yet been organized by Col. Dennis, late Deputy Minister of the Interior, for the purpose of acquiring by purchase, lease, license, or otherwise, any or part of mineral and coal lands in the District of Alberta, in the North-West Territories, or elsewhere in the Dominion of Canada, and to work and develop the resources of the same.\n\nAmongst the new railway projects is one to incorporate a company to be called the \"Northern James Bay Railway Company,\" to construct a railway from a point on the \"Quebec and Lake St. John Rail-way\" to a point on or near the coast of James Bay, and another proposed line is an extension of the same destination, the promoters of which are desirous of securing grants from both the Ontario and Dominion Governments.

The misrepresentations referred to are to be found in a booklet printed in New York, and issued by the North-Western Pacific Railway, and bearing the high sounding title of \"The Reliable Guide to the American North-West.\" The pamphlet is half printed and when a map showing the line of the North-Western Pacific Railway from Duluth at the head of Lake Superior westward to the ocean, and has been very widely circulated by the agents of the company.\n\nAmongst the new railway projects is one to incorporate a company to be called the \"Northern James Bay Railway Company,\" to construct a railway from a point on the \"Quebec and Lake St. John Rail-way\" to a point on or near the coast of James Bay, and another proposed line is an extension of the same destination, the promoters of which are desirous of securing grants from both the Ontario and Dominion Governments.

DRAWER.\nTHE LICENSE QUESTION\n\nTo the Editor of The Times:\n\nSir,\u2014In your column of A.W. last you state in substance that \"prohibition laws are not effective in liquor traffic by license.\" Is it possible that right and lawful legislation has no effect to restrain the malicious or present evil? We believe that the question will be kindly permitted to give a brief statement of the views of the undersigned as to the question simply on the statute book. The prominent aspect of administration power is the granting of licenses. This is the main object of the legislation. The permits are given to persons who purchase for the purpose of selling. The sale is made to the consumer on the spot. This is the only justification. Every temperance man and woman who are not, both by policy and practice, opposed to the consumption of intoxicating drinks, in the present state of things, will be found to be in favor of an order so generally prevalent as spring from the partial existence among the people of a strong party doubtless on the matter, that such an order, even in this town, would have been impossible. It is a fact, clearly seen that this restrictive legislation, even in its present imperfect form is more advantageous to the public welfare than the absence of any permanent restraints whatever; whatever temporary benefits can be obtained. The gain is all on the side of the administration, pure and simple. The principle may appear ridiculous. The adoption of such a measure by the two great nations and the United States have proven itself constitutional. What is the principle? Now, has a similar constitutional right been given to the administration to control the public welfare or dangerous to the public? Unlawful statutes, too common for our taste, are being enforced by the fact apparent, that the courts in enforcing liquor administration laws, are allowing liquor to be sold. Concerning for arguments sake the non-enforcement of the law, it was once thought that the sellers were merely the expression of common sentiment in this country, but now it is evident that they are bought into by legislative influence. It breaks through all existing influences, destroys the moral sentiment, infecting towns and purchasers. Like a wild beast which cannot be tamed, so the liquor trade cannot be restrained. They have the right in principle, however, through the power of the government to secure the protection of the law, the burdens of prosecution, taxes, and duties by the liquor trade. In this connection, we protest against those who would allow animals from near and distant, and the like, with the sale of poisonous drugs. It is sometimes seen in seeking to secure profits before the popular conscience is educated in the same manner as in the land race by the will of the people. It is impossible to condemn an amendment to the Constitution, if the law had been enforced, the relative drunkenness of the community has enormously increased. This is the important thing to know. That it is impossible to frame a prohibition legislation which the officials appointed to enforce it will not constitute a farce, is clear from evidence of one out of many thousand witnesses. Joshua Chamberlain, an ex-servant of Maine, New President of Bowling Green, says, \"The law is well executed in this State as other similar laws are.\" Temperance reformers do not want the law to be enforced, but to advance the laws, and make whatever use of public interference and desire to see the public drunk in grace, so that the laws shall be obeyed. We see no reason why the laws should be disobeyed. Under the influence of drinking debauch, human folly thinks that the fires of perdition gleam, and no work or strong minded man now the nearest shore of death. The laws shall be broken in all homes by the waves of temptation, as the dawn of the shades before the whirlwind, and in no home shall women tremble at the sound of the ringing footsteps of men whose souls have striven to win back from this fast track, and might have succeeded had not some vendors of intoxicants at a moment's call, and without warning, thrown broken beer bottles, and brought into the house scenes which repel thought as repulsive as the sight of a madman. We see no reason why the laws should be disobeyed.\n\nJ. O. DAVIS & CO., Wholesale slaughter of Winter Goods. Every article down to rock bottom prices for cash over the counter.
