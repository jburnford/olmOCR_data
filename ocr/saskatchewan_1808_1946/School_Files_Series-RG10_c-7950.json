If permissible, I would suggest giving the building to some members of South Bay Band, who are not allowed to cut timber on the Manitoulin Island Unceded Reserve, rather than accept $15.00 for it.\n\nNone of the Indians have asked for the building, but, I know that members of South Bay Band have difficulty in getting lumber for building purposes.\n\nI would appreciate an early reply, as Capt.

With great difficulty I found an excellent teacher, Miss Pearson, but as soon as she saw the small room that was going to be set together, parlor, kitchen and sleeping room, she would go away immediately. The only reason because the Chiefs agreed to ask your Department for an addition comprising another room and a bed. But the year passed and nothing has been done. Now it has to be done immediately before the bad weather, or the teacher will likely be obliged to move away, being unable to stand any more hardship. I know, dear Sir, what hardship is, having been a missionary for years, and I may tell you that it would be inhuman to let a lady accustomed to comfort in the School of South Bay any longer.\n\nYour Department wants to have good teachers for the Indians schools; but it will be impossible, except if I happen to find one or two of those saints who, for the sake of religion, are ready to sacrifice their life. I may say it in connection with the School of South Bay, of Manitowaning and also to a certain extent of Sagamog. There ought to be warm small\nI have provided with the most necessary furniture, and there is nothing else.\n\nHope, dear Sir, that this state of affairs will receive your immediate attention.\n\nI want a good competent teacher having third class certificate for bushwarming by adding a certain amount to the salary given by the Department. His name is Mr. A. P. O'Malley. But I am afraid that after seeing that there is no pay for him, he may not remain more than a few months. And besides, the supplementary payment that I give him is only for this year, as I may not have the same means next year.\n\nG. A. Arthur\n\nSuperior of R.C. Mission.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 4th August, 1900.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nFather Artus of Wikwemikong calls the attention of the Department to the necessity of furnishing better accommodation for the teacher of the South Bay Indian school and I think that something should be done to fill this want.\n\nMr Inspector Prendergast in his report on this school states that Miss Moore who is at present in charge, is one of the best teachers he has met in our Indian schools. It would be a pity to lose her services and Father Artus states that she will not remain unless something is done.\n\nThe South Bay Indians could afford to pay for an extension to the building and I would suggest that Mr Agent Sims be asked to furnish an estimate of the cost of providing two additional rooms for the teacher's residence.\n\nThe want of accommodation is a great drawback in securing a better class of teachers for schools along the North Shore and where the Indians have money I do not see that it could be better expended than in remedying this defect.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

As for the wages given to me, the salary of Mr. Chief Carpenter and of the apprentices is what I charge to the reserve being for workers that are as I may say of my family. Of the men I have here and the rest at South Bay, the Department will not oblige me to run after them and lose a good deal of time.\n\nBesides it appears to me very strange that anyone should be required to undertake this work. It would be a service to the Indians and become no one else would do it. The building made cost more than the $300.00 paid here and besides I will have to pay more than $50 dollars to bring back here our tugboat that was stolen on the last trip.\n\nHowever if the Department wants it I will have the receipt of the men by and by when I meet them. But being quite what a difference the Department is doing I shall never more do any work on the same conditions.\n\nThe work is done, it is worth the money paid for it.

(RG 10, Volume 6222, file 473-8, part 1)\nof the school faces the road, while the gable end of the house faces the school.\n\nNo diagram shows a plan which would really improve the place in every way, particularly in point of appearance and convenience.\n\nIn No 2 diagram we ask to have the present residence moved back of the school, a distance about fifty-six feet, and a new part built between the school and residence instead of building a new kitchen.\n\nThe school is thirty feet long, eighteen feet wide, and twelve feet high. The perpendicular height of the gable end is a little more than nine feet.\n\nThe house is twenty feet long, sixteen feet wide and the ceiling downstairs is eight feet high. The upstairs is only an attic as it is only six feet in the centre and slants down to four feet on the sides. The perpendicular height of the gable end is five feet six inches.\n\nThe new part to be built we propose to have it ten feet long and eighteen feet wide, and outside to have it as high as the school, but inside the rooms downstairs to be the same height as the house that is eight feet, so as to leave room...\nupstairs for two bedrooms with a window in each and a door opening into the present room upstairs.\n\nIn the new part downstairs we ask for two rooms, one for an oratory with a window in one side, a double door opening into the classroom and one door opening into the other room, which will serve as a waiting room or sitting room. In the latter room there should be two doors, one leading to the kitchen the other outside, with one window on the same side as the outside door.\n\nIt will be necessary to have a stone foundation under the whole building and a cement cellar under the kitchen because the ground is low and in winter we have no place to keep our vegetables and other necessary provisions, and since the Department wishes us to teach cooking we must necessarily keep a larger supply of provisions on hand, as it takes quite an amount to give one lesson every week which will really benefit our girls, they must handle the things themselves, for this we must have ample room and sufficient provisions, as it is now it is almost impossible to do what is so earnestly desired of us, there is only one room twenty by sixteen to live in, and to keep our provisions. It is hard to\nget provisions as the stores are sixteen miles away, and the roads are very bad.\n\nIn proposing this plan we feel confident that the Department can see we only want to show our interest in the work and since improvements are to be made we thought it duty to inform the Department of the present conditions of affairs and make a few suggestions which will enable the Department to understand what is required to carry on the work in accordance with their wishes.\n\nAt the time of Mr. C. L. D. Sim's visit to the school we did not think of the present plan.\n\nWe take this opportunity of thanking the Department for granting a sum of money to be used for prizes to encourage the children.\n\nThanking the Department for this and for all the favors received in the past, and trusting soon to receive a favorable reply.\n\nWe remain,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nMiss K. Olson and\nJol. St. James.\nOttawa, May 26, 1911.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, and in reply I beg to say that you should at your earliest convenience consult with Mr. Agent Sims and lay before him your proposed plans for additional living accommodation at the South Bay school. The Department will write him by this mail.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE.M. McLean\nAst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Zoe St. James,\nTeacher,\nSouth Bay Indian School,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nOttawa, May 26, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nIn official letter of November 3rd, last, you were asked to report fully upon the addition which the teacher of the South Bay school requested should be erected for her accommodation accompanied by a sketch showing the style of the present building and teacher's quarters, as well as the proposed addition and giving an estimate of the cost. Apparently no reply was received to this letter.\n\nThe teacher has now written making a new suggestion in regard to this accommodation and she has been asked by this mail to communicate at once with you and lay before you her proposed scheme. As the season is now advanced it is doubtful whether any extensive work can be arranged for this year. It will probably be necessary to prepare plans and specifications. However, when you report you should go fully into the matter and make recommendations as to the best means of having whatever work is decided upon done. This is a matter which should receive prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. L. D. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning, Ont.\n25th June 1911\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of date 26th ultimo with reference to an addition to the teacher's quarters at South Bay. I have the honor to report that I have talked with the teacher regarding her proposition and I do not consider it would be at all practical to comply with what she asks for. She asks that the residence be moved and placed behind the school, joining the two buildings with an addition of ten feet. To do this the present wood shed would have to be moved as well as the residence and this work would cost considerable in itself and it is altogether uncalled for.\n\nAn addition of the dimensions of 14 X 20 feet with a wood shed 10 X 12 and cellar under the addition complete would cost about $625.00 which would give the teacher and her companion ample room and good accommodation. The above figures are for plastered finish inside, if finished with V joint or V beaded and matched pine it would cost $50.00 more.\n\nTo move the old building back of the school and move the wood shed and put on the addition as asked for by the teacher it would cost approximately $750.00 and they would not have anything like as good quarters.\n\nYou ask for a sketch showing the present style of the teacher's quarters, in reply to this I beg to say that I do not think a sketch would be of any material use to you; the building is just an ordinary square frame building 16 feet X 20 feet with 12 walls 12 feet high.\n\nThe repairs to the school should be attended to without delay, as reported by me last fall the plastering on the inside of the building requires renovating by an entirely new coat of plaster and the outside of the building requires painting. To do these two jobs will cost $143.00 and I would recommend that the necessary authority be given at once so that the work may be finished in the holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You should obtain a more detailed estimate of the cost of having the work done on each of these plans, with recommendations as to whether the work should be done by day labour or by contract. You should also obtain a resolution from the band authorizing the expenditure of a sum of money from their funds to meet the expenses of either plan.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG. L.

I have the honor to refer you to my letter of date 30th June 1910 in which I informed you that I was of the opinion that the South Bay Indians would not pass a Resolution authorizing an expenditure from their funds and since that time I am confirmed in my opinion.\n\nI explained to you in my letter above referred to the fact that there are only a very few children who are members of the South Bay Band attending this school, but that the South Bay Band are educating large numbers of the West Bay children, the South Bay Band are fully alive to this fact and if the proposed improvements to the teachers' quarters are dependent on a Resolution of the\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nSouth Bay Band I am almost positive that they will not be carried out. However, I will submit the question to the band in council at the very first opportunity. It will be some time before I will be able to submit this question to the band in council as the most of these Indians are absent just now and will not be home until some time in autumn.\n\nIf there is any other suggestion that you may have to make in regard to this I will be pleased to receive same.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 1, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your action in letting the contract for the plastering and painting of the South Bay School to Mr. Neil MacMartin for the sum of $145.00 and payment will be made from the school vote.\n\nIn the meantime you should obtain a detailed estimate of having the work on the teacher's residence done, as outlined in the last paragraph of letter of July 5th.\n\nI have also to ask you to supply the Department with a statement of the number of West Bay Indians and Indian children residing in the neighborhood of the South Bay School, with the number of children attending the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nOttawa, Sept. 18th., 1917.\n\nMadam,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 6th, I must say that the department has not as yet decided to make extensive alterations to the teacher's dwelling in connection with the South Bay School. Mr. Sims has been asked to obtain a detailed estimate of the cost of carrying out the plan suggested by you. I may state, however, that a prominent official of the Roman Catholic Church who recently visited the Department represented that at no very distant date a day school might not be necessary at South Bay as there was a probability of the Indians leaving their locations. As you are aware many of the Indians at present attending this school belong to the West Bay Ojibwe Band. If there is any justification for this statement the Department would not be disposed to expend the large sum necessary to remodel the teacher's residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAmt.

I have the honor to report that today I presided at a Council of this Band and was successful in obtaining a Resolution authorizing the Department to repair the present dwelling so as to provide adequate accommodation for the teacher. The minute of said Resolution is enclosed herewith. I have been unable to procure more details as to the proposed addition to the teacher's residence as Mr. McMartin, the only available contractor, has been absent for the whole summer having just returned a few days ago, since which time he has been confined to his bed with a severe illness; however, immediately on his recovery I will go into the matter fully and let you have the details asked for. The South Bay Band do not expect that the expenditure authorized will be to such an extent as to interfere with their usual distributions of interest money and I must say that they have certainly acted very liberal in passing the enclosed Resolution. With reference to your letter of 1st ultimo and more particularly to the final paragraph thereof, same file number, in which you ask me for a statement of the number of West Bay Indians and other Indian children residing in the neighborhood of the South Bay school and the number attending.

This is owing to the fact that at that time no allowance had been made for cementing the cellar and this is indispensable as were not well cemented it would be full of water every spring owing to the nature of the ground and the location of the building.\n\nMr McMartin informs me that he would not care to undertake the moving of the old dwelling as suggested by the teacher as on due consideration he says that the building might not stand moving and he would not care to take the chance of a collapse, besides the work has to be performed in a very out of the way place where it is hard to get in appliances for such work as moving buildings and he says that he wishes to withdraw his former offer. In regard to this I beg to report that I cannot see but that the best way is to build the addition to the present dwelling which will provide adequate accommodation for the teacher and her companion, besides this, there is the question of fire hazard, if the dwelling were joined to the school in case of fire in either cases all would be destroyed.\n\nTrusting I have made matters reasonably clear to you and again wishing to draw your attention to the fact that the other bands whose children are being educated at this school should materially assist in the expenditure and not saddle it all on the poor South Bay Band whose capital, at best, is very small, and awaiting your further instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The authority was given you on October 12th, last, and there would appear to have been delay or the work would have been undertaken last fall. I may say that the Department is surprised to learn that the weather conditions on Manitoulin Island were such as described by you. The season throughout Ontario generally was very open till the end of December. In any event the delay in commencing this work should have been promptly reported to the Department. There has been a great deal of trouble in getting this work so far as the letting of the contract and in the meantime the teacher has to suffer the consequences. If Mr. Martin is not prepared to undertake this work just as soon as conditions will permit in the spring the Department will have to consider taking the contract out of his hands.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputyband Secretary\n\nG.

I note your remarks as to the authority being given on the 12th Oct. last and that there would appear to be delay or the work would have been undertaken last fall. In answer to this I beg to say that there was not any delay. The letter you refer to came to hand on the 14th October, on the 16th October Mr. McMartin was advised, on the 18th October he went to South Bay and let the job to an Indian to quarry and deliver the stone for the cellar and foundation. The Indians did not get the stone delivered on the ground till the 10th November and at this time the weather was such as not to warrant the contractor in proceeding with the work. In order to commence the building it is necessary first of all to pull down an old wood shed that adjoins the teacher's residence. Mr. McMartin consulted with the teacher on the subject and she said that in so far as she was concerned that she would much rather that the shed be left up till spring as should the weather conditions be such as to prevent the completion of the addition last fall the occupants of the dwelling would be very greatly inconvenienced without the old shed.\n\nIt was fortunate indeed that he did not commence as the work could not have been completed last fall.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nWith reference to your criticism in regard to my remarks as to the weather conditions on this island I beg to say that I extremely regret that the Department should have the opinion that I would depart from the truth in reporting any matter entrusted to me. The weather in the month of November was certainly the worst experienced in years. It was winter weather for practically the whole of the month with lots of snow. During December the weather did moderate but at no time during either November or December would it have been safe to start the work and expect to get it finished before the spring. At that season of the year there is no reasonable guarantee that good weather will prevail for any length of time. In so far as the suffering of the teacher is concerned all I can say is that she would have been inconvenienced far more had not common sense been used. I quite agree with you when you say there has been a great deal of trouble in getting this work started and can assure you that your humble servant has done his utmost to get the improvements required for the better accommodation of the teacher. Everything has been done for the best in so far as I am concerned. In reference to the concluding portion of your letter in which you say if Mr McMartin is not prepared to undertake the work as soon as conditions will permit, the Department will have to consider taking the contract out of his hands. I beg to call your attention to my letter of 6th Instant in which I reported to you that he had the material all ready and would commence the work immediately on the opening of Spring. If you have any reason to doubt this statement Mr. McMartin informs me that he...\nwould perfectly satisfied for you to take the contract off his hands, providing you will pay him for the material he has bought and paid for and his labor on the material. In reference to your remarks that the delay in commencing should have been reported, perhaps I did err in not reporting this but I cannot see how it would have improved the situation.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 19, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant in which you explain fully the reasons for the delay in proceeding with the work of repairs and improvements to the teacher's residence at South Bay.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that this work was not pushed to completion last fall, but your explanation of the reason is satisfactory. Mr. MacMartin should undertake this work as soon as weather conditions will permit in the spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. L. D. Sims, M.A.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nExtract from personal letter from Rev. Chas. Belanger.\n\nWikwemikong,\n27 March, 1912.\n\nJust few minutes ago I have had the visit of Mr. MacMartin of Manitowaning, the contractor of the reparations that have to be made at South Bay School, and he told me that it would not cost more to put the ladies' building behind the school than to leave it where it is now, because the foundation of the old building have to be changed, etc. Then I asked him to be kind enough to write the Department to inform him. Because it would be far handier for the teachers to have their building by the school. Would I dare to ask you to be kind enough to get interested in the matter, because you know the life of sacrifice that have those ladies in order to work for these poor Indians. I am sure that if the Department was duly informed of their situation, he would not have the least objection to have the house fixed as they (the teachers) wished to have it and this without any extra expenses.\nOttawa, April 2, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to previous correspondence in connection with repairs to be made to the South Bay School residence I beg to say that in a communication recently received from the Reverend Principal of the Wikwemikong Industrial School he states that on March 27th, last, he had a visit from Mr. McMartin of Manitowaning who told him that it would not cost more to put the residence behind the school than to leave it where it is, because the foundation of the old building had to be changed, etc.\n\nAs you are aware it is the wish of the teachers to have the dwelling so located at the rear of the school building and the Department desires to respect their wishes, more especially as, according to this report, it can be done without any extra expense.

DeSino\nIndian Agent, Manitouining\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of 6th inst., I will say that the Reverend Choo Bellanger must have misunderstood me about the residence behind the school at South Bay Village. I did not state the cost either ways of building but as I told you before that the cost would be greater to move the old building than to build the way we have settled on and about the foundation of the old building there was nothing said and as I have everything on the ground to start forthwith, I cannot see any way to change it and as I said before I would not move the old building. I am sorry the Reverend Choo Bellanger understood me in that way.\n\nI am your Resh,\n\nNeil McMartin\nManitouining\nIndian Office, Manitowaning, Ont.\nApril 8th 1912\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to official letter of date 2nd Inst in which you advise me of the receipt of a letter from the Rev. Belanger in which he states that Mr. McMartin of Manitowaning told him on the 27th Ult. that it would not cost more to put the residence behind the school than to leave it where it is.\n\nI have the honor to report that on receipt of your letter I wrote Mr. McMartin asking him regarding this and under even date he replies as per the enclosed letter from which you will see that there has been a misunderstanding somewhere, this is due no doubt to the fact that the Rev. Belanger does not understand the English language very well. Mr. McMartin has all the material on the ground to do the work as awarded to him last fall and as I informed you in my letter of date 7th October last that he had withdrawn his offer in so far as moving the old building was concerned and putting it behind the school, I cannot understand how anything is to be gained by trying to alter matters now.

As those buildings are on slanting ground, and a high bluff at back of grounds, the soil around the school grounds are always very wet on account of springs. I think the only way would be to have a deep ditch put on the east side and the back of buildings so as to carry any water which may come away from the buildings. The foundation of the school is also being damaged by water and frost fall and winter. If a ditch was used there would have to be about 250 ft. ...... from 7 ft. to 3 ft. deep and filled with stone and gravel which would cost $75 or $80. The drain from the new building will have to be opened up first and made to carry all water which comes into the cellar, which will cost about $15.00 and should be attended to during summer holidays.\n\n(Sgd.)

On arrival it was in such a condition that she says she would have returned if she had the money to pay the driver. She has no furniture except 2 chairs and a table, a cot and bed clothes and a broken stove. In comparison with Miss Lavallee, the teacher at Sturgeon Falls or Kaboni is in Heaven. Miss Lavallee has completed high school education and is much too good for that place. I would rather see her in Kaboni but for some reason or other (I think her people are in Sudbury) she would prefer Whitefish Lake, where Mrs. Lalondeur was last year. Can something be done as to fixing this South Bay to make it a proper habitation for a white teacher? Can she be placed in Whitefish Lake School? Mr. Lewis has fixed Whitefish School like a little palace in comparison.\"\nOTTAWA, Sept. 17th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has been informed that the school and teacher's quarters at the South Bay Indian Day School are in a poor condition and that the teacher's quarters especially are in need of more furniture, bed clothing and a stove.\n\nI have to request that you will immediately enquire into the conditions at this school and furnish a report as to what is required to make it comfortable for the teacher and children during the coming winter. The living quarters of the teacher should also be supplied with a few articles of furniture, bed clothing and the broken stove should be either repaired or a new stove secured.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform the Department as to the various articles required to fit up the teacher's quarters and also give an estimate of the cost of supplying the same. If any minor repairs are required to either the school or the living quarters you should state the requirements and give as full particulars as possible regarding the cost. The Department will expect to hear from by the end of the present month, giving full particulars as asked for in order that any work or articles required can be supplied before the cold weather sets in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6222, file 473-8, part 1)\nSir,\n\nWhen I left your office to come to South Bay, it was with the promise from yourself that I should receive any article of furniture, or other household necessity, within reason, tending to my comfort.\n\nEspecially does a teacher need a little comfort when he sacrifices a better school & larger salary to come to such a place as South Bay, where he is quite alone, and where his friends are his books, and the nearest white people 14 miles away.\n\nI wonder if you realize what kind of a place this is for a white man, and I also wonder whether you realize in what condition this house & school was, if so now, no wonder a teacher will not stay long in such a house.\n\nBut I am not kicking about the school work; I love it, and I am not here for my salary alone, but because I love my work, and believe I should be successful if conditions were made a little more bearable.\n\nThe house wants a few things absolutely necessary to show the Indian how the white man lives.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6222, file 473-8, part 1)\nThe teacher's house should be the centre of the community life here & an example shown in how a person can be clean & neat, but even my windows are bare of blinds or curtains. I should not ask for strips if I had been guilty of breaking them, but they are in the same condition as on Sept 18th last.\n\nThe chair broken, & the kitchen table loaned by the chief here, minus a leg. The only other tables which I have are a small writing table which will not even accommodate my register & my writing table where I keep my books & papers, besides a small table very shaky, where I use as a sideboard in the kitchen. Not a scrap of linoleum or carpet on any of the rooms, no door mat, etc., etc. Surely this was a convent, and as such, was O.K., but I am not a Religious & do not intend living an ascetic life.\n\nThe stove in school is badly in need of renewal, a Waterman-Waterbury would be the simplest & one which I should understand. There is no ventilation in my school, & I am suffering from headaches continually in school, to say nothing of the conditions of my pupils many of whom are suffering from colds & are prevented from attending. There is no intake for fresh air, two foul air registers.\n\nI am really in love with my work, but if you cannot see your way clear to give me a little comfort in hours and reasonable amount of encouragement to pupils at school, I shall have to resign at the Xmas vacation.\nI visited Miss Lavallie's house & school & her house is a palace to mine; why should one teacher have greater comfort than another, especially as Miss Lavallie is not in such an out-of-the-way place as I am.\n\nI have sent in a requisition for just the bare necessities but it has been refused, on what grounds, I know not, presumably because things are being damaged all the time, but I can promise to hand over things just as I found them, or pay for them, if I break them. The damage is done whilst the vaca are on, or when the schools are closed.\n\nSome authority ought to be given to some person to ensure regular attendance of pupils living within the prescribed limits. I have two or three who are kept at home to work, & living only a mile away, & even nearer.\n\nSomething ought to be done to prevent the damage of school property by writing filthy language on the girls' lavatory; this is done by the rough element, usually young men, not under my control; these same young men get intoxicated & have been known to violate school property when Miss Lavallie taught here. One has been very offensive to me already, & I expected to thrash those young fellows & will the law back me up if I do so?\n\nKindly answer at an early date, so that I may be able to decide whether I shall stay on here for a couple of years or resign; believe me, I am in love with my work.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nWilliam W.

Smith and Chapple Limited advise that their tender stands while C. W. Collins Stores state that there will be an advance in prices in mill work.\n\nThe tenders were checked, but we found it difficult to compare them, as the tenders secured by the Indian Agent were not uniform. One firm quoted f.o.b. six different points. Our analysis of tenders may be summarized as follows:\n\n(a) Fellow Supply Company, Chapleau, Ontario quote on thirteen items only, one of which is not included in your requisition. There is no advantage in accepting their quotation as their total price is higher than that of their competitors for the same items.\n\n(b) Chas. W. Collins Stores Limited, Chapleau, Ontario quote on the complete bill of material, but adding freight and increased cost of mill work indicated in their letter of the 27th\nultimo, their total cost is approximately equal to that of the third tenderer (Smith and Chapple Limited, Chapleau, Ontario).\n\n(c) The latter firm quote a firm price, f.o.b. Tophat, Ontario, of $7868.40.\n\nIn view of the above, I suggest that a submission to Council be prepared, recommending acceptance of Smith and Chapple Limited, Chapleau, Ontario, at their quoted price of $7868.40. To facilitate this action on your part, the three tenders are being returned herewith. Kindly send them back when they have served their purpose.\n\nFor similar proposed purchases, it would be in the best interests of all concerned if requisitions for supplies and materials be submitted to this office for the usual action. It is the function of the Purchasing Section to call for tenders. In the case of this Mount Batten school, we would not have limited competition to retail firms in the immediate vicinity.\n\nW. M.

It was not until today that shipments on the above were completed.\n\nI am enclosing checked and corrected invoices along with voucher today.\n\nJ. L.

Please advise if your Division is prepared to assume a portion of the cost if this machine is supplied.\n\nIf your answer is in the affirmative, we propose instructing Mr. Whitney to submit a requisition, indicating thereon the proportion he considers should be charged to Welfare and Education Votes.\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent of Welfare.\nMarch 30, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

As you know, we are only building a one-room Indian day school with attached teacher's residence and therefore presume that our share of the outlay will not be too great. We will be glad to hear from you when the price of the machine is known and Mr. Matters has recommended as to the amount which our Education Vote should bear.\n\nBernard F.

This item does not appear to be listed on the specifications list, but is quite necessary in the construction of this building. This beam is shown on basement plan sheet #1/5 of the blueprint.\n\nOn page 5 of the specifications, it calls for 1800 square feet, 3/8\" thick gypsum board 4\"x12\" for class-room walls and ceiling. This item is not on the purchase order. Also immediately following this item is one for 4000 square feet 3/8\" gypsum board 4\"x8\"; this item was also omitted. Also missing are 8 double hung sash and frames 10\"x12\"-4Wx3H as shown on sheets 3/5 and 4/5 of the blueprint for the school. Those are the windows in the cement foundation. In their place on page 3 of the purchase order, under the heading Basement, is an item: 1 casement sash 10\"x12\"x1 3/8\", 12 lights P.G. R.A.B. and D.M. 3Wx4H. The plan does not call for any such window. It would be suitable as one of the basement windows if it had read 4Wx3H but as supplied it is useless.\n\nI might also point out that on sheet #T-1 of the plan for this school, the sketch of the outside toilets calls for 3 removable windows in each toilet and 3 fixed outside screens. Also for 1 6\" metal roof jack.\nfor ventilator for each building. None of these items appear on the purchase order.\n\nWhen checking this material on its arrival at Tophet, we were, of course, checking against the purchase order and it was not until Mr. Larsen, the carpenter arrived 3 weeks ago, and began checking against the bill of material for this school the above shortages were noticed.\n\nAs the basement windows are all missing, we will not be able to proceed with the cement work without knowing the exact size of the hole to be left to accommodate these windows. Another item needed early in the construction will be the large beam for the basement. In view of this I would appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience as to what steps can be taken to remedy these shortages.\n\nJ.L.

(RG 10, Volume 6222, file 477-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nExtract from Indian Superintendent Whitney's report on his Agency dated July 5th.\n\nOn Mountbatten Reserve, the construction of the school is well under way and I expect the apartment will be ready for the teacher by the 1st of September and the school ready for opening by the 1st of October at the latest. It is expected that there will be about 15 children ready to attend the school this fall. These will be mostly children who have been in residential schools because their families were scattered about where no schooling was available.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Mountbatten Day School.\n\nWhilst I was away on Monday last, Mr. Whitney was in the office and left the enclosed requisition and unsigned contract with some notes regarding them.\n\nIt appears that Mr. Larsen is not willing to sign any contract. He is prepared to work and have the school ready as quickly as possible but due to the fact that the essential materials are not on the spot he is being slowed up now. He has been employed by us for this last five or six years and during that time has done an excellent job and I have no doubt he will do the same with the school if given a reasonable chance.\n\nI see by a copy of a letter to you dated June 16th that the Chapleau office wrote regarding shortages or errors in material ordered. To date this has not been rectified and a whole month has passed. The plumbing items are covered in the attached requisition.\n\nThe letter referred to the Main Beam across the basement; 1,800' and 4,000' Gypsum Board 3/8\"; 8 Sash and Frames for basement windows; Removable Windows and Screens for outside toilets; 3, 6\" Metal Roof Jacks. The basement windows and beam are needed early in the construction. Further to this list, Mr. Whitney advises Sash Balances are the wrong size. The Purchase order not having specified what size was required.\nIn view of the delay in this material, I find it difficult to question the wisdom of Mr. Larsen refusing to sign the contract. Actually, it does not call for either bonus or penalty and most people would sign it without any qualms. However, he is the type that will not sign or even promise anything unless he is fairly sure that he can fulfill the promise.\n\nTo expedite construction I would suggest that the shortages or errors be traced and supplied as quickly as possible. If at all possible, I will try to get to the school before coming to Ottawa on July 26th.\n\nF. Matters,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nc.c.\n\nMr. J.L.

As the work of construction on the Mountbatten school was urgent, we had to begin pouring cement immediately on receipt of the mixer.\n\nRather than delay the project, I took it upon myself to purchase three metal wheelbarrows for cement work. These barrows will of course be used with the mixer on all cement projects and without them we would have had a serious delay on the Mountbatten project.\n\nI would request, therefore, that you approve this expenditure and have the enclosed account paid.\n\nJ.

Please advise if I am to take this as authority to purchase these locks.\n\nRe: Classroom\n\nThe classroom in the above school is nearing completion, but as yet there is no sign of any blackboards having been ordered or shipped for this classroom. These blackboards are not listed on the List of Materials, therefore, I took it for granted that arrangement for their purchase and shipment would be made from Ottawa. Would you please advise what is being done in this matter.\n\nRe: Kitchen Cupboards\n\nThese cupboards were supplied by Smith and Chapple Ltd. from Purchase Order No. 33841. Neither the Purchase Order, nor the Bill of Material, nor the Specifications call for any hardware, i.e., hinges, catches and pulls for the doors and drawers and therefore, they were not supplied. Would you please give me your authority to purchase these items locally as the cupboards are installed complete except for these items.\nRe: Hardwood Flooring\n\nThe Purchases Order did not list nails for the laying of the hardwood flooring for this school. It requires one keg of hardwood flooring nails for laying 13/16\" floor. Please advise if it will be in order to purchase these locally.\n\nRe: Outside Toilets\n\nThe plans for this school call for two outside toilets, but the list of materials do not show any locks or hinges for same. To be properly completed it will be necessary to purchase two sets of door hinges and latches of same description also seven pairs of strap or T-hinges for cleanout doors and boys' urinals. Please advise if it will be in order to purchase these locally.\n\n[Signature]\n\nV. L. Whitney\nSuperintendent\nChapman Agency\n\nJUN/08\nSeptember 22nd, 1949.\n\nMr. J.L.

However, if these have not been supplied I presume it will be necessary for you to purchase them.\n\n(3) Floors - You may purchase an extra keg of nails if these are required.\n\n(4) Outside Toilets - The necessary locks and hinges may be purchased.\n\n(5) Classroom - You might let me know the length and width of the blackboard which you consider should be supplied, and an order will be placed immediately with the Government Stationery Office.\nWhen purchasing the locks and other materials authorized in this letter, it is understood that while serviceable articles should be secured, the expenditure should be kept as low as possible.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\n| DATE   | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|--------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Sept. 16 | Wages paid carpenters on the Mountbatten     |        |\n|        | Day School project, as per return of labour attached. | 740.92 |\n\n516-13-491\n\nTo be charged against cheque # 41706\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, that all the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Neary\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe: Water Pump - Mountbatten Day School\nRequisition attached\n\nWhen this day school was being constructed, Mr. Larson, the foreman, drove a pump point under the large store room in the basement and led a pipe from this up through the concrete floor. Using this source of water, he did a large part of the cement work and he advises me that this source of water is practically inexhaustible, as the point is down below the water line in good water bearing gravel.\n\nAs the temperature in this part of the country in the winter often goes to fifty and sixty below, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to maintain an outside pump. In view of this, I would request that you give this requisition your favourable consideration so that this pump can be installed in the basement of the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. L. Whitney,\nSuperintendent,\nChapleau Agency.\nNovember 30, 1949.\n\nMr. J.L. Whitney,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nChapleau, Ontario.\n\nRe: Mountbatten Day School\n\nWe have your letter of the 24th instant enclosing requisition for a hand operated semi-rotary water pump.\n\nWe are prepared to provide this but we would like to know the cost before giving final authorization. If this pump will cost over $100, it will be necessary to have it ordered by the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nIn that event you should state the price for which it may be purchased in Chapleau and giving catalogue number of the firm from whom the pump could be secured.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nEXTRACT FROM QUARTERLY REPORT OF CHAPLEAU AGENCY FOR THE PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30th, 1949.\n\nRE: EDUCATION:\n\nWith the exception of the blackboards, the Mountbatten School is ready for use. A great deal of difficulty was experienced in getting all the material assembled for the construction of this building. The firm who took the purchase order for this material I feel did a very poor job of supplying. They received this purchase order in August of 1948 and in August 1949 some of the material had still not been received. However, the building is now completed except as noted above. As soon as the new teacher arrives, a number of children who are now in Residential School will be brought home to attend Day School there.\n\n(Signed) J.L.

Young veterans, established under the V. L. A., are settling in the vicinity of Murray Hill. Mr. Arneil drew the attention of our Education officials to the need for a new school there before he left for British Columbia. The Provincial School Inspector and the local Indian Agent have also requested the establishment of such a school.\n\nOur Superintendent of Education has just returned from an inspection trip to Manitoulin Island and has made a thorough educational survey of the area. A site for the school has been selected and we have been fortunate in obtaining a bid from a local white carpenter who will undertake to supervise the construction of a one-room Indian day school with attached teacher's residence. There are enough Indian carpenters, painters, labourers, etc., available to complete this project under his supervision. It is our intention to have the Departmental Purchasing Agent obtain all the necessary building materials and to have this building erected on a day labour basis. It is therefore recommended that you approve the hiring of Mr. M. K. Brown, R. R. 1, Manitouining, Ontario, as a foreman carpenter at the rate of One Dollar and Thirty cents ($1.30) per hour.\n\nFunds for the erection of this school are provided in our Main 1948-49 Estimates.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Immediately upon receipt of notice of any decision of the Minister of Labour hereunder the Contractor shall adjust his contract and the classification of work so as to be in effect to such decision. In case the Contractor shall fail so to do, or fail at any time to pay to any employee or employees for any services performed by them for any hours of labour wages according to the rates fixed in the schedule or fixed by the Minister of Labour hereunder regarding over-time and classification, the Minister of Labour may authorize and direct the Minister to pay any such wages at the rates so fixed and to deduct the amount thereof from any moneys payable by His Majesty under the said contract and say such payment shall for all purposes as between the Contractor and the Government be deemed and taken to be payment to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall be bound in every particular by any such authority, direction and payment as aforesaid.\n\n(3) For the protection of the workmen employed, the Contractor shall post and keep posted in a conspicuous place in each premises where the contract is being executed, or occupied or frequented by the workmen, the Schedule inserted in this contract, also the preceding paragraph (2) and any decision of the Minister of Labour made thereunder.\n\n(4) The Contractor shall keep proper books and records showing the names, trades and addresses of all workmen in his employ and the wages paid to and time worked by such workmen, and the books or documents containing such records shall be open at all reasonable times to the Work Officers of the Government at any time they may be expedient to the Minister of Labour to have the same inspected.\n\n(5) The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of any money which would otherwise be payable under the terms of the contract in respect of work and labour performed in the execution of the contract unless and until he shall have filed with the Minister in support of his claim for payment a statement attesting that he has complied with (1) the rate of wages per hours of labour of the various classes of workmen employed in the execution of the contract; (2) whether any wages in respect of the said work and labour remain unpaid; and (3) that all claims for wages have been adjusted and fully complied with; and in the event of notice from the Minister of Labour of claims for wages, until the same are adjusted. The Contractor shall also from time to time furnish the Minister such other detailed information and evidence as the Minister may require in order to satisfy him that the conditions herein contained to secure the payment of fair wages have been complied with, and that the workmen so employed as aforesaid upon the portion of the work in respect of which the said wages are due have been paid in full.\n\n(6) In the event of default being made in payment of any money owing in respect of wages of any workmen employed on the said works and if a claim therefor is filed in the court of competent jurisdiction, the same shall be paid to the said Minister who in the said Minister may pay such claim out of the moneys at any time payable by His Majesty under said contract and the amounts so paid shall be deemed payments to the Contractor.\n\n(7) The provisions of this clause shall apply to moneys payable for the use or hire of horses or teams, and the persons entitled to payments for the use or hire of horses or teams shall have the like rights in respect of moneys so owing them as the workmen have in respect of wages.\n\n(8) With a view to the avoidance of any abuses which might arise from the subletting of contracts it shall be understood that subletting, other than as may be customary in the trade, without the written permission of the said Minister, shall not, nor shall any portion thereof be transferred without the written permission of the Minister; no portion of the work to be performed shall be done at the homes of the workmen.\n\n(9) All workmen employed on the work herein referred to and to be executed pursuant to the said contract shall be residents of Canada, unless the Minister is of opinion that Canadian labour is not available or that other special circumstances exist which render it contrary to the public interest to enforce this provision.\n\nA.

Please find attached a copy of a letter which we have today sent to the Departmental Purchasing Agent concerning the requirements at this school. You will find the blue-print of the toilets attached to the standard set of drawings for the school. These toilets should be to the rear of the building and approximately 50 to 75 feet away, if possible.\n\nPlease find attached also the Labour Conditions for the construction work on this school. Most of these items do not apply to a one-room school such as at Murray Hill because of the fact that electricians, plasterers, steam shovel engineers, etc., are not employed. It is passed for your guidance, as most of this labour will be supplied by Indians working on an Indian reserve.\n\nAuthority is hereby given for the local purchase of rough lumber and minor incidentals for the erection of a tool-shed at the site of this school. If a further sum is required, could we please be advised. Do not submit vouchers in excess of $100.00 as otherwise a purchase order is required.\n\nBernard F.

We do not appear to have heard of this previously.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nMEMORANDUM: COL. NEARY,\nSUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION.\n\nVacation Pay\n\nWith reference to your memo. of the 5th instant, enclosing extract from a letter received from Superintendent Johnston, this office so far has had no definite information regarding vacation pay except that such an item has been noticed in detail of last plus contracts similar to that for Workmen's Insurance and Workmen's Compensation. The first I recall, and which was referred to you, was the building of the school at Sarnia by Shaw Construction Company.\n\nIt strikes me that this is a matter for administrative decision, and having got into the construction business, is perhaps a matter which you should refer to Mr. Cory with a view to deciding as to whether the Branch is a common employer in the accepted sense. I can, however, tell you of some information I gathered respecting vacation pay in a telephone conversation which I had with the head of our Cost Inspection and Audit Division, and also of a personal opinion in the matter.\n\nFirst of all, it appears that vacation pay is a matter of labour legislation common to most of the Provinces. In Ontario particularly, where the work being supervised by Mr. Johnston is involved, the matter is under the direction of the Industry and Labour Board, Department of Labour, and the Act is identified as \"Act of Work and Vacations with Pay in Industrial Establishments\". The method followed is that the employer obtains special stamps from the Province and affixes them to the book of the workman. This book is carried by him from job to job and at the end of the year, due to the fact that he worked 32 weeks, he is entitled to claim vacation pay from the Province, presumably at some local Provincial Employment Office.\n\nIt would seem, therefore, that if a White man ordinarily employed at his trade comes to work for the Branch from another employer and is in possession of a book, we have no option but to continue making the contributions on his behalf. On the other hand, the question of recognizing Indian labour as being entitled to vacation pay might be far reaching in its effects on the Branch generally. I take it that the Indians could be considered simply as casual labour on the reserve, and it is only incidental that presently they may be employed in the building of a school, having come from doing such work as building Indian houses (which to a very large extent is welfare or relief matter) or from employment on roads, fencing or digging ditches, for none of which I am sure to date the question of vacation pay has ever been discussed.\n\nIf\nIf, therefore, you do not feel like advising Mr. Johnston that Indian labour should not be considered as entitled to vacation pay, I would suggest that you consult Mr. Cory or write direct to the Provincial Department of Labour for a ruling.\n\nWL/S\n\nChief Treasury Officer.\nJuly 8, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

It has nevertheless been settled that Indians when off their reserve are subject to such Provincial legislation as is enacted within the scope of the Provincial legislature; nevertheless the question as to whether such general Provincial legislation applies to Indians while on reserves does not appear to have been definitely determined by the courts.\n\nWith reference to the Ontario Hours of Work and Vacations with Pay Act, I am of opinion that this Act would apply to Indians when working off reserves and would apply to white men when working on reserves, but that it does not apply to Indians working on reserves. An Indian working on a reserve does not normally engage in industry as a means of obtaining a living. The Act in question, in my opinion, is intended to apply to persons regularly engaged in industry throughout the year and is not intended to apply to Indians engaged as casual labourers in the construction of a small building on an Indian reserve.\n\nI would therefore suggest that you advise the Indian Agent that vacation pay is to be given to whites, but not to Indians employed on this project.\n\nI would further suggest that you advise the Industry and Labour Board, Department of Labour of the Ontario Government of this opinion and suggest that if they do not agree with it that they are free to deal directly with this office in further discussing the matter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDepartmental Solicitor.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Johnston, Supt. of Indian Agency,\nManitowaning, Ontario.\n\nFrom his recent visit to several schools in your Agency, Mr. Doucet reports the following:\n\n1. Wikwemikong Indian Day School - The school plumbing is leaking between the two floors above the kitchen. The Agent has been authorized to have this checked immediately and the necessary repairs made. The school roof leaks at two places. The Agent has been authorized to have this thoroughly inspected and have the spots where the leakage occurs re-shingled. This may entail a few shingles or a couple of square feet. However, as it is ruining the ceilings and walls, it was necessary to have this done immediately. Ceilings at the spot of leakage will have to be re-plastered. It is not more than a few square feet at each spot.\n\nThere is plenty of water in the well but apparently the cylinder of the pump is leaking and would need new leathers. The Agent has been asked to have this done. It should entail very little expense.\n\nThe Department confirms the decisions made by Mr. Doucet and wish you to have the above done as soon as possible.\n\nWe have received your wire re the condenser and coil for the electrical plant. These articles have been ordered through Fairbanks-Morse and will be forwarded to you as soon as they arrive.\n\n2. West Bay Indian Day School. - A great deal of the cold air enters the kitchen from the foundation. This should be thoroughly banked with the surrounding soil in the Fall and in the Spring cleared away to prevent the lumber from decaying. Prices should be obtained immediately from an insulation company on insulating the school and residence.\nA storm porch approximately 5' x 6' should be built at the entrance of the second classroom.\n\nThe Department desires you to obtain prices for this insulation at your earliest convenience and also the cost of building the above mentioned porch.\n\n3. Lakeview and Murray Hill - You are authorized to use the rock siding insul brick instead of the red brick for the Lakeview School and if the Company supplying the asbestos shingles for the siding of the Murray Hill School is willing to substitute the rock insul brick, you are hereby authorized to make this substitution.\n\nObtain a contract for the forced air stoker fed heating plant for the Lakeview two-room school and the gravity system with the automatic draft controls for the Murray Hill one-room Day School. Have these contracts sent to this office at your earliest convenience so that the construction of these buildings may not be held up by the heating installation.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSeptember 13, 1948\n\nMr. C.R. Johnston,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n\nWe have your requisition of September 6th for\n40 pupils' desks and one teacher's desk.\n\nYou mark on the requisition \"Equip new school\".\nPlease let us know exactly what school you mean.\n\nBernard F.

Unfortunately, blackboard is in very short supply at present and you can anticipate a delay of several months before this shipment arrives.\n\nWe do not wish, however, to hinder work at this school by failing to provide sufficient blackboards. In view of your knowledge of local conditions, you will be able to decide the urgency of providing this item.\n\nTherefore, if necessary, you can take the following action:\n\n(a) Purchase locally pieces of standard untempered masonite, size 'x' (this costs approximately $3.00 each in Ottawa).\n\n(b) Order quarts of blackboard surfacer from your nearest school supply company (as listed below). One quart of this surfacer covers approximately 60 square feet with the necessary three coats. It dries in one day and can be applied by anyone who can use a brush properly. The cost is approximately $2.50 a quart.\n\n(1) Geo. M.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nExtract from letter dated 8th February, 1949, from Indian Superintendent C.R. Johnston. Original on file 471-10\n\n\"With regard to the five children who proposed to attend Murray Hill School, I have to advise the furnace, blackboard and school desks have not yet arrived. The work was abandoned on January 26th as nothing further could be accomplished until these supplies are available and it is therefore uncertain when the school may be opened.\"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6222, file 479-5, part 1)\n24th February, 1949.\n\nMr. C.R. Johnston,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nManitowaning, Ontario.\n\nWe note from your letter of 8th February, 1949, that you have abandoned work on the Murray Hill School, and that one of your reasons for taking this action is due to the fact that the furnace has not been received. In this connection, I would refer you to Purchase Order 37226 issued on 18th December, 1948, and it is distinctly understood that Mr. Charlton would consult you about the furnace. Have you seen Mr. Charlton, and when does he intend to supply the furnace? Please let us have an immediate answer.\n\nThe blackboards are difficult to secure and there is always some delay in the painting. However, we have been informed regarding temporary blackboards which can be erected easily.\n\nWe are making further enquiries regarding the delay in forwarding the desks.\n\nBernard F.

Johnston,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nManitowaning, Ontario.\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return your Credit Voucher 49-164.\n\nThis Voucher has been reviewed by Treasury and they cannot understand the item of $20.93 which you show at the bottom of the Voucher. They can find no expenditure of this amount, and if wrongfully charged to the advance in connection with the construction of Murray Hill School, and it has been adjusted, the balance on hand should be increased.\n\nIt is also noted that you have taken credit for $17.64 for employer's share of Unemployment Insurance. We cannot find any record in the cash book of any expenditure for stamps during the past two or three months. Please check this Voucher and return with your explanation.\n\nBernard F.

We previously paid several accounts, and as a result, there is only $251.51 unexpended on the above Purchase Order.\n\nIn order to pay the enclosed account we will require authority for an additional amount of $352.56. Indian Superintendent Johnston states that the reason for the increased expenditure is due to the fact that additional materials were required and in a few cases there were increases in prices over the estimated amounts mentioned in the above Purchase Order.\n\nPlease issue authority for the additional amount required.

Galvanized screening is not available and I have ordered the screens made at Bucks in Little Current using bronze screening. Illuminum screening is also available at slightly lower cost but since it is new to the trade here, was doubtful whether I should order it.\n\nI would also suggest that the standard equipment for Teacher's residence be supplied for this school. To date we have only the kitchen range which was purchased locally.\n\nC.H. Johnston,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency.\n\nGRJ:MJN\nMarch 19, 1949.\n\nMr. C.R.

They have promised however to have them here within a few days and it should then take only about one day to complete the installation.\n\nThere is a small amount of work for the Carpenters after the furnace is completed and it is proposed to have Mrs. Agnes Wakegiijig open the school after the Easter vacation.\n\nA set of blackboards came by rail, although I had received no advice from the Department that blackboards were being supplied from an outside source. I had ordered blackboards and trim from L.A. Buck of Little Current early last fall which were delivered only a few days before the other blackboards arrived.\n\nThese can probably be utilized in some of the other schools however, and I would suggest they be retained for this purpose as I cannot ask Bucks to take theirs back since they were ordered especially for this school.\nMr. Charlton's account will be forwarded just as soon as the work is completed and it is assumed the remainder of the Carpenter work will be paid by voucher.\n\nPlease advise at once whether satisfactory for Mrs. Wakegijig to begin duties after Easter vacation.\n\nC.

On making enquiries from the Agent we find that he was under the impression that Vouchers 43-960 for $356.48, 48-1104 for $364.80 and 49-62 for $386.37 were also charged to the above Purchase Order.\n\nHowever, on reviewing our file it is found that the Superintendent did not mention Purchase Order 32638 when forwarding the last three mentioned Vouchers, and consequently, we obtained special purchase orders for them.\n\nWe understand from the Agent that Mr. Charlton has not yet completed the installation of the furnace, and no account has been submitted against the purchase order issued in his favour.\n\nBernard F.

Brown,\nReserves and Trusts.\n\nLakeview Indian Day School.\n\nIt is our intention to erect a new Indian day school on the West Bay Indian Reserve, in the Manitoulin Island Agency. I visited this reserve and selected a site, which should be satisfactory if water can be found. It is approximately two acres in extent and covers the south east corner of the property owned by Andrew Debassige. I can identify this property on a reserve map. Could we please be advised as to what action can be taken to have this property made available for school purposes. I understand that Mr. Debassige is quite prepared to accept our offer of $50.00 for this property.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMr. C. R. Johnston,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nManitowaning, Ontario.\n\nLakeview Indian Day School.\n\nSince my return to Ottawa, I have taken the following steps with regard to the construction of a two-room Indian Day School with attached teacher's residence on the West Bay Indian Reserve:\n\n(a) I have prepared and submitted a memorandum to Council through our Minister's office, for the necessary authority to enter into a contract with Mr. Wm. J. Ferguson for the construction of this building.\n\n(b) I have made preliminary enquiries with regard to the release of the property upon which we agreed to erect the school.\n\nHowever, before any definite steps can be taken with regard to the sale of this property, it will be necessary to make sure that an adequate source of water can be obtained. Therefore you are authorized to expend an amount, not in excess of $300.00, in order to have a well drilled as discussed with you recently. It would be appreciated if we could receive reports upon these well drilling activities as they are carried out.\n\nBernard J.

The Provincial School Inspector and the Indian Superintendent drew to our attention the urgent need for the construction of a school in this vicinity. So pressing was the need for educational facilities that an old Indian house was rented and we now have thirty-four children attending school in this Indian house. There are about another thirty children who are being sent to the Spanish Residential School because of the lack of day school facilities.\n\nOur Superintendent of Education visited this reserve and with Mr. Indian Superintendent Johnston inspected the work being done by Mr. William J. Ferguson on the R.C.M.P. quarters at Manitowaning. It is felt that he has made a good job of this contract and that he would be entirely satisfactory for the handling of the school contract. The attached tender was obtained from him.\n\nI enclose Memorandum to Council for the granting of a contract to Mr. Ferguson, as outlined in his attached tender.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We are also to check with Mr. Farley as to the amount of cement needed for this building.\n\nWe are also to inform Mr. Ferguson of the paint colours which we wish used throughout this building.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to the erection of a new two-room school at West Bay, it was decided on Mr. Neary's recent visit to this Agency to sink a well on the proposed site as early as possible to assure a supply of water.\n\nArrangements have been made with the only available well driller on the Island to proceed to the site this week.\n\nThe cost is higher than expected as the driller claims he must charge $5.00 per foot for drilling and $2.30 per foot for seamless steel casing, the only kind obtainable at present.\n\nIt is hoped we do not have to drill a great distance to the rock which will lessen the cost for casing, however, the driller is making this his first job of the season and we have no alternative.\n\nC.

Our Superintendent there advises me that the Insul Brick is definitely superior, and that he prefers it on many counts to the Asbestos Shingles. It is important, when this insul brick siding is placed near doors at the front of the building, that it be overlapped by covering boards so that\nthe children are not tempted to tear it off.\n\nWe have asked for a stock of blue-prints for this building and will send two additional sets to you for Mr. Ferguson.

The Contractor shall allow them to time further than may be necessary to obtain detailed information and evidence as the Minister may deem necessary in order to satisfy him that the conditions herein contained to secure the payment of fair wages have been complied with, and that the workmen so employed as aforesaid upon the portion of the work in respect of which such claims remain have been paid in full.\n\n(6) In the event of default being made in payment of any money owing in respect of wages of any workmen employed on the said work and labour thereof, the Minister of Labour may, after providing satisfactory evidence to the Minister is furnished, the said Minister may pay such claim out of the moneys at any time payable by His Majesty under said contract and the amounts so paid shall be deemed payments made.\n\n(7) The conditions shall extend and apply to moneys payable for the use or hire of horses or teams, and the persons entitled to payments for the use or hire of horses or teams shall have the like rights and remedies always so owing them as are given to the workmen employed by them in respect of wages.\n\n(8) With a view to the avoidance of any abuses which might arise from the subletting of contracts it shall be understood that subletting, other than such as may be expressly permitted herein, is prohibited unless the approval of the Minister is obtained; subcontractors shall be bound in all cases to conform to the conditions of the main contract, and the main contractor shall be held responsible for strict compliance therewith; no subcontractor on the part of the contractor; the contract shall not, nor shall any portion thereof be transferred without the written permission of the Minister; no portion of the work to be performed shall be done at the homes of the workmen.\n\n(9) All persons engaged in doing the work hereunder intended in and to be executed pursuant to the said contract shall be residents of Canada, unless the Minister is of opinion that Canadian labour is not available or that other special circumstances exist which render contrary to the public interest to enforce this provision.\n\nA.

Ferguson of Mindemoya, Ontario, for the erection of a two room school and attached teachers' quarters on the West Bay Indian Reserve, Manitoulin Island Indian Agency, Province of Ontario.\n\nTHAT this contractor agreed to undertake the construction of the said building immediately on the basis of cost plus ten per cent (10%) providing the said cost does not exceed $30,000.00.

In fact, Mr. Ferguson erected an R.C.M.P. house on Manitoulin Island last year on a cost plus basis and no security deposit was asked nor secured.\n\nIt would now seem that the Auditor General will require in future such a security deposit or a P.C. worded in such a way as to specifically exempt the contractor from the necessity of furnishing such a deposit.\n\nTherefore, the attached Submission to Council has been prepared and is recommended for consideration by the Minister.\n\nDirector,\n\nEncls:\nBFH/HM\n\nIndian Affairs.

Contracts are enclosed herewith for the Director's signature.\n\nWith reference to the water supply at this school, Mr. Ferguson has now had a pump installed in the well and it is found considerable gravel or sand has come up in the casing leaving only six or seven feet of water in the casing. It will only supply one pail of water about every four or five minutes which will, unless it improves, be inadequate.\n\nThe Driller thinks it may improve with constant use; however, I am rather doubtful and unless it improves greatly during the pouring of the concrete, I would suggest trying to have it deepened. The driller claims he had considerable difficulty getting down the last ten feet on account of boulders and caving in. This would appear to me to indicate we are close to bed rock and it may\nbe necessary to drill into rock to get an adequate water supply for this school.\n\nSome water was struck at about fifty feet and I considered by putting the casing too deep, we might shut the water out altogether but I am of the opinion now that it requires deepening.\n\nC.

This matter was discussed with Mr. Matters on his recent visit to the Agency and Mr. Matters is of the same opinion as the Contractor, Mr. Ferguson, that insul brick siding has a tendency to rot the sheathing, that moisture does not escape and Mr. Ferguson is inclined to believe that the insulation would become damp and would not dry out properly with the use of insul brick siding.\n\nI also note that the purchase order issued to Mrs. Anne Buck for Murray Hill School calls for asbestos shingles so that I would be pleased to have it definitely established which is to be used on each school.\n\nI do not like the appearance of a red siding with a blue roof and if it is decided to use the insul siding, I would suggest using a stone block effect which is now available in white and will give a much better appearance with a blue roof than a red brick siding.\n\nIt is also noted the specifications call for urinal troughs and glazed doors on the toilet. I would recommend two upright urinals as much more\nsanitary and the cost will be only about $15.00 higher. I would also suggest there should be no glass in the toilet doors.\n\nMr. Ferguson has written twice to the Cost Audit bureau for the necessary forms to apply for progress payments with no results.\n\nWill the Department please forward these to Mr. Ferguson immediately?\n\nG. R. Johnston,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency.\nOttawa, August 16, 1948.\n\nMr. C.R. Johnston, Supt. Indian Agency,\nManitowaning, Ontario.\n\nRe: Lakeview Day School.\n\nThe bill of material for the Murray Hill School called for asbestos shingles while the Lakeview School has been changed to insul brick. We have had considerable trouble with the breakage of asbestos shingles and decided that they were not satisfactory for school purposes, hence the change. You will, therefore, proceed with the brick insul for the Lakeview schools.\n\nIt is apparent that blue will not match very well with red. However, the shingles can very easily be changed into green or green and red tint. There should be no difficulty as far as the appearance of the school is concerned.\n\nThe other matters can be taken up with Mr. Doucet when he is down there some time in the near future.\n\nEnclosed please find the necessary forms for progress payments.\n\nA.J.

D. Wilson, who is doing the concrete work on this school.\n\nMr. Wilson is Agent for the Lindy Fence, and is an expert at erecting wire fence. I would recommend using cedar posts for gates, and corners set in cement with the intermediate posts of steel. The cedar posts soon rot off at the surface of the ground, unless set in cement.\n\nMr. Wilson makes a very neat job. He would charge $1.00 per hour for his own time, and would employ all Indian labour.\n\nThe fence is the best grade obtainable, all No.9 wire, ten wires horizontal, and sixteen wires vertical to the rod. I do not know just what the cedar posts will cost, but they will be purchased from the Indians, and I am enclosing a requisition for the other material to be purchased from Mr. Wilson.\n\nI did not get an estimate from Mr. Wilson on cost of labour, but would put it roughly at $100.00, and would recommend having Mr. Wilson do the work, and be assured of a good neat job.\n\nAs I have had some complaint from Mr. Debassige about horses gaining entrance to his farm through the opening at the road, I would recommend having the fence erected with the least possible delay, and would request an advance of $100.00 to pay for labour.\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent Indian Agency\n\nIndian Affairs.

Johnston,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency.\nMr. C.R. Johnston, Supt. of Indian Agency,\nManitowaning, Ontario.\n\nFrom his recent visit to several schools in your Agency, Mr. Doucet reports the following:\n\n1. Wikwemikong Indian Day School - The school plumbing is leaking between the two floors above the kitchen. The Agent has been authorized to have this checked immediately and the necessary repairs made. The school roof leaks at two places. The Agent has been authorized to have this thoroughly inspected and have the spots where the leakage occurs re-shingled. This may entail a few shingles or a couple of square feet. However, as it is ruining the ceilings and walls, it was necessary to have this done immediately. Ceilings at the spot of leakage will have to be re-plastered. It is not more than a few square feet at each spot.\n\nThere is plenty of water in the well but apparently the cylinder of the pump is leaking and would need new leathers. The Agent has been asked to have this done. It should entail very little expense.\n\nThe Department confirms the decisions made by Mr. Doucet and wish you to have the above done as soon as possible.\n\nWe have received your wire re the condenser and coil for the electrical plant. These articles have been ordered through Fairbanks-Morse and will be forwarded to you as soon as they arrive.\n\n2. West Bay Indian Day School - A great deal of the cold air enters the kitchen from the foundation. This should be thoroughly banked with the surrounding soil in the Fall and in the Spring cleared away to prevent the lumber from decaying. Primes should be obtained immediately from an insulation company on insulating the school and residence.\nA storm porch approximately 5'x6' should be built at the entrance of the second classroom.\n\nThe Department desires you to obtain prices for this insulation at your earliest convenience and also the cost of building the above mentioned porch.\n\n3. Lakeview and Murray Hill - You are authorized to use the rock siding insul brick instead of the red brick for the Lakeview School and if the Company supplying the asbestos shingles for the siding of the Murray Hill School is willing to substitute the rock insul brick, you are hereby authorized to make this substitution.\n\nObtain a contract for the forced air stoker fed heating plant for the Lakeview two-room school and the gravity system with the automatic draft controls for the Murray Hill one-room Day School. Have these contracts sent to this office at your earliest convenience so that the construction of these buildings may not be held up by the heating installation.\n\nBernard F.

Johnston,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nManitowaning, Ontario.\n\nWe have received the quotation on the installation of the heating system at Lakeview Indian Day School. We wish to submit the following for the consideration of the contractor:\n\n1. We do not favour the iron fireman as a stoker. It is a soft coal burner and has caused considerable trouble in homes using them. Here, I refer to reports which I have received from people using them in Ottawa. We definitely prefer the anthracite coal stoker. Enclosed you will find literature describing the Volcano anthracite stoker. The Ottawa representative has written directly to the company to find out if they have any representative in Little Current. If not, we will make arrangements so that Mr. Charlton may obtain one. The stoker uses buckwheat, white ash, the coal that does not clinker. I feel certain that this type can be obtained in Little Current. The pit below the furnace makes cinder removal more convenient.\n\n2. In looking over the plans, we have noticed that it is going to be rather inconvenient to control the heat in the various sections. By this we mean the two classrooms and residence. Each of these three sections should be separate and controlled preferably automatically by means of electric dampers. You can see the necessity of reducing the heat in the classrooms over the week-end and for holidays. On the other hand, it might prove necessary to reduce the heat in the living quarters during the day. This can be efficiently done only by means\nof these automatic controls and the installation of a thermostat on each of these sections. That is, one for each classroom and one in the living-room of the teacherage. The increased cost of this installation should not exceed $150. We do not know whether the furnace dealers in Little Current are familiar with this system. It is rather a simple system and is similar to the automatic control in the smoke stack.\n\n3. The implementation of the above would require a different division in the feed ducts from the furnace. One duct should go to the residence and branch off. Another duct for the classroom should branch off so as to isolate each room. The contractor will readily see the necessity for this.\n\n4. We look favourably on the idea of the duct above the blackboards. We would greatly prefer to have these heating ducts in the partition. We realize that this could not be done in the cloakroom but we believe that other simple arrangements could be made for them even putting them in the floor if no other alternative were possible. We realize that the heating Engineers must have some reason for heating the classrooms in this way but we can not readily see this reason. Should it be impossible to carry out our instructions on this point, we would not be too insistent upon it.\n\nWe are prepared to endeavour to obtain from our Purchasing Branch, the seventy-five sheets of galvanized iron (3 ft. x 8 ft. 26 gauge) but to do this it will be necessary for the contractor to delete from his contract the price of this material. Otherwise, it would be difficult for us to obtain priority.\n\nWe are returning the blueprints so that the plumbing, heating contractor can take note of the various points mentioned above and return to us if possible by return mail his new contract price so that we may submit it over to Head Office for approval.\n\nEncl:\n\nBernard F.

The plans give most of the information that I believe required to explain the proposed installation. This has been drawn up in accordance with the latest air conditioning practices and can be relied upon to give perfect satisfaction.\n\nOur estimate includes material as specified in the specification sheets of the Indian Dept. In regards to quality and gage of metals to be used, we ask the privilege however, of using aluminum sheets of not less than 26 gage, in the event that galv. iron is not available in sufficient quantity. This of course would not be used for smoke pipes or plenum chambers.\n\nThis estimate acknowledges the requirements generally laid down in the department's specifications covering heating.\n\n1 only #1034- J Gurney steel furnace with square casing.\nB.T.U. at bonnet ........... $450.000\nB.T.U. at register .......... $360.000\nDia. furnace body .......... 34\"\nSmoke pipe Dia. ............. 10\"\nCasing size W.08\" L.36\" H.71\"\nWarm air outlet size ....... 24x20\"\nShipping weight .............. 16,40 lbs.\n\n1-# 20 Fan unit correct size for the furnace.\n60 cycles, single phase, 110 volt motor.\n\n\"IRON PYRAMID\"\n\nStoker 12 feet long, D.I. 50\", long. Will handle up to 60 lbs of coal per hr. Includes all automatic controls for both stoker and fan, with room thermostat.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6223, file 480-5, part 1)\nPrice includes a complete installation ready for service and any adjustments necessary for a period until the installation is correctly adjusted and set to perform automatically efficient.\n\nWe agree to supply all material and perform all work that has to do with the installation in question. To perform the work neatly thoroughly, and for safety, correctly insulated ducts where necessary. And to clean up after the work is completed. For a total sum of $2800.00 Twenty Eight Hundred Dollars.\n\nI respectfully submit this estimate for your consideration and acceptance.\n\nYours Very Truly\n\nVernon W. Charlton\n\nP.S. Kindly return the blue prints as early as possible as this is the only copy we have. V.W.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI acknowledge receipt of Department Letter No. 480-5 (E.2) dated November 22, 1948 with reference to installation of heating system at Lakeview Indian Day School.\n\nI have taken up with Mr. Charlton the suggested alterations and enclose herewith his revised tender.\n\nWith reference to having the heating ducts in the partitions, as the gyproc is already installed, it will be difficult to carry this out, but you will note Mr. Charlton's suggestion that these be installed on the basement ceiling and insulated with asbestos.\n\nMr. Charlton has also requested 150 sheets of galvanized iron which is intended to take care of both schools. This will of course be deducted from the contract price if supplied by Department.\n\nIt would be advisable to have purchasing agent secure this as otherwise we will have difficulty obtaining it.\n\nC.

We can supply the \"VOLCANO\" anthracite coal stoker which will operate on American \"White Ash\" rice or buckwheat coal. The manufacturers recommend for this installation Model J.E.R. 40 which is a hopper type having a 40 lb. capacity. Instead of the iron fireman mentioned in the original quotation.\n\nAt the moment we have very little information on the automatic electric damper controls. However, I believe they are available. And I will arrange to install one for each main lead in conjunction with a room thermostat for each class room and teachers quarters. There will be an additional charge for this of $150.00.\n\nWith slight alterations we will be able to separate the leads or feed ducts to facilitate each class room and teachers quarters being separately controlled by above mentioned automatic dampers regarding the duct shown along the wall of the class rooms. I believe that we can change this, and have it run under the floor of the class rooms. That is against the ceiling of the basement, but in the same general location in relation to the class rooms wall. Risers can then be brought up through the wall and outlets installed in the baseboard under the blackboards at floor level. The same number and size of outlets can be used and located at intervals as shown on the blueprints, but in the baseboard. If it is preferred, the registers can be located in the floor rather than in the wall. In either case the duct will require to be well wrapped with asbestos to reduce radiation and draft loss. This will involve extra labour and insulation in the ductwork.\n\nRegarding Galvanized sheets, we will require 150 sheets 36\"x 96\" X 26 gage instead of the 75 previously mentioned. Due to the fact that supplies I have been expecting to have available are not forthcoming, it will require this much material to make these installations.\n\nThe above changes and additions as mentioned above, in accordance with the suggestions of the department, (all other requirements of the contract to remain in the original letter and quotation) will be installed and installed for a total sum of $2975.00 TWENTY-NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-FIVE DOLLARS. The price of 150 sheets of any amount under this figure may be deducted from the quoted price, if they are supplied through the department.\n\nYours very truly,\n[Vernon W.

It has been suggested that the chimney be moved slightly to one side although Mr. Charlton advises that this can possibly be avoided.\n\nIn a previous letter, I was requested to advise when this school would be ready for occupancy but with the great delay in obtaining quotations on the heating, it is difficult to estimate when the building may be completed.\n\nMr. Charlton has requested to have the blue prints returned as this is the only copy supplied to him by the Gurney Foundry so perhaps copies can be made at Ottawa and return the original for Mr. Charlton who has spent a great deal of time and effort in trying to get a plant to fill the requirements.\n\nMr. Charlton also requests that the Department endeavour to get seventy five sheets of galvanized Iron for the heating in the two schools if he is awarded the contracts. He expects to give a quotation for Murray Hill School in the very near future.\n\nC. R. Johnston,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nDecember 7, 1948.\n\nMr. C.R. Johnston,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nManitowaning, Ontario.\n\nIn reply to Mr. Charlton's remarks re the forced air heating for the Lakeview Indian Day School, I wish to make the following observations:\n\n1. In this paragraph he states he can supply the Volcano anthracite coal stoker. I hope that he will find it possible to install this on the side of the furnace and provide an ash pit below the furnace.\n\n2. We are endeavouring to obtain for him some information on the automatic electric damper controls. As soon as we have received this, we will forward it for your information. The price of $150. is acceptable.\n\n3. Mr. Charlton's suggestion of running the duct above the blackboard below the floor is acceptable. The outlets should definitely be in the baseboard and not in the floor. His increased price of $25. for insulation is reasonable.\n\nWe are today sending a requisition for 150 sheets of galvanized iron or if it cannot be obtained, we are authorizing substitution of aluminum sheeting.\n\nBernard F.

Other supplies were quoted on by C.W. Hinds and S.W. McPhee of Manitowaning.\n\nThe requisition is enclosed herewith and I would recommend immediate purchase of the articles listed as the furniture can be transferred to the new school when completed and Mrs. Gingras is greatly handicapped in the present school.\n\nC.

J. Ferguson has estimated the cost for Lakeview School at approximately $75.00 installed and the amount for Murray Hill School would be somewhat less.\n\nI would consider it very essential to have eave troughing installed particularly since the basement windows are close to the surface of the ground, as otherwise these windows will be spattered with every rain.\n\nI would be pleased if the Department would advise the colours to be used for interior work both in class-rooms and residence.\n\nC.

We decided that we should put one strand of barbed wire over the fence to keep the horses from reaching over it and ruining the fence.\n\nAll the necessary material has been purchased and a voucher is attached covering the materials purchased. However, there will be more labour on the fence in the Spring as it could not be entirely completed until the Frost is out of the ground.\n\nG. A. Johnston,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI wish to draw attention to the matter of supplies being shipped in for schools of this Agency.\n\nQuite frequently supplies for schools at West Bay, Sheshgwaning and Sucker Creek Reserves are addressed only to myself at Manitowaning and are delivered to this office by the transfer that carries all freight for Eastern Manitoulin with the result they have to be re-shipped sometimes at considerable expense.\n\nIt is therefore very important that the name of the School be designated, particularly for those schools West of Little Current as all freight or express for those schools should be delivered by another Transfer Company and if the name of the school is indicated, it is easily determined which Transfer should make delivery.\n\nI wish particularly to refer to Purchase Order No. 34332 and 34334. The Teacher's Desk has already been delivered to the Residence of the contractor, Mr. W.J. Ferguson of Mindemoya and has to be returned to Lakeview School. Although the chair desks have not yet arrived, it is noted shipping instructions were identical with that of Purchase Order No. 34334.\n\nI would suggest that the name of the school be designated in all cases which would eliminate a great deal of confusion here and unnecessary expense.\n\nG. R. Johnston,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency.\n4th February, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nRe: Purchase Order 33637\n\nIn connection with the above, we have received the following letter from Superintendent Johnston:\n\n\"We were unable to obtain cedar posts and have had to use steel posts which are more expensive, but makes a much better job. We decided that we should put one strand of barbed wire over the fence to keep the horses from reaching over it and ruining the fence.\n\nAll the necessary material has been purchased and a voucher is attached covering the materials purchased.

As you know, the original Purchase Order was issued for $186.90 and the account requests payment of $245.90.

It was also considered advisable to have one strand of barbed wire on top to prevent livestock reaching over. The steel gate posts and corner posts, although more expensive, make a much better appearance and will last much longer than the cedar post.\n\nIn connection with this job, I would point out that out of the $100.00 allotted to pay labour, $21.00 was returned, but there will be a little work to finish up next Spring after the frost is out.\n\nG.

(RG 10, Volume 6223, file 480-5, part 1)\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Lakeview Indian Day School\n\nThere was no provision made in the electrical contract for heating of water by electricity on construction of the above school and the only alternative is to have a range boiler attached to the kitchen range.\n\nWe find the kitchen range furnished by the Eaton Company is not fitted for this and it will be necessary to get the water front for this range at a cost of $7.35.\n\nIt is a Huron Range and is listed in T. Eaton Co. Spring Catalogue under No. 056-5015.\n\nSince the water is from a deep well and likely to be very hard water, there may be some difficulty with the waterfront lining up quickly and should always have a spare one on hand.\n\nI would suggest that a water front be supplied as early as possible for this range.\n\nC. A. Johnston,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency.\n17th March, 1949.\n\nMr. C.R. Johnston,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nManitowaning, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant, the Department approves the purchase of a waterfront for the range at the Lakeview Indian Day School. It is noted that you can secure this at a cost of approximately $7.35.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n17th March, 1949.\n\nThe Ahearn & Soper, Ltd.,\nP.O.

I would suggest that Mr. Strang be asked to communicate with us around the middle of May at which time we should be in a position to give him a fairly accurate forecast with regard to the breakup at Bearskin.\n\nIt is estimated that we will require an advance of $2,000 to complete the building at Bearskin and to purchase a few of the essential furnishings.

These will be for your seasonal schools and I will ask the Indian Superintendents concerned not to ship in any but sound desks.\n\nIf you would write me concerning the addresses of the schools, also the numbers required, I will instruct the other Indian Superintendents to have these desks shipped in so that they can go by tractor train.\n\nBernard F.

Pikangekum Post, c/o Patricia Transportation Company, Red Lake Road, Ontario, (C.N.Rly)\n\nDeer Lake - 30 desks - to be shipped addressed to Indian Day School, c/o L. Tapper, Red Lake, Ontario, c/o Patricia Transportation Company, Red Lake Road, Ontario. These should also be shipped about January 1, 1950.\n\nBearskin - 40 desks - to be addressed to Bearskin Indian Day School, c/o H.B.C. Bearskin, c/o Johnson Transport, Ilford, Manitoba. This shipment should arrive Ilford early in January.\n\nDue to lack of storage space it would not be advisable to ship desks for other proposed schools until the buildings have been completed.\n\nIn our Estimates for 1950-1951 we showed an amount of $100. for purchase of desks and seats from Berens River Mine, at Favourable Lake. I understand that all the equipment remaining in the school there, including desks, can be bought for approximately $100, and I would suggest that it might be more satisfactory and also economical to acquire this equipment than to have it shipped in from outside points. If you would approve of the purchase I shall be glad to go into the matter at the first opportunity I have in the vicinity of Favourable Lake.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sandy Lake is situated approximately 360 miles north of Sioux Lookout. No reserve has been surveyed or set aside for these Indians. This band is one of the largest and most self-sustaining in the agency. There are no school facilities provided and the Indians are anxious to have their children receive an education. There are approximately 100 children of school age. Requests have been received from missionaries and representatives of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church for the establishment of a school. The Agent states that a building 22' x 30' with a lean-to 18' x 22' would be sufficiently large to accommodate the children and house the teacher. The building would be of log construction and the Indians would do all the work, if rations were supplied them. The Agent states that he is sure the cost would not exceed $1,200.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPAY TO: Canadian Pacific Airlines, Limited,\nAirways Building,\nADDRESS: Winnipeg, Manitoba,\n\nDATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT\n---|---|---\n1948, July 31 | Transportation Charges - School Supplies shipped from Dep't Printing, Ottawa, for Sandy Lake Day School. | 9.45\n\nI hereby Certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\n\nVoucher No.: \nDate: August 21, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Chiefs considered it will not cost over $50.00, but according to the arrangements, they hope to make, I am convinced this will not be sufficient, they hope to have a band, and provide for their guests, they hope to have present, the Supt. General of Indian Affairs and other representatives of the Department, the Minister of Education of the Province and many others.

At the present time the roads are almost impassable, the scholars attending Thomas' School one and one-half mile from the new School would not be able to attend at the present time, besides the new School has not being fully seated on account of an error of James Smart Co. of Brockville, but the balance of the seats have been shipped which are expected daily. The blackboards which were ordered last summer have not all arrived, the slate for one Board is here and the other is shortly expected, until these are completed, I submit it is not wise to close Thomas' School.\n\nThe Chiefs at a Special Meeting held yesterday decided to engage Miss Pearl Hill, at $20.00 per month to assist Mr. Clark until the School is completed and then Mr. Miller take charge of the Junior branch, Miss Hill agreeing to do this until Mr. Miller or any other Assistant is duly appointed, she having passed the entrance examination to the Collegiate.

J. Clarke and J. Miller, Teachers, Ohsweken School. Will report under separate cover.\n\nE.D. Cameron,\nInd. Supt.\n\nThe Sec'y,\nDept. of Ind. Affairs.\nSir,\n\nThe Chiefs at their Council meeting on the 6th instant decided to increase the salary of Mr. John Clark, Senior Teacher at the Chawaken School to $400.00 per annum, and Mr. John Miller Junior Teacher to $350.00 per annum. I beg to report on these separately.\n\nMr. Clark is the Head teacher of the Chawaken School, this is the largest attended school on the Reserve, he has been most successful since his engagement as teacher a few years ago. He has been offered a School in Haldimand at $400.00 per annum and should he leave the Reserve it will be difficult to procure a teacher satisfactory to the people. I beg to recommend that you approve of the Chiefs' decision to fix the salary of Mr. John Clark at $400.00 per annum from the 1st of October.\n\nAs to the increase of Mr. John Miller, Junior Teacher, I submit requires careful consideration. Mr. Miller has been engaged as a Teacher at Thomas' School for some years at a salary of $362.50 per annum, he was quite successful. When the Chawaken School was completed, Thomas School, where Mr. Miller was teaching was closed, he was then offered the position as Junior teacher at the Chawaken School under Mr. Clark at a salary of $300.00 which was approved of by you under cover of August 21st last File No. 1866 which was accepted by him. Mr. Miller has no teaching qualification whatever, all the other schools on the Reserve where they have qualified teachers receive $300.00 per annum, they have full charge of the school and the attendance and responsibility much larger and greater.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6223, file 483-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nthen Mr. Miller will have their salaries are fixed at $300.00 per annum.\n\nThe Chawaken School is under the control of the Chiefs, while the other schools are under the control of a School Board. If Mr. Miller as Junior Teacher at Chawaken is to receive $300.00 per annum, it is not fair to the other teachers to receive but $300.00, whose responsibility is much greater.\n\nThis is one of many difficulties that has to be considered with when the schools are managed under different boards; dissatisfaction is sure to result and I believe education will be seriously affected. I most earnestly trust that the Department will seriously consider my recommendation to the Department, that all schools on the Reserve should be under one Board. And in the meantime you will not approve of Mr. Miller's increase, as he is now receiving the same salary as is paid any teacher under the School Board.\n\nI would suggest that I be instructed to notify the Council that after the expiration of the ensuing year, the schools would be under one Board and that the Department will be represented by Mr. W. Wilkinson, Revs' R. Ashton and J. L. Strong with myself, and that the Chiefs will appoint their representatives. If they appoint more than three as formerly, you can consider the advisability of adopting the increase, but nothing will be said as to the number they are to appoint.\n\nEach teacher will report to the Indian Office, the weekly attendance and all minutes of meetings of the School Board will be laid before the Council for their consideration before action will be taken; this will give the Chiefs full control of the schools. I am satisfied that the Council through this Board will be able to satisfactorily arrange the educational matters on the Reserve.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6223, file 483-1, part 1)\nOTTAWA, 5th November, 1903\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith reference to Mr. Supt. Cameron's letter hereunder in which he recommends that the increase in the salary of the assistant teacher of the Ohsweken public school of $50.00 per annum, which was approved by the Six Nations Council on the 7th ultimo, be met approved by the Department, I beg to say that Mr. Cameron states that it would be unfair to the other unqualified teachers on the reserve, who are in charge of schools, to pay Mr. Miller, who is only an assistant and has not any teaching qualifications a higher salary than they receive. Although Mr. Miller may not hold Provincial qualifications, he has had twenty years experience as a teacher and had charge of the Thomas school until it was closed, when he accepted the position of assistant teacher at Ohsweken. His salary at the Thomas school was $362.50 per annum, and if the Indians are willing to give him $350.00 at Ohsweken, I think that his success and long service would entitle him to this amount.\n\nThe qualified teachers on the reserve to whom Mr. Cameron refers as receiving lower salaries are birds of passage, filling in their time to qualify for a higher grade certificate.\n\nMr. Cameron again calls the attention of the Department to the difficulties that have to be contended with when the schools are managed under two...\ndifferent boards, and suggests that he be instructed to notify the Council that after the ensuing year the schools are to be under one board. As the two boards do not work harmoniously, Mr. Cameron thinks that there should only be one board for all the Six Nations schools and that the Indians should not have sole control of any one of the schools, or the Ohweken school in particular. When Mr. Cameron was here in the early summer with Rev. Mr. Ashton, he urged his views on the Department that there should be but one board and the Indians should not have control, as they would use their power for their own purposes and not for the educational benefit of the band.\n\nOn the 28th Jan., last I prepared a memorandum on the application from the Six Nations Council for the appointment of Trustees to manage the Ohweken school, which takes the place of the old Thomas school which was under such a management. On this you ruled that as the Indians appeared to have managed the school well, they should be allowed to continue, and Mr. Supt. Cameron and the Chiefs were so advised. Mr. Cameron wishes to have this ruling reversed and perhaps Mr. Scott who visited the reserve recently could give you the pros and cons of the case.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Miss Terrance will be graduated from our four year Normal Classical Course on February 7th; she wishes to be appointed a teacher in the Indian School at Chawaken, and is anxious to begin work as soon as possible after her graduation.

The Principal of the State Normal and Training School, at Potsdam, also wrote to the Department on her behalf. Both these gentlemen have been advised that there was no vacancy at present. In the meantime I wrote to Mr. Agent Long to find out whether Miss Terrance was a Canadian Indian. His reply has been received, in which he states that she is not a Six Nations member of the band under his charge.\n\nIf she is an American Indian, as Mr. Long's letter would indicate, I do not see how the Department could employ her, as there should be no need of going out of the country to engage teachers. If you concur in this view of the case, I would suggest that the Minister of Education, who has again written on the subject of her appointment, should be so advised.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Chief Johnson was anxious to accept Miss Terrance's application notwithstanding that she is a Roman Catholic. However there were very strong objections offered by some members of the Board. Besides she is a member of the St. Regis Reserve of the United States.

The Junior Department of this school was vacant last summer when the teacher Miss Shaver resigned on account of ill health. Since then temporary teachers have been employed. The Trustees advertised for a teacher for this Department but received no applications. After the Christmas Holidays Mr. Asa Hill was temporarily engaged. Chief Johnson a member of the School Board reported that Mr. Asa Hill a lad some 18 years of age is not a satisfactory teacher and therefore recommended that the Board endeavour to procure a more efficient teacher after this quarter. This will give Mr. Hill a full month's notice, that his services will not be required. The Board after considering Chief Johnson's report decided to endeavour to procure a more suitable teacher for this Department and appointed Mr. Standing, Chiefs A. G. Smith, J. S.

Smith,\nSup't.\nReport of the Six Nations Night School - 1912.\n\nRemarks.\n\nLast year the night school was attended by male pupils only; this year several young women were among the most regular attendants.\n\nThere are, however, several young people, mainly youths, in the vicinity, who, for some inexplicable reason show an aversion to, or, more correctly speaking, a negligence in attending the night school. It is clearly understood that the conduct of the pupils has been so decorous that the slightest mention of discipline has never been necessary; and also that the method of treating the various subjects has been made congenial to all by avoiding such recitations and questioning as might in any way be embarrassing to the unlearned or most sensitive pupil. The only solution for the apparent apathy of the indifferent ones is, that they have inherited some of the aboriginal characteristics of their forefathers, by which the youths, after expending their energies during the day in playing with each other in the ancient game of \"Snowsnake,\" choose to spend their evenings about the store of the village store playing the \"Lagoo.\"\n\nBut since education has never completely revolutionized any nation in a decade, the time must be bided.\n\nDuring the season just closed the weather was extremely severe and oftentimes very inclement; still the attendance and interest in the work never flagged, but rather increased as the season advanced. The assiduity of some was marvellous.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Smith, Esq.\nIndian Superintendent\nBrantford, Ont.\nIndian Office,\nDecember 6th, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nWhen I reported the minutes of the last School Board meeting, I stated that an investigation was to be made on the 25th of November, in reference to a charge made in council that John Clark, teacher at No. 2 school, was guilty of selling intoxicants to Indians. This investigation was held and there being no proof that Mr. Clark was guilty of the charge, the Board passed a resolution to that effect which was read to the council. I beg to enclose a copy of the proceedings of that date. In reference to Mr. Clark it appears as if there was considerable dissatisfaction in Chawken about him. He has unfortunately got mixed himself up in matters outside his business as a school teacher and has accordingly placed himself open to much criticism with a result that very many parents in that school section do not wish him to remain any longer as a teacher. It is true that as a teacher he has given good satisfaction and on that account the school Board has not felt it necessary to ask for his resignation. He has asked the Inspector to investigate two complaints, one in regard to the improper execution of the contract for repairing his house and the other in regard to the charges of Chief Jonathon. This can only result in increased dissatisfaction on the part of the parents of his pupils and consequently reduce his influence as a teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nSupt.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nCheweken, Nov. 25th., 1913.\n\nInvestigation into the charge made by Chief Lawrence Jonathan against John Clark Teacher No. 2 School for selling liquor to Indians.\n\nA meeting of the School Board was held at No. 2 School.\n\n1.

He was asked to make this statement by David Hill this was about two weeks ago and the charge is based on what happened two or three years ago. To Mr. Clark I never did anything to get you off the reserve David Hill at the time he got me to bring this up in Council he said he would get three witnesses to prove this viz. Enoe Hill, David Hill and Albert Hill. I got the notice from Surt. Smith I never heard about investigation until last Saturday.

The liquor was brought Mr. Clark never sold me any liquor and I have never seen Mr. Clark sell liquor to Indians. Mr. Clark gave me liquor when he had a heap there were five or six people there and they all got liquor then. The man who got the money to get liquor with and who got the liquor was Albert Hill.

Hill\n\nGordon J. Smith\nA Commissioner\n\nThat the members of the Six Nation Indian School Board having fully investigated the charge of selling whisky to Indians made by Chief Lawrence Jonathan (in open Council) against John Clark teacher in S.S. No. 2 Ohawken, fully exonerate said John Clark from guilt reference to said charge condemn in most mistakenable the practice of making defamatory charges on hearsay evidence further we request that the Chairman of the Board read this Resolution in open Council before the School Board on adjournment and that a copy of the evidence be forwarded to the Department.\n\nMoved by Mr. Parks\nSeconded by J. S. Johnson\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy-Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn the 18th ult., I received notification from Deputy Mr. Gordon J. Smith, Brampton, that a charge had been made by Chief Lawrence Jonathan in the Six Nations Council that I had been selling intoxicants to the Indians on the Reserve, and that the School Board would investigate the said charge on the 25th ult. at Ohsweken.\n\nI met the School Board upon the day set and found that Chief Lawrence Jonathan had been made a tool of by three malicious and unscrupulous Indian Brothers viz., David S. Hill, Albert E. Hill, and Erno Hill. It was simply a diabolical conspiracy, the nature of which I will give after stating the case:\n\n1. The informer knew nothing but hearsay and even then perjured himself in attempting to screen himself from being implicated in the collective manufacture of the case.\n\n2. David S. Hill knew nothing but hearsay.\n\n3. Albert E. Hill's evidence was not taken because David S. Hill had left the place of investigation contrary to the resolution and desire of the investigation committee and conversed with Albert Hill who then came in to testify.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6223, file 483-1, part 1)\nEnos Hill did not put in an appearance at all.\n\nThe School Board passed a resolution exonerating me and condemning such practice of defamation.\n\nAs to the motive for the conspiracy:\nDuring the time I inspected the schools of the Reserve I observed and learned:\n\n1. Mr. Alvin J. Scott, a young man who had for years taught No. 9 School with success and satisfaction was, about a year ago, subjected to complaints that he was too intimate with certain Indian women. Mr. Scott wrote to Capt. Smith asking for an investigation which was never given. He left the Reserve shortly after with the stain upon his character although those who knew him best believed him to be guiltless of the charge. There was also some shadowy manipulation about Mr. Scott's salary.\n\n2. Mr. Jas. A. Keays, B.A., taught during the Sept.-Dec. term of 1912 at No. 7 Six Nations School. Members of this same Hill family and another (Jamieson) family circulated stories of Mr. Keays' immorality with Indian women. He left at Xmas. Mr. Keays afterwards wrote to me from Toronto saying that he had not received his salary in full.\n\n3. Mr. A. J. Abbott, assistant teacher at No. 2 Six Nations School up to June 1913, was...\nan experienced and energetic teacher.\n\nAt the June (1913) meeting of the Six Nations School Board, Chief Hilton M. Hill, clerk at the Indian Office, Brantford, and a brother of the three who were to testify against me, attempted to interpose some gossip complaints about Mr. Abbott. The board appealed to me, being present, for explanation. The complaints were not in any tangible form when I asked for them; in fact were just in the \"weaving\" and being totally unfounded were not entertained.\n\nA few nights after, David J. Hill, above mentioned, apparently in a well-advanced state of intoxication appeared on the street close to my residence and in the presence of several persons, railed at Mr. Abbott claiming that he was unqualified, incapable etc., and also assailed me for defending him in the School Board meeting. Mr. Abbott left. (It is significant that Mr. Abbott, like myself, was a married man and the charge of trafficking with Indian women would not suit as well as in the case of the other (single) victims).\n\nMiss McPherson, an excellent teacher, at No. 1 Six Nations School up till June 1913 found that her sojourn there was to be very unpleasant if not intolerable. Upon her advent, the keys of the desk, cupboard, and school house were missing. Her predecessor was Mr. Roy Hill, son of Albert E. Hill above mentioned. The same trick was perpetuated on another...\nincoming lady teacher at another school\nto which Mr. Hill was transferred for a\nfew months. Miss McPherson found open\ndefiance coming from a family of Hill's\nrelations and from a Jamieson family.\nThe tone inside and outside the school\nwas anything but agreeable, needless to say she left.\nShe was succeeded by Mr. Elmer Jamieson,\nson of the Inspector of Works, and I might\nadd he being untrained and unqualified,\nis to be paid a salary One Hundred and Fifty\nDollars, in excess of what is authorized by\nthe Six Nations Council.\n\nIn each of the above mentioned\ncases where qualified, (or experienced and\nsuccessful) teachers were removed, there was\nan axe to grind.\n\nTo return to my own case.\n\nIt is very obvious that the present\nor recent persecution is but another step\nin the deliberate campaign of vilification\nwhich is being waged upon this Reserve,\nas even the children upon the streets here\nare talking of their new teacher after him,\nMr. Jamieson (son of the Inspector of Works).\nTheir plan is temporarily frustrated although\nDavid S. Hill in his drunken hours is prophesying\nmy removal.\n\nIf I do wrong I ask no undue palliation\nbut I most strenuously resent with righteous\nindignation such an attempt as this malicious\nconspiracy made of whole cloth.\"\n\nYours truly,\n\nJohn Clark\n\nP.S.

In any event the School Board and the Six Nations Council will both be pleased to hear that he has left the reserve and certainly all the officials connected with the office and Council House will be pleased as he has been the means of making very much trouble and discord for more than a year past.

Alexander teacher at No. 2 School, I beg to report to you as follows:\n\n(1) I quite agree with her that the school should be made more attractive by providing swings and other playground articles. The School Board has always provided foot balls and base balls when asked for by the teachers; but as the grounds at this school are large it would be advisable to provide more amusement.\n\n(2) The annual school fair is to be held this year.\n\n(3) At a recent meeting of rural school trustees held in Brantford several of the Indian trustees were present and there was a discussion in regard to providing hot lunch at country schools. It was pointed out that a grant was available from the Provincial Educational Department to assist the schools in providing hot water heating appliances and many of the Inspectors present strongly recommended the installation of these articles. I was not aware that the majority of the pupils at this school\n\nThe Secretary:\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nbrought their luncheons but for those who come a long distance especially in the winter time, the hot drink at noon would be beneficial both for their health and their work.\n\n(4) There has been for some time an agitation for continuation classes at Ohsweken as every year more Indian children are attending High School but so far not many have matriculated as they generally stop before reaching that stage. For that reason the high school work for the first two forms might be very well taught at Ohsweken.

A.F.B.\nSir,\n\nThere is a matter I feel should be brought to your attention respecting the action of our local School Board at its meeting here a few days ago. There were applications for increases in salaries from the teachers of the Ohsweken School (No. 2) and the majority of those members present felt that this increase was not only much deserved but quite necessary in these days of H.C.I.H. There were four Indian members of the Board present and three White, besides the Chairman, Mr. Gordon Smith. The White members abstain on principle from voting on financial questions. One of the Indian members was in a rather delicate position as he has a daughter a teacher, so I suppose he felt he could not vote. The other Indian didn't vote as it came about that two Indian members were the only voters at all and they both refused the increase asked.\n\nNow the point is that we are unfortified here with a serious position. This is the Chief School on the Reserve and if these teachers resign as they probably will if the increase is not granted, it will be extremely difficult to get anyone at all\u2014even at a much higher salary than that asked for and even if we could get teachers at this increased rate there is grave doubt that we could not get teachers of the efficiency, knowledge and\n\nIndian Affairs.

The great majority of the Parents have been so much encouraged in their hopes for the schools' present helpfulness to their children if changes were necessary. It is hard enough at any time to get the parents' interest in the schools, how much more so when they have teachers in whom they have confidence.\n\nIt would probably be disastrous to run risks of wasting their interests.\n\nI know that the other white members of the Board agree with this opinion and I am almost certain that the two Indians who have voted do also, so I venture to ask that before rejecting this application for increase that the opinion of the Chairman, the School Inspector, and the members of the Board be asked.\n\nI feel that it is my duty to bring the matter before you as the education of our children here is of such importance.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. A. Paget\n\nPoveshuken\n\nChairman of School Board.\nJuly 10, 1920.\n\nDear Mr. Paget,\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant with reference to the action of the Six Nations School Board in regard to the increases in salaries asked for by the teachers of the No. 2 school.\n\nI am asking Mr. Superintendent Smith for a report, and I hope that we will be able to adjust matters to the satisfaction of all interested.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. E.A. Paget,\nOnweken, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6223, file 483-1, part 1)\nJuly 10, 1920.\n\nDear Major Smith,\n\nI have received a communication from Rev. Mr. Paget regarding the matter of increases to the teachers of No. 2 school, which was under consideration at the last meeting of the Six Nations School Board.\n\nI have not yet received the minutes of the meeting, and thought it advisable to communicate with you in the meantime. Mr. Paget represents that the increases were refused, because the white members of the Board as well as one of the Indians refrained from voting. I wish to give the most sympathetic consideration possible to applications from deserving teachers, and I hope that we will be able to adjust this matter satisfactorily.\n\nKindly let me have your report.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMajor Gordon J. Smith,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nIndian Office, Brantford,\nJuly 14th., 1920.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have received your letter of the 10th inst. in regard to increases to the teachers of No. 2 School.\n\nMiss N.M. Alexander is drawing a salary of $725.00 as teacher of the senior class No. 2 School and her sister Ethel Alexander is drawing $600.00 as the junior teacher. Both these teachers have been with us for over six years and Mr. Standing the Inspector always speaks most satisfactorily in regard to their work; but of recent years an agitation has been stirred up against them, partly, of their being mulattoes and partly through personal grievances of some of the parents in that section. A petition was presented to the Board asking for their dismissal and a counter petition was presented asking that they be retained. Part of the trouble I believe is that the junior teacher Miss Ethel Alexander has been taking a very active part in the work of Mr. Paget's church the Anglican Church and has been taking her pupils to the church during the noon hour which has been resented by some of the parents. The majority of the people in Chawken and neighborhood are not Anglicans and naturally did not wish church matters introduced amongst the children. I think the teacher\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nhas not offended recently, as I took the matter up with her and pointed out that her actions were not satisfactory in this respect.\n\nA brother of these girls Arthur is the teacher at No. 7 School, he was drawing $750.00 and applied for an increase of $150.00 but was granted only $75.00. He has since sent in his resignation as he has an offer in his home neighborhood of a salary of $1100.00, but he was most anxious to stay here providing he got an equal amount, which the increase asked for would have given including his bonus. I might further say that since the meeting of the Board I discussed the matter with the Inspector and he stated that he noticed a slight falling off in the energy of these two teachers, they did not seem to have the same enthusiasm as they had when they first began the work, this might possibly be accounted for by the knowledge that there was an agitation against their remaining. If these three teachers leave I do not see how we are going to replace them with qualified teachers without paying $900.00 or $1000.00 at least as that is the rate of salary prevailing in the white sections.\n\nWhen advertising for new teachers in order to arrange for their salaries, I would like to know if the present bonus of $150.00 will continue for the next school year.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt.\nJuly 27th, 1920\n\nDear Major Smith,\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant with reference to the increases to the teachers of No. 2 School. In view of your report I am not disposed to interfere with the action of the school board. It seems to me, however, that all the members of the board should make themselves heard on important matters of this kind and should not refrain from voting. The appointment of teachers and salaries to be paid are among the most important items that come before them for consideration.\n\nWith reference to the bonus, it will be continued during the present fiscal year up to the 30th April 1921. What provision Parliament will make for next year I am of course unable to say.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMajor Gordon J.

If this is correct, I presume she will start at $1000.00 per annum.\n\nAs Miss Jamieson will be away for a further three months I would ask the Department whether it is intended to grant her sick leave on full pay for this period, which including the time of her absence while in the Hospital, will amount to about four months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt.

The Tuscaroras and other Indians of the State of New York are opposing the rights of Canadian Indians who are descendants of the New York State Indians, so he wrote Delegate and attended the meeting in 1838 at Buffalo Creek when the treaty was signed. There are also women members of the Tuscarora band of this Reserve, who have married members of the Lewiston band N.Y., who have ceased to be members of this band who have forfeited all...\ntheir rights to the distribution of lands and other benefits here, but whom the Tuscaroras at Seneca N.Y. refuse to place them on their enrollment. The Six Nations Council therefore request that the Commissioner of Indian Affairs might be pleased to place these people and their children on the roll in like manner as the Canadian Government does with women coming from Seneca and other Reservations in New York State and marrying into our band. Women coming from Reservations in the United States marrying into Six Nations band become together with their children full members of the band, and are entitled to share equally in lands and annuity money, the same as other members of the Six Nations in Canada.\n\nThe Council then adjourned until next general Council on Tuesday 3rd of December next at 10 O'clock A.M.\n\nI hereby certify that the above is a true copy from my minute book.\n\nJosiah Hill,\nSec'y S.

The Council also instructed the Inspector of Works to prepare Plan and specifications for outer buildings for the School and to inquire as to price of a large Bell and report at a subsequent Council, as soon as these are received will fully report to you.\n\nSteel Bridge across McKenzie Creek.\n\nThe late Chief Jonathan was granted by the Chiefs the contract for the erection of a Steel bridge over McKenzie Creek for the sum of $1850.00. Mr. Robert Martin, a responsible mechanic of the Reserve has undertaken the erection of this bridge at the late Chief Jonathan's price.\n\nMr. Henry Bunning and Mr. David Fish former tenderers were present. Mr. Bunning offered to build the two piers and do the grading required for $925.00, the Hamilton Bridge Co.'s price for the bridge manufactured by them is $935.00, making the total cost $2570.00, but the Chiefs would consider Mr. Bunning's offer, he is not a mechanic and do not consider him in any way responsible. Mr. David Fish, a practical mechanic and stone mason member of the Reserve, has frequent contracts for the surrounding municipalities building bridges, but he would not agree to build the Bridge for less than $2300.00. I enclose Mr. Robert Martin's offer and beg to recommend that his offer be accepted.\n\nI am\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt.\nnecessary to engage others. The Council decided to leave the matter in the hands of Mr. Augustus Jamieson, Inspector of Works, he being a practical mechanic is well able to see the building completed according to plan and specifications. I beg to recommend that you approve of the Chiefs' decision and have the building completed under the supervision of Mr. Augustus Jamieson.\n\nSchool Desks\u2014\n\nThomas' School on the Reserve, which under the control of the Chiefs is furnished with desks purchased from the Canadian Office Furniture Co., Preston. These desks are in good condition, the Chiefs decided to purchase whatever desks may be required for the new School House from this Company. As they will remove the desks from Thomas' School to the one now in course of construction. There were several tenders submitted to the Council from various firms and their prices were the same, the double separate desks being $4.70 each. Until the present desks are removed it is impossible to say the number required, as the desks selected are most modern. I beg to recommend your approval.\n\nFurnace\u2014\n\nThe Chiefs decided to purchase a \"Buck's Furnace\" manufactured in this City, which is the best furnace manufactured in Canada, the specifications does not provide for a furnace. I beg to recommend your approval of the Chiefs' decision and have a Buck's Furnace placed in the School House. I am not able to report the size required for the size of the building. The Chiefs preferred the Buck's Furnace which will be cheaper in having one purchased here than from any other firm out of the City.\n\nWell.\nSir,\n\nI regret to report that Chief Levi Jonathan, contractor to erect a new School at Chawaken as well as the building of a Steel bridge across McKenzie Creek, on returning home from this City on the 9th instant was killed by lightning on the highway about one and a half miles from the Council House. A special Meeting of the Council was called on Tuesday last 16th instant to deal with affairs.\n\nChief Levi Jonathan was concerned in effecting the Reserve, and to enclose minutes:\n\nThey appointed Chief Levi Jonathan's widow, who is on the list as Ida Jamieson, Administratrix of the Estate, as she is familiar with his affairs and anxious to carry out his wishes in every respect. I beg to recommend that you approve of same.\n\nSchool House\u2014\n\nThere has been paid on account of the contract price $1857.63, I am responsible to Schiltz Bros. for all material from their factory which is required to complete the building for the sum of $1800.00, there are also some outstanding accounts which I am responsible for.\n\nTo complete the building it will require, according to the estimate of the Inspector of Works some $600.00, which includes plastering, cement floor in basement, painting and carpentering, which it is hoped will be completed within the contract price. Had Jonathan met not with the accident he could have completed the contract for less than the contract price, as he was one of the best mechanics on the Reserve and would have completed the painting and carpenter work himself, while now it is nec-\n\nThe Secretary\u2014\nDept. of Indian Affairs\u2014\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He had a contract for building the new schoolhouse at Ohweken and a portion of the work still remains to be done. The Council decided to let the Inspector of Works, Mr. Angus Johnson, complete the building and the Agent recommends that this should be done.\n\nI think the Department should approve of this recommendation.\n\nIn his letter the Agent also refers to the resolution in regard to the purchase of school desks to complete the equipment of the new building which the Council wish to obtain from the Canadian Office Furniture Co., of Preston, Ont., whose prices are satisfactory. With regard to the purchase of desks I may mention that directions have been given by the Deputy Minister that all such articles required for schools in Ontario are to be procured from the Jas. Smart Mfg. Co., of Brockville. Is this order to apply in this case? Preston is much nearer to Brantford and the freight charges would be considerably less.\n\nThey also wish to purchase the furnace and pump for the school at Brantford.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Cameron, Esq.,\nSuperintendent Indian Office,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have thoroughly examined the new School Building just completed at Ohsweken and must say that both in construction and materials used it is far superior to the general run of work of this class. I might say that great credit reflects on your inspector Mr. Jamieson, with whom I had several interviews during the progress of the work, and believe that the best interests of your people have been well looked after by his constant attention to the important parts of the building, which perhaps might have been neglected to some degree by a foreign inspector.\n\nHoping this will be satisfactory,\n\nI am your obedient servant,\n\nGeo. W. Hall\nThe manual labour at construction is now completed according to the terms of the late land settlement, which has agreed to complete for the sum of $4905.00.\n\nI received from you the following amounts:\n\n- Cheque No. 1208, April 10th, 1908: $1000.00\n- Cheque No. 1209, May 10th, 1908: $1000.00\n- Cheque No. 1210, August 30th, 1908: $700.00\n\nI request you to pay the following amounts:\n\nMay 15th, 1908: $1200.00\nAugust 30th, 1908: $1975.70\n\nI now submit receipt of the balance of $2600.00, with vouchers.\n\nI also enclose the report of Mr. O. Hall, the architect, who assures us that the building is well built, possessing all the specifications and most satisfactory. He also attests that the tender of Mr. Johnson at $4000.00 is substantially low and in no other respect is there any building so erected for less than $4000.00, while our expense does not include the heating or lighting, which I will submit under separate cover.\n\nI am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs.

W. Hall, the Architect, he advised that a fire at once be started and kept in the new School. At the same time the building occupied as a School at Ohsweken was badly in need of repairs and was uncomfortable for the scholars. In order to save the expense of keeping two fires in two buildings, the School Trustees in consultation with me as well as a number of the Chiefs, thought better to have the benches now used at the old School at Ohsweken removed to the new building where School could be held in one of the rooms, which would be comfortable for the scholars, thereby saving the expense of keeping fire in the old School at Ohsweken. Coal was ordered from here; the above accounts include the expenses of teaming coal from here to Ohsweken over 10 miles and transferring the benches from the old School to the new one.

General Indian Agent\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to bring to your attention the account of Messrs. Bennett & Son, contractors of Brantford, for recent repairs to No. 2 school here, and the unjust actions of the Six Nations Council who have attempted to reduce the account under the control of a number of selfish people both within and without the council.\n\nThese contractors had been engaged to repair St. Peter Church here and had given such good satisfaction that I thought it was advisable after getting the advice of several other members of the school board including Mr. Deputy Smith to have them repair our school here instead of employing the local jacks of all trade and masters of none.\n\nThe council has during recent years authorized Inspector & Works Augustus Jamieson to have necessary repairs done to this school but it has been neglected except odd jobs given to his friends such as he did the year before.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6223, file 483-5, part 1)\nWhen the Hill Brothers (or some other name) tore up & rebuilt a flight of outside steps & other such jobs. These very steps were tottering and about to fall down shortly after they finished them so that I had to order the teacher to keep the children off them and use another entrance. The building needed painting outside wood work and at the one corners the heaving of frost and settling had cracked the brick wall badly. The walls and ceiling had not been as much as whitewashed in over ten years. The closets had been rebuilt by Hill Brothers but were improperly done. In fact the whole building was in a disgraceful and dangerous condition.\n\nThe work was done by Bennett & Doulton and the whole building inside and out has been put in excellent condition which was seen by Mr. Charles Gibbon, Inspector of Indian Agencies, on his recent visit when he commented favorably upon the work.\n\nThe fault\u627eers both within and without the council, some of them being officials are under the control of a few who are\nare jealous, because they are not receiving the benefit because not fit to do the work. They have reduced other accounts to try to discourage any work being done except by them\u2014selves while their accounts when they do anything are not allowed to be questioned. When this account was presented it was not dealt with in our general council before Capt Smith but was dragged along to gain time for trouble making through several adjournments of the council. They have appointed a special committee to inspect\u2014and value the work who are ready to do their bidding and have circulate false reports charging all sorts of wrongdoing among those prejudice as the contractors are while men and also attempt to raise a feeling among my brother chiefs to have me dismissed from my chiefship. If it is possible I would like to have this whole matter thoroughly investigated before Inspector Mr Gibbon or some other such authority. If that be not possible I would recommend that Bennett & Harken be paid for the work as I have requested.\nit closely and feel that it is entirely satisfactory and the prices reasonable.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Speaker\n[Signature]\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to our conversation of the 24th inst. re our account for work done at the Chawken School.

The account has been before the council one or two occasions and on the 20th of January was passed at $250.50 although the original account called for $409.75. The circumstances in connection with this matter so far as I know are that for some time the School Board desired to have repairs made to this building but for various reasons the Council never took the matter up seriously, but only would do a little patch work from time to time. These contractors last fall were doing work in Chawaken on St. Peter's Church and Chief Johnson suggested to me that while they were there, they attend to the repairs required at No. 3 School and I advised him to do it, never thinking that such extensive work would be done as Mr. Johnson ordered. When the account came up, the first objection made to it was the board bill amounting to $54.50 for the men working on the job. Chief William Smith was instructed by the Council to ask Mrs. Johnson how much she received for the board. Her daughter turned up the account in her book and stated it was $29.50 for board while working on the school. She had another account for board while working on the church. This discrepancy was sufficient to make the council closely examine all the items of the account and the Fire Inspectors, David General and Robert Duncan Scott, Esq.,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6223, file 483-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nRobert Martin, the latter of whom is an experienced contractor, were appointed by the council to examine the work done and report. This report I have to enclose in which they value the labour, material and board at $250.50. I have also had a visit from Mr. Borden in which he claimed that the whole account was absolutely correct that good value was given for material and work and that he actually paid Mrs. Johnson $54.50 for board.\n\nA good deal is mentioned by Chief Johnson in his letter to you which I do not think is borne out by the facts. It is stated that the Inspector of Works neglected attending to this school unless he was able to give the job to his friends the Hill brothers which I am sure is not correct. It was the Council's neglect more than the Inspector's that matters were allowed to go so long without being settled. Some years ago Mr. Inspector Borden pointed out that the school needed attention. I submit that it would have been better had Mr. Johnson called for tenders for the painting of the building but that he was just in having the steps and doors repaired at once and the wall in one corner were the rain was loosening the mortar also repaired.\n\nIn conclusion I am of opinion that the Council reduced the account by too much as the work appears to have been well-done and the building looks very much improved by reason of it.\n\nI am\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt.\nOFFICE OF THE\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nFOR ONTARIO.\n\n441832\n\nMr. C. Scott\nDeputy Dept. General\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of January 15th in reference to an account of Bennett & Boardman for repairs to the school at Ohsweken. This matter did not come before me while at Brantford over the Repairs to the Teachers' House & School. I have now sent your request for this account. I noticed that repairs were being performed at the school and found they were authorized by the School Board. Members of the Board were with me when I visited the school. Referring to the matters investigated, I might say I have just read the evidence on Saturday last.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I will also report on my return about other matters at Muncey.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nCharles Macdonald\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nBennett & Bowden account.\n\nThe Council of the Six Nations on Aug. 9th, 1913 authorized certain repairs to a number of schools on the reserve among the number being school No. 2, and a list of the repairs considered necessary, made out by Messrs Jamieson and Hill, which, however, does not mention all the repairs actually done, is also on file. This was approved by the Dept. on Aug. 15th.\n\nThe next correspondence is an extract from the minutes of a meeting of the Council of Jan. 6th., 1914, when the Council again postponed consideration of the account for these repairs made by Messrs Bennett & Bowden, but instructed the Fire Inspectors to examine the work and account and report. This they did at a meeting on the 29th. Jan. 1914. Their report stated that the charges were excessive, and after much discussion the Council unanimously decided to confirm this report. The original account was for $409.75, and the Inspectors cut it down to $250.50 - a difference of $159.75.\n\nChief Johnson, writing on Jan. 23rd. through Mr. Cockshutt, charges the Council with unduly cutting down the account, and gives as reason for their doing so the opinion...\nthat the Council took this means of discouraging the giving of work on the reserve to white men. He stated that the Council during the last few years had authorized the Inspector of Works to have odd repairs made to the school, and these jobs had gone to the friends of the Inspector, with the result that the repairs had been both insufficient and badly done.\n\nMr. Superintendent Smith in his report of Feb. 2nd, gives his opinion that a good many of the statements made by Mr. Johnson could not be borne out by facts. He points out that one item in the Bennett & Bowden account is for $54.50 for board. Mrs. Johnson, when asked how much she received, finds only $9.50 while Bennett & Bowden were working on the school,- but Mr. Smith adds that there was a further amount (he does not say how much) for board during the time the contractors were working on the Church. The contractors claim that the whole of this amount was paid Mrs. Johnson, and ask that the account be investigated, as good value had been given for material and work.\n\nThe Superintendent submits that the Council had done only a little patchwork from time to time, and that though it would have been better to call for tenders for painting the building, Mr. Johnson was justified in having the steps, doors and wall repaired immediately. Mr. Smith states in conclusion that the Council had reduced the account too much, as the work appeared to have been well done, and the appearance of the building was much improved in consequence.\nOFFICE OF THE\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nFOR ONTARIO.\n\n442260\n\nRe: assist deputy Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nSw:\n\nEnclose File #184853-5a\n\nYour obedient servant,\nCharles Macdonald\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nIndian Office, Brantford,\nJune 25th., 1912.\n\nMoved by Mr. Park and seconded by Chief Lottridge that this School Board accepts with much regret Mr. Standing's resignation and in the meantime till some definite arrangement of the matter may be found Mr. J.

CARRIED:\n\n[Signature]\n\nfrom Minute Book / S.W. School Board.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Office, Brantford, Ont.\nDecember 17th, 1913.\n\nJOHN CLARKE\n\nRe Lawrence Jonathan's Charge.\n\nThe following is the evidence as taken before Mr. Charles McGibbon, in the Indian Office, Brantford, Ont., on December 17th, 1913, at 2:30 p.m.\n\nCOUNSEL: Mr. W. A. Hollinske, for Plaintiff.\n\nEVIDENCE\n\nMr. John Clark, sworn, examined by MR. HOLLINSKE:\n\nI am a teacher on the reserve. I was appointed 14 years ago. I have been teaching there ever since with the exception of four months. For a year and four months I was Inspector of Schools on the Reserve. I am not Inspector now. The School Board relieved me, for reasons best known to themselves. I had ten or eleven teachers under me; some were qualified and some were not. I believe Mr. Scott's case was the first one there. He was there at the time I took charge. He was a very successful teacher. He was not qualified; he had two or three years experience. There were some complaints about him. He has sent in an affidavit here. (Reads). A year ago today I believe I attended a meeting of the Six Nations School Board, and heard the resolution moved, seconded and passed that that increase began the 1st of January. I have also letters from Mr. Scott that he was subject to damning complaints, and he asked for an investigation that was never given. I claim that this persecution was brought upon for a purpose since a friend of Chief Hilton Hill's was put in the school since he left. I believe A. O. Smith is the Secretary of the School Board, and that that resolution was passed a year ago today. Scott left because they did not carry out the recommendations of the School Board, and Miss Russell, a lady who lives close to the school, took his place.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6223, file 485-5, part 1)\nI do not know that Miss Russell is any relation of the Hilla.\nShe is not a qualified teacher.\n\nThe next case was that of Mr. James A. Keen, a qualified\nteacher. (Minutes read) We have four witnesses here to\nprove that that was passed on, and that it has been tampered\nwith, and that the people of the Indian Office can best tell whose\nwriting it is. As Mr. Scott says, he left because he did not\nget his raise. The actual motion was that they were to\nreceive their increases dating January 1st; until that was\ntampered with I believe it would show it.\n\nA. H. Lottridge, sworn, examined by Mr. HOLLINRAKE:\nI was a member of the School Board in 1912, and attended\nthe December meeting. There were increases asked for a couple\nof teachers, Scott and Lickers. It was moved that each teacher\nshould have their salary increased, and it was carried; that\nmeeting was in December, I think. I heard the applications.\n\nMeeting December 17th.\n\nMR. McGIBBON: It was not mentioned about having\nit referred to the new School Board. I am sure of that.\n\nRobert Martin, sworn, examined by MR. HOLLINRAKE:\nI was a member of the Six Nations School Board in the\nyear 1913; I remember the meeting at which the applications\nof Mr. Scott and Mr. Lickers were put in. There was some\ndiscussion as to Lickers, and the opinion was that none done down\nthere could fill the position as well as he could; he had been\nteaching for some time, and the Board decided to increase his\nsalary. Mr. Scott's salary was also raised. It was decided\nat that meeting when the raise was to start. It was carried\nat that meeting.\n\nTo MR. McGIBBON: I am quite sure of that.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6223, file 483-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nJoe Martin, sworn, questioned by MR. CLARKE:\n\nI was a member of the Six Nations School Board in 1912. I attended the December meeting of that Board. I remember the applications for increases. To the best of my recollection they passed both applications. I objected to one and that was Lickers, but I got beat. I did not make any objection to Mr. Scott. I remember they both passed, because I got beat on one. I had no objection to Mr. Scott's.\n\nTo MR. HOLLINRAKE: I don't remember that anything was said about leaving it to the next School Board. We passed it at that meeting.\n\n---\n\nSuperintendent G. J. Smith, sworn, examined by MR. CLARKE\n\nI was present at that Board meeting. I remember the matter coming up. I cannot say positively that both increases were granted. The Minutes are first written on foolscap paper, loose paper, by the Secretary of the Board, then they are transferred into the Minute Book, by Mr. Hill, sometimes Hilton Hill does it. I report to the Department on this, what is written by the Secretary and transcribed by my office help. I have always felt that my office help was reliable, and I do not think it looks a little shaky now.\n\nMR. McGIBBON: I am afraid it is too far back to have the original motions. That correction would be made by a succeeding meeting, when those minutes were read. Mr. Strong was chairman at the next meeting of the Board. I was absent and these Minutes were read, and confirmed by Mr. Strong.\n\nMR. HOLLINRAKE: The Board had the authority to make corrections. Most of the members composed the new Board. Mr. Carpenter was on both, and Mr. Strong was on both.\n\nMR. McGIBBON: I cannot say whether this motion was ever called to my attention, you see I was not at this meeting. As a matter of fact I don't know what took place.\n\nMR. CLARKE: I might say that Hilton Hill was at that...\nTo MR. HOLLINRAKE: The new Board would know what was\nthe intention of the former Board because Mr. Strong and Mr.\nCarpenter, and Mr. Park were members.\n\nTo MR. CLARKE: Mr. Scott called my attention to\nthe Minute. (Mr. Smith reads Minutes of January meeting).\n\nMR. CLARKE to MR. HOLLINRAKE: I was Inspector of the\nSchools and I tried to stand behind them, and I have observed\nthese things as Inspector. I might say further that it was\nobserving such things as that that caused my dismissal as\nInspector.\n\nRev. Mr. [signature], sworn, examined by MR. CLARKE:\n\nI was present at the December meeting, but had a very\nbad attack of deafness and told the Chairman I would have to\nleave. I left before this business was transacted, and at the\nnext Board meeting I was present, and able to hear, and we felt\nthat there was some manipulation of the Minutes in the insertion\nof this that was read. There was a feeling among the members\nof the Board that they felt perfectly satisfied that the motion\nhad been passed and dealt with by the old Board, but the\ninsertion seemed to leave it to the new Board; it was the\ninsertion that brought it up.\n\nTo MR. HOLLINRAKE: I think the members were nearly\nall new men, and the only ones present would be the clergymen\nwho were at the December meeting. We noticed at the time\nthat that was definitely realized as the old Board. There was\nno authority whatever for the addition, for it would have\ngone in the regular way in the January meeting. It would have\nbeen a motion passed and carried at the January meeting\nreferring to the mistake that was passed in the December meeting.\nThe Secretary had no authority in January to go back to the\nDecember meeting and make a change there.\nHilton Hill, sworn, examined by MR. McGIBBON:\n\nYes, that is in my handwriting (shown insertion). The School Board authorized me to make that change, at the School Board. There was some misunderstanding about that Minute when it was read. When that Minute was read they decided to change it. That would be the next meeting. I cannot tell you now what member objected to it. There was an objection made by some members of the School Board but I cannot tell you whom it was.\n\nTo MR. HOLLINRAKE: There was no memorandum taken of the objection by the Secretary.\n\nTo MR. McGIBBON: I was authorized to change that, that is all I know.\n\nTo MR. CLARKE: There is no Minute to that effect, that I know of.\n\nTo MR. HOLLINRAKE: Then the same Board authorized me to strike it out again at the next meeting. I cannot enlighten you as to why they should want it struck out at one meeting and struck out at the next. I cannot give you names of the members of the Board who asked me to do that. I would not do it unless I was told to.\n\nMR. CLARKE: That salary was afterwards paid, after the men got off the Reserve.\n\nTo MR. McGIBBON: Chief Johnson was a member of the Board this year, 1913.\n\nChief J. S. Johnson, sworn, examined by MR. McGIBBON:\n\nI remember the increase of some of the salaries. I do not remember anyone taking objection and stating that the matter should be referred to the new Board. I think I remember Lickers asking for the increase. I remember a question coming up referring to the new Board, but whether it was to deal with that question or not I would not be sure of that. I am pretty sure we dealt with that question this year.\nTO MR. McGIBBON: I do not remember the new Board striking out any words; I remember the raise in salary. I do not know anything about the authority for adding those words. I have been present at every meeting this year.\n\nTo MR. CLARK: I do not remember the Board authorizing the insertion of these words. I understand Mr. Lickers salary was paid at the end of March.\n\nA. G. Smith, sworn, examined by: MR. McGIBBON:\n\nI am a member of the school Board of 1913. I was not a member of the Board of 1912. That question (reads resolution) came up and was discussed at either the first or second meeting of the Board, I forget just which. The discussion was on account of misunderstanding of the resolution being passed that increases be made in the salaries of Scott and Lickers, I believe. Part of the members of the Board claimed that it was passed, and then we looked in the Minutes as it was copied, and I found it was indefinite because it was simply written. Moved and Seconded that the increase be made to the salaries of these people without stating whether that motion was carried or not, and then I went back to look at the original which was written in pencil. Jamieson appeared to have been acting Secretary at that time, and he did not state in the Minutes as to whether it was carried. Peter Jamieson expressed himself as being under the impression that it was carried or on second thought, that it was referred to the new Board that was to be elected. It seemed to be pretty well understood that it was carried. I knew nothing of it because I was not a member of the old Board. After thinking for a while Jamieson was under the impression that it was referred to the new Board. I did not remember whether April was the first meeting or the second meeting.\n\nTo MR. HOLLINRANE: That was the only discussion I think; I don't think there was anything said after that. I cannot be sure whether the matter was discussed at the first meeting of the new Board.\nI think the matter was only discussed once.\n\nMR. CLARKE: The second case was the case of Mr. Kees, and he beside being subject to defamation of character of which there are several witnesses to bear testimony, he was also subject to blackmail and a threat of assault.\n\nTo MR. McGIBBON: I for one heard Mr. Hill circulating defamatory stories about Mr. Kees.\n\nTo MR. HOLLINRAKE: As to his morality. He had also asked Mr. Smith to prosecute the man who threatened to assault him.\n\nRobert Martin, sworn, examined by MR. CLARKE:\n\nAbout a year ago I heard defamatory stories about Mr. Keys, teacher of #7. They were some stories which were not very nice. I heard Mr. Will Curry speak of it, and Mr. David Jamieson made a few remarks and Albert Hill.\n\nMR. HOLLINRAKE: I never heard that there was any truth in them, none that I know of.\n\nDavid Davis, sworn, examined by MR. CLARKE:\n\nAbout a year ago I heard them talking disrespectfully about Mr. Kees, teacher of No. 7, that he was not conducting himself very well at the school. I heard this from Mr. Albert Hill.\n\nTo MR. McGIBBON: I could not say whether these stories were true.\n\nMR. CLARKE (To Mr. McGibbon) In a letter I have from Mr. Scott he claimed that the same stories had been circulated about him, and he asked Mr. Smith for an investigation of the matter, but it was never given. I have the letter.\n\nThe next case was of Mr. Abbott, a qualified experienced teacher in #2 School.\n\nRev. Mr. Park, sworn, examined by MR. CLARKE:\n\nIn the June meeting of the Six Nations School Board of the\npresent year I remember some complaints being brought up against Mr. Abbott. Mr. Hilton Hill said there were complaints against Mr. Abbott's conduct and character. There was nothing much done, but I said I considered Mr. Abbott a very first-class teacher and that the children were fond of him, and there was nothing very definite and no resolution passed, some of them were blaming him, and Mr. Abbott told me some time before that he was not going to stand it, and the result was he left. He resigned and I am sorry. I considered that he was an acquisition to the schools on the reserve, and conducting himself properly. He roamed right next to the Rectory, and I was very sorry to hear that Mr. Abbott had gone, and I was quite satisfied that that was why he left, that people had been discrediting him.\n\nTO MR. McGIBBON: Mr. Hilton Hill made the report that he was not conducting himself properly. I think someone asked what was the nature of these complaints and there was nothing definite. I was surprised, not surprised in a measure, but I was surprised at Mr. Abbott; I was not surprised at the party these things came from, for I had been maligned myself, but I concluded it was not worth the trouble and I let it rest. In fact, I didn't know I could do anything, I thought I had to submit.\n\nJ. S. Johnson, sworn, examined by MR. McGIBBON:\nThere was never any complaint of him that I know of except that of some words of expression mentioned against him. This was outside. In the June meeting I don't remember anything. I cannot remember any complaints about Mr. Abbott being discussed.\n\nA. G. Smith, sworn, examined by MR. CLARKE:\nI am afraid I am ignorant on the subject of the complaints against Mr. Abbott which came up at the June meeting. I am a little afraid I missed that meeting.\nChief A. G. Elliott, sworn, examined by MR. CLARKE:\n\nDuring last summer I heard some complaints about Mr. Abbott teacher of School #2. They were given by David S. Hill. He said that Mr. Abbott was no good as a teacher, that he was away behind the times, that he was not qualified, and that we should have a qualified teacher at that school. He also said that other teachers of the Reserve were not qualified. He said that you should be out of that, and quite recently he made the remark that he would have John Clarke out by Christmas.\n\nDavid S. Hill made that remark. He had something to say about you bringing in constables to look after the whiskey question during the fair. He said you were the cause of bringing the Dominion police down to inspect the Reserve during fair time. I don't recollect that he said anything about who was to pay for it. I don't remember that he said it was at the expense of the nation.\n\nMR. CLARKE (To MR. MCGIBBON) Now in the case of Miss Almas, teacher of #7; in the June meeting of the Six Nations there was a resolution passed I think, that her salary should be paid at the rate of $400.00. That was the meeting of June 1913. Motion read.\n\nI understood from Miss Almas that her salary was to be $500.00 and I have understood since that she was paid at the rate of $500.00, contrary to that resolution. I understood that she had a claim of $600.00, but that the School Board authorized payment at the rate of $400.00, though they afterwards, I believe, overlooked that resolution and extra money was paid. I do not know on what authority Mr. Strong would issue that cheque. This was last June.\n\nJerome Duncan, sworn, examined by MR. CLARKE:\n\nLast winter one night I was present on the street with Knox Hill when he was drunk. We did not wait outside of your house for some time. I did not stand and linger there for some\ntime. I never went past a second time. We did not pass the house more than once a little after midnight, that I can remember.\n\nI did not halt at all. Know Hill did not wait. We never followed a party that came out of your house, with the intention of assaulting him. I was with the person who intended to assault you. It was another fellow, about half past twelve or something like that, who passed Mr. Clarke's. We had come out of the pool room, and it was about between David Garlow's and George Miller's. I was not following the fellow. I do not know what the other fellow followed him for. When we got up to this fellow, he said Good-night. The man I was with was under the influence of liquor. I do not know that he was waiting and walking around the streets looking for a chance to lick somebody.\n\nQ\u2014To threaten the party that came out of my house with assault? A\u2014They both threatened one another. I did not follow with Know over the road. He went to the corner of the Council House, and I stood by the gate. I don't know that I went out of my way. I just wanted to hear what was on.\n\nGeorge Curry, sworn, examined by MR. CLARKE:\n\nDuring the past few months or a year I have heard of several threats of assault. One was by David Hill. He called you some pretty names, and said he could lick you anywhere at any time. He said he was going to move you off the reserve and that Mr. Park would be off at Christmas, at the same time. His only reason I think, is that he is down on Mr. Clarke. I must say that Mr. Clarke is the best teacher they have had. He was the one who educated the Hill and Jamieson family, then they were done with him.\n\nMR. SMITH: I agree with what you say about Mr. Clarke.\n\nDavid Davis, sworn, examined by MR. CLARKE:\n\nI have heard during the last few months or a year back of you being assaulted. You would have been lots of times if you\nhad not been a good runner. It seems as though that was their intention for they were talking about it all the time.\n\nI heard Mr. David Hill talking about it.\n\n---\n\nDavid Garlow, sworn, examined by MR. CLARKE:\n\nI remember the investigation held against you for selling intoxicants to Indians. I remember the morning after when you were talking to me about a certain matter.\n\nQ\u2014Do you think that was on the previous Friday, was it not?\n\nA\u2014It was either Friday or Saturday.\n\nQ\u2014You told me that morning that he had been arranging to go to town with you on Saturday?\n\nA\u2014Yes. It must have been Friday night that Lawrence Jonathan was in my store. That was Friday previous to my hearing.\n\nMR. CLARKE: (To Mr. McGibbon). Jonathan swore that he had not been in Ohweken for two weeks, also I saw that man about 5 o'clock about 20 feet from this man's store, and if this case comes to a case for perjury, my wife will also swear that she saw him. It was a malicious conspiracy against me and Lawrence Jonathan was made a partner in it. I tried to bring out that he had been in that village that week and he said he had not been in the village until Saturday morning.\n\nTo MR. Mc GIBBON: I think the conspiracy charge is pretty well shown, regarding the persecution of myself.\n\n---\n\nRev. Mr. Park, sworn, examined by MR. CLARKE.\n\nI was present at the June 1912 meeting, when the matter of Inspector was discussed. That was when Mr. Standing's resignation was before the Board; you were appointed Inspector at that meeting. During the succeeding quarter I made visits to the school while you were Inspector. You were going to visit some time after the holidays, I imagine; you were asking me as one of the trustees to come out with you and visit Mr. Kees' school.\nMr. A. H. Lottridge, sworn, examined by Mr. Clarke:\n\nI remember a year ago in June when you were appointed as School Inspector in place of Mr. Standing. The motion was carried.\n\nMr. Clarke (To Mr. McGibbon) I have only received $100.00 out of $267.00 that I should have received as Inspector. For conducting night school down there last winter I have never received a cent. It comes from the Department through Mr. Smith. The Department sets the salary.\n\nTo Mr. Hollinrake: Mr. Standing resigned in May 1912.\n\nMr. Clarke: (To Mr. McGibbon) I asked after the end of the quarter for my salary. I came in personally to the office to Mr. Smith, and he said there was some question about payment of the salary, and he would have to see the Treasurer of the Board. The money was due.\n\n(Minute of last November read).\n\nI was to get $200.00 a year for Inspecting the schools, and I only received $100.00. My appointment was taken back in June. I inspected a year and four months; the money is paid quarterly.\n\nMr. Smith: He got the first cheque of $83.33, and then $50.00.\n\nMr. Clarke: I never received that $83.33, and if there is a cheque with my name on there is a gross irregularity.\n\nMr. McGibbon: This was issued March 31st. Do you think you could find it?\n\nMr. Smith: I'm looking for it now.\n\nMr. McGibbon: Surely this matter of salary could be straightened out.\n\nMr. Clarke: I claim that my salary should cover those four months. It was a piece of manipulation to keep me out of it.\n\nQ\u2014Who do you mean by \"they\"? A\u2014I will say your clique. Clerk Hill is one of the important ones, and then Peter Jamieson; I think the treasurers work is just the formality of putting his name on the cheques.\nMR. SMITH: We make them out here. If there is any doubt I speak to Mr. Strong, and I go by the Minute Book.\n\nMR. McGIBBON: He is entitled to the salary from the 1st of July.\n\nLawrence Jonathon, sworn, examined by MR. HOLLINRAKE:\n\nI am a chief. I do not know that I could make you understand, as I cannot take the English. I would sooner have somebody to interpret. (To interpreter) Q\u2014Some time ago this man made a charge against Mr. Clarke for supplying liquor to Indians? A\u2014Yes; I was simply told that that was the report. David Hill and Albert Hill told me. The parties came to me and said I was wanted to go before the Council and lay the information against Mr. Clarke for the reason that Mr. Clarke was acting in a dual capacity in connection with the school, and also on account of Chief Johnson bringing an account for substitute being paid for taking the place of Mr. Clarke in school. David Hill and Albert Hill at the time they approached me, were also talking about Mr. Clarke supplying liquor to Indians, and I remonstrated with them, but they said they were ready to prove it, and moreover they told me that Mr. Clarke was in the habit of getting up dances and supplying liquor at these dances. Two Hills told me this. They also said they could prove that Mr. Clarke had a supply of liquor on hand. I laid this matter before the Council. I am an Onondaga, one of the fire keepers. They came to me because they knew I would be in a position to lay this matter before the Council; for a long time others had been speaking to me about the same thing. They were people who generally congregate around there. They said he was acting in dual capacity, people said he should give up either one position or the other. There was the investigation held at the school house, and they said Mr. Clarke was excluded. Those who were plotting this said it. If it hadn't been for what David and Albert Hill said there would not have been any...\ninvestigation, or charge.\n\nMR. HOLLINRAKE: I cannot tell whether I was in David Garlow's store on the Friday night, because I am in there a great deal, and I have a good many different talks with Garlow.\n\nMR. McGIBBON: Just caution this man that it is a very dangerous thing to injure a man's reputation, or to attempt to ruin his standing in a community, and in his profession.\n\nCertified,\n\n[Signature]\n\nStenographer.\nOFFICE OF THE\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nFOR ONTARIO.\n\nMr. D.C. Scott,\nDeputy Dept. General\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nReferring to your letter to me dated Dec 3/13, I have enclosed a report that I held an investigation into the matter in question and have attached the evidence taken for your information.\n\nI am unable to find that Mr. Clark has any grievance in this case; as it appears to me the trouble arises from the fact of the Catlow Board engaging another inspector for the agency and the inspector for the schools. According to the Resolution, copy of which I enclose, Mr. Clark was only engaged for one year.\n\nI am firmly of the opinion that had Mr. Clark not been engaged to inspect the schools in 1912, the trouble would have resulted.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6223, file 483-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe reappointment of Mr. Standing as County Inspector seems to have been a great disappointment to Mr. Clarke, in fact, to see how he could be expected to inspect the schools and give proper attention to his own school at Oshawa. The fact of him holding two positions displeased certain decisions in his school section and helped on the trouble.\n\nMr. Clarke complains about reports started about other teachers being afraid these reports are much too common on Indian Reserves and it is a hard matter to meet the difficulty unless the report complaints of sufficiently serious to warrant bringing the offender before a magistrate.\n\nI warned the people at the investigation that it was a most outrageous offence to circulate stories that would injure any...\nany Person standing in the Community,\n\nThe Clerk appears to be a Good Teacher and a Clear Man but of fancy lacks tact and is not too Pacific in disposition.\n\nI pointed this out to him and I submit the hope that matters will move more along more smoothly.\n\nI would suggest that the Capt be instructed to keep the original copies of the resolutions of all School Board meetings being them away in his office so that at any time they can be referred to in case of a dispute as to the correct wording of a recorded Resolution.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nCharles E.

I beg to recommend that this decision of the Council be approved and that an architect be sent from the Department to look over the building as it will require an expert's opinion as to the best means of making the addition required, etc. I expect to be absent on my holidays during the last three weeks of August, so I would like the architect to come before or after that time so I could visit the school with him.\n\nI am your obedient servant,\n\nGordon J.

These class rooms are approximately 22' x 30' and will provide additional accommodation for sixty pupils.\n\nYou will note that grade entrances have been provided for the boys and girls, which eliminates the necessity of constructing steps on the outside of the building.\n\nIt might be well for the council to consider the advisability of placing chemical closets in the basement of the new portion which would do away with the unsanitary outside closets.\n\nIf you will return the sketch plan to me with any comments or recommendations, a complete plan and specifications will be prepared for this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.

(RG 10, Volume 6223, file 483-5, part 2)\nSir,\n\nI beg to return rough sketch plan of the proposed addition to No. 2 School which will provide for 60 extra pupils. In discussing the matter today with a member of the School Board and others interested, it was pointed out that they did not consider two additional rooms enough on account of the large number of extra pupils attending this school and the suggestion was made that it might be possible to utilize the basement under the new portion if raised a little higher for one class room and two class rooms above raising them higher still so that the front portion of the building will be a two storey class room and the rear or old portion a one story room as it now is.\n\nI am expecting to have a meeting of the School Board sometime during the week commencing the 26th inst., and would like to have an approximate estimate of the cost of the building as proposed in your plan and also the cost of what the suggested additions mentioned today might come to. I would not advise preparing plans and specifications complete until the School Board passes on it and probably the Council afterwards.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGordon J. Smith,\nSup't.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, September 16th, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 10th inst., with reference to the proposed addition to No. 2 school, I beg to say that the approximate cost of the addition as shown on the sketch submitted to you will be $3000.00 and if provision was made for four class rooms in place of the two as shown, it would probably add an additional $3000.00 or $4000.00 to the cost.\n\nIf the basement was used for class rooms, it would be necessary to make them all above ground as the heating of these lower class rooms would be rather difficult when using warm air furnaces.\n\nShould you wish the sketch returned to you, please advise me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.

Owing to the settling of the stone foundation walls the exterior walls are gradually bulging towards the outside, with the result that the joists on the ground floor are resting only a few inches on the wooden beams under the centre of the class rooms. The roof and eaves troughs are also in need of repairs.\n\nI would recommend that the Superintendent be authorized to have the whole of the plastered ceiling which is in a poor condition in the basement removed, and that all the joists be bolted together. It is also necessary that the walls be straightened out, and tied together by means of steel rods with turned buckles. While the carpenters are there, I would suggest that they examine the upper part of the building by raising the floors, etc., in order to find out if any similar work is required above the ground floor.\n\nI estimate that the cost of the above mentioned work will be about $480.\n\nDepartmental Engineer.\nOttawa, July 9, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has been advised by Mr. Chene that the structure of School No. 2 at Ohsweken, Six Nations Indian Reserve is in a very dangerous condition owing to the settling of the stone foundation walls and the bulging of the exterior walls. It is reported that the joists of ground floor are resting only a few inches on the wooden beams and are gradually being pulled out of place.\n\nAs it is important that these conditions be remedied at once, I have to request that you engage a competent builder and arrange to have the repairs as mentioned above performed. There are also a few minor repairs to be carried out such as the fixing of the eaves troughs, plastering, etc.\n\nIt is considered advisable that the whole of the plastered ceiling which is in a poor condition in the basement be removed entirely in order to allow the bolting of the joists and the installation of steel rods, for the straightening and strengthening of the outside walls. It is also necessary that the joists in the upper part of the building be examined in case similar work should be required in some other part of building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Morgan,\nSuperintendent Six Nations,\nBrantford, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\n\"Sinking foundation of No. 2 School\"\n\nI beg to report that acting upon instructions received from you today, inspected No. 2 school at Ohsweken, the foundation of which is sinking and has been reported as unsafe.\n\nI found the joists on the main floor drawing off the beams, there being evidence of recent movement. I inspected the joists in the roof and found that some of these had also slightly drawn but not so much as those on the main floor, nor apparently as recently.\n\nAbout twelve months ago tie rods were installed and as a pronounced movement has since taken place it has been assumed that these rods were not doing their work. Upon inspection, however, I found that the bolts and plates on the outer ends of these rods were loose and the plates were not functioning at all.\n\nThe trouble is caused by the subsidence of the foundations which is greatly due to seepage of water between the wall and the ground outside and also, I understand, that when the building was put up the foundation trenches were dug too deep and subsequently filled in with loose rubble to the required depth. I found that the cement work around the water pipes was full of holes and apparently most of the water from the roof is running down alongside the foundations.\n\nI am of opinion that there is no immediate danger if proper precautions are taken.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6223, file 483-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI recommend:\n\n1. That the rods be immediately tightened all over.\n2. That the cement around the water pipes outflows on the ground be repaired.\n3. That all outside cracks be pointed and carefully watched.\n4. That marked wedges be put in the existing openings between the joists and the beams and carefully watched.\n5. That the bearing of the cellar joists be increased by spiking pieces of 2\" x 4\" to them.\n6. That the loose bricks on the top of the chimney be removed and the window and door arches be re-keyed and re-pointed and watched.\n\nI do not think that the tendency of the wall on the north west corner to bulge is sufficiently serious not to be counteracted by the tie rods after they are kept properly tightened, and if there was any tendency to fall inwards, which there is not it would be stayed by the joists.\n\nThe suggestions which I now make are, of course, temporary to tide over the winter but I think that the whole question of the condition of the foundation of this school should be gone into as soon as mason work becomes practical in the spring when it will be a question for the Departmental Architect to decide whether the school should come down or be jacked up and the foundation rendered safe.\n\nFinally I would add that you visited the Reserve with me where we met Mr. Albert Hill, who I understand built No. 6 & 11 schools and who has undertaken that these measures by me shall be at once carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In order to carry out this arrangement it will be necessary for the band to vote an expenditure of approximately $5,000.00, the money to be taken from their land funds.

One of these rods is somewhat loose and Mr. Turner suggested to have this rod tightened and other than this, would not advise doing anything further.

As I previously reported the school is in an unsafe condition, due partly to settlement of the foundation and partly to poor construction. The outside walls are of solid brick and are only eight inches thick. The result is that they are bulging badly in many places. I discussed two schemes with the Indian Council in connection with this building, first the demolishing of the old building and the building of a new school; second the tearing down of the outside walls of the school and rebuilding same in balloon frame construction. The latter is more economical and I believe the best system to adopt.\n\nI would recommend that Col. Morgan be instructed to lay the matter officially before the Council at their next meeting, and obtain a minute authorizing the expenditure from their band funds amounting to approximately $3,500.00 to make the necessary repairs.\n\nARCHITECT.\nAugust 24, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Architect of the Department who visited Brantford recently has again reported that the No 2 School at Chateaugay is in an unsafe condition, due to settlement of the foundation and to the bulging of the outside walls, caused by the brickwork in the walls being only eight inches thick, which is not sufficient for walls of their height with the number of window openings in same. It has been recommended that there are two schemes which could be adopted in connection with the remodelling of this building; first, to totally demolish the building and rebuild anew, or to remove the outside walls and rebuild on a concrete foundation and balloon frame construction above. The latter would be the most economical, and could probably be done for approximately $3,500.00.\n\nI would ask you to bring this matter to the attention of the Indian Council at their next meeting for the necessary action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst.

Six Nations.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nI beg to report that on Wednesday of last week I made an inspection of the No 2 School now being repaired on the Six Nations Reserve at Brantford. As previously reported on the 14th, instructions were given to the Indians employed on the work to rebuild the outside walls, care being taken to put the necessary supports in the interior of the building to provide temporary support for the roof. Unfortunately, when they commenced operations the building was in such poor condition that it collapsed, while in Brentford I took the necessary measurements in the morning, and in the afternoon Mr. Fairchild of Brantford granted me use of his office and I prepared a plan for the building of the school on the same foundation. The new building will be of balloon frame construction, and provision is made for two classrooms, a cloak room, etc. The classrooms will be slightly larger than the former ones. We will use as much of the old material as possible. The work is being carried out by day labour, and Mr. Wilson Russell, an Indian on the Reserve, who is a competent mechanic, is acting as foreman. The Indians have passed a resolution authorizing the expenditure of $4,000.00 from their band funds for this work.\n\n[Signature]\n\nARCHITECT.\nThe eleventh General Council of the second elected Council of the Six Nations was held at Ohsweken, Sept. 2nd, 1926.\n\nNo. 8.\n\nMoved by Frank Miller seconded by Wm.

Orr Esq.,\nDepartmental Architect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\n\"Re No. 2 school.\"\n\nMr. Russell is about through with the work all but the painting. He has only four men working now. When he was in he mentioned about the furnaces and the registers. The furnaces will have to be turned on account of the chimneys being in a different place than where they were before. These furnaces are the Kelseys and were installed by Turnbull and Sons of this City. Please let me know what you want done with regard to the above.\n\nThe roads on the Reserve are impassable with a car, the side roads are regular quagmires and it is raining again today.\nThere is a lot of material left over, odds and ends, and Mr. Russell reported that a lot of old lumber was disappearing. Mr. Montour, Inspector of Works, has advertised for a sale of the material next Thursday. This is our Council day.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHH/B.\nNov. 23, 1926.\n\nDear Col. Morgan,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 26th instant, with reference to the new No. 2 School, I would ask you to please arrange with Turnbull and Sons of Brantford, who originally installed the hot air furnace at the No. 2 School, to make the necessary changes in the installation, as required by the alterations in the layout of the building.\n\nI expect to be in Brantford some day next week.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

The pay-lists I have here show payments of $2154.82. I have therefore overdrawn $154.82. Will you please send a further sum of $800.00 as soon as possible.

As the work was under way before the Order in Council was obtained, $1,000.00 was advanced from Interest funds and an expenditure of $3,906.67 has already been made against the amount provided by Council. Unpaid accounts amounting to $1775.82 are now before the Department, and before dealing with them I would be glad to know whether additional funds will be provided by Order in Council from Capital, or should these be paid from Interest. The accounts before the Department to date exceed the $4,000.00 provided by $2,685.49.\n\nThe Capital Funds of Six Nations is now $656,014.45, and the Interest is $12,749.95.\n\nChief Accountant.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the cost of rebuilding the No. 2 School at Ohsweken on the Six Nations Reserve, in my memorandum to you of the 14th of September I estimated the cost at approximately $3,500.00. At that time it was the intention to rebuild the unsafe outside brick walls without removing the roof, or disturbing the foundation. When work was commenced, however, through unforeseen conditions the building collapsed, and it was, therefore, necessary to rebuild the entire school, which of course doubled the cost. The work has been done in a satisfactory manner and the Department has excellent value for the money expended.\n\nARCHITECT.\nJanuary 27, 1927.\n\nHis Excellency\nThe Governor General in Council.\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to recommend that authority be granted for expenditure of Two Thousand ($2,000.00) Dollars from the capital funds of the Six Nations of the Grand River Band of Indians, which now amount to $656,014.45, for the purpose of completing No. 2 school-house on their reserve, which is situated in the Province of Ontario, the same being necessary in the interests of the said band, pursuant to the provisions of Section 39 of the Indian Act.\n\nS.G. 27.1.27\n\nT.B.\n\nC.C.\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nJanuary 27, 1927.\n\nTo authorize an expenditure of Two Thousand Dollars from the capital funds of the Six Nations of the Grand River Band of Indians which now amount to $656,014.45, for the erection of No. 2 school-house which is required on their reserve, pursuant to the provisions of Section 89 of the Indian Act. It is proposed to recoup the capital funds thus expended by annual repayments from interest funds.\nJanuary 29th, 1927\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir:\n\n\"No. 2. School.\"\n\nOn the 17th of January under my IOB/27/75 I wrote to you enclosing vouchers for labor on No. 2 school for $3084.21 pointing out that I had an overdraft to be met and asking you to be good enough to forward me a cheque at your earliest convenience to meet this overdraft. I was under the impression that at the same time I dictated a further paragraph to Miss Brock which apparently I did not do pointing out that further pay-sheets had yet to be met on this expenditure and asking that a cheque to cover the estimated amount for them.\n\nMr. Wilson Russell was in with his pay-sheets today which I was unable to pay amounting to $97.30 so if you will send me a cheque for $381.51\nas soon as possible I will remit the money to him for his pay-sheets and pay the overdraft.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt.

H. Turnbull & Sons for $711.74 for repairing two furnaces and I must remark that the same is an excessive price for repairing furnaces and it is desired to know if you obtained prices from other dealers before giving the job to this firm, and, if so what prices you obtained. If you did not obtain competitive prices why did you not do so. The first item in the bill of $347.50 for time of man and helper must be given in more detail showing the rate of pay of the man and the helper. An explanation and receipt is also required in connection with the item of $36.50 for meter trips.\n\nIn connection with the account of Messrs. Turnbull & Outcliff for paint supplied, it is desired to know why you did not purchase at the prices which you did when you bought paint for the schools on the Reserve. This firm charges $3.35 for half (\u00bd) gallon of white paint and the price charged per gallon throughout the account for paint is $6.00. In October they charged seven cents (7\u00a2) per pound for putty and in December eight cents (8\u00a2). For nails they charged eight cents (8\u00a2) instead of seven cents (7\u00a2). It is not understood why sixteen (16) paint brushes were required for this job and to know what has become of the brushes.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

For red paint the highest price quoted was $4.65 given by this firm. For inside white paint the highest price quoted was $4.45 by Mr. Johnson, and, yet you purchased paint from Messrs. Turnbull & Cutcliffe and allow a charge of $6.00 per gallon. Did you obtain competitive prices for this paint as you did on a former occasion? Why was the paint not purchased at a price something near the figures quoted in the tenders you received in August? There was sufficient paint purchased to warrant a price being obtained by tender as it is noticed the following quantities were bought:\n\n- 27\u00bd gallons of white\n- 1 gallon of green\n- 5\u00bd gallons of paint specified by number\n- 2 gallons of varnish\n- 3\u00bd gallons of stain\n\nThere is an item in the account of $449.50 for roofing and metal work. Was this work given by contract after obtaining tenders, if so, please forward the tenders received; if not called for by tender why not? A full explanation of this charge must be made and the items furnished as to how the amount is reached.\n\nTo enable you to look into this matter intelligently a copy of each merchant's account is enclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6223, file 483-5, part 2)\nLt. Col. C.E. Morgan,\nSupt. Six Nations,\nBrantford, Ont.\n\nDear Col. Morgan:\n\nWith regard to your queries respecting the high cost of repairs to the two furnaces at No. 2 school, Ohsweken, I will, in case the detailed account furnished is not sufficiently clear point out the work that was necessary before these furnaces were workable.\n\nTo begin with to install furnaces of the same type would cost, exclusive of piping and installation $300.00 each F.o.b. factory Brockville.\n\nThe old furnaces have been moved, entirely re-cased, hot and cold air pipes, and additional cold and warm air registers upstairs. Reference to the bill will show that new castings were supplied, grate bars, doors and new water tanks in fact the furnaces were rebuilt and are now every bit as good as new.\n\nI would also like to point out that the season of the year when this work was carried out was most unfavourable which in some measure accounts for the cost of transportation and some of the overtime for labour.\nMarch 11th, 1927\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir,\n\n\"Re-erection of No.2 School\nSix Nations Reserve.\"\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Departmental Letter No.32-2-5-A of the second instant.\n\nFrom this, and previous correspondence, it appears to be thought in the Department that the erection of this building was under my supervision, and the purchase of materials in connection with it in my hands which was not the case.\n\nThis work was started late in the year, when the roads were impassable, and the only possible course, if the work was to be finished in time for occupation by the pupils after the Christmas holidays, was to leave it in the hands of the Foreman of Works, Mr Wilson Russell.\n\nThe Departmental Architect realized this and instructed Mr Russell to proceed with the work giving him such instructions as regards material paint and the roofing as he considered necessary.\nIt is claimed continuously both before the work was commenced and during its operation and it would not have been possible for Mr. Orr to reach the reserve in a car had he visited Brantford.\n\nMr. Fairchild and I, as well as the Inspector of works visited the work during its progress but the work and the selection and purchase of materials were in Mr. Russell's hands.\n\nMr. Orr has, I believe, full confidence in Mr. Russell, who built the R.C.M.P. Barracks at No. 6 School and No. 11 with Albert Hill.\n\nI have interviewed the firms of Turnbull and Cutcliffe and Turnbull and Sons and obtained explanations from them of the items queried which I attach marked A & B.\n\nI will answer the queries contained in Departmental letter 32-2-5-4 in the order in which they appear in the letter.\n\nThe two School Furnaces.\n\nThe charge appears excessive until the work done is considered. These furnaces had been disconnected. The casing, air pipes and various fittings had been battered and broken by the children who have been allowed to play in the cellars, which has now been stopped. Bars, doors and other castings required renewal.\n\nWhile the building was occupied by the builders it was not possible to dismantle and re-erect them, so that the building was finished and ready for occupation before work on the furnaces could be started.\n\nIndifferent warmth was provided for the workmen by hired stoves but the furnaces delayed occupation by the pupils for two weeks after school reassembled.\n\nUpon examination before moving them into their new positions in\nconformity with the new building, they were found to be falling to pieces. I wrote to the Departmental Architect who instructed me to get into touch with the agents for the makers, which I did.\n\nAs Turnbull and Sons are the only agents for the makers in Brantford, as far as I am aware, and the spare parts had to come from the makers, no good end would have been served by calling for tenders from other firms, who would have been obliged to obtain their parts from Turnbull and Sons.\n\nIt became a question of either buying new furnaces, which would have cost $300.00 each F.O.B. Brockville, plus pipes and other extras and cost of erection, or having these repaired.\n\nThey have been rebuilt with new cases, doors, bars, pipes and ventilators, and are every bit as good as new, and are reported on as being entirely satisfactory.\n\nFor information regarding the motor transport and other detail please see Turnbull and Sons letter marked A.\n\nTurnbull and Cutcliffe.\n\nTenders were not called for the reason I have given above.\n\nThe paint supplied to Mr Russell was Brandon Henderson's best quality and not that tendered earlier in the year for other work.\n\nThe quotations then made were at wholesale rates and Mr Russell took out with him each pay day as much as he could carry in his rig to last until he came in again.\n\nThe difference between $5.25, for half a gallon and $6.00, for a gallon is customary when smaller containers are bought.\n\nThe difference in putty has been credited, although there was some\nfluctuation in the white lead market which led to it, I understand.\n\nThe difference in prices charged for nails - 7\u00a2 and 5\u00a2 is owing to\ndifference in quality, the higher being for finishing nails.\n\nSixteen brushes to paint the area involved, with a number of painters\nemployed simultaneously is not excessive, and there were also brushes\nfor varnish and staining the desks.\n\nNo doubt these brushes, or such as have not been worn out, are in\nthe possession of the Superintendent of Works on the Reserve whose\nbusiness it is to care for such things, I will enquire and furnish a\nreport.\n\nThe Departmental Architect desired this particular type of roof which\nis only supplied in this district, as far as I am aware, by the Brant\nRoofing Company, whose agents are Turnbull and Cutcliffe.\n\nFor the full explanation desired by the Department, I would refer to\nthe Departmental Architect and to the letter from the agents, marked B.\n\nIt was, I understand, arranged that when the building was ready for the\nroof Mr Russell was to communicate with Turnbull and Cutcliffe who\nwould then put it on.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent Six Nations.\n\nLt Col C.E. Morgan.\nSuperintendent Morgan has submitted two accounts in connection with the erection of No. 2 school-house on the Six Nations Reserve which I am not prepared to pass for payment as I consider the charges excessive.\n\nIn letter of 2nd instant, the accounts were referred to Superintendent Morgan pointing out the excessive charges and no satisfactory explanation has been given.\n\nThe first is the account of Turnbull & Sons for $711.74 for repairing two hot air furnaces. New furnaces could be bought for $300.00 each. The large item in the account is $247.60 for labour and yet we have only two old furnaces overhauled.\n\nThe other is the account of Turnbull & Cutcliffe for painting material amounting to $783.53 which seems excessive for painting a two room school-house. Six Dollars ($6.00) a gallon has been allowed for paint while last summer paint for other school-houses on the Reserve was purchased for $3.60 for outside white and at that time this same firm quoted $4.95 per gallon.\n\nThe reason given for the high price of the paint is that the roads were bad and paint could be got in small quantities only but the gross amount required could have been contracted for.\n\nIt is also stated that the paint is a superior quality to what was supplied for use on other school-houses and no reason given why better paint was required on this building than on others on the Reserve.\n\nIt is desired to know if you favour passing these accounts as the firms are asking for payment.\n\nChief Accountant.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nMarch 22, 1927.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the memorandum hereunder regarding certain accounts in connection with the rebuilding of No. 2 school on the Six Nations Reserve, I beg to recommend that the accounts be paid as I consider them fair and reasonable for the work performed.\n\nWith regard to the furnaces the cost of which was $711.04 this price includes the complete overhauling of not only the furnaces but all the piping. In the memorandum hereunder it is noted that new furnaces could be bought for $500.00 each. This amount is only for the furnaces and represents a small portion of the necessary labour and material required to make the installation as it now stands, and it would therefore have cost considerably more than the amount of the accounts submitted, if new furnaces had been installed.\n\nWith reference to the account of $763.62 for paint, this includes in addition to paint all items such as ventilating registers, roofing, and hardware, and I consider the price charged is reasonable. This building is a flat roof construction and the charge of $449.50, which is included in the amount above mentioned, is for the laying of a felt and gravel roof. I may say with reference to this work that the great portion of it was carried out in the fall and although I made several efforts to visit the site of the building I was unable to do so on account of the roads. I have, however, every confidence in Mr. William Russell, the Indian who acted as foreman, as in my experience his services have always been entirely satisfactory.\n\nARCHITECT.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6223, file 483-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, March 25, 1937.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the account of Messrs. Turnbull & Sons for installing furnaces in No. 2 school-house, I beg to point out that the first item for time of men and helper for 14\u00bd hours at $1.60 per hour amounts to $237.60 and not $347.60 as entered in the bill.\n\nThe papers submitted as receipts for the expenditure of $36.50 for horse hire are not acceptable and are returned as what is called a receipt from Mr. Miller contains no amount and the receipt from P. Clancy should be for $7.50 which was actually paid for trips in connection with this work. The account of the firms for five trips in connection with the work should be forwarded as well. The receipts objected to are enclosed and I would ask you to forward proper receipts.\n\nI may say that in spite of the remarks of the firm who overhauled the furnaces it is considered that the Department has two old furnaces which are not so good as new furnaces would be. Incidentally I may say that a new furnace suitable for heating a church was installed complete by the Department for the sum of $345.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D.

Morgan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir:\n\n\"Veneering No. 2 school with brick.\"\n\nAt the last Council meeting it was decided to call for tenders to veneer No. 2 school, which was rebuilt two years ago, with brick.\n\nI have this morning had a talk with Mr. Harper, who points out that when this is being done certain exterior alterations should be made with which I agree.\n\nIn Mr. Standing's report this year he recommended that the long room at the back of the school should be adapted for the use of a Continuation school, which I think the Council will favourably consider; alterations therefore will be necessary to the entrance.\n\nMr. Harper suggests that the existing wooden stairs should be removed and that before starting to veneer that the two windows in the basement should be turned into doors and the necessary stairs put in instead.\n\nMr. Orr will remember that the basement of this building was never finished, the concrete floor being in a very bad condition and as there is quite a lot of water lying there, which is rusting...\nthe new furnace which recently cost over $700.00 it would be advisable to have this also attended to. The water finds its way down the stairs at the back of the basement which should also be remedied.\n\nMr. Harper tells me that there are one or two points with regard to the hospital about which he would like to see Mr. Orr. One of these, a serious one, is the old question of coils and heating apparatus furring up with lime. The coils in one of the furnaces has already completely burnt out and has to be replaced and it will not be long before the entire heating apparatus follow suit. The only solution appears to be a large soft water tank as there is no doubt that the softening apparatus should be filled with soft water and the water softener apparatus is useless.\n\nI have also called for tenders for the flooring of the Police stable and have, in discussion, with the Corporal came to the conclusion that the suggestion of filling in and concreting the floor will be too costly.\n\nI have not yet all prices but imagine that the cost will not exceed $150.00 to floor with oak.\n\nIf Mr. Orr could spare time to come down sometime soon it will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt. Col. O.E. Morgan,\nSupt. Six Nations.\nJune 26, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to the portion of your letter of the 23rd, with reference to the No. 2 School, it is noted that you are inviting prices for the brick veneering for this building. It would be also advisable that we get prices for the finishing of the concrete floor and the necessary work required on the stairs leading to the basement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

C. E. Morgan, Sept.,\nBrantford.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs I drive a car to school most of the time, I would like a garage built on the premises of Number Two School, preferably a two-car garage. I find that parking in the school-yard is unsafe when children are playing about and weather conditions are not always favourable for parking outside. I thank the Board for past favours; I remain\n\nYours truly,\nHora E. Jamieson\nChaweken Ont., March 18, 1931\n\nLt. Col. C. E. Morgan,\nChairman of the Six Nation's School Board.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nThe fence at No.2 School is badly in need of repair. Some of the pickets need replacing, the gates are damaged, and I think new ones should be put on. The fence also need repainting. No.2 School is a fine building and it is a shame to have such a fence surrounding the school yard, as it spoils the appearance of the building.\n\nThere is neither a flag nor a flag pole at this school. As it is part of the school curriculum to have a flag raised on certain dates we would very much appreciate a flag and a pole at this school if the school board see fit.\n\nMiss Jamieson and myself have talked about a garage at this school. Most of the teachers drive cars to school now and those of you who have cars know how hard it is on them to leave them standing outside with the sun and rain beating on them. As there are two teachers here we would suggest a two car garage.\n\nWill the school board please consider these things I have asked for?\n\nYours truly,\n\nVera E. Davis.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6223, file 483-5, part 2)\nWe are not prepared to authorize the erection of a garage at the No. 2 School.\n\nThe Department will approve of you arranging to have the minor repairs requested by the teachers carried out, with the exception of the fencing required at the No. 2 School. In this connection, I shall be pleased to have a detailed statement regarding the repairs or any new fencing required, and the estimated cost of same.\nI beg to report that at my recent inspection of the Six Nations Schools and classrooms I found the following matters requiring immediate attention:\n\nSchool No. 2 - Teacher Senior Room, Miss Vera Davis.\nTeacher Junior Room, Miss Nora Jamieson.\n\nMiss Davis requires a new chair, the one she uses being broken beyond repair, and a new bell rope.\nThe board walk approach to the school is broken, full of holes and dangerous. I recommend that either a crushed stone walk with concrete curbs, or a concrete walk be installed.\nThe fence is in a bad state needing a number of new pickets.\nThe down pipes from the eave troughs have blown off and become lost in two places, and the eave trough flow is undermining the foundation.\nThere is one window broken.\nThe classrooms are in good condition, and all else in this school is entirely satisfactory.\nOttawa, November 24, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nRelative to that portion of your letter of the 14th instant, which has reference to your inspection of the No. 2 Indian Day School on the Six Nations Reserve, I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase, from indicated sources, of a new teacher's chair, also a new bell rope. You may also have the board walk approach to the school repaired by having new boards installed where necessary. The expense for this purpose should be kept as low as possible. Further, you may arrange for the supplying of the new pickets required for the fence and for the repairing of the broken windows. After you have carried out the above authorized work, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nRegarding the down pipes from the cove troughs, which have blown off, I have to request that you will state in detail the work required in having new cove troughs installed or the present ones repaired. In this connection, only the work absolutely necessary at the present time should be considered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nLt. Col. C. E.

The building are old and will need from one to two hundred dollars repairing on it before the teacher can go in and the price is too high. We have a new building for less money.

He is a married man and has experienced difficulty in procuring house accommodation for himself and wife. For the past year or two, he rented a house from Chief J. N. Johnson, who notified him that he required the house in June. Mr. Clark could not procure another dwelling and was therefore considering resigning as teacher there. The trustees of the Chawaken School requested him to defer his resignation until they could lay the matter before the Chiefs in Council, which they did at their meeting held on April 28th, when the Council decided to build a dwelling house in Chawaken for a residence for the teacher. The minutes of which Council meeting was duly forwarded to you. After the meeting I requested the trustees to prepare the plans and specifications for the teacher's residence and ask for tenders to be returned at the Council meeting to be held in May, when the Chiefs would consider the plan and tenders and if approved of, the matter could be fully reported without further delay to the Department. Chief Johnson one of the Trustees prepared a plan and specifications for a house which I enclose.\n\nI also attach the tenders of:\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6223, file 483-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPIES\nRobert Martin $844.00\nThomas J. Thomas $64.00\nA.E. Hill $88.00\nLawrence Jonathan et al $882.00\n\nThe Chiefs did not accept the plans as prepared by Chief Johnson, but called for tenders for the sale of any property in Onweken. The Chiefs had several objections to the plan prepared by Chief Johnson. I enclose the offers of various members for sale of their properties in Onweken, as follows:\n\nMrs Jefferson Isaac $850.00\nJohn Hill $1000.00\nChief J.S. Johnson $50.00\nMrs. Isaac Claus $300.00\nMrs Charlotte Powless $800.00\nMrs Mary Johnson $800.00\n\nThe Chiefs accepted the offer of Mr John Hill for a brick house 16x28 with cellar under whole frame kitchen attached 14x24 in all eight rooms, stable 14x20 wood-shed 15x24 one and a half acre of land, first class well and out buildings. The only other building which was worthy of any consideration was the offer of Chief J.S. Johnson for the house at the present time occupied by the teacher. The house is of the same plan as the one Chief Johnson proposed to build for the teacher residence, but the Chiefs would not accept his offer. Mr John Clark the teacher informs me that he prefers the house of Mr John Hill to any of those offered for sale. All the houses offered are convenient to the school. I consider the offer of Mr John Hill's the best value and most desirable of all properties offered. I would much prefer building a suitable residence but as the Chiefs objects to this, I beg to recommend that you approve of the Chiefs\ndecision and authorize the purchase of Mr Hill's property. The building is in a very good state of repair and with very little outlay can be placed in first class condition. I consider it to the interest of the Six Nations to have a dwelling for the teacher at Onweken. I much prefer a married man as teacher and without a dwelling it will be difficult to procure a married man. I also enclose an objection of Robert Martin, as he considers his tender should be accepted. I also enclose letter I received from Chief J.S. Johnson objecting to the purchase of John Hill's property. I suppose it is natural for Chief Johnson to feel annoyed on account of the Chiefs not accepting his plan for a new building and also not buying his property.

Gordon J. Smith,\nsupt.\nOhsweken, Ont. Nov. 15th.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Dept.-General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nSir,\n\nAs a teacher here under a three year contract with the Six Nations School Board I beg to advise you of a grievance under which I am living.\n\nMy contract states \"as part remuneration for services\" \"the free use of house and barn\" and \"The Six Nations School Board hereby agrees to do all necessary repairs to the said house and barn\" Agreement signed March 23, 1912, to begin April 1, 1912.\n\nRelative to said repairs.\n\nThe Six Nations council ordered Inspector of Works, Augustus Jamieson, to attend to this repair work early in the summer of 1912. Several times during the summer of 1912, I asked Asst. Gordon J. Smith, Indian Agent, Brantford, to have this work done as some of the repairs were then badly needed.\n\nThe work was not touched until late in the fall and was carried on until about New Year's in very unfavourable weather.\n\nThe following is a copy of a portion of the Specifications prepared by Inspector Jamieson. I obtained a full copy from the Specifications on the work on Nov. 20, 1912, and if the complete Specifications is desired I will furnish it, but here quote a part only for the sake of brevity.\nSpecifications for the repairs of Teachers' Residence and pump at Ohsweken, Tuscarora.\n\nGeneral Conditions:\nThe contractor is to give his personal supervision to the works, to furnish all necessary materials, labor, apparatus, and tools needful for performing the works in the best and most satisfactory manner according to the specifications and these particulars prepared for the same and are intended to include everything necessary and requisite for the full and entire completion of the repairs notwithstanding every item necessarily involved in the works are not particularly mentioned and vice versa are to be done as if specified.\"\n\n---\n\nOhsweken\nOct. 16, 1912\n\nAugustus Johnson,\nInspector of Works\n\nIn this will be seen ample opportunity for the obvious and unjust discrimination which characterized the whole management of the affair from beginning to end.\n\nIn tendering, friends of the Inspector who were not successful in securing the contract but who afterwards manipulated affairs to get the work put in tenders without looking over the several items. Others, not in the ring told me when they came to get data for their estimates that it was almost impossible to figure owing to the general conditions of the specifications.\nIn one case, and on one point the specifications particularly mentioned two new doors whereas he would be compelled to figure on four owing to the General Conditions. I might say here that only one door was renewed of those particularly specified.\n\nWhen the repair work was being discussed in the Six Nations Council, Mr. Hilton M. Hill, Clerk of the Indian Office, Brantford, presiding over the said Council as the Deputy Sect., Smith made false statements about dancing damaging the floors and plaster of the house and so deceived the chiefs as to influence them against the repairs, so that the items then being considered have never been done.\n\nOne particular of the specifications calls for a new dining room door where the weather had rotted a large hole in the old one. The hole was filled with plaster, paint, cement, or some such material and painted over.\n\nThe front door of the house admits snow and rain. It was not touched.\n\nAlthough the roof was reshingled and the chimneys were to be properly flueled, some furniture has been damaged by rain coming in near the chimney.\n\nThe pump in the water well was repaired by the Inspector's son-in-law, but needed other repair before he got his derrick away.\n\nThe stable floor had a hole through which my horse got a foot. This hole and other parts of the old floor which was worn thin were never touched. I have since had to repair the floor myself.\nThe specifications called for \"the sink pipe from the kitchen to be long enough to overlap at least two feet with the waste pipe in the cistern.\"\n\nThese diagrams will explain themselves.\n\nI remonstrated at the time with the Inspector but in vain.\n\nDiagram No. 2 will show that this sink pipe is worse than useless in frosty weather and liable to become clogged at any time.\n\nFrom No. 1 you will understand that something is wrong when I say that kitchen slops run back into the cistern. A fearful stench is lately coming into the kitchen from the sink pipe notwithstanding whole can of disinfectants and deodorizers and kettles of boiling water being poured down, we have discontinued the use of it altogether.\n\nThere never was a sink pipe before the repairs.\n\nI think the cistern overflow pipe must have been wrongfully tampered with when connecting the sink pipe, for when it rains the water rises above the waste pipe and I presume soaks out into the ground as the cellar has, since the repairing had as much as eight...\ninches of water, although it had hitherto been dry during the many years I have lived here. I had to gather vegetables, etc., out of the water in the cellar and put them on trestles. The water soaked away during the dry weather but it shows evidence of coming in again recently.\n\nSupt. Mr. Smith when spoken to re these imperfections said he could do nothing as Inspector Jamieson had charge of the work.\n\nInspector Jamieson came in during January, 1913, apparently to have me say that the work was O.K., from the manner of his conversation. He, in presence of my wife and a clergyman who was our guest at the time, refused twice to inspect the work upon my asking him to look over the items with me. His only answers to my requests to inspect the work were \"The contractors say they have done everything.\"\n\nInspector Jamieson is obviously the one in fact, but as he is only one wheel in the official machine of this Reserve he cannot but turn back or forward with the rest.\n\nClerk Hilton M. Hill was an important feature in militating against the execution of my written contract. He was well aware of the agreement for he witnessed the signatures.\n\nSupt. Gordon J. Smith first allowed a great delay in beginning the work, then connived at the unfair specification to which I called his attention, and latter neglected to attempt to rectify the matter.\n\nI regret that I have been impelled to resort to what seems insubordination.\nbut since the condition of my residence is both uncomfortable and unsanitary I appeal for redress.\n\nYours sincerely,\nJohn Clark.\n\nP.S.

Hill, who live here I have vowed dire vengeance and physical harm to anyone who should attempt to complain upon anyone within the \"nest.\" It is but a matter of a few hours after information reaches the Indian Office, Brantford, until it is in the possession of dangerous people here.

McGibbon, on December 4th, 1913, at 10:30 a.m.\n\nCOUNSEL:\n\nMr. W. A. Hollinrake, for Plaintiff.\nMr. George D. Heyd, for Defendants.\n\nEVIDENCE.\n\nJohn Clarke, sworn, examined by MR. HOLLINRAKE:\n\nMy name is John Clarke. I am a teacher, and also for the year Inspector of the schools on the Reserve. I have been on the Reserve 14 years. There is a dispute as to when I was appointed as Inspector; the re-appointment occurred in 1912. I live right in Ohsweken. Under the agreement, Exhibit 1) I am entitled to a house. The agreement says \"The Six Nations School Board ............. reasonable repair\". That was the agreement entered into I believe on the 23rd of March 1912.\n\nIt was repaired in a way. After keeping at them, finally there was a specification prepared of which this is a copy. (Exhibit 2). It was drawn up on the 16th of October 1912. In many respects the house was in very bad shape. I know of no reason why it was not attended to before except that a campaign of persecution has been conducted against me. They got the specifications out in October 1912. I cannot give you the date that they started to make the repairs, except by my recollection it was somewhere about a month later. The work has never been completed. A perusal of the specifications will show that they are very unfair, and left a great loop-holes for the contractors. I cannot give any reason for it except that they have been persecuting me. I cannot see any other reason except say that Superintendent Smith was coming to my\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6223, file 483-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nan average of once a month during that time, and he walked over the verandah floor where it was not safe. There was a lady came in and broke through, and so did a gentleman.\n\nMr. Smith said he would try and see Mr. Jamieson about it and try and have the place repaired. To show how these specifications were unfair I will read a part of the general conditions, \"contractors, . . . . . . . . to be done if satisfied\". I claim that that gives a loophole for a person to be let out or to be stuck, the contractor to be stuck pretty severely or to be let out. The repairs were not properly done; scarcely an item can be said to have been properly done. There was a charge against me for damaging the house. I was told the charge was made in Council by Hilton Hill, Clerk of the Indian office, that I had been holding frequent dances in my house, and damaging the floors, and knocking off the plaster. The statement is not true, for during all the time I have been on the Reserve I have only had one dancing party, and that was in the kitchen. There were a few friends in once last winter. At the time he made the statement, it was only the one time after many years. I might say that the representation was made at the time this was discussed. That is all I have to say unless we take up the different items, and show how badly the work was done. For instance, the shingling; the house had never leaked until it was repaired a year ago last month, and now it leaks down by the chimney, evidently from the chimney being improperly flashed. The verandah floor was not arranged according to specifications. Posts were to be put in, which was never done. It was five brothers of Clerk Hilton Hill who did the job; the contract I believe was let to a man by the name of Thomas, but they so arranged it that they did the work. Thomas was there occasionally and did a little on the work, and there were some other men working odd day. I think the contract price was $193.00. There was no door locks to be renewed. The door locks were to be repaired. Some of the locks that were to be repaired, they never had them. They were never what you want.\ncellar was cemented, and my presumption is that the drain must have been stopped because last spring eight inches of water came in, a condition that never occurred before. The worst feature of all is the kitchen sink. In the first place it had no trap, and it was partially fixed with a small iron gas pipe which is exposed to severe weather, and it has three joins in a distance of about 4 feet, and it runs into the over-flow, and I don't know about it being laid on the level, but kitchen slops just run around the cistern, and come back in by the over-flow pipe. I have complained about these matters.\n\nInspector Jamieson came in to apparently, I presume, get my approval of the work, and I asked him to look over the different items of the work, and he said No, the contractors had said they had done all that was necessary. He was there occasionally during the process of the work but when it was finished and I asked him to go over the items he refused twice and said that the contractors had said the work was all done. That is all the inspection I could get. He took the word of the five brothers of Hilton Hill, although Thomas was the nominal contractor. I won't say that he did not inspect it at all. A good many, in fact all of the defects are there yet. The sink has not been repaired. The pump which they repaired is little better; it is not working right now.\n\nCross-examined by MR. HYD:\n\nThings are not satisfactory to me down there. I am under a three-year agreement down there. I have asked Mr. Smith for a release from my contract which he would not give, though I do not like to pull up immediately. I cannot see any other excuse for their actions except personal spite. I do not understand the situation in that frame of mind exactly. I think I am perfectly fair and not prejudiced, notwithstanding the fact that people are doing all they can to inconvenience and trouble me. The School Board was to do all necessary repairs. They returned, to do all necessary repairs. I might say that...\npart of the summer when Inspector\nand we looked over the items together. He made\nlist of them, and I did so as we walked around\nhim the paper. My wife later thought of some other\nand I asked for a return of it or add them, but he said\nwould remember them. It appeared at that time that they\nquite anxious to get a list of everything that was necessary.\nThat list (shown to witness) looks very much like my writing.\nThat looks like the list.\n\nThe stable floor was one thing; the kitchen pump is\nmentioned there, but it was mentioned in conversation\nhim, after he put the list in his pocket. This list\nmade a year ago, and I could not say now that there was\nnothing else to be repaired. I cannot think of anything\nat present except the barn floor and the kitchen pump\nwaste pipe. I won't say that it contains all\nto do outside of the kitchen pump and the barn floor.\nI cannot think of anything else that would\nup the specifications for this\nall these items. I believe he included\nand the kitchen pump. I saw the\nwork being done. One of the contracts\nspecifications and I read only the\nnoon hour. I did not see the\nopportunity unless I intruded\nhave an opportunity to read the\ntime to see whether it included\nobjection to Sub\nthe unfair statement\nI read the\nwas a\nAccording to the premises it was necessary to read part of them and saw all I wanted to see; I was going to kick before reading the specifications over enough of them. I did not read it all at that time, but I telephoned Mr. Smith saying that it looked as though it were unsatisfactory. Mr. Smith said it was in Inspector Jamieson's hands.\n\nInspector Jamieson did not give me an opportunity to complain to him. I went to the proper authority, to Mr. Smith. I did not meet Mr. Smith to do the running around. The man came started the work after a certain length of time. In the meantime I heard from Mr. Smith to the effect that he had not done anything, and who else could I go to? That was the action I took in the matter.\n\nThe work has been improperly done. The shingles have laid 4 inches to the weather, but they were laid too low. I will say that some of the shingles have been laid too low. It must have been in order to prevent chimney leaks. That is done very partly cemented. I spoke to someone that this year, but it has not been done; there was nothing put instead of being renewed was a new door. I will overlook the Inspector has made, but the cedar posts to be put under the dining room has glazing room.\ndoor they gave no key to call. These keys (produced) in dining room (produced) \"All locks and knobs necessary\"; that was not done. The concrete was done in the cellar, but the cellar holds water, water gets into the cellar. I do not know how the water gets in. I presume there was a drain there, because it was previously dry. I think they must have covered up the drain, that is the only presumption I can give you in the matter. The next was the cistern. \"The top of the brick lining...... cement mortar\" It was only built up and cemented, not with bricks as it calls for. The sink pipe is also very unsanitary. It leads into the pipe in the cistern. The kitchen sink slope thrown down there run around the pipe, and go into the cistern. It should have a (shows plan) This is the overflow of the cistern that all slopes thrown in there run back. If you there you will see it run back in there today, in Q-What next?

As the work was complained to Mr. was not done that sink frame I thought it Inspector, but he said that time to get up his rights. Th\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6223, file 483-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nTo MR. McGIBBON: I have been teacher fourteen years; I think it was 1905 that I went in this house, in November, that would be eight years last month; it would be seven years previous to the agreement. I have lived in the same house, excepting for some four months. I had no trouble with the roof previous to entering into this agreement, but you could see that the roof was getting old. The pump was not working all the preceding summer. I keep a horse, that is why I want the stable. I might say there was a hole through the stable floor and once in backing the horse out she put her foot through.\n\nRev. James F. Park, sworn, examined by MR. HOLLINRAKE:\n\nI am a clergymen at Chawaken. I know Mr. Clarke, and know where he lives. I have been there about 2\u00bd years. I have been at Mr. Clark's home frequently. I remember the time when the house was being repaired. I remember Mr. Clark complaining to Mr. Jamieson about the specifications and repairs. I heard them talking frequently. Mr. Jamieson did not seem to want to discuss the question at all. He looked around the rooms and said the contractors said it was finished, and Mr. Clark asked him if he would not make an examination of the work, but he did not do so, and at that time there had been no inspection of the work at all. Evidently he thought what the contractors said was all right. He would not inspect it at that time. I happened to be in Mr. Clark's that evening. I noticed the verandah floor; you had to watch carefully, a person might easily break his leg. The house was in a pretty dilapidated condition. The water is quite rily in the cistern now; Mr. Clark poured water into the sink, and I could see the water dripping into the cistern, and what was more serious than that was no trap; the fermentation was considerable, it came right into the kitchen.\n\nCross-examined by MR. HEYD:\n\nI do not know where this waste from the sink goes to. Mr. Clark tells me it is out in the yard.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6223, file 483-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI am not sure that it has any outlet. I can say that there is no trap at the waste pipe. Mr. Clark poured some water in the sink, and I noticed some trickling into the cistern from some place. I had to light a match to see, and the water in the cistern was a whitish color. I did not take a sample of it. Mr. Clark said the work was wrong and he wanted to show Mr. Jamieson the work. Mr. Clark was objecting to the work. Mr. Jamieson did not want to examine the work apparently. I could not say how long it was after the work was completed. I did not keep any tab at all on what they were doing. I just happened to be at Mr. Clark's that evening. The verandah floor was bad before it was repaired. So far as I can see it is all right since.\n\nTo MR. HOLLINRAKE: Mr. Clark would have told Mr. Jamieson what the defects were, and they both got a little angry. Mr. Jamieson would not listen. He said the contractors had told him the work was finished.\n\nD E F K N G K.\n\nJ. G. Jamieson, sworn, examined by MR. HEYD:\n\nI am Inspector of Works on the Reserve. I got authority from the Council to examine this house. The Chiefs in Council authorised me. That is the authority. (reads), I went to Mr. Clark's residence, and we had a conversation. That is what he wrote out. (Exhibit 3). It is in Mr. Clark's handwriting giving everything he wanted. He did not mention afterwards to me about repairing the barn floor and the kitchen pump. I disagree with him on that. If he had mentioned it there is no reason why it wouldn't go right down there too. I drew the specifications according to that list. That is a copy. I drew all these specifications according to the items in Exhibit 3. I drew them up to the best of my ability. I had no ill-will or ill-feeling against him. There was no conspiracy. This part here (describes) is copied from the Indian Department forms, right up to here. That is a copy given to me to be followed by the Indian Department down to \"Ottawa.\"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 1C, Volume 6223, file 483-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThen I reported to the Council. They authorized me to get tenders, and I went down to Mrs. Clark, and asked her what they wanted, and she showed me some of them. That was before I saw Mr. Clark. Before I saw Mr. Clark, Mrs. Clark had told me a great many things she wanted to have repaired. I saw her before I saw Mr. Clark, and reported to the Council. I reported that it would cost more than $20.00, and then I was instructed to prepare the plans and specifications. I reported what Mrs. Clark wanted on June 4th. They authorized me to get tenders, and on November 6th, they were opened. I advertised two or three weeks. I did not report what Mr. Clark wanted. I just went there, and asked him to get me a list so I could prepare the plans. I then reported to the Council what they wanted and that it would be more than $20.00, and they instructed me to get tenders. I advertised by posting up notices all over the Reserve. I let all possible contractors know about it. There is a list of those who tendered, and on November 6th, 1912, they were opened. J. Thomas $193.00, A. E. Hill $215., R. Martin $248., Smith & Son $277.75. The Council accepted Thomas' tender of $193.00. Thomas is a chief, and a good contractor, a good reliable man. He took the job according to the specifications, except one, this part that is scratched off. We had this fixed before the contract was let. I altered the specifications a little bit by striking out some on the last page. It was struck out because it had been done before the contract was let. His tender was for $193.00 with those two items struck out. He then went to work and first got the necessary materials. He engaged men to do the work; they were competent men. I think he finished the work according to the specifications. I was there while the work was being done most every day, and I saw it was being done according to specifications. When the work was done it was according to specifications, excepting a few changes. There was the waste pipe; when we were first discussing the repairs we thought the waste pipe from the sink would go from the cistern into the overflow, right through the cistern.\n\nIndian Affairs (RC 10, Volume 6223, file 483-8, part 1)\nWe discussed the matter, and I presume it was by Mr. Clark's own knowledge then we changed it to go around this other way. It cost a little more and more piping. When it was first discussed with Mr. Clark the idea was to run the pipe through the cistern, and I thought it would be better to have the pipe run around the cistern. I think we made a proper job, and it cost more money. It was his own suggestion that the pipe should run into the overflow. The other change made in the specifications was in the door, the glass door of the dining room. It was his own request. I understand that the whole door should be left there, but to repair it, and put the new door in between the kitchen/pantry, and they did it. I understood we were simply to repair the dining room door. We put a new door in between the kitchen and pantry. I had no conversation with Mr. Clark about the dining room door. It was to be a new door in the dining room. He did not want to have a new door, but to have the old door repaired and remain there, though I thought a new one would be better. The contractors told me he wanted the old door to remain there, and to have a new door between the kitchen and the pantry, so that was done. I do not know anything about the shingles not being laid 4 inches to the weather; I have not measured. I did not go over that with a rule. It looks alright. I do not know anything about the leak, where one of the chimneys is flashed. I cannot say about the cedar posts to be put under the verandah, for I was not there when the joists were put in. It can be seen by taking up the floor. They had the verandah floor fixed before I got there. I took their word for the work. The contractors tell me that the knobs and locks were all repaired. I did not examine it. The concrete work in the cellar is all right. I do not know why the water should come in. The drain cannot be covered up because I don't think they were there.\n\nQ\u2014The specifications say cistern was to be taken out 12 inches and made three inches above the old level? A\u2014It was not of brick. It was made of good concrete. I could make a...\nJob of the concrete. I do not know about the sash being painted. We discussed about the weinscotting and the doors. It didn't say anything about painting the sashes. I engaged my son-in-law to inspect the pump. He is David Holder; he is one of the Six Nations Indians, and my son-in-law. He took out the pump and put in a new leather. It cost $2.50 to get that done. I don't know about it not working. Nothing was mentioned about the barn floor. It is my opinion that, barring these few little items, the job was done in every way, first class. Mr. Clark did make objections, and want further alterations and additions done; repairs to the front door, kitchen door and replacing pump in the kitchen. He made no complaint then about the things he is complaining of today. The Council then refused to make any alterations to the teacher's residence.\n\nExhibit 4 produced.\n\nCross-examined by MR. HOLINRAKE:\n\nI am the Inspector on the Indian Reserve. I have been Inspector about 17 years, 16 or 17 years. I was a farmer before. I inspect everything, culverts, houses and fences. I am not a farmer now, though that is my trade. It was brought to my attention as inspector that there were certain repairs required on this house, sometime I think prior to May 1912. I do not know about the School Board entering into an agreement with Mr. Clark to keep up all necessary repairs to his house and barn. I did not know much about it until I got my instructions from the Council. That is a certified copy that the Council decided to do the work providing the cost did not exceed $20.00. You cannot do much repairs for $30.00. It was left to me if the cost would exceed $20.00 to call for tenders. That was on May 14th 1912. It was perhaps a month later that I went to see the place, probably about the beginning of June. I went and saw the place and decided I would call for tenders. The Minute Book will show when I called for tenders.\nThere is\u2014\n\nHOLLINRAKE: It would\n\nNovember 1912 that I called\n\nstances over which I had no control.\n\nadvertise for tenders before.

I went up on one side, and they were laying them all right. I cannot remember whether they were laying them 4 inches to the weather. That is something that is always specified. I can't remember whether I took the trouble to see if there were 4 inches to the weather. That was the only time I went up on the rough. There is asbestos paper underneath the shingles; I saw that. I do not know about the chimney that is leaking. This is the first I have heard of that.\n\nQ--What about the verandah floor, what about these joists of the verandah floor (reads) A--That was not done, it was at three joists; there was timber joists in it before, but after we took up the floor we found it was all right. I cannot tell you whether there were any cedar posts put in. I was not there when they were fixing it. I was there when they were taken up. I was there when they got them done. I was there most every day. I did not look at that. There were no posts out at all.\n\nQ--we will come down to these doors, what do the specifications call for (Reads \"Renew...........\") A--That was \"One dining room door........Glass panel\"; that was not because, by Mr. Clark's consent they put that door there but a new door between the pantry and the kitchen. The contractors spoke to him about it; I never spoke to Mr. Clark about it. I was told about it. There was no new door put in the bedroom, that was repaired. I did not speak to Mr. Clark. I was not working for Mr. Clark. I would not accept what the contractors told me. I thought it was all right the way they wanted it; I think we showed a good deal to these people. They put on good locks, not the locks. I do not know how many new locks were put on. There were locks on all the doors. There are different locks. There were quite a few done the work on this was George Currie. Two men knew that five.\nbrother of Hilton Hill's. \"Locks and knobs with two keys\", that would be new locks. I did not get new locks; I do not know that we got two keys. There was a drain in the cellar. I did not go down when the contractors were laying the concrete in the cellar. I was there every day. The drain is in another part of the cellar I believe. I don't think the cellar fills with water. I do not know why the water gets in there. It was not my business to see that the contractors did not fill up the drain, at least I am not certain about that. I cannot account for the water getting in. I would not let them fill up the drain if I saw them.\n\nThe cistern is right close to the house, and there was to be a waste pipe put in from the sink, and we ran that into the over-flow from the cistern. Mr. Clark has never complained of that to me. I do not know that he has complained to others. The waste pipe was run that way at his suggestion. The suggestion was made between Mr. Clark and myself to go from the cistern into the waste pipe. It went around the cistern. I knew he made a suggestion because we were discussing it, and we ran around the cistern into the waste pipe. Mr. Clark did not complain about it.\n\nWhat is a trap? I am not a plumber, and do not know what a trap is. I do not know what a trap is. Perhaps I have seen traps before, and never knew the name of it. I did not hear anything from the sink to keep the gases from coming up. The traps are entirely new to me, never had occasion to have anything to do with them. I do not know that they are used down there. We did not put a trap in. I took Mr. Clark's suggestions. He did not make any suggestion about a trap, but he did about going around the cistern. (Mr. Hollinrake reads \"Interior woodwork....\")\n\nI did not inspect that work. I cannot account for the windows. The window sash and the window sashes were not installed by me.

It says in the specifications that the waste pipe should be long enough to overlap at least two feet, and that is right; it overlaps just the same; the only change is going around instead of through the cistern. Mr. Clark made no complaint when the work was being done on the dining room door. Afterwards when I went to complete my inspection Mr. Clark was so ugly I wanted to lick him. He did not treat me as a gentleman. He did not complain about this door; for it was at his request the dining room door was left, and the new door put between the kitchen and the pantry. I think I have given this work my best care so far as I can see.\n\nMR. HOILLINHANE: (Reads letter from Mr. G.J. Smith)\n\nI do not know what these delays are. It was always better to report to the Council what I found to be the case.\n\nTo MR. HEYD: I never got notice of what the Council decided to do; it was quite a while after that I knew what they had done.\n\nMr. Thomas, sworn, examined by MR. HEYD:\n\nI am a contractor. I tendered on these specifications. I agreed to do the work for something like $193.00. I received the specifications from Mr. Jamieson, and figured on the work. Albert I went to see Mr. Edward Hill, he lives quite close by there, and he and I agreed to go the work in partnership, and another thing, I was afraid to go on because of the time of the year; it was rainy weather and stormy. Hill and I took the job together. When we got notice from the Department of their sanction, I went over there one day and fixed up the scaffold and got everything ready, and it was kind of rainy then and we did not know whether we dare go to work or not. We left everything ready to go on, but I live quite a ways from there so I went home. Hill and I started to work, I did not go back the next day; Albert Hill started the work then. When I got there again they had shingled one side of the roof and part of the other. The shingles were missing to\nSpecifications. They were laid 4 inches to the weather. I do not know whether it was 4 inches or 5 inches. They are not laid at different lengths to the weather. I do not know whether they are 4\u00bd inches or 5 inches. I think it was a little more than 4 inches, but I don't remember how much; not very much. I suppose it is all done that way right through, but I do not know. Hill did the work on the verandah floor; so far as I can see it is done properly. I don't think I saw the joists for the verandah floor. I knew about the trap door in the verandah floor. I left the whole thing to Hill; I bought the material. I helped to do the concrete work in the cellar. It was done in a good and proper way, according to the specifications. I knew about the doors in the kitchen and dining room. First it was to be two new doors, so when we fetched the door, the light was not long enough to satisfy Mr. Clark, so we came into town here, I forget where we changed it. I took it to the planing mill anyway; when we took it back it did not come to the right length, and Mr. Clark said it didn't give so much light as the old one, so we agreed myself and Mr. Clark, to bring that new door between the kitchen and the pantry; we always like to satisfy the occupant. He wanted the new one put between the kitchen and the pantry, and we agreed to do it. I heard Mr. Clark request that it be put between the kitchen and the pantry, and leave the old dining room door where it was. We did it at his suggestion. So far as I can remember the locks and knobs on the doors were according to specifications. The cement work was done in the cellar. Mr. Hill was in the cellar. I was kept watching the mixing. Mr. Clark did not make any complaint about the sink to me. Mr. Hill painted the sash in the kitchen. I cannot say about it not being painted; Mr. Hill did that work. I was not there nearly every day, for I had a lot of other things to do, that is why I went in with Mr. Hill as partner. There are a lot of things Mr. Clark complained about that ought to be done which are outside the specifications. I know he complained...\ntwo or three months afterwards about the door.\n\nTo MR. MCGIBBON: To my knowledge he did not complain about the work while it was being done.\n\nTo MR. HENDY: To my knowledge I did not hear him complaining while the work was being done, but I heard him complaining about things that should have been included. He wanted other things that were not in the specifications. We took note of other things and brought it before the Council but they would not authorize it. I cannot remember about him complaining of the work we were doing.\n\nCross-examined by MR. HOLLINRAKE:\n\nI did not work on that job very long. I put one day on the work, but I can't remember that I put two. My work was to bring all the materials there, then I left it to Hill. I was there once in a while; all the work I did was on the cellar. I left the whole thing to him. I do not know very much about the rest of it, outside of the cellar. Then I remember putting a door in the floor of the verandah. I do not remember of anything else. I did some work and brought the material there. I did some work in mixing the cement. I put the door on the verandah. I hardly think I did anything else. I do not know about the rest of the work to my own knowledge. Albert Hill put in a tender, but my tender was lower than his, but I turned the work over to him. He is a brother of Hilton Hill. I am one of the chiefs. Before we commenced the cellar I went down. I did not see the drain there. I did not take any particular notice. I cannot say that I knew the drain was in the cellar.\n\nTo MR. MCGIBBON: I cannot just remember whether I saw the drain in the cellar. If I had thought the thing was there I might have taken more particular notice.\n\nTo MR. HOLLINRAKE: I was down the cellar when the work was being done. I was mixing the cement, and one of the hired men took it down; I mixed it outside. I went down before\nthey started but afterwards we dared not stop on the soft cement.\n\nI went down after the cement was hard. Before we commenced I\nwent down the cellar, then we were mixing outside, and had one\nfellow who carried it down to Mr. Hill, and the work was\ncommenced. He laid it, and they completed it, and it got hard\nand then I went down; I could see a little from the outside,\nbut I did not go down until it was hard. I tell you I left\neverything to Mr. Hill.\n\nTo MR. McGIBSON: I am a chief. We give contracts to\nchiefs on the reserve. This is not my first contract from the\nCouncil. I have been a chief for the last 20 years. I have had\na lot of jobs.\n\nTo MR. HOLLINRACE: I always like to do a good job.\n\nAlbert Hill, sworn, examined by MR. HEID:\n\nI took the contract with the last witness to do this work, at\nleast I tendered along with others, and he got it, then he and I\nwent into partnership to do the work together. He got the\nmaterials. I did the work according to specifications.\n\nAccording to my memory we did the shingling according to\nspecifications. It strikes me the shingles were 4\u00bd inches to\nthe weather. I think it was 4\u00bd inches. I would not be positive\nwhether it was 4 inches or 4\u00bd inches. We put the asbestos\nunderneath, and I think we did a good workmanlike job.\n\n(Reads \"Joists in floors\") That was partly done; when the floor\nwas taken up there it did not appear necessary to put in the\ncedar posts. We found that the material there was suitable\nand not decayed, and that we could use it. There was a new stick\nof timber there, and we laid a new course of joists so there\nwould be closer bearings in the length of the floor. The old\nverandah joist had one single course in the centre, so we placed\nanother course in front. We did not put in any new posts because\nit didn't require it. We finished the verandah in a proper\nmanner. We put the trap door in. We did not put the hinges in\nin the trap door because Mr. Clark said it would be better to have no hinges to save people from tripping over it.\n\n\"Kitchen doors\" I did not know there was any call for a kitchen door. We put a new panel door in and repaired the dining room door. At Mr. Clark's request we put another door into the pantry, the door we had brought for the dining room, and we repaired the dining room door. So the repairs in the dining room door were extra, and we did that at his request. We fixed the glass in the dining room door. We placed new locks on the front door, and repaired those that were damaged. \"Locks and knobs with two keys\" We put new locks in the front door with two keys, and repaired the rest. We did what was necessary. So far as I know the cement in the cellar was done in a proper manner. I do not know anything about covering up a drain; the drain is in a different part of the cellar. We put the floor in the front part, and there is no drain there. If the water subsequently got in it was through no fault of ours. In the first place father owned that house, and there was no drain in that part of the cellar. The drain in the cellar is to carry off the water from the cellar out into the road. We were never near that; we had no repairs whatever to do in that part of the cellar. It is 15 or 16 feet from where we did the concrete work. We cemented the cistern. There was no brick that required taking down, and instead of putting down the brick top that was asked for we put a cement top. We did that in a good workmanlike manner. We did the sink pipe in the kitchen as they required us to do. When we looked into it, we found it would have to go over the cistern, and we went in another direction, which made it a good deal longer. It was done with Mr. Clark's knowledge and consent. We ran the pipe two feet into the cistern. It could not be possible for the water to get into the cistern unless the old drain was closed up. We had nothing to do with the old drains. I don't remember whether we painted the sash in the windows. I think if there was any painting called for it was done.\nIt would be a simple matter to paint it. I did the work to\nthe best of my knowledge. My men were carrying out my\ninstructions to the best of my knowledge. Mr. Clark saw me there,\nHe did not raise any objection about the way I was doing the work.\nI was the man in charge. Mr. Clark wanted the work built, but\nthat was after the contract was completed. He complained that\nthere should have been other things included. Then there was\nsomething about a front door that should have been repaired;\nthat was an oversight on his part. He was regretting that it\nhad not been included, otherwise he had no complaint. I never\nheard any complaint from Mr. Clark.\n\nCross-examined by MR. HOLLINRAKE:\n\nI tendered on this job, but I didn't get the contract.\nThomas got it, and we went into a partnership arrangement. I\nhave worked with him on other jobs. I helped him to build\nNo. 4 and No. 7 schools. He is one of the chiefs. He gets\nquite a number of jobs from the Council, and I have helped him\nto build some of them. It strikes me the shingles are 4 1/2\ninches to the weather. I would not believe that they are 6 inches\nin some cases. They are not 6 inches. It sometimes happens\nin finishing up a roof that you have to spread out a little. I\nbelieve on a large contract it is an important thing to have\nthem 4 inches to the weather. If I get work to do I am\ncontracting all the time. I do not get a great deal of work. A\ngreat deal depends upon the pitch of the roof whether the shingles\nshould be laid 4 inches to the weather. If it was a flat roof\nthey might not have shingles at all. As I said before the\nshingles might be 5 inches to the weather up near the ridge, so\nyou could work out your courses properly.\n\nThe joists on the verandah floor are laid lengthwise.\nI suppose the verandah would be about 30 feet. By the prammer\nthere is some support under the joists; on the outside course\nthere is, laid on blocks. The blocks are situated under the\nstick of timber that is laid in the front. The joists are\ncarried by your trimmer. They were 16 feet\u2014joists. They are\non the trimmer. There is nothing underneath them on the centre\njoists, courses. The old support is on the outside timber, which is\nfar better than putting it on cedar posts or anything else. It\nwas not required to put cedar posts in. \"Joists for verandah\nfloor........5' cedar posts\" We did not do that but placed a\ntrimmer instead of it.\n\nI do not know how large a light was of glass was in that\ndoor. The door we originally brought for the dining room was put\nin the pantry. We were not going to put in very small panes\nof glass. I do not know how much glass is in the present\ndining rooms door; I do not know as it was mentioned in the\nspecifications. We put on new locks where it was required. We\nput a new one in the front door. We gave them two keys, they\ncost 75 cents. This house has been repaired several times; I\nthink this is about the third time since Mr. Clark's has\nbeen in it. We put a new waste pipe in there. It did not\ncall for a trap. I do not think that is necessary, not in the\nposition that the sink is. A trap is to cut off the draughts\nof air from the waste pipe. It might be quite a number of shapes,\nI did not think it was necessary there. I do think it is\nnecessary some places. I do not have it in my own house. We ran\nthis pipe right into the overflow of the cistern. We had\nnothing to do about whether the overflow was running right\nor not. Instructions were to run it into the drain, and we did so.\nIt was supposed to be running properly. I did not pay any\nattention to it. Mr. Clark complained about these doors, when he\nfound it was an oversight in leaving them out of the specifications.\nHe objected to the little bit of light in the dining room, and\nThomas brought it back and exchanged it for another.\n\nMr. John Clark to MR. HOLLINRAKE:\nI did not consent in any way to that dining room door\nbeing patched up, and the other put in the pantry, for I was not\nat home at the time.\nThey never told me about it. I objected to Hill about it. I objected to the waste pipe going into the over-flow; it was not done under my instructions. I do not know that I mentioned the matter of trap to him. The night that Jamieson called at the house he did not wish to come inside the door, and I asked him in and persisted that he come in. He would not sit down; he said that he came in to look over the work. I had just come in from school and asked him if he had his specifications, and he said No, the contractors said they had done all. I said \"Mr. Jamieson, are you inspector, or do you take the contractors word and he immediately turned in a heated manner, and went out; he never sat down.\n\nTo MR. HEYD: I was not hot myself. Any person would be agitated over it. I asked for a waste pipe, and waste pipe includes a trap if it is properly put in. I did not have a waste pipe before. I suppose it was the suggestion of the Inspector of works that the waste pipe should run into the over-flow. I objected at the time it was put there, to the Inspector; I objected before it was put in. He would not give me any answer at all.\n\nCase Closed.\n\nCertified,\n\n[Signature]\n\nStenographer.\nI went to the trouble of going to Oshawa and looked over the house with the School Board and pointed out certain repairs which I considered should be done. The Board assented to the repairs suggested by me which I expect have been performed. By the kindness which I believe you will observe Mr. Clark has lived in this house since 1905. Such being the case it is difficult to understand why the house raises so much objection. To the house which has very recently been repaired I trust nothing further will be heard from Mr. Clark on this subject.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nCharles Melgibson\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nReferring to letter to me dated November 19/13 file # 15483-3 - 5-A\n\nI beg to state that as per instructions I have an investigation relating to the repairs to teachers' houses at Oshawa and O'Connor. The repairs fairly well performed and do not consider Mr. Clark justified in making the complaints he has submitted.\n\nThe house has been occupied some years and it is a very different matter to repair an old house satisfactorily. I am satisfied that if it was possible to provide all the teachers on the different reserves with as good houses as this house is that Mr. Clark complains so much about a much better class of teachers would surely be secured.\nIndian Office, Brantford,\nMarch 29, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose the minutes of special Council held on\nthe 9th of February and also minutes of general council held\non the 2nd of March and subsequent dates and to report thereon\nas follows:\n\nNo. 19.\n\nThe teacher's residence at Onweken since Mr. Clark left\nhas not been occupied and the Council decided to rent it to Asa\nR.

It does not appear to me either wise or consistent to import Jews to the Reserve to compete with our Indian storekeepers while, on the other hand, white people are ordered off. I suppose the Council demands the ten dollars rent they are to receive but if this resolution is approved Fredlander should sign a definite agreement with me on behalf of the Department to go at a week's notice at anytime I consider he should without any question of why or wherefore. If such a man once establishes a domicile on the Reserve it will be both difficult and costly to remove him and to get rid of him, as in the case of Doolittle. I suggest that this resolution be neither approved or refused until I have had an opportunity to interview this man and report further to the Department.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Moved by Robert Hill seconded by James Martin, that further consideration of the claim of Isaac Dortator to the Teachers residence be laid over for one month. Carried.\n\n14. This is an old dispute and will be reported upon when the full circumstances in relation to it are brought out at the next Council.\n\nMajor E. P. Randle\nSupt. Six Nations.\nSIX NATIONS MINUTES OF COUNCIL MEETING HELD SEPT. 3RD, 1936.\n\nNo. 12.\n\nMoved by Wm. Smith seconded by Ambrose Hill\n\nThat in the application of Isaac Doxtator asking to be reimbursed for having invested and lost a sum of money with members of the old Council, that same be not allowed.\n\nCarried.\n\nThis is an old claim of which the Department may have some recollection. Isaac Doxtator loaned the old Chiefs in 1921, $500.00 and in return received a Quit Claim on the house known as the Teachers residence in Ohsweken. Apparently the money was not paid into band funds, but used to finance a trip to England by the late Levi General, to press some claims to the Crown.\n\nDoxtator occupied the residence referred to for four years or more without his rights being questioned. But on the elective system being instituted, the new Council passed a resolution dispossessing him of the residence which received the approval of the Department. It is impossible for me to rightly judge all the circumstances of something which happened so far back, but it has the appearance of an individual's right to some consideration and justice, being completely submerged in the intense struggle between the old and new times. However, the Department will appreciate the situation with their past knowledge better than I can, though in my opinion on compassionate grounds, Doxtator's small pension of $25.00 a year might have been increased a little, to compensate him slightly for the loss of all he possessed, in perhaps a mistaken cause.\n\nE. P. Randle,\nSupt. Six Nations.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nIt quite evident and it seems too bad to let this case go without consideration.\n\nI am quite convinced that Mr. Smith has just claim he was evicted from his home which has since been sold by the council for $1000 around about 1929. I can not see where it might not be a precedent or some claim for I know of no parallel case to this.\n\nAs the council have a minute Sept 8, 1936 not allowing the claim... I regret to attempt to go over their head about this matter but I quite feel in all fairness to the old Gentleman who has a wife to keep at his age of 83 years.\n\nI am convinced that your department should inquire into the justice of the case and offer at least some redress and am quite conscious of the seriousness of recommending to their council a course to pursue but from the Public interest I feel that restitution should be made.\n\nI feel that restitution should be made immediately. Give this your immediate consideration. I am yours Truly,\n\nGeo. E. Wood M.P.\nBrant.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nDear Mr. McGill,\n\nMy attention has been called to an appeal from Isaac Dovtate, an elderly Six Nation Indian in regard to a claim that I think should be taken up by your department and given some guidance in all fairness to British justice.\n\nIt seems Isaac Dovtate had advanced money to the old chief council in 1921, which was the recognized authority for administration at that time and in lieu of this money amounting to $625.00, he was promised a house and lot was conveyed to certain property a house and lot was conveyed to him Dovtate in which a quit claim deed was given by the then council.\n\nNow owing to the difference of opinion that exists now among the Six Nations regarding the system of electing council or retaining the old system of chiefs they develop so rapidly especially when a case as old as this comes up.\n\nAs to how that money was spent whether wisely or otherwise, I do not think enters into the case. The system of administration at that time should be recognized and their oath given honored and I feel that if this council had recognized the claim and settled it would have helped to heal a breach and given recognition to the spirit of tolerance which in general...\nEX'D.\n\nSeptember 21st, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Wood,\n\nI have your letter of the 14th September dealing with the matter of recouping Levi Doxtator of the Six Nations Reserve for money advanced by him some years ago, previous to the adoption of the Indian Advancement Act on the Reserve.\n\nThe question of reimbursing Doxtator has been gone into a number of times and, while we have no doubt that he advanced the money in good faith, it was not for purposes that could be countenanced by the Department.\n\nIt is true that the Department could override the decision of the elective council of the Six Nations but I would hesitate to recommend to the Honourable the Superintendent General the exercise of such arbitrary powers in a matter that would ordinarily come within the autonomous jurisdiction of the elective council.\n\nIn the event of the Superintendent of the Six Nations reporting Doxtator to be in need of relief, any necessary assistance will be authorized and paid for out of appropriation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nGeorge E.

P. Randle\n\nMajor E. P. Randle.\nSupt. Six Nations.\nSecretary of Department of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have been consulted on behalf of Isaac Doxtater, an Indian residing on the Reserve here at Brantford. It appears that in 1921 he purchased from the then hereditary Chiefs a portion of land and premises known as Teacher's Residence at Ohsweken and paid the sum of $625.00. He resided on the premises until the Spring of 1925. In the interval there had been a change in the method of Government on the Reserve and an elective council became the governing authority rather than the hereditary chiefs. In the Spring of 1925, six months after the new council took office, they dispossessed this old gentleman of the property. Since that time he has been endeavoring without a great deal of success to obtain some redress. The action for dispossession was taken by the then local Superintendent, Col. Morgan, and Doxtater finally left the place on the 1st day of May, 1925. He holds a proper quit claim deed from the Chiefs and he is now in very serious circumstances and except for a small old age pension, which he receives, is without any means of support. Personally, it appears that this man has suffered a great injustice and I feel that if this matter was brought to the proper authorities at Ottawa, his case would be fairly dealt with. If you wish me to forward the quit claim deed, I would be glad to do so. It was approved by the Council on the 1st day of August, 1921.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTrepanier and Hagey.\n\nHLH/EC\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6223, file 483-8, part 2)\nMay 1, 1937.\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe wrote to you on April 6 last on behalf of one Isaac Doxtater. Since then we have not heard from you in the matter.\n\nWe feel that we cannot urge too strongly the unfair situation that this old gentleman finds himself in. He bought the property in good faith from the proper authorities in 1921, had possession and title to the same for over four years. The new Council then dispossessed him of the property. It is true, of course, that there was a strong feeling existing on the Reserve concerning the change in the method of the administration. As far as Doxtater was concerned, he was not involved in this, but he is now called upon to suffer in his old age by the very unfair attitude adopted by the present governing body.\n\nMr. George Wood, the representative of Brant in the Federal House, has been in to see the writer concerning the matter. It appears that he has investigated it also, and feels that a great injustice has been done. Personally, we feel that your Department should either cause the present Council to re-imburse Doxtater, or if this is not within your rights, that the Indian Department then should take some action.\n\nWe would appreciate hearing from you at your earliest opportunity with regard to this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTrepanier and Hagey\n\nPer: [Signature]\n\nHLH/MC\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, May 5th, 1937.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st of May, dealing with the matter of recouping Levi Doxtater of the Six Nations Reserve for money advanced by him some years ago, previous to the adoption of the Indian Advancement Act on the Reserve.\n\nThe question of reimbursing Doxtater has been gone into a number of times and, while we have no doubt that he advanced the money in good faith, it was not for purposes that could be countenanced by the Department.\n\nIt is true that the Department could override the decision of the elective council of the Six Nations but I would hesitate to recommend to the Honourable the Minister the exercise of such arbitrary powers in a matter that would ordinarily come within the autonomous jurisdiction of the elective council.\n\nThe Superintendent of the Six Nations Reserve was instructed that if this aged Indian was in need of assistance that he was to be given relief and this has been done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.R.L.

That the season for hauling heavy materials for these school houses is past and that No. 5 School Section have a School House which serves the purpose up to the present time and is good enough to serve the purpose which is required for some time yet and so it was decided to abandon the Idea of building a new School House for No. 3 at present.\n\n2.
