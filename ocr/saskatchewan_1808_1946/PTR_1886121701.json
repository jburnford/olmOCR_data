D. MAVEETY\nPRINCE ALBERT, N. W. T.\nFRIDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1886.\n\nJ. D. MAVEETY, PROPRIETOR.\n\nTHIS PAPER may be found at\nROWELL & CO.'s Newspaper Advertising Office, Prince Albert, N.W.T., or at any place where newspapers are sold.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 17, 1886.\n\nTHE LIBERAL IDEA OF INDEPENDENCE.\n\nSome of the members of the Liberal Association here are a little nettled because, in our last issue, we undertook the very important task of exposing the present-day Canadian Liberalism. It is true, The Times should have no political leaning, but we thought it best to do so, as the call themselves claim the right to form a party association, nominate a party candidate, and exercise jurisdiction that the electors of their constituency as a whole, and the friends of the Government, shall unite in one voice, and state how promptly they will act when warranted their assertions. The Times must say nothing. They claim for themselves the right to criticize others, a free people, while they deny the poor, struggling newspaper man\u2014the man who must think for himself\u2014who is called to enlighten his fellow citizens, to the creation of political thought\u2014the free expression of opinion\u2014freedom of thought is to prevail in this country whatever will become of us? But it will not. We are not free, nor are we likely to remain free, or polite, with the liberality our friends of the Liberal Association only exert over the right which they possess as free men to form an association and nominate a candidate. But when they did so they showed their party spirit, and the spirit which is also known in a public way their allegiance to Mr. Blake\u2014and they should be the last to protest against the right of others to have taken a stand quite opposite, and we claim the privilege of differing with them. Mr. Blake's policy, as we understand it, is supported by Liberals; but it is also opposed by Conservatives and others who belong to no party. We cannot consent to duty to oppose the candidacy who will support, not oppose, the government, and in doing so feel satisfied that we will serve the best interests of the province or the people of Saskatchewan. Of course, in doing so we have the satisfaction of knowing that we are acting according to our convictions. We took a liking for the G.O.M. in our youth, and the longer he lives the more we like him.\n\nFor Mr. Laird, personally, we have the greatest respect, and if he enters the contest we do doubt very much whether he will enter the race, but we are opposed with the utmost conviction. But we are opposed to him on local and political grounds, and we shall use every legitimate means to defeat him.\n\nMANHOOD SURFACE.\n\nIn starting on our career as a Paper it would be a very wise act on the part of the Dominion Government to give the privilege of voting to all those who have been born and raised in the Northwest for six months, and who have been citizens of the United Kingdom for five years. This would have the advantage of at once placing the franchise on the same basis as that of Ontario and Quebec, and obviating all subsequent alterations. It would start political parties in the race for power on a common platform, and put an end to the strife and dissension which has characterized the political contests of the Northwest. The settlers of the Northwest are not like a people who have been educated in the schools of responsible government. The great majority of them have been brought up without the advantages of education, and are consequently with their duties as a free people. Were it otherwise, manhood suffrage would have been of effect in placing the ballot in the hands of the ignorant, and enable them to override the intelligence of the country. Nothing is more certain than that the result of Canadian elections always depends upon the intelligence of the voters. A democracy cannot exist where there is no intelligence, and where there is no intelligence there can be no democracy. The result of Canadian elections always depends upon the intelligence of the voters. A democracy cannot exist where there is no intelligence, and where there is no intelligence there can be no democracy.\n\nEDITORIAL NOTES.\n\nAs the Municipal elections are approaching candidates should be forthwith nominated.\n\nThe meeting of the Manitoba Legislative Council, which was to have taken place yesterday, has been postponed owing to the uncertainty which exists about some of the details of the election, ballot boxes having mysteriously disappeared in some cases, and records being placed in others.\n\nWe last week received important news of \"Lord\" David Laird's election. \"This is to be treated in nine volumes, and will be a valuable work. Vol. 8 will be devoted to the Northwest.\"\n\nThe Liberal party are doing more now than ever before. If the intentions of the leading party may be trusted, the Liberals of the Northwest will never be visited with such an afflicting experience. Our party should be able to meet the situation with the air of confidence.\n\nWe learn from the Winnipeg Free Press that Lord David Laird has received a large number of letters from his constituents, that \"Liberalism is answered by a good majority,\" and that \"the Tory organization is declining.\" We quote these statements in the hope of giving a fair average for the Free Press; the result of the election will prove to be far beyond the truth.\n\nWe have received a communication from Mr. J. M. Cameron, of Edmonton, Alberta, in reply to M.C. Cameron, M.P., who reviews that gentleman's speech, taken up in the House of Commons, and says that he is only garbling facts, and that he does not convey an impression exactly the opposite of that which they were intended to convey. Mr. Cameron says that he fears he will not retire from public life, now that his political usefulness is gone.\n\nThe question of the election is decided, and we believe that we have found talent enough from which to select a representative, and that the Conservative party is a great mistake, which will make its mark in Till's store, Prince Albert, on Tuesday afternoon. We trust that the Liberal party will take advantage of the friends of the Government present, and that unanimity of purpose employed, as we have seen in the past, will be successful, made here and elsewhere that the friends of the Government in Saskatchewan are united, and that we shall have no reason to doubt that the friends of the Government in Saskatchewan have no need to go anywhere else than the sea for a candidate, but that they will elect a good man and elect him.\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS.\n\nA PACIFIC WAY OF PUTTING IT.\n\nTo the Editor of The Times:\n\nI am glad to see that the Conservatives of the district are about to organize in view of the Dominion elections. As the Liberal party have sent to Prince Albert several delegates, I am afraid that the Conservatives will find one somewhere around Vancouver Island. It is impossible even to come into play among local electorates, why not the Pacific.\n\nINDEPENDENCE.\n\nA LITTLE INQUIRER.\n\nFor the Editor of The Times.\n\nI am interested in the future of the Territorial Government, and I believe that the Liberals of Prince Albert have nominated Mr. David Laird, of P.E.I. If that statement is altogether correct, Mr. Laird will be elected in his native Province. Or is he one of the Wreckers? If so, stamp him out, and let him know that we know him best, and looking to find himself on the people of Saskatchewan. For my part, I am convinced that the man who has to have his native Province in quest of a place to rest his political ambitions in the lower regions as superior to Carrot River. If we cannot represent ourselves in the Lower Regions, then let us go to the North, where there is less latitude for Saskatchewanists! He is one who is destined to be a leader of the Northwest, but he must find his place, and let us hope that he will find it.\n\nWe want no political adventurers, but honest, hardworking, independent Nominees\u2014a local man and a friend of the Government and we will vote for him.\n\nCARROT RIVER.\n\nD.
