If accepted, kindly wire me reply collect.\n\nOn this we do not know just what we are getting. A few things needed are - spray nozzle, fuel line, oil lubricator, thermometer, fuel pump, injection pump, all governor springs, 2 main bearings, air intake valve, water pump, oil and grease fittings, 2 head gaskets injection push rods, and we do not know what the inside is like.\n\nRe generator - no name plate - 7KW with pulley.\n\nWe would offer one hundred and ten ($110.00) for this.\n\nRe water system Robinson Myers 391554, Motor H 62776.\n\nWe offer Twenty-five ($25.00) dollars for this.\n\nThese offers are for any or all of these articles.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThompson Bros.\n\nPer B.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith letter received from Thompson Brothers Garage, Spiritwood, Saskatchewan, making an offer of $100.00 for the engine, $110.00 for the Generator, and $25.00 for the motor for the water pump of the Onion Lake Church of England Residential School destroyed by fire.\n\nThe articles in question were salvaged and examined by Mr. Mitchell of the Surveys and Engineering Branch who, I understand, placed a valuation upon them. I do not know what valuation Mr. Mitchell gave and I am therefore not making any recommendation as to the advisability of selling at the prices offered.\n\nIt would appear to me that it might be advisable to have Indian Agent Cameron make enquiries in the district to ascertain whether or not there are others who might wish to quote on the equipment in question.\n\nI have a copy of Mr. Christianson's letter, file No. 309-11 AGE., dated April 17th, 1944, in which he states he was attaching a list of the equipment salvaged from that school. There is no copy of the list on file here and I do not know its contents. When at the Onion Lake Agency recently I discussed this with Mr. Cameron and he informed me that a list had been sent Mr. Christianson. I was not aware at that time that there was not a copy of this kept on file at this office. I later called on Thompson Brothers of Spiritwood and the visit of Mr. Thompson to the Onion Lake Reserve to examine the equipment and make an offer was on my suggestion.\n\nJ.P.B.

Your sincere consideration in this matter would be appreciated, as the senior pupils need to be fully occupied apart from their academic studies in the class room.\n\nIt would also be appreciated if this matter could be considered as most urgent.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n(Rev. Henry Ellis)\nOttawa, November 16, 1945.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to interior painting at the St. Alban's School.\n\nI do not understand from your letter if the amount of $450.00 is required for material alone or if this includes labour as well. In either case the cost of the materials will be more than $50.00 and consequently, as you are aware, the order will have to be placed through the Departmental Purchasing Agent. Please let me know the quantity and colour of the paint which you consider is needed.\n\nI trust that the employment of senior pupils to do the work will not bring criticism from the parents.

I feel that I am having a fast one pulled on me, and this is the reason why I think so.\n\nAbout two months ago Rev. Ellis, the Anglican Indian School in Prince Albert and I exchanged mangles with the understanding that he receive One hundred and thirty-five dollars ($135.00) less Twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for my mangle and he would pay the freight on the school mangle to Melfort. Now he claims that I wasn't, but an even trade.\n\nCommon sense will tell you that it couldn't be when I paid One hundred dollars ($100.00) out of my gratuity money for my mangle and had sixty-one dollars ($61.00) worth of work done also to make an even trade or a mangle that is an old make in the first place and also not knowing what shape it is in it just isn't so.\n\nSo you see Sir it couldn't possibly have been an even trade on my part for I would not have made an even trade in the first place.\n\nSo let I would like a check for Sixty dollars and if that is not forthcoming to authorize Mr. Ellis at the Anglican school to return my mangle.\nPlease treat this as urgent. I would prefer to have my message back. Thank you.\n\nYours Truly,\nMelfort, Saskatchewan\n\nPer J.A. Witter.\nMr. J. A.

Neary\n\nIn connection with a discussion we had the last time I was in Ottawa, accompanied by Mr. Ramage of the Public Works Department I visited the site of Ex-Army Camp 128, Basic Training Centre, Prince Albert, which is to be vacated shortly. Some of the buildings presently in use have been used temporarily and some are deteriorating fast as the result of abuses.\n\nThere is a man by the name of Eustace Kertin, a veteran of the First Great War and a pensioner, who is living in one of the buildings and has been giving them what care he is able to give them, besides looking after a good orchard and garden on the premises. It would appear to me that the first action which should be taken is to have all of the buildings turned over to the Department of Public Works and have Mr. Kertin appointed on a salary to take care of them. By this action they will receive no further damage and not be subjected to theft such as resulted at the R.C.A.F. Station at North Battleford between the time that the Department of National Health and Welfare considered taking some of them over for hospital purposes and the time that a man was actually appointed to take care of them.\n\nThere are many buildings which could be made suitable for school purposes as an annex to the St. Alban's Indian Residential School or as an Indian residential school separate from St. Alban's School, according to Departmental intent. Naturally it would be advisable to have a suitable location of buildings adjacent to each other and this can be more conveniently carried out if all of the buildings are under the Department of Public Works for redistribution.\n\nJ.P.B.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nMy predecessor was very keen on providing motion picture projectors in all our schools and had managed to collect from various organizations and private funds a sufficient amount to meet about half the estimated requirements. He had hoped that the schools might raise the remaining half from some source or other but this has proved to be out of the question because few, if any, of our schools have any fund which they could devote to this, or any other, purpose.\n\nIn my view, motion picture projectors should be considered a valuable training aid and, in consequence, should be supplied by the Department in the same way as other educational requirements.\n\nI understand that, although this type of equipment is not authorized as a class-room supply generally, you are prepared to cooperate at this time to the extent of paying half of the cost of a projector for one of our schools. The cost is approximately $300 per 16 mm projector from Crawley Films, Ottawa, for reconditioned War Assets machines plus extra for screen, and, as I would like to take advantage of your offer, I would be glad if you would have an order placed for a 16 mm projector with screen to be delivered to St. Alban's Indian Residential School, Prince Albert, Sask.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

The only relief from the overcrowding is obtained by sending all boys but two to sleep in the former army barracks. Two little boys were being permitted to sleep in the junior girls' dormitory. They are very little boys, but I have pointed out the possibilities for exaggeration.\n\nEven for the hundred girls who are housed (or rather \"scraped up\") in the building, the sleeping accommodation and the sanitary arrangements are a sorry spectacle. There are too few windows, and even these are filled with blocks to preclude their being opened wide.\n\nPlumbing fixtures are too few in number, and are not well maintained.\n\nThe general effect is depressing to the inmates, both children and staff, as the cluttered state of things does not inspire them to keep things ship-shape. At 4 p.m. I found some girls still languidly sweeping up, even though the air was a little stale.\n\nThe bathrooms are not appropriate for an institution of this type. They contain the usual three pieces. The porcelain in nearly every case was \"frowzy.\" I looked in vain for their house. The supervisor said they must have fixed up the nation\"\u2014obviously some time ago.\n\nIn the boys' toilets the seats have been removed although urinals are provided. They did, however, have toilet tissue in two of the three compartments.\n\nIndian Affairs.

There aren't enough windows. Rooms are at the four compass points.\n\nMiss Altwater is going to attempt an issue of tests (which is not often used) so that I may administer the test in spelling.

Residential School.\n\nFrom time to time since the main building at the school was burned there have been requests from different people in the Onion Lake District as to the intention of the Department with regard to selling the buildings which were left. In view of this fact the only safe way to offer these buildings for sale is by proper advertising, which, I understand, had to be done through the War Assets Corporation.\n\nIf it is possible to take action to sell the buildings without reference to the War Assets Corporation I would recommend that Indian Superintendent J.A. Davis, of the Meadow Lake Agency, be instructed to mail notices to all those who have expressed an interest in the purchase of any of the buildings, asking them to submit competitive bids direct to the Department. I am certainly in favour of selling the barn, garage, and chimney if they can be sold at a fair price, as the cost of dismantling them to use the lumber in our work would be prohibitive.\n\nJ.P.B.

Residential School.\n\nThis matter was discussed with Mr. J.D. Gardner, Director, Lands & Buildings Department, War Assets Corporation, Ottawa, and he was non-committal about granting permission for local disposal of the barn, garage and chimney. He intimated that due to insufficient description he could not very well grant authority for the Indian Affairs to proceed with the sale. It would, therefore, be appreciated if a more or less full description be given of the barn, garage and chimney and also their exact location for identification purposes. It is also requested that some estimated value be placed on same which would assist him in making a decision as to whether it would be possible to grant the Indian Affairs the necessary authority to proceed with the sale locally by securing bids from interested parties.\n\nW.

It is my feeling that the Bishop should at least meet the major share of these costs.\n\nWhen the lease was renewed, the following letter was sent to Bishop Martin on December 6, 1948:\n\n\"You will recall our recent discussion with regard to the renewal of the lease on the above building. In reviewing our files, I find that Mr. Roey wrote you as follows on December 23, 1943:\n\n'I have noticed Your Lordship's reference to taxes, and the city levy appears to me to be very reasonable. Would it be acceptable to the Diocese if we spent a minimum of $2,000.00 on the school, in lieu of rent, for the year 1944, and allowed you the sum of $2,000.00 annually for the next 4 years, on the understanding that any repairs that might be necessary would be undertaken either by the Diocese or by the Principal and that the taxes also would be paid by the Diocese? If this allowance is acceptable to you, it might be advisable to submit a voucher for one half the amount semi-annually.'\n\n\"I understand that this lease was to run for the period of five calendar years and that it will expire on December 31, 1948.\n\n\"In view of increased costs of repairs and general rental rises, I would like to suggest that the amount of $2,500.00 a year be considered as the amount of the new lease on this building for the next five years. I would also like to suggest, in view of the possibility of the Department purchasing this building, that the lease be subject to cancellation by either party after one year's notice.\"\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOttawa, April 5, 1949.\n\nDear Bishop Martin:\n\nOnion Lake (St. Alban's) Residential School.\n\nI have just been advised by Mr. Ostrander that an expenditure of $2,178.79 will be immediately necessary in order to meet the requirements of the Provincial Fire Inspector at the above building.\n\nThe fire inspection report covered eleven items which required attention and we have only been able to take care of three of these up to the present time. Mr. Ostrander has forwarded a tender from Mr. W.I. Dier of Prince Albert in the amount stated above, and advises that the St. Alban's building is very dangerous from the point of view of fire hazard. He recommends that this work be carried out immediately.\n\nYou will recall that we met the cost of another major repair job on this building some five years ago and deducted it from the annual rental. In order to expedite the work on this building, would it be agreeable to you if we had these repairs and alterations carried out at once? We can then pay the account and deduct the cost from the annual rental due you for the 1949 calendar year.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDirector.\n\nRight Rev. H.D.

I fully concur in your finding that this work should be carried out immediately. In this connection, I do wish Mr. Ostrander had kindly given me the opportunity of discussing this most important matter with him before forwarding to you his findings; because, as I say, I had no idea that such conditions existed.\n\nNow with regard to the cost. Again there is nothing else we can do but carry out what is suggested by you in your letter, although I rather thought that the Department would like to come to our help, at least to some extent, to meet this very heavy cost. I wonder if you could see your way to help us in this regard? I have kept in fairly close touch with this school since the death of the Principal, Mr. Fisher, and I am fully convinced of the good work it is doing for our Indian children; and, of course, my great ambition for this building is that it be taken over by the Government and used for the providing of higher education to Indian boys and girls here in the West who show signs of being capable of absorbing such education. The building is admirably situated for this purpose in every regard; and I trust that in the not too distant future my hopes in connection with this school may be realized.\n\nWith Easter Greetings,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Dier, Builder and Contractor, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, who offers to do the work required at a cost of $2,178.79.\nAs mentioned above, this is a rented building and the care of the children is under the direction of the M.S.C.C. However, I feel that Indian Affairs Branch shares the responsibility for proper fire protection in the building, and consequently, I recommend that the tender of Mr. W.I. Dier be accepted, and that the Department allow $1,000.00 towards the cost of the work and the balance, namely $1,178.79, be deducted from the rental allowed for the building during the calendar year 1949. I may add that I have communicated with Bishop Martin, and I believe he will be satisfied with the above arrangement.\n\nDirector.\nSend the following message, subject to the conditions on the back thereof, which are hereby agreed to.\n\nOttawa, April 23, 1949.\n\nMr. R.J.

The other\nchimney is 4'7\" x 4'3\" x 7'4\" in height with\napproximately 6940 bricks. For a dismantling proposition\nI doubt whether we could get more than $95.00 for these\nchimneys. It would be difficult to fall them due to\ntheir position in the burned out building. The implement\nshed is 20'x40' frame, 3/4 pitch shingled roof, three\ntrack doors, and on cement footing. This building is in\na fair state of repair and would value same as a moving\nproposition at $225.00. The garage, 18' x 18', frame,\n7' studding, 1/3 pitch roof, shingled, two track doors,\ndouble boarded and sided, value same as a moving\nproposition, $250. The barn, 30'x66', 2\" x6\"x14\" studs,\nhiproofed, shingles, re-inforced double, spruce floor in\nloft, hay track and carrier, five double horse-stalls,\nnineteen stanchion cowstalls, eighteen lights, barn\nre-inforced with 6\"x6\" posts holding 6\"x8\" sills.

Vincent,\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis will acknowledge your letter of June 17th with reference to the question of granting permission to the Indian Affairs Branch of your Department to dispose of a barn, garage, chimneys, etc., at the former Onion Lake C.E. Residential School, Sask., as agents for the Corporation.\n\nCareful consideration has been given to this request but it does not seem desirable that War Assets Corporation should grant this permission unless in very exceptional circumstances and this particular case can hardly be considered to come within that category.\n\nWe have on one or two occasions granted permission to your Department to act as our agent for the sale of buildings, and as late as June 3rd I wrote to Mr. Pratt on this matter in respect to certain buildings at the Pasqua Indian Reserve, copy of my letter is attached for your ready reference. The factors which I mentioned in that letter would apply in a large measure to the present case and my answer must be the same.\n\nHowever, we do desire to co-operate with your Department to the fullest extent possible in respect to the buildings at your Indian Reserves, and for this purpose the following procedure is suggested which would allow the sale to be conducted in a large measure under the supervision and advice of your Mr. Davis.\n\nIt is suggested that the following procedure be followed:-\n\n1. Your Department should make a declaration in the ordinary way to War Assets Corporation of the property which is surplus and to be sold.\n2. This Department of War Assets Corporation will process the declaration in the ordinary way and in this connection we can use Mr. Davis' report of May 31st as to the structure and condition of the buildings as the basis of our valuation.\n\n3. We will issue tender notices to be posted according to our regular procedure in local post offices in the vicinity, and in addition we will supply Mr. Davis with a number of the tender notices which he can distribute to parties which he feels might be interested.\n\n4. As a condition of the sale we will specify that all interested parties are to apply to Mr. Davis for permission to inspect the surplus properties offered for sale.\n\n5. On receipt of the bids we will select the purchaser, secure his money and the necessary restoration deposit. We will then advise Mr. Davis of the successful bidder and send him the custodian copy of the sales order and the necessary handover certificate for signature by the purchaser. Mr. Davis can supervise delivery to the purchaser and return us the handover certificate. He could then satisfy himself that the property is removed and the restoration of site carried out in a manner satisfactory to him. In due course he can advise us and we will then be in a position to restore the restoration deposit to the purchaser.\n\nIt seems to me that this would be a satisfactory procedure for disposal of any Indian Reserve property and if it meets with your approval we will be glad to have the declaration in due course.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd) J.

Symes, of Frenchman Butte, Saskatchewan, for the pig pen at the site of the old Onion Lake C.E. Indian Residential School.\n\nMr. Symes originally offered $50.00 for this building, which I did not think was enough, and I asked Indian Superintendent Davis to endeavour to get other quotations. He was not able to get other quotations, but Mr. Symes subsequently increased his offer to $85.00, of which I would recommend acceptance.\n\nThe material in this building is worth more than $85.00, but the building has been constructed in such a manner, with the sills, plates, and studding bound solidly into the concrete floor, that there will be a great loss of material in dismantling it, which is the reason that it was not very attractive for sale purposes.\n\nJ.P.B.

It will be noted that Mr. Wilfred Amirault offers $80.00 for this building. Both Superintendent Davis and Regional Supervisor Ostrander state that this is a very old building, and both of them consider that the offer should be accepted.\n\nIn connection with this matter, I would refer you to the memorandum which you received from War Assets Corporation dated June 22nd, 1949.

The staff of the school at this date includes the following members:\n   Rev. J. R. Matheson, as principal;\n   Mrs. E. B. Matheson, M.D., medical attendant;\n   Miss Smith, girls' matron;\n   Miss Gladys Matheson, boys' matron;\n   Joseph Chamberlin, teacher;\n   Maria Money, cook.\n\nThe day of inspection was Joseph Chamberlin's last day as teacher, and on the following day his duties were assumed by Miss Gladys Matheson in addition to her work as boys' matron. This arrangement may, however, be only temporary.\n\nAdmissions and discharges.\n\n2.

The pupils are graded in their school work as follows:\n\n| Treaty pupils | Non-treaty pupils |\n|---------------|------------------|\n| Boys          | Girls            | Total | Boys | Girls | Total |\n| St. I         | 6                | 3     | 9    | 5     | 5     | 10    |\n| St. II        | 1                | 1     | 2    | 1     | 2     | 3     |\n| St. III       | -                | -     | -    | 1     | 3     | 4     |\n| St. IV        | -                | 1     | 1    | -     | 1     | 1     |\n| St. V         | -                | 1     | 1    | -     | 1     | -     |\n| Total         | 7                | 6     | 13   | 7     | 11    | 18    |\n\nProgress in studies.\n\n5. Fair progress has been made in reading, writing, number work, geography and language. The progress of the senior classes is more decided than that of the beginners, with whom the methods employed by the teacher count for much. The general tone of the work is only fair; the pupils are moderately attentive and diligent; but there is no enthusiasm. Physical exercises of all kinds have latterly been neglected, but will be resumed at once under Miss Matheson's direction.\n\nThe pupils are tidy in their clothing and general appearance, and orderly in their conduct.\n\nTeacher.\n\n6. Joseph Chamberlin, who has had charge of the class-room for about eight months, is an ex-pupil of the Battleford industrial school. He has passed the teachers' non-professional third-class examination, but has had no normal training. He leaves now to continue his studies, and after passing the second-class examin-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6323, file 658-6, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nC. of E. Boarding School,\nOnion Lake.\n\nation he intends taking a course of normal training, after which he will probably return to his present position in this school. He is a cripple owing to an attack some ten years ago of infantile paralysis or something of that nature, and is able to move around only with crutches; but he is intellectually bright and is treated with due respect by the pupils.\n\nThroughout the quarter ended June 30th last the class-work was conducted by Miss Armstrong, a temporary member of the staff, who was not a trained nor experienced teacher, and who appears to have had but little aptitude for the duties.\n\nMiss Matheson, who now takes charge of the class-work, is merely returning to her former duties, after an interval of about a year spent in a course of hospital training. She has had no normal training; but her natural aptitude for her duties is exceptionally good; she has picked up some of the best methods with beginners; and she infuses considerable energy into the work of all the classes. I visited the class-room again on Apr. 2nd for the special purpose of observing her methods of conducting the work.\n\nClass-room and equipment.\n\n7. The class-room affords ample space, good lighting and good ventilation. It is a cold room, but adequate provision is made for heating in two large box stoves and a large supply of good fuel. There are two entrances to the room, one for the boys and one for the girls.\n\nI have said above that the conduct of the pupils is good; but in the condition of the pupils' desks and a portion of the school material there are evidences of some rudeness among the pupils at some time during the past year. A few of the desks are damaged, and half a dozen new ones would be required; while the slates and\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6323, file 658-6, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nbooks give indications of careless handling. These are for the most part the property of the Principal, as are also more than half the desks.\n\nDormitories.\n\n8. The dormitories afford sufficient air-space; and though there is no regular system of ventilation yet by the careful use of doors and windows a fairly pure atmosphere appears to be maintained. However, so far as the older building, or girls' residence, is concerned the condition in which the atmosphere is kept depends largely upon the effort and diligence of the staff; and I cannot say that this building, either as regards the dormitory or the building generally, complies with the Department's requirements. The boys' residence is constructed on a more modern plan and there are better facilities for ventilation.\n\nHeating.\n\n9. Neither building has stone or concrete foundation, nor any basement except a small vegetable cellar; and the buildings are heated throughout by wood stoves. Good, dry wood is liberally supplied, and the buildings are well heated.\n\nFire escapes.\n\n10. The girls' buildings is but two storeys in height, and so well provided with means of exit that special fire escapes are quite unnecessary. The boys' building is of three storeys, all above the ground. The dormitory is in the third storey, and there is but one exit, namely, by a stairway situated in the middle of the building. A folding steel ladder was to have been provided some time ago, but it has not been done. However, the Principal assures me that such a fire escape will be installed without delay; and the Agent states that he will see to it that this matter is not neglected.\n11. There is a small but suitable building, situated at a distance of about 100 yards from the residence buildings, which some years ago was fitted up for hospital purposes and has from time to time been utilized as such by Dr. Matheson in connection with her duties as medical attendant both to the school and to the reserve. It has been occupied in the case of infectious diseases among the pupils, and for both infectious and non-infectious diseases among the Indians of the reserve generally, and has served a good purpose at times.\n\nIndustrial training.\n\n12. Though there is no formal instruction in any industry, yet there are adequate facilities for training in the usual range of industries by actual practice. The training of the girls is at present much better than that of the boys. Special attention has latterly been given to sewing and knitting; and on the whole the girls are receiving a useful training. As for the boys, they are rather too small for instruction in anything but a very limited range of agricultural industry; yet in the care of a few head of stock and in gardening they have sufficient practice. A sufficient number of cows and horses are kept, and a sufficient area of garden is worked, for the actual requirements of the school; and this work is done under the direction of an intelligent labouring man who is employed in connection with the school and mission, but who is not included in paragraph 1 above as a regular member of the staff.\n13. Since my last inspection, or at least since April 1st last, no instruction has been given in hygiene, calisthenics, physical drill, or any of the subjects outlined in the latter part of Clause 9 of the Agreement which came into effect Apr. 1st, 1911. The teacher who now takes charge will, however, give instruction in at least some of these branches, and in all to the best of her ability. The Principal expresses it as his intention to live up to the spirit and intent of this agreement.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nOnion Lake,\nApril 2nd, 1912.\nREPORT on the INSPECTION of the ONION LAKE\nCHURCH OF ENGLAND BOARDING SCHOOL.\n\nFrom April 1st, 1912, to March 31st, 1914.\n\nDate of inspection, March 31st, 1914.\n\nStaff.\n\n1. The staff is composed of -\nRev. J. R. Matheson, as principal;\nDr. E. B. Matheson, matron and medical attendant;\nMiss Rema Matheson, assistant matron;\nMiss Leita Matheson, teacher;\nMrs. A. J. Hanson, house-keeper;\nMiss Carrie Money, (pupil), cook.\n\nAttendance.\n\n2. The attendance is as follows:\nAuthorized attendance of Indian boarders, 18\nActual attendance (enrolment) \" \" 13\nPresent in classes at inspection, 11.\n\nOne pupil, Carrie Money, who is about 16 years of age, is constantly employed in the residence, giving very satisfactory service as cook; while one boy, Jeffrey Quinney, was absent without leave on the reserve, his father promising, however, to bring him back at once.\n\nThere are also in attendance 6 non-grant-earning boarders and 2 day pupils, 7 of whom were present at inspection.\nGrading of pupils.\n\n3. The pupils are graded in their classwork as follows:\n\n| Standard | Boys | Girls | Total |\n|----------|------|-------|-------|\n| I        | 3    | 1     | 4     |\n| II       | 1    | 1     | 2     |\n| III      | 3    | -     | 3     |\n| IV       | 2    | -     | 2     |\n| V        | -    | 2     | 2     |\n| Total    | 9    | 4     | 13    |\n\nExamination of classes.\n\n4. The examination, which included reading, dictation, language, numbers, geography, and written exercises on slates and paper, was generally satisfactory.\n\nThe pupils read intelligently, with some expression, and with a rather good pronunciation.\n\nThey write dictation with a fair degree of ease and accuracy, as their ears appear to be accustomed to the language from daily association in classes and at recreation with English speaking children.\n\nThey speak English with some freedom and confidence, and use it moderately well in written composition.\n\nNumber work is taught in a practical way, and good results are being attained.\n\nThe pupils of the fourth and fifth standards show a general and superficial acquaintance with the physical and general geography of the world, and a somewhat closer acquaintance with that of North America. Maps are constantly used.\n\nSinging, hygiene and physical exercises have a place in the time-table; but in these the pupils were not examined on this occasion.\n5. The teacher, Miss Leita Matheson, is but 18 years of age and has had no special training for her work. She has, however, fair scholarship and is unusually well adapted to the work of the school-room. She is alert and energetic, and has easy and complete control of her classes. A lively interest is created and well sustained. Her education was received in part at St. Alban's College, at Prince Albert, where well qualified teachers are always employed; and her methods, if largely suggested from her own experiences as a student, are rather well adapted and successfully employed.\n\n6. The main buildings consist of a girls' residence and a boys' residence. The former includes the staff's quarters and the dining rooms, while the class-room is in the boys' building.\n\nThe girls' residence has been enlarged from an ordinary mission dwelling by frequent additions during the past twenty years, until it has come to cover considerable ground but is devoid of uniform plan or adaptation to its present use. It consists in part of two storeys and in part of one; it has no substantial foundation and only a partially excavated basement. It is heated by wood stoves, lighted by lamps, and is dependent mainly on the use of doors and windows for ventilation.\n\nThe boys' residence is of three storeys, was erected about eight years ago, and is in several respects a building better suited to its purpose than the one last described. It contains, on the ground floor, the common class-room, which is a\nspacious, well lighted and well ventilated room.\n\nA log building, which had for some time past been used as a store room, was destroyed by fire early in the spring.\n\nThere is a suitable and fairly well equipped hospital, standing at a distance of some 75 yards from the other buildings, which has at times served a good purpose for the isolation of pupils suffering from measles.\n\nAccommodation and equipment.\n\n7. For the present reduced attendance, or for the authorized attendance of 18 grant-earning pupils, the present buildings, so far as space and equipment are concerned, afford ample accommodation.\n\nFire protection.\n\n8. The fire-fighting appliances on hand are inconsiderable; but there is some protection in the isolation of the buildings, the residences being about 60 yards apart. In case of fire the building in which it originated would in all probability be destroyed; but there is safe means of escape for all the occupants under any circumstances.\n\nClass-room equipment.\n\n9. The class-room is furnished with two large box stoves, suitably situated to heat the entire room with a fair degree of uniformity. It is furnished with a full supply of pupils' desks, a teacher's table, 2 chairs, stationery cupboard, and a small organ. There is a rather complete supply of maps, but some of them are in poor condition, being much the worse for use. The blackboard is of slated cloth, of sufficient dimensions, 80 sq. ft., and neatly mounted and\nframed; but like slated cloth generally, it takes the chalk poorly and the writing is always indistinct and at times scarcely legible. In my opinion it should be replaced by a similar area of Hyloplate board, which could be inserted in the present frame and moulding.\n\nLive stock.\n\n10. The live stock includes 4 horses, 2 cows, 4 pigs, 30 hens and 6 turkeys. The Principal formerly kept a herd of cattle outside the reserve, from which he derived his beef supply; but these have recently been disposed of.\n\nGarden produce.\n\n11. No farming is done in connection with the school; but a fairly good garden is cultivated, producing a supply of roots and vegetables which is usually sufficient, as it proved during the past season.\n\nThe Principal's health.\n\n12. Owing to advancing years and failing health Mr. Matheson is not by any means as energetic in the management of his affairs as he once was; and he appears to be anxious to be relieved of the care of the institution. In such a case it is doubtful whether another competent man could be found to undertake it; and it is possible, and would probably be best, that it should be continued as a day school.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nBattleford,\nJune 30th, 1914.\nI have the honour to submit a report on the inspection of the Church of England Boarding School at Onion Lake.\n\nThe inspection was made at the end of March; and I regret that owing to the pressure of other work I have not been able to make this report at an earlier date.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI have the honor to submit my report on an inspection of the Church of England Boarding School, at Onion Lake, made on the 15th ultimo.\n\n1. The staff is but slightly changed since last inspection, which was made on the 1st of March, 1914. It is composed as follows:\n\n   Rev. J. R. Matheson, Principal;\n   Mrs. E. B. Manson, M.D., Matron and Medical Attendant.\n   Miss A. L. Cunningham, Teacher, and Boys' Matron.\n   Miss Emma Matheson, Girls' Matron.\n   Miss Tandy, Cook.\n\n2.

Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nI have the honor to submit my report on an inspection of the Church of England Boarding School, at Onion Lake, made on the 15th ultimo.\n\n1. The staff is but slightly changed since last inspection, which was made on the 1st of March, 1915. It is composed as follows:\n\n   Rev. J. B. Matheson, Principal,\n   Mrs. E. B. Manson, M.D., Matron and Medical Attendant.\n   Miss A. L. Cunningham, Teacher, and Boys' Matron.\n   Miss Emma Matheson, Girls' Matron.\n   Miss Tandy, Cook.\n\n2.

For class-work the pupils were graded as follows:\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Sect. Gen. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nStandard I. 2 Treaty, 5 Non-Treaty, Total 14\nStandard II. 5 6 11\nStandard III. 3 3 9\nStandard IV. 4 2 6\nStandard V. 1 0 1\n\nTotal 21 18 39\n\nTeacher -\n\nThe teacher, Miss A. L. Cunningham, holds First Year Standing in Manitoba University. She has no special training for teaching but has had years experience, all in Indian Schools, namely Lac La Bonge, Cross Lake and Island Lake. Miss Cunningham displays great earnestness and enthusiasm in her work, has complete control of her classes, good methods of presenting work to pupils of all grades, and a view to the ultimate aim in connection with all the exercises of the school-room and all her duties.\n\nExamination of Classes -\n\nSatisfactory progress has been made in reading, dictation, writing, language and geography. The pupils have a good practical use of English, according to their different grades, and give evidence of a fair understanding of what they read. They read with some expression and a good pronunciation. They show a good elementary acquaintance with local and general geography. Their familiarity with numbers is practical and useful as far as it goes; but even in Standard IV it is limited to operations in the simple rules and with integers alone, or fractions of the simplest description. The pupils' writing shows steady improvement; but little attention has been given...\nto drawing, owing to the fact that the Teacher's time is too fully occupied with other subjects.\n\nPhysical exercises and drills are practiced regularly, but hygiene has been taught only incidentally in connection with other lessons and with general routine.\n\nA time-table is on hand, but the subjects are not all fully provided for. The Teacher's attention was called to this, which will be remedied.\n\nIt is a difficult matter to follow out a fixed order and apportionment of time when the subjects and the classes are so numerous. Miss Cunningham has evidently been making the best use of her time and that of the pupils; but it will be helpful at least to have all the subjects represented on the time-table and a due proportion of time allotted to them.\n\nClass Room -\n\n6. This is a spacious room affording ample floor-space and air-space; it is well lighted, well ventilated and is comfortably heated in any kind of weather with two large box stoves.\n\nThe class-room is well equipped with 20 double pupils' desks, teacher's table and chair, organ, stationary cupboard, 95 sq. ft. of Nylol-plate black board, a terrestrial globe and wall maps of the hemispheres, Canada, North America and Europe.\n\nMain Building -\n\n7. The main building is a frame structure 50' x 80', of 2 stories, and a small basement. For foundation the building rests on\nmud-sills, the roof is of wood shingles, a balcony extends along 50 feet of the south side. The interior finish is of lumber and the building is painted, both the interior and exterior; but in many parts the building is in need of renewing. The building as it stands at present consists of a small original dwelling house, which has been enlarged to its present proportions by numerous additions.\n\nFurther alterations and additions are still being made and some improvements in the interior arrangements are also being effected; but there is still such a lack of unity in the interior plan that it cannot be said that the building is either convenient or in any respect well adapted to its present purpose. The one advantage is that for the present attendance at least, it has all necessary capacity and air-space.\n\nThis building contains:\n\n- Quarters for the Principal and his family\n- Pupils' Dining Room\n- Staff's Dining Room\n- Kitchen\n- Girls' Dormitory\n- Office\n- Dispensary\n\nBoys' Building - The Boys' building is also a frame structure 30' x 40', and of three stories. The foundation is of heavy sills resting on substantial blocks. It is covered with rubber roofing. There are two exterior entrances on the ground floor and one on the second floor. The inter-\nfor of the walls is finished with lumber and the ceilings with metal; and the building is painted throughout.\n\nThe building is generally in good repair, except that it is hard to heat, in consequence of the shrinking of the lumber in the walls.\n\nIt contains the following apartments:\n\nClass-room.\nRoyal Dormitory.\nClothing Room.\nRoyal Recreation Room.\n\nLike the Class-room, which is on the ground floor, the building is heated throughout by means of box stoves.\n\nFor lighting unusually good provision is made, by numerous windows in all apartments. The only artificial light in this building, as in the main building, is furnished by coal-oil lamps.\n\nThough no complete system of ventilation is provided for, yet by the use of several devices, chiefly that of fan-lights over the windows, which is provided throughout the building, the air is readily changed and no serious difficulty is experienced in keeping it in a wholesome condition.\n\nHospital -\n\nA separate building, at about 50 yards from either of the school buildings, has for some years been devoted to hospital purposes, either for the school or for the Indians on the Reserve. It has been used for isolation cases on several occasions.\n\nIt is a properly finished log building on foundation of blocks and covered with rubber roofing. It is well lighted, heated with stoves and maintained in a sanitary condition.\nFarm & Garden -\n\n10. Some two years ago, the Principal met with an accident whereby he was deprived of the sight of one eye and since that time the out-of-door industries have been more or less neglected; and indeed the general management of the institution has devolved mainly upon the other members of the staff.\n\nThe farm products of last season consisted of a small crop of green feed. No potatoes were grown and but few other roots and vegetables. Fortunately the school was able to purchase its supplies of these articles at reasonable prices.\n\nLivestock -\n\n11. The Livestock maintained in connection with this school includes the following:\n\n- 6 Horses.\n- 2 Cows.\n- 15 Pigs.\n- 30 Pigs.\n\nThe Principal has in addition a herd of cattle, which are kept at a distance and outside of the Reserve, and from which the school's beef supply is mainly derived.\n\nManagement -\n\n12. Under present conditions the school is not being maintained within its revenue. If the attendance were larger this would be somewhat improved, and there are children in the vicinity who should be attending this school and who will probably be enrolled in the near future, as there are also a few on the Reserve at Onion Lake who should be attending the Roman Catholic School, but whose education thus far has been neglected.\n\nIndian Affairs.

J. R. Maclean, Principal\nMrs. E. E. Maclean, M.D., Medical attendant and matron.\nMiss A. L. Cunningham, Teacher\nMiss Tandy, cook.\n\nAttendance.\n\nThe total enrolment of resident children is 29. There are also non-treaty children, mostly white, attending day school to the number of 14, making a total enrolment of 43. At time of inspection there were 34 pupils present, 6 were absent of whom 5 were sick with minor ailments and 3 were visiting friends.\n\nGrading.\n\nThe treaty children are graded in classes as follows:\n\n| Grade | Boys | Girls | Total |\n|-------|------|-------|-------|\n| I     | 6    | 3     | 9     |\n| II    | 4    | 3     | 7     |\n| III   | 4    | 2     | 6     |\n| IV    |      |       |       |\n| Total | 18   | 11    | 29    |\n\nThe day non-treaty pupils are graded as follows:\n\n| Grade | Boys | Girls | Total |\n|-------|------|-------|-------|\n| I     | 2    | 1     | 3     |\n| II    | 0    | 2     | 2     |\n| III   | 2    | 2     | 4     |\n| IV    |      |       |       |\n| Total | 5    | 6     | 11    |\n\nConduct and Clothing.\n\nThe behaviour of pupils in school is very good and they are suitably and comfortably clothed.\n\nTeacher.\n\nMiss A. L. Cunningham had first years training in Manitoba University and has taught in Indian Schools for the last 5 years. She understands the temperament of the Indian child exceedingly well and is this way she is able to impart knowledge with a large degree of success. She is most enthusiastic and thorough in her work and has complete control over her pupils.\n\nExamination of Classes.\n\nA time schedule which includes all subjects taught is adhered to.\n\nReading - In Grades I and Junior II the forming of simple sentences was good.\n\nIn Grade II senior the reading was exceedingly well done.\n\nGrade III was well advanced in reading and Grades IV and V read extracts in a very fine manner.\n\nThe fact of some white children being included in the classes has a marked effect upon the Indian children. They speak out well and their pronunciation is good. From the same cause there is less difference shown by the Indian pupils in the junior forms.\n\nWriting - Samples were produced and copy books examined.\nOnion Lake Boarding School.\n\nand in most grades, especially in Grade IV the writing was exceedingly good.\n\nSpelling - Junior Grade II were asked to spell the days of the week and months of the year which they did satisfactorily.\n\nIn grades III and IV quite severe tests were given and answered very well indeed.\n\nArithmetic - In all grades they show an intelligent knowledge of their work and especially so in the higher grades where the instruction takes them into decimals.\n\nHistory - The \"Story of the Canadian People\" is being taught in higher grades and in grade III \"The Great Men of Canada\". They are also familiar with the facts of the present war. Questions were answered well and without any hesitation.\n\nGeography - In Grades III and IV questions were put on the provinces, Capitale, Rivers, Railways, etc., of Canada and were very well answered.\n\nDrawing - Samples of drawings of familiar objects were shown which were very good. In the higher grades map drawing is extra well done.\n\nHygiene - Elementary facts in Hygiene are taught in the lower grades and more advanced instruction is given in the higher grades. The teacher is taking up this work enthusiastically and giving it a prominent place in their studies.\n\nPhysical Exercises - In the summer, drill and exercises are given in the open. The pupils went through their exercises in a very able manner to organ accompaniments.\n\nClass Room.\n\nThis room is of generous dimensions with large floor space. It has 9 large windows with 12 lights, which give ample light and ventilation. It is heated by box stoves which are in good condition and the stove pipes securely fixed.\n\nThe class room is well equipped with desks, accommodation consisting of 13 double desks and several rough made desks. The latter, however, are being replaced by desks which were under order at the time of inspection. The general equipment is good, has ample blackboard and maps.\n\nBuildings\n\nThe main building is rather old and not in very good repair. The interior in many places needs repainting and, as it is at present, is anything but attractive. There have been no improvements during the past year.\n\nAmple air space is provided in the various rooms. The girls' dormitory while kept in clean condition is not at all attractive.\n\nThe question of ventilation receives careful attention. The kitchen is kept clean and tidy and is well equipped with an exceptionally good range.\n\nThe boys' dormitory is in separate building over class room. It is fairly well kept and clean. The inside decoration is not very attractive, the walls requiring attention by way of paint, etc. The ventilation is well attended to and amply provided for.\n\nThe building is heated by means of box stoves which are in good repair and smoke pipes are securely fixed.\nOnion Lake Boarding School.\n\nHospital.\n\nThis building is situated some distance from the main school buildings. It is an old log building which has been fixed up for hospital purposes and is in good repair. The inner walls are exceptionally well plastered and clean, is properly lighted and ventilated.\n\nThe building is also heated by box stoves.\n\nGardens and Livestock.\n\nI am unable to report on these as no proper information was obtainable at time of inspection. This will be fully reported upon at next inspection, as I hope to be able to see what is done in the gardens this coming summer.\n\nManagement.\n\nIt will be noted that there has been increased enrolment during the past year. The management and supervision, owing to the continued sickness of Rev. Mr. Matheson, is entirely looked after by Mrs. Matheson who also acts as doctor at Onion Lake Reserve. Her time is fully occupied and it cannot be expected that she would be able to devote much time to the supervision of the school as should be done.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector\n\nIndian Affairs.

Crombie, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nNORTH SASKATCHEWAN INSPECTORATE.\n\nReport on Inspection of Church of England Boarding School, Onion Lake, Sask.\n\nInspection visit was made on December 13th, 1917.\n\nSTAFF:\n\nMr. Henry Ellis Principal\nMrs. Ellis Matron\nMiss A. L. Cunningham Teacher\nMiss Leake Assistant teacher\nMiss Johnson Assistant Matron\nMiss Smith Cook.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF SCHOOL.\n\nThe management of this school was taken over by Mr. Henry Ellis in August, 1917. Previous to that date he was employed at the Blood Reserve Boarding School at which school Mrs. Ellis was a teacher. Mr. Ellis is a young man, who appears to possess business ability, is most enthusiastic in his work and I am of the opinion that with the assistance of Mrs. Ellis, who appears to be a competent matron, he will succeed in improving the living as well as the financial conditions of this school.\n\nTEACHERS.\n\nMiss Cunningham, who continues to teach at this school, I found to be as enthusiastic and as thorough as formerly. She keeps in touch with up-to-date methods of teaching which she applies in her work. Now that an assistant teacher has been engaged, Miss Cunningham will be able to devote more of her time to the advanced grades for which work she is fully competent and the results obtained by her are exceptionally good.\nTeachers, contd.\n\nMiss Leake, Assistant teacher, commenced her duties on December 1st, 1917. She has had former experience as a teacher of junior grades and is now taking charge of Grades I and II.\n\nPUPILS (Were Recruited)\n\nThere are 34 pupils enrolled, recruited from the following reserves:\n\n| Agency          | Reserve             | Number |\n|-----------------|---------------------|--------|\n| Onion Lake Agency | Onion Lake Reserve   | 11     |\n|                 | Frog                | 2      |\n|                 | Ministikwan         | 2      |\n|                 | Keheewin            | 1      |\n| Battleford Agency | Thunderchild's     | 1      |\n|                 | Red Pheasant's      | 10     |\n| Carlton Agency  | Mistawasis          | 5      |\n|                 | Ohtahkakoop         | 2      |\n\nTotal 34\n\nGRADING OF PUPILS.\n\nThe pupils are graded in classes as follows:\n\n| Grade | Boys | Girls | Total |\n|-------|------|-------|-------|\n| I     | 5    | 2     | 7     |\n| II    | 7    | 0     | 7     |\n| III   | 2    | 2     | 4     |\n| IV    | 2    | 4     | 6     |\n| V     | 2    | 4     | 6     |\n| VI    | 1    | 2     | 3     |\n| VII   | 1    | 0     | 1     |\n| Total | 20   | 14    | 34    |\n\nDAY PUPILS.\n\nIn addition to the Indian children there is an average of ten pupils who attend as day pupils, the majority of whom are the children of employees at Onion Lake Agency.\nADMISSIONS and DISCHARGES.\n\nIn December, 1916, the enrolment was 31 and since that time 5 children have been admitted and five discharged, leaving 34 pupils on roll at date of inspection. Of this number there were four applications awaiting the signature of parents and the approval of the Department. One pupil has been absent since the summer vacation on account of sore eyes.\n\nHEALTH and CLOTHING.\n\nAt date of Inspection the general health of the pupils was good and they were provided with comfortable clothing.\n\nEXAMINATION OF CLASSES.\n\nOwing to alterations being made to school building the classes were being held in the Dining Hall and for this reason I was unable to make the usual examination of the class work. From what I observed, however, I feel satisfied that the same high standard as formerly is being maintained. In the evening I had the pleasure of witnessing a dress rehearsal of a Patriotic Pageant which the pupils were preparing for a concert to be given by them in aid of the Red Cross. The Indian children acquitted themselves well and much credit is due the teacher for encouraging the children to assist in this good cause.\n\nCLASS ROOM.\n\nThe class room which is a large one was undergoing alterations at the time of my visit. The windows were being provided with storm sash and storm doors were also arranged for. The floor which is single boards and badly worn in places was being covered.\nClass Room, contd. \u2014\ncovered with fir flooring and the room divided\nwith a partition to provide two class rooms in\nplace of one as formerly. Box stoves were being\ndispensed with and hot air registers were being in-\nstalled to provide heat from hot air furnace in\ncourse of construction in the basement. These much\nneeded improvements will convert the class room into\ncomfortable and desirable teaching quarters.\n\nBUILDINGS.\nThe main building (photo attached marked \"A\")\nconsists of Dining Hall, Staff Dining Room and\nLiving Room, Kitchen, Indian Waiting Room and\nPrincipal's office downstairs, while upstairs is the\nGirls' Dormitory and sleeping quarters for part of\nthe staff. This building is very old and the floor\nin the large dining hall is in bad condition. The\nchildren's dining room has been enlarged by the re-\nmoval of partitions and the room is also made use\nof by the girls for sewing and recreation purposes.\nThe rooms are heated by box stoves and while the\nstove pipes are securely fixed there is great danger\nof fire from this source.\n\nThe Girls' Dormitory is 31 X 23 X 5 feet which\nprovides 5704 cubic feet, or according to regulations\naccommodation for 1140 pupils, whereas the number\nof girls enrolled is at present 14. The interior\nconditions of this Dormitory are not at all inviting\nas the walls require redecorating and the wood work\nrepainting. The room, however, is kept clean and\nthe fact of its being extra well ventilated offsets\nthe seeming overcrowding.\nI discussed with the Principal the advisability of providing additional dormitory accommodation for the girls and he proposes to use part of the staff living quarters for this purpose. By removing a partition a room 19' 4\" x 23' 4\" x 8' or 3600 cubic feet can be provided. The walls, however, are sloping and the air space is therefore somewhat restricted. This room is not provided with a sufficient number of windows and in addition a proper ventilator would require to be installed. After alterations were made the accommodation provided would not make room for more than five pupils.\n\nI note that Mr. Ellis has provided emergency pails filled with water to be used in case of fire.\n\nThe Boys' Dormitory is in the top or third floor of separate building (Photo attached marked \"B\") the ground floor being the class room while the second floor has teachers' quarters and two recreation rooms for the boys. The dormitory is now heated by hot air registers from hot air furnace which is supplemented by heat from the smoke pipe which runs up through the building to the chimney built on brackets in the boys' dormitory. The elimination of box stoves with their numerous stove pipes will now lessen the danger from fire. The dormitory is well provided with windows to which storms have recently been fitted, thus providing additional comfort. The dormitory is supplied with a large ventilator which provides ample ventilation. I discussed with Mr. Ellis the need of having additional fire escape facilities from this room in the event of exit by way of inside stairs being cut off. He agreed to provide exit from one of the windows over the roof of the balcony to outside stairs.\nBuildings, contd. -\n\nThe interior conditions of this dormitory are not inviting and some of the beds which are old are not in very good shape. The room, however, is kept clean and tidy.\n\nThe measurements of this boys' dormitory are 35' x 25' x 10'4\" which provides 9041 cubic feet of air space, or according to regulations accommodation for 16 pupils, whereas the total enrolment of boys is 20. This number, however I would not consider excessive in view of ventilation facilities in the dormitory.\n\nALTERATIONS and IMPROVEMENTS TO BUILDINGS.\n\nThe alterations to school building (marked \"b\" in attached photograph) which were in progress at the date of inspection are estimated to cost $1500. This sum includes the following:\n\n- Excavation of Basement under building.\n- Hot air furnace\n- Cement foundation under building.\n- 2 storm porches to outside doors.\n- Storm windows and doors.\n- New floor in class rooms and partition.\n- New outside stairs and platforms.\n\nGRANT EARNEING PUPILS and ACCOMMODATION.\n\nHis Lordship Bishop Newnham advises me that he would like to take up with the Department the question of getting permission to increase the number of pupils at this school to 40 provided the dormitory accommodation would permit after alterations proposed by the principal are made.\n\nThe rooms suggested for additional dormitory are at present used by Principal and his wife who figure on getting quarters in ground floor of Hospital Building if same were taken over by the mission or the Department.\nGrant Earning Pupils, etc., contd.\n\nIt will be noted that the dormitory accommodation at present provided is being made use of to capacity and over. The proposed additional Girls' dormitory would provide accommodation for 5 girls. I would respectfully suggest that the total number of pupils should not be allowed over 37.\n\nIn conversation with Mr. Milligan regarding Mistawasis Day School I found that if the school were opened now the attendance would be very small and I suggested that as it would not be advisable to re-open the school under those conditions, it would be better to allow the Principal of the C. of E. Boarding School, Onion Lake, to recruit from children at Mistawasis for his school. In this way a saving would be effected.\n\nCLASS ROOM EQUIPMENT.\n\nThe classes are furnished with a sufficient quantity of supplies and these are properly looked after by the teacher. The principal made a request for some new desks but I advised him to get along with what he had for the present. Now that the class room has been divided additional blackboard will be required and I would respectfully suggest that two pieces of Hyloplate 3' X 6' be furnished as soon as possible.\n\nLIVE STOCK and GARDEN PROVINCE.\n\nThe live stock at the school while the former principal was in charge were understood to belong to the school. It now seems that the present principal found upon arrival that the school owned no live stock whatever. He has purchased a cow.\nLive Stock, etc., Contd.\u2014\n\ncow and hopes to purchase more stock as his funds will allow. He is also without a team. The principal has also found it necessary to buy a considerable quantity of vegetables but hopes next year to be able to raise all the vegetables required for the school.\n\n\"A\"\n\n\"B\"\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nInspector.\n\nPrince Albert, Sask.,\nJanuary 30th, 1918.\nOFFICE OF THE\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nNORTH SASKATCHEWAN INSPECTORATE\n\nPrince Albert, Sask.,\nFebruary 2nd, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith Reports of Inspection made on Boarding and Day Schools in the Onion Lake Agency, as follows:\n\nC. of E.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 14th, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report of the 13th of December on the Onion Lake Anglican Boarding school.\n\nYour suggestion that the pupilage at this school should not be larger than 37 has been noted.\n\nThe request for a hyloplate blackboard has also been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIn Charge of School Branch.\n\nW.E. Crobbie, Esq.\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nCommissioner's Office,\nRegina, Sask., May 8, 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the schools included in the Union Lake Agency which I visited during the month of March last.\n\nSt. Barnabas Boarding School.\n\nI made a short visit to this school on March 26th as my time would not permit me making a comprehensive inspection. I went through the school and found it clean and well kept. The children were looking well. The school buildings are in very bad state of repair, in fact the old building is in a tumbled down condition, floors uneven, owing to the building have settled badly. There is a very great need for a new school at this point. There are 38 pupils on the roll, which is practically all they can accommodate. They have two applicants on the waiting list and an additional six & saddles who have requested admittance. I am attaching hereto District scale of wages supplied the pupils. There is only fifty acres of land in connection with this institution which is altogether inadequate for their requirements and does not provide any facilities for farming or the grazing of a sufficient number of stock. Two cows were being milked at the time of my visit, two were being purchased at an early date and two more coming in next spring, which will give them six cows to supply milk for the coming summer months. They have a large garden at this school which provides an ample supply of vegetables for their requirements.\n\nMr. H. Ellis is in charge as Principal and he impressed me as being a capable manager. Miss E. Turner who holds a first class Saskatchewan certificate has charge of the senior class room and Miss K. R. Jeannel who holds a second class teachers certificate has charge of the primary grades. The class standing of the pupils is as follows:\n\n| Standard | Number |\n|----------|--------|\n| 1        | 11     |\n| 2        | 4      |\n| 3        | 7      |\n| 4        | 7      |\n| 5        | 9      |\n\nW.M.G.\n\nInspector.\n\nNOTE:\n\nBoth these schools are doing good work, but are undoubtedly labouring under very great disadvantages through not having buildings to carry on the work. Something should be done at once to remedy matters here.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It has five windows, four rear and one left. The floor in both rooms is insufficient, but does not interfere with the left side shelf. The buildings and grounds are clean.\n\nBuildings are about 6 years old, require repair. They are needed.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\n(Under this heading the Inspector should report upon the general management of the school and offer any suggestions for improvement he may wish to make.)\n\nThis school is not located in a public school. A selection of books would be added. Besides the local and annual life pictures, historical and geographical records would prove most useful and interest to these pupils.\n\nA daily report\u2014as used in public schools\u2014should be kept in addition to the present record, which is adequate. More to resident staff to day schools. Quota of free work should be systematically kept.\n\nVery satisfactory work is being done by the teacher.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department is, of course, well aware of the conditions obtaining there.\n\nI would also draw attention to what the Inspector has to say with reference to books embracing nature study etc., and the adoption of a daily register.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\nI visited this school on February the 16th and inspected the buildings throughout. I also held a short examination in class-room work.\n\nThere are 46 pupils enrolled\u201429 boys and 17 girls. The present enrolment taxes the capacity of the school to its limit. This school is a popular one with the Indians and the Principal is continually turning down applications for admission owing to lack of room to accommodate them.\n\nTwo class-rooms are provided and each is in charge of a properly qualified teacher. The class standing of the pupils is as follows:\n\n| Standard | Number |\n|----------|--------|\n| 1        | 15     |\n| 2        | 13     |\n| 3        | 12     |\n| 4        | 11     |\n\nThe pupils appear to be making excellent progress in their classwork. A number of white children attend as day scholars and their example is an incentive to the Indian children.\n\nThe pupils had a clean and healthy appearance. The boys receive training as cadets and they look very smart in their military uniforms. The pupils were all well and warmly clad.\n\nApart from some individual cases of sickness the general health of the pupils has been good.\n\nThey are provided with an ample supply of nourishing food including meat and vegetables. There is however a shortage of milk supply. Only two cows were being milked at the time of my visit. This number will I am told be increased when spring arrives.\n\nBUILDINGS\n\nThere are two separate buildings, one for the boys and the other for the girls. The latter building has already been reported upon as being old and in a rather poor condition. I can only add that its condition is not improving and a new school will be the only remedy.\n\nI found the buildings clean and comfortably heated provided for the children.\n\nSTAFF\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Ellis is in charge as Principal. He is assisted by a man to take charge of the outdoor work, two teachers a cook and a housekeeper.\n\nMr. Ellis impresses me as being a capable manager.\n\nThe two Onion Lake Boarding schools are situated in a good centre of Indian population. I do not think that there would be much difficulty in obtaining a considerable increase in pupilage if they had the necessary accommodation.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW.

Reading is rather monotone and the tongues seem too thick for clear pronunciation. The lessons are well understood. In numbers the pupils are generally rapid and confident. Systematic work is being done in composition. Geography has been introduced, a general view has been taken of the world and Canada. Note-books are neat and well filled in. Art work is good.

Windows however should lower from the top to prevent wind from blowing on pupils' heads. Rooms are not large enough. Two posts appear in the centre of the rooms. The blackboards should be lowered and an additional one added at the side for permanent work.\n\nClassroom Register (Is a careful tally made morning and afternoon?)\n\nRegisters are well kept neat - names well arranged according to classes. Attendance is carefully checked up each half day. A public school register is kept.\n\nA careful record is made of work covered, standing of the pupils and the attendance.\n\nGENERAL\n\n(Under this heading the Inspector should report upon the classroom activity generally and offer any suggestions for improvement.) Junior Department.\n\nPercentage of attendance is high.\n\nThis room consists of grades one and two, four classes. These were examined in reading, spelling literature, numbers, writing, memory work, and general seatwork.\n\nA good use is made of the blackboard in the teaching of primary reading. Later the classes read from the reader. Reading is fairly fluent but too much monotone. Special attention is given to English; questions and answers are introduced and the work made as practical as possible.\n\nNumber work is well taught. Oral and seat exercises are well arranged and neatly done.\n\nAll classes in this room are well up to standard and are doing good work.\n\nWriting and seat-work are quite creditable.\n\nover\nSenior Department.\n\nAttendance in this room is also high.\n\nThe room consists of grades 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9.\n\nThese classes were examined in reading, spelling, literature numbers and problems in arithmetic, and general seat work. The senior classes were also tested in geography.\n\nA very creditable showing was made in all subjects. The one prevailing weakness seems to be low tones and brief answers.\n\nThe senior classes in this room are now capable of heavy work. Grade nine has lost much of her year on account of the non-arrival of books ordered. These were ordered in July and arrived in March.\n\nAs many of the lessons in the readers do not appeal to these Indian children I suggested that these uninteresting selections be omitted. A full line of interesting supplementary readers\u2014a dozen of each\u2014should be introduced and used. These will stimulate reading and will give interesting information and employment in spare periods as well as in class periods.\n\nThe farm end should now be developed and both boys and girls given a practical training along these lines.\n\nThis school is now in a position to do excellent work.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nON\n\nAnglican INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nOnion Lake Sask.\n\nNumber of pupils in residence\n\nJr. 21\nBoys Sr. 22 43\nGirls Jr. 29\nSr. 11 46 83\n\nNumber of classrooms and number of desks in each...Twp Jr-38 Sr-33\n\nNumber of classes and number of pupils in each class...Jr. Grade 1-3 Classes...Grd 1cl.\nSr. Grades 3,4,5,6,7,and8.\n\nTHE STAFF\n\nPrincipal's name...Rev.

Statements and answers are brief. A good deal of knowledge is there but the Indians will not express it fully.\n\nSuggestions.\n\n1. Read aloud long passages.\n2. Tell or re-tell stories. Indians love stories.\n3. Recite, debate or make speeches.\n4. Select from the readers for reading and literature only those selections that appeal to the Indian.\n5. Pass over all uninteresting selections.\n\nThese may aid in getting the pupils accustomed to hearing themselves speak in the presence of others; they seem shy.\n\nCLASSROOM FURNITURE\n\nPreservation and arrangement of furniture. Pupils' and teachers' desks are new\u2014well arranged\u2014good\u2014well cared for. Blackboards are slate but placed too high\u2014three feet and six inches\u2014one foot too high.

Respect for such is trained in.\n\nIf necessary, indicate what additional classroom material, books, etc., should be supplied.\n\nA good stock of supplementary readers of a general type should be supplied\u2014nature study\u2014animal stories\u2014geographic readers. These will give more interesting reading.\n\nSupplies are too long in coming. High School books asked for in July 1925 arrived in March 1926\u2014too late. If a dozen readers are asked for the mass requires so many. The number should not be cut down.\n\nSupplementary readers are usually low in cost. Supplies should come promptly.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Residential School that our children do not speak audibly, neither is their articulation good. To reply, I have to inform you that the majority of the children are not yet old enough to be in school but a short time, since we entered occupation of the new school and recruited up to strength. I have been much concerned over this myself, and have been in the class-room three or four times a month to assist the teachers in having the children overcome this difficulty.\n\nThe suggestions set forth by the Inspector will be gladly followed, and I trust that there will be a marked improvement when he visits us next time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

These pupils are all reading from the text. The junior section has not acquired a fluency in reading. Phonics are used and the pupils seem to understand what they read. A good use is made of the blackboard in teaching words.\n\nThe senior section is acquiring a fluency. There are a few weak pupils that should have more reading from the blackboard. Spelling and dictation with these classes were well conducted.\n\nThe senior class in oral problems in arithmetic made a good showing. The bare numbers however should be constantly under drill.\n\nAll seat work is required to be neatly done. Writing is good. Order and class management are good. This room is in good hands.\n\nGrade 2 was examined by the Inspector in reading, spelling numbers and literature. The reading is very fluent.\nThe literature is understood but it is difficult to get full answers. In numbers the class is fair. A few require drill to develop speed and accuracy.\n\nSr. Room. This department has five classes.\n\nGrades 4, 5, 6, and 7 were examined in tables and measures in arithmetic; in these the pupils are fairly rapid and accurate. In a special selection in literature the pupils showed appreciation and understanding but none are enthusiastic at answering.\n\nMiss Taylor conducted classes with the senior grades in spelling, composition and geography. All classes were well conducted and showed good teaching ability.\n\nQuantities of hand work have been selected for the fairs. Some very creditable work has been done along this line. These classes are in the hands of very capable teachers.\nCLASSROOM\n\nCondition of Classrooms (Ventilation, light, etc.)\n\nVentilation is quite satisfactory, but there is cross-lighting which hinders good vision, and the blackboard cannot be seen very well on cloudy days.\n\nClassroom Register (Is a careful tally made morning and afternoon?)\n\nThe classroom registers are properly and systematically kept.\n\nGENERAL\n\n(Under this heading the Inspector should report upon the classroom activity generally and offer any suggestions for improvement.)\n\nI examined the school in arithmetic, spelling and writing. In arithmetic, particularly in the lower grades, I had considerable difficulty in ascertaining the standing of the pupils on account of inhibition. After considerable effort though I found that the grades are just about the correct standard. In spelling I found Grades III and IV somewhat weak, particularly Grade IV, whereas Grades V VI and VII were well up to the standard, only two pupils in all three grades dropping below 50% in a rather severe test. The writing was very good, considerably above the average for the same grades in Saskatchewan rural schools.\n\nI was quite satisfied with the work being done in both rooms. Discipline is well maintained, supervision is quite good, and the general tone quite satisfactory.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nON\n\nST.

I noted that in arithmetic abstract ideas develop slowly in the Indian child, and that teachers resort more to concrete examples than in white schools. I endorse this procedure as I feel that best results are obtained this way when dealing with children of nature.\n\nSeptember 25th 1928.\n\nNOTE:\u2014This form to be used for Indian Residential Schools only.\n\nForm No. 141\nSuggestions regarding teaching methods\n\nI recommended the use of correction books in arithmetic and spelling to the teaching staff, and left a complete outline of how to use these. I also recommended more oral spelling, and a more systematic use of the library, outlining to the teachers a plan to elicit the cooperation of the pupils in this respect.\n\nCLASSROOM FURNITURE\n\nPreservation and arrangement of furniture\n\nAll equipment is in a splendid state of preservation and arranged to the best advantage.\n\nCare of material It would appear from an inspection of this school that Indian children are more particular than white children in the preservation of their desks and other school equipment.\n\nIf necessary, indicate what additional classroom material, books, etc., should be supplied:\n\n1.

In arithmetic I found Grades II and IV entirely satisfactory, but two pupils in Grade III, all pupils in Grade V except two, all pupils in Grade VI except one, and also all of Grade VII were considerably below the standard for their respective grades. In spelling the marks on the whole were very much better, only twelve pupils in the whole school getting below 50% on rather difficult tests. I felt that the character of the written work was hardly as good as I found it the year previous. Discipline was quite good in the junior room, and fairly good in the senior room. The response of the pupils was not always well controlled in either of these rooms, which fact I drew to the attention of the teachers. I feel that this school has had too many changes in the teaching staff to expect normal progress on the part of the children. On the whole I would say that the classes did not measure up as well this year as they did a year ago.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nON\n\nST.

I felt that there was no clearly defined method, outside of assigning and hearing the reading lesson, in the senior room, and I outlined to the teacher a systematic way of teaching this subject. Here also, as in the junior room, my suggestions were well received.\n\nCLASSROOM FURNITURE\n\nI felt that the desks and woodwork would have been the better of a coat of varnish during the holidays as Indian children take a delight in anything that looks new and bright. The psychological effect would have been that the teacher would have no trouble in keeping the children from marking up the desks, whereas at present there is little inducement for them to take an interest in them while they are dull and somewhat worn looking as at present.\n\nCare of material... I found both rooms without any exercise books of any description, and all the tests had to be worked on slates. I consider this a most deplorable condition of affairs. The children are using saliva, some cases to clean their slates in spite of all the teacher can do to prevent it. I feel that all classroom materials should be on hand before the opening of school on September 1st.\n\nIf necessary, indicate what additional classroom material, books, etc., should be supplied.\n\nI hope that steps will be taken in the future to see that the Principal's requisitions are promptly forwarded so that there will be no delay in getting the school properly under way after the holidays.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Residential School on the 23rd and 25th ultimo. The Inspector reports on the classroom activity, as follows:\n\n\"I was quite satisfied with the teacher's methods in the first classroom, although I felt that there could be some improvement in the method of teaching number work. I was not so well pleased with the method of teaching reading in the second classroom. I left some suggestions with the teacher which, I hope, may prove of benefit and result in better work being done.\n\n\"I feel that the character of the written work was hardly as good as I found it the year previous.

In connection with this, I may say that the Department favours discarding the use of slates entirely and we are prepared to supply whatever quantity of scribblers, exercise books, etc., that may be required.\n\nIt is necessary that schools should anticipate their requirements and allow a reasonable length of time for filling the orders. With reference to your school, I might point out that the requisition did not reach the Department until September 3rd. I believe that it would be advisable to forward a requisition for supplies for the new school year when sending in the June quarter return. This action would permit the supplies being secured and forwarded while the pupils are absent on holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. H. Ellis,\nPrincipal,\nOnion Lake C.E. Indian Res. School,\nLloydminster, Sask.\nCLASSROOM\n\nConditions of Classrooms (Ventilation, light, etc.)... Ventilation would be quite satisfactory were it not for the fact that I found too many pupils for the size of the rooms. In the senior room there is a glare on the blackboards, possibly due to the rear windows. I left a suggestion with the teacher which she is going to try out in an endeavour to correct this.\n\nClassroom Register (Is a careful tally made morning and afternoon?)...\n\nI found that the registers are being properly kept in both rooms.\n\nGENERAL\n\n(Under this heading the Inspector should report upon the classroom activity generally and offer any suggestions for improvement.)\n\nI examined both rooms in arithmetic, spelling and writing.... In the junior room I left some suggestions as to the teaching of number work to Grade 1 which were well received. The marks taken in this room in Arithmetic, Grades II and III showed that the children are well up to the standard in the mechanics of this subject, only one pupil dropping below 50% in the tests given. In the spelling tests the marks in Grade III ranged from 70% to 100% which shows that the children are well up to standard. In Grade II the marks ranged from 5% to 90%, with two of the children decidedly weak in this subject. The character of the written work in this room was excellent, and the response of the pupils was promptly controlled. Discipline and supervision were also very satisfactory. In the senior room the results of the tests showed that the children are quite well up in the mechanics of arithmetic, but a great many of them do not know how to apply them in such problems as they would meet in daily life. The results of the spelling tests in this room were indeed very satisfactory. The character of the written work was good, and the pupils' response was generally well controlled. I found discipline and supervision also of a high order.\n\nI would like to strongly recommend the addition of a third room, as the work is altogether too much for two teachers to handle, and the crowded condition of the rooms cannot but be detrimental to the health of the children.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nON\n\nST.

Very good progress is being made under the direction of Miss Dunn who has had a number of years of experience in teaching among Indians. Oral work was taken with the beginners who are doing well. Tests were given in all grades in arithmetic and spelling. There were a few pupils rather weak in the latter subject. A number of suggestions were left with Miss Dunn which were well received.\n\nIn the senior-room written tests were given in arithmetic and spelling, all grades, and some oral work was done in geography with Grade V. In the arithmetic tests the results were below average, a few pupils taking good marks, and a great many failing to obtain pass marks. The marks in the spelling were very much better, only a few pupils failing to obtain pass marks. I felt that there was need for considerable regrading in this room. I went into the matter thoroughly with the teacher. Miss Dunn is in charge of her first school and a difficult one, and I spent considerable time discussing school problems, and offering her suggestions. I believe that conditions will improve as the teacher gets used to her surroundings as she appears to be a very enthusiastic and earnest teacher. Her academic and professional training has been exceptionally good, and when this has been coupled with experience good results should follow.\n\nEQUIPMENT\n\nI would like to recommend the purchase of a printing outfit for the junior room.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nON\n\nST.

Man 1446-25 |\n| Margaret Mary Reynar Armitage | 24 | First Int. 80-31 |\n\nRemarks relative to the methods employed by teachers. Methods to be employed with Indian children differ in many respects from those used with white children. In the junior room the teacher has had many years experience in Indian schools and her methods are good. In the senior room the teacher is only a beginner, fresh from Normal school. I accordingly spent considerable time offering her suggestions as to methods etc., which I hope may prove helpful.\n\n29th & 30th September 1921.\n\nSignature of Inspector\n\nNOTE:\u2014This form to be used for Indian Residential Schools only.\nSuggestions regarding teaching methods. The criticism offered last year relative to problem work in arithmetic still applies in the senior room. The pupils are fairly good in mechanics, but in any case cannot apply them.\n\nI believe that a better library should be built up in this school and more time devoted to an organized use of it. Possibly a reading hour could be set aside on Sunday in which it would be compulsory for all pupils to read under the supervision of the teachers. I have seen this idea carried out to good effect in other residential schools, with the result that a real love for reading has been developed in many of the children, and this in turn results in much improved work in many of the classroom subjects, such as composition, spelling, geography, history, etc.\n\nCLASSROOM FURNITURE\n\nThe glare on the blackboards might be eliminated by pulling them... Preservation and arrangement of furniture... out at the bottom and re-setting them permanently at that angle... I found all equipment in a good state of preservation, and as advantageously arranged as was possible under the rather cramped conditions prevailing. There is hardly sufficient classroom accommodation for the number of children enrolled... This school should really have three classrooms instead of two as at present.\n\nIf necessary, indicate what additional classroom material, books, etc., should be supplied.\n\nI would recommend the purchase of the following books:\n\nTwo dozen Aldine Primers... One Beacon Phonetic Reading Chart...\nEight - Work Book in English Usage and Composition for Gr. 3...\nSixteen - Do... Do... Do... Gr.4) J.M.Bent...\nFourteen - Do... Do... Do...

(RG 10, Volume 6323, file 658-6, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nCLASSROOM\n\nConditions of Classrooms (Ventilation, light, etc.)... Except for the fact that the rooms are overcrowded, the ventilation is satisfactory. The lighting is also satisfactory except for a blackboard glare as reported last year.\n\nClassroom Register (Is a careful tally made morning and afternoon?) The registers are marked regularly and kept neatly.\n\nGENERAL\n\n(Under this heading the Inspector should report upon the classroom activity generally and offer any suggestions for improvement)\n\nExcept for four pupils in the senior group who were given written tests, all the pupils in Grade I were examined orally, and I am pleased to report that good progress is being made, and the response showed that earnest and effective teaching had been given them. I took some work with Grades II and III in music, spelling and arithmetic, and I am pleased to report that the standards of achievement in these grades were the highest that I have yet found them during the years that this school has been under my supervision. Discipline and the character of the written work were very satisfactory, but I am satisfied that good work is being done in this room. In the senior room I felt that the situation had very considerably improved during the year although there is still some weakness in arithmetic, particularly in Grades VI and VII.\n\nIt is impossible to test the pupils in very many subjects during one inspection, but I feel certain, judging from the marks in the spelling tests that the work in English subjects has greatly improved. The average marks in the spelling tests were very high in fact considerably higher than the usual run of village and rural schools. Discipline was much better than last year although I would recommend a little more firmness yet on the part of the teacher. In conclusion I may say that conditions generally were the best I have yet found them, as far as the work of the school is concerned, even in spite of the fact that the teachers have been greatly handicapped, due to the number of pupils in their rooms.\n\nEQUIPMENT\n\nLast year I recommended the purchase of a printing outfit for the junior room. This is not a very expensive purchase, but for some reason this was not supplied. I would, therefore, again recommend this purchase.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I noted improvement in this connection, particularly in the senior room, where suggestions left last year had been acted upon to advantage. I was pleased to note that Miss Armitage, although possessing much higher academic standing, has gained much through her willingness to cooperate and accept suggestions from Miss Dunn who has had a much broader experience in Indian work. This has worked out to their mutual benefit, and also that of the children.\n\nDate and 22nd June 1932.\n\nSignature of Inspector\n\nNOTE:\u2014This form to be used for Indian Residential Schools only.\nSuggestions regarding teaching methods.\n\nMethods to be used in Indian Schools are of necessity somewhat different to those employed in other schools. The period at which Indian children can absorb information in the abstract arrives at a more advanced age, with the result that primary methods particularly involve a larger use of concrete material, e.g., in number work Indian children must have the objects before their eyes, and work with them for a longer time than white children. This same idea applies in other subjects. A teacher with experience in Indian schools should if possible be retained in the work, as it takes considerable time to gain the necessary experience to teach Indians well. I had a conversation with the teachers, and left some suggestions, and am pleased to report improvement in conditions as to methods used. As to disciplinary methods, I would recommend a rather firmer hand in the senior room, although I noticed that this recommendation had already been carried out to some extent.\n\nCLASSROOM FURNITURE\n\nI left one or two suggestions as to the arrangement of equipment and furniture which I thought might work out advantageously.\n\nPreservation and arrangement of furniture. \u2014 The fact of the matter is that there are altogether too many pupils for the accommodation. I reported this matter last year only to find the situation even more aggravated this year. All equipment was in a good state of preservation, and there is no doubt that the property is being well cared for. The overcrowded situation, however, as to accommodation is so serious that I do not believe the teachers can do their best work. The lack of accommodation also gives rise to situations like the following:\u2014 There are children actually working in the wrong grade because there is no room for them in the senior room. If the junior room is an advanced grade in the junior room there is considerable loss of time through unnecessary indirection; additional classroom material, books, etc., should be supplied the teaching of the same grade in both rooms.\n\nADDITIONAL CLASSROOM MATERIAL REQUIRED\n\nOne Illustrated Action Words By Isobel Nixon J.M.

The Inspector refers to overcrowding in the classrooms and stresses the poor arrangement of the classes. Apparently the ventilation is satisfactory, notwithstanding that the rooms are overcrowded. The only remedy for this condition would appear to be to set aside another room to accommodate the overflow and this would necessitate the engagement of another teacher. I will take this matter up when I next visit that school. The report on the whole discloses fairly satisfactory conditions at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nCLASSROOM\n\nCondition of Classrooms (Ventilation, light, etc.) The system of ventilation and lighting is good, but there are altogether too many children crowded into the space available to make it possible for me to report good ventilation. The fact that there are 65 pupils enrolled in one room is sufficient evidence that that room must be overcrowded, not to speak of the inability of one teacher to handle that many pupils with complete Classroom Register (Is a careful tally made morning and afternoon?) success.\n\nThe classroom registers are carefully and systematically kept.\n\nGENERAL\n\n(Under this heading the Inspector should report upon the classroom activity generally and offer any suggestions for improvement)\n\nIn the junior room, which is under the direction of Miss Dunn, the children were examined in reading, number work, spelling and oral composition. Grades II and III were subjected to written tests in number work and spelling. There were one or two pupils who proved to be a little below standard in their work, but it turned out that these pupils had come in from another school recently. Recommended that they be re-graded. The work on the whole in this room must be graded as exceptionally good, when one takes into consideration the number of pupils entrusted to the care of one teacher. Miss Dunn is energetic\u2014progressive, possesses a strong personality, and has a rich experience in Indian work.\n\nIn the senior room Grade IV was examined in reading, and later given written tests in arithmetic and spelling. The work of this grade was of a high standard, only one pupil being in the least weak in the work, and at that not seriously so. In the other grades written tests were given which included language, geography, spelling and arithmetic. The work in arithmetic, Grades VII and VIII could hardly be graded as up to standard, and with the exception of one or two pupils there was criticism would also apply to Grade VI. Spelling was good throughout the school, and the results on the language test, Grade IV, and the geography test, Grade VIII were also very good. Discipline in this room is now good; it has steadily improved since the time Miss Armitage first took charge. I consider that this teacher is doing very good work and is getting even better results than one would expect when taking into consideration the number of grades, the number of pupils, the lack of room, and the amount of work to be covered. The situation has now become so serious that I would strongly recommend to the Indian Department that some measures must be adopted to provide further classroom accommodation in this school. There is more than enough work to keep three teachers busily engaged.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nON\n\nSt. Barnabas INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nNumber of pupils in residence\nBoys ........................................

Hicks on the St. Barnabas Residential School in the Onion Lake Agency.\n\nPerusal of this report indicates that conditions there are very satisfactory and that the pupils are making creditable progress. The Inspector found the whole building in a neat and tidy condition and in a good state of preservation and repair. It will be noted that he makes some comments with regard to over-crowding in the classrooms. This is a matter which I will look into when I next visit that School, which I expect to do in the near future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nCLASSROOM\n\nCondition of Classrooms (Ventilation, light, etc.). The situation reported last year as to overcrowded classrooms still exists, and I am in duty bound to report that I do not consider it fair to these children, nor to their teachers, to crowd so many into one room, and expect good results. The establishing of a third classroom is not only desirable but imperative and practically necessary to the success of this school. No notice was taken of this recommendation last year, but I sincerely hope that something will be done about it as a result of this report.\n\nClassroom Register (Is a careful tally made morning and afternoon?) Classroom registers are properly kept.\n\nGENERAL\n\n(Under this heading, the Inspector should report upon the classroom activity generally and offer any suggestions for improvement.)\n\nIn the junior room written tests were given in arithmetic and spelling, and I was very much pleased with the results. Classes were also observed in reading. Miss Dunn has had a very rich experience in Indian work, possesses a wonderful fund of energy, and must be graded as an outstanding teacher. In the senior room a new and inexperienced teacher was in charge, but she quite surprised me with the grasp she already had of the work. Her pupils stood up well under test, which of course to a great extent was the result of her predecessor's work. Written tests were given which included the following subjects:\u2014arithmetic, history, citizenship, spelling, health education and home economics. The results must be graded as the best I have ever found them in this school, and I was indeed very pleased. Discipline was good, and the general tone of the classroom very satisfactory. There are six or eight Grade 8 pupils, however, who are ready and anxious to proceed with the work of the grade, but there is no accommodation. In addition to this fact both teachers are already overcrowded with work. In view of this fact, I wish again to strongly recommend that a third room be established in this school, and the situation would be ideal if the services of Miss Armitage, who I understand is not working, could again be obtained to go ahead with the senior room in which she would know all the pupils.\nSuggestions regarding teaching methods\n\nA number of suggestions were left with the teachers at the time of the inspection which were well received. I found the staff very progressive, and eager to get hints in connection with their work.\n\nCLASSROOM FURNITURE\n\nPreservation and arrangement of furniture.\n\nI found not only the classrooms, but the whole building in a neat and tidy condition.

Hick's report on the St. Barnabas Church of England Indian Residential school at Onion Lake. The Inspector speaks very highly of the progress being made in classroom work, but points out that in his opinion the classrooms are overcrowded and a third classroom should be provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nCLASSROOM\n\nCondition of Classrooms (Ventilation, light, etc.)... There is a bad glare on the blackboard in the junior classroom. I have reported now for several years that the classrooms in this school are overcrowded, and I have definitely recommended on several occasions the addition of another classroom to look after the enrolment. No action, however, has been taken, and I would reiterate my former recommendations in this connection. Please see previous reports.\n\nClassroom Register (Is a careful tally made morning and afternoon?)...\n\nThe classroom registers are properly kept.\n\nGENERAL\n\n(Under this heading the Inspector should report upon the classroom activity generally and offer any suggestions for improvement.)\n\nI observed classes taken in reading with two different divisions in Grade 1. These were capably conducted, and the methods used were sound. I examined the Grade II class orally and found reading and spelling average or slightly better. While number work was good, with the exception of two or three pupils who must be graded as slightly weak in this subject. Written tests were given the Grade III children in history and spelling. In the latter subject the results were outstanding, while in the former the results must be considered as somewhat below standard. These pupils are particularly weak in the English-Grammar class in literature taken by the teacher, and a lesson in Art with the Grade I class. On the whole I am satisfied that good work is being done in this room.\n\nIn the senior room written tests were given in home economics, geography, history, health education, spelling and arithmetic. In practically all subjects there was a great spread between the strongest and the weakest pupils. There can be no doubt that the work has been taught or reviewed in a manner which has been effective, but there must be more emphasis placed on thoroughness with the weaker pupils in order that average results may improve. Spelling is evidently the strongest subject and the results compare very favorably, and even surpass those of most of the white schools.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Short tests in arithmetic in Grade II showed that the pupils have been well grounded in their work and are well advanced for their grade. The pupils were encouraged to participate freely in the lessons. The discipline and tone of the room is good; there is plenty of seatwork which is carefully checked by the teacher and some fine project work has been done. Miss Tysoe is a capable teacher, a tireless worker, very resourceful, and has the situation well in hand. She reacts well to suggestion.\n\nIn the senior room lessons were observed in geography and health. Tests in arithmetic showed that the pupils who have been under Miss Buxton's care for some time were well grounded in their work. The note was taken that the course is being well covered. The discipline and tone of this room are good; the teacher makes good use of her time and of the boards in her teaching, the pupils are kept busy with lots of seatwork, and they go about their tasks without any fuss. Miss Buxton is also a capable teacher, who has her work well prepared, is very conscientious, and who too has the situation well in hand. Her work has been held up so far by the sickness in the school. You are fortunate in having two such fine girls on your staff. The situation was discussed fully with them, and suggestions were made.\n\nI feel that a little less stress on the academic part of the education and more on the practical, such as training in agriculture, home economics, manual training would prove of value to these pupils, and better fit the for life. I should like to point out that both these teachers have far too many pupils with whom to do first class work. If they keep up at the pace they are going, I fear for their health. There is little time for any individual attention to pupils' difficulties.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nGeneral comment: As Miss Sherstone was new both to the school and the profession, most of our time was spent in observing her work. The results of tests in spelling were good, but some weaknesses were noted in Grade V arithmetic. In a lesson in geography, while the pupils had a map in front of them, it seemed that there was too much detail given and expected, with the result that interest was lacking. The same criticism holds good for lessons in history where too much detail and text destroyed the interest of the pupils. Besides having to large a class, Miss Sherstone is handicapped by lack of experience and lack of first hand knowledge of the Sask. curriculum which she is more or less at sea. Although she tries hard, and carefully prepares her work, this latter will not be sufficient to make her task very difficult. Her lessons lack punch. The discipline of this classroom has slipped somewhat this year, and attention will have to be given to this problem as once she has a long talk with this teacher, and discussed her problems fully with her, leaving some suggestions for her guidance. It was unfortunate that she had to go into such difficult work her first year, and in a province where she is not acquainted with the curriculum. I strongly advise that only experienced teachers be hired in future.\n\nWith the large enrolment in this classroom, the teacher has no time to give to the individual problems and difficulties of the pupils, especially the weaker ones. As a result certain phases of the work are suffering, especially in the higher grades where the pupils must prepare for standard Departmental examinations.\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER.\nRegina, December 19, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to attach Inspector's Reports on St. Anthony's and St. Barnabas Indian Residential Schools, Lloydminster, Sask. It is noted that the Inspector's report is not very favourable on Miss Sherstone, one of the teachers at St. Barnabas School.\n\nPersonally I cannot see how we can expect a good report on a teacher who has to handle a class of 62 Indian children.

In Grade 11 the writing is above the average, the pupils are well advanced in arithmetic, with only two weak pupils being noted, and they are in fine condition in reading. The results of tests in reading, arithmetic and spelling in Grade 11, and spelling and arithmetic in Grade IV were good, and showed that the foundation had been well laid. Only a few minor weaknesses were noted, and these should disappear with further review. Writing throughout this room ranged from average to good. It was also noted that the pupils' notebooks were carefully checked by the teacher. In lessons conducted in reading, the teacher questioned pupils frequently, and good interest and discussion was used; their experiences to put over the ideas. Suitable seatwork assignments followed each lesson. The pupils were kept busy at all times with an abundance of seatwork, and the routine of the classroom moved smoothly. The pupils sing nicely. On the whole it was quite evident that Miss Tysoe continued to render very efficient service here, and that her pupils are making progress. She is a capable teacher, tireless in her efforts, very resourceful, and does not spare herself in her work. How she gets as much done as she does in the time at her disposal is hard to understand. Her friendly manner and willingness to cooperate makes her classroom a pleasant one to visit.\n\nThis room is overcrowded, thus throwing too much work on the teacher who cannot give the individual attention where it is needed. As a result the pupils do not get the full benefit from their opportunities.\n\nInspector of Schools\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In Grade II the writing was average to good; the exercise books were neat and well checked, and the pupils were in good average condition for arithmetic and reading. At the opening of the morning session it was noted that the boards were all filled with seatwork, but the pupils were not actively employed all the time, and that the teacher successfully supervised all work. The methods used in Grade I reading which involved the alphabet, and made provision for drill showed promise. Pictures were used to advantage in this grade. The music period was well conducted, and the pupils sang with freedom and enjoyment. In Grade III the pupils were being well trained. Miss McGill will be faced with trouble eventually in her work, and she has not the time to give the necessary individual attention to each pupil's difficulties that will be demanded in such a heavy enrolment.\n\nThe tone of the classroom was good, and the teacher seemed to have no difficulty with discipline. She had her work carefully planned, made good use of her time and the board in her teaching, and was in control constantly. She showed quite commendable energy and resourcefulness, and was more than willing to adopt suggestions.

In Grade III the writing was average to quite good, and the pupils were in satisfactory condition in spelling, arithmetic and reading. In Grade IV the writing was average to good; the results in spelling were satisfactory, while two pupils showed weakness in arithmetic. The pupils in Grade V, who were about working during my visit, were rather weak. In arithmetic where she averaged pupils showed need for a review of some of the fundamental rules. In reading pupils in Grade III, the teacher had pupils dramatizing the story under discussion, something that was all done. In a new subject the teacher omitted a drill on the new words, she asked some questions, and assigned some follow-up work. The teacher lost some time going to the pupils' desks checking eachwork in literature Grade IV as all would have gained from a blackboard check thereof. The board was used to advantage in checking work in arithmetic, but the pupils should have been made do more of the thinking. Miss Hauver had a tendency to help too much at times.\n\nThe discipline of the classroom seemed satisfactory. While the boards were kept well filled with work, it was found that the teacher did not throw enough responsibility on the pupils, and the teacher's system for keeping them on task and her work well arranged kept on the go all the time, looked very conscientious, but she some trouble finding time for all the work because she was trying to follow the course too rigidly. She reacted well to all suggestions left with her. The only trouble with Miss Hauver is that she was too conscientious, and worried too much about trivial matters. Some time projects had been done by the pupils, and a civic league was in operation. She should do at least an average work here as she is used to the climate.\n\nN.B.

In Grade VIII, IX and X the pupils showed a good overall grasp of their lessons. Reading in the above grades was fully discussed with the teacher, and some suggestions left for her guidance. At the opening of the afternoon the teacher read the pupils a story from the supplementary reading, and they showed good interest therein. In geometry Grade X the board was used to advantage, and the teacher carefully supervised the work therein. In lessons in literature the teacher questioned the pupils on the content, the pupils read orally, but no follow-up work was assigned. Work was also observed in spelling and geography. There was a fine exhibit of pupils' project work in evidence in this classroom. A civic league was in operation.\n\nMiss Armitage is a conscientious teacher, interested in her work, and willing to give of her best for her pupils. The tone of the classroom was pleasant, and she seemed to get along well with the pupils. She had her work well prepared, but it was felt that this did not throw enough responsibility on her pupils. She should do at least good average work here this year.\n\nThis room needed more blackboard space.\n\nInspector of Schools\n\nJAN 8 1940\n\nN.R.\u2014One form to be used for each classroom teacher.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6323, file 658-6, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSince my last visit here, an extra room has been opened. This has cut down the crowding somewhat, but not enough. Both the primary and intermediate rooms still have too heavy a curriculum for a teacher to do effective work. It was also felt that grades 111-711 were out of school too much at other work, and thereby handicapped the work of the teacher. I am not blaming any of the staff for this situation, but the intermediate classroom is not large enough to accommodate all the pupils enrolled therein at one time, so one grade has to stay out. A fourth room is urgently needed here.\n\nI was pleased to note that the pupils were getting a more practical training, the boys in manual work and farming, the girls in house economy. A separate room is being opened for manual training, the equipment for which has already been purchased. Some fine work has been done by the pupils. The singing of the pupils was of a high standard.\n\nIt is to be regretted that there have been so many staff changes. There have been six different teachers employed in the last three years. There were three new teachers here last visit, and one of them was planning to quit at Easter. One of the additions this year was a young lady right out of normal school without any experience. She worked hard, and seemed to be doing good work; she had difficulty in adjusting herself to her new surroundings. I would strongly advise that in future only experienced teachers be engaged, as experience not necessarily being with Indians. This is the second case this type in two years, and the work of the school is bound to suffer therefore.\n\nIt was noted that the teachers here were using the Bask attendance register instead of your departmental register which was used in all other schools inspected this fall.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gillespie is willing. She does her best, but until she has completed a definite course at some normal school she will be a failure as a teacher, no matter whether the classroom contains English speaking or Indian children.\n\nWe believe that children the world over have the same latent abilities and the same needs. In the lower grades of an Indian school should not vary much from that in the public schools. Accordingly seat work material should be provided.

Residential School on October 19 last. The Inspector states that Miss Gillespie is not a qualified teacher and consequently he believes that it is a mistake to place a class of 55 children in charge of a young girl without any training. While Miss Gillespie is willing, her lack of training does not permit her to do good work. I realize that it is difficult to secure qualified teachers at the present time and I thought it advisable to bring the Inspector's remarks to your attention so that, if possible, you could secure a qualified teacher for this room for the academic year 1943-44.\n\nThe Inspector also writes as follows:\n\n\"Old disused texts from public schools are not conducive to good progress.\"\n\nThe Department is at a loss to understand this statement of the Inspector and I should appreciate hearing from you in regard to it.

She left last September and since then Mrs. Davies, an experienced teacher of years standing took her place. It is our intention, whenever possible, to secure certificated teachers or those holding a degree, as we did for years before the War. During these abnormal times, however, it is a case of securing the best teacher that is available. I think we have been successful in this.\n\nI am not aware that we are using obsolete texts, nor has the Inspector drawn my attention to this matter. I expect to meet Mr. Bowes in the near future and will certainly take up this point with him. Our text-books are those that are prescribed by the Department of Education at Regina, and are listed in their Course of Study for the different grades and are used throughout the Province in all the Public Schools.

(She leads the school's Girl Guides in addition to a full load of other duties and seems to be a kind of deputy director of the institution.) The building is in good repair. Some re-decorating of the walls is going on\u2014pupils do the work\u2014and certain floors are being re-surfaced with a special coating.\n\nDormitories are well\u2014almost too well!\u2014filled. Plumbing appears to be adequate. Bed linen was neat and clean. Much of this is donated by the Women's Auxiliary of Ottawa. The money thus saved must amount to a very considerable sum.\n\nThe basements were clean and tidy, and the laundry, furnace, and food storage rooms appeared to be efficiently conducted.\n\nThe classrooms are really adjuncts of the auditorium. Movable partitions preclude the use of adequate blackboards. In most rooms the pupils are seated more closely than desirable.\n\nStaff:\nMiss Atwater - Senior room\nMiss Stephen - Intermediate grades\nMrs. Ellis - Junior grades\nMiss Hauser - Beginners.\n\nAll these teachers have certificates as such. All appear to be doing good work and getting at least average (for Indians) results. Possibly the most striking progress is being...\nmade in the beginners' class.

For example, St. Alban's has been operated since last September as a school for girls in the junior grades and as a hostel for girls attending high school. I should like to have your views on the success of this and other experiments that have a bearing on the school programme.\n\nAs the classrooms vary in size and other physical characteristics please include full comment on the inspection form for each teacher.\n\nYour description of what is being done in physical education, vocational training and recreational activity is also desired, and an over-all appreciation of each school might well be added.\n\nA supply of blank inspection report forms accompanies this letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Motherliness is her outstanding contribution to the needs of the children committed to her charge. The general impression that I have received during several visits to classes which she has conducted is that there is a slackening of the momentum which the pupils bring to her classes. This may be attributable to whatever philosophy of Education Mrs. Ellis has developed and to the objectives towards which she thinks she is working. Like so many of those to whom the teaching of Indians is entrusted she would be well-advised to subject her pedagogical notions and habits to the light of a summer session.\n\nC.A.T.

She brings a refreshing professional attitude to Indian education, and is conscious of the need to adapt the programme to the retarded and to the superior. Her most recent summer course was in 1944, a short course in Mental Hygiene.\n\nThe children have, in the majority of cases, made creditable progress in the various subjects and some are to be promoted to Grade Five. Such girls should be transferred to All Saints School (also in Prince Albert) so that Mrs. MacRae can continue next year with the blended programme for Grades Three and Four which she handles well.\n\nThe library facilities for these girls should be reviewed and adjusted to what ought to continue to be a junior-grade school.\n\nC.W.

Pilcher,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Alban's Indian Residential School,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Pilcher:\n\nWhile I was in Regina I mentioned to Mr. Ostrender and to our recently appointed Supervisor of Construction, Mr. Morrison, the mystery of your kitchen hot water or rather cool water tank. I shall feel more comfortable when I have your assurance that the supply of hot water is ample.\n\nUnder separate cover there is going forward to you a supply of a booklet \"Good Health for Canada's Indians\" which all your teachers should find useful. One copy should go back to each home at the end of June. I think your teachers will find in the curriculum definite instructions concerning the teaching of many of the matters covered in this booklet. In our residential schools there is sometimes a tendency to regard the teaching of health habits, personal grooming, table manners, etc., as the work of the supervisors. Especially do some teachers consider that the care of clothing, equipment and property is the supervisor's duty. My observations in the schools and on the reserves convince me that the children cannot be \"supervised\" into taking such care. It is the classroom teacher who must begin the instructional processes and with the cooperation of the supervisor continue to the necessary degree of appreciation and habit.\n\n...2\nIn the matter of the cupboards which some of your classrooms require, may I suggest some sort of reciprocity with Mr. Scrase and his Manual Training class. I pointed out to Mr. Stoddard some shelving in building #32 which could be made available for a number of purposes.\n\nSt. Alban's school is, in my opinion, well able to endure inspection by visitors. I do not regard it as \"frozen\" in its present pattern. As a girls' school there must be a limitation upon the number of pupils and the number of grades conducted. So far we have relied upon the presence of over-age girls to give leadership in housekeeping and other activities. The time may come when beginners of normal age and size may more conveniently be handled at All Saints School and the girls in your charge would thus be older and in higher grades, or you might have a beginners class of the \"opportunity\" type comprising older girls. This development would probably entail changes in the teaching and supervisory staff. The present staff seems well suited to the present pupilage. I look forward to a further discussion with you after you have had the school under observation for a few more months.\n\nKindest regards to yourself and your wife.\n\nYours most sincerely,\n\nC.A.F. Clark,\nEducational Survey Officer.\nSuperintendent of Education:\n\nSt. Albans Indian Residential School:\n\nDuties elsewhere compelled me to restrict my attention to this school to a discussion with the Reverend Principal last Sunday evening.\n\nI told him that I was disappointed to discover that the supper dishes were being washed in lukewarm water even after the installation of a new heater in the boiler room. He explained that it was the engineer's afternoon \"off\". It would appear that the kitchen staff consider that they have to keep out of the boiler room.\n\nHe told me that his ratio of staff to pupils was rather high as he had been employing laundry helpers so as to avoid the \"half-day\" system. I assured him he would not be accused of continuing the half-day system so long as there were desks for all pupils and so long as a reasonable amount of practical work in laundering, cooking, mending, etc., is required of pupils so that they become competent in the theory and practice of these household science subjects. Unfortunately, some of his staff do not appreciate the necessity or the method of integrating this work with the pupils' schooling in the classroom. We must assume that advice on this subject must be repeated year after year and the organization of schools must be examined periodically to check any retrogression.\n\nIf this school follows out this plan there is no need for it to carry pupils beyond grade four. The part-time service of enough older girls can be assured as long as there is a quota of the academically-retarded. We might, however, ask the two Reverend Principals to consider whether they could during the coming year arrange matters so that St. Albans would have only grades two three four and five, followed the next year by three, four, five and six \u2014 but definitely stopping there so that any who go on to grade seven would join the presumably larger classes in the junior high school grades at All Saints school. This would eliminate from St. Albans next September the beginners and first-graders who would be more likely victims if fire were to break out in St. Albans. It means also that\nSt. Albans would in September send on to All Saints only those junior pupils who cannot be properly assigned to a normal Grade Two class. St. Albans would have to receive from All Saints a quota of pupils to provide well-balanced classes in Grades Two, Three, Four and Five. They have at St. Albans three rooms which may be considered to have capacity of 40, 30, 30. Perhaps they should use the largest room for Grade Two. This year that room holds grades three and four. It could hold Grades four and five if it is desired to retain the pupils who are going on to Grade Five. Then the following year it would be filled with a Grades Five-Six class with the other rooms holding thirty grade four and thirty grade three pupils. High school girls in residence would constitute the surplus up to 105.\n\nA copy of this memorandum is being sent to Mr. Supt. Jones so that he may invite the attention of the Principals to the proposed changes, and permit them to discuss the matter and to correspond with their headquarters. Both schools are expecting changes in staff, and future organization should be a factor in making replacements, particularly of the teaching staff.\n\nOne question has been asked on which a higher-level answer is sought; May the schools retain on the roll and receive the usual grants for pupils who have attained the age of sixteen and wish to continue to attend residential school although they are only at, say, grade five? St. Albans has a few older pupils whose return to their so-called homes would be disadvantageous.\n\nIt is noted that St. Albans has a radio-phonograph which might be useful in the classrooms. Presently it is situated in the staff lounge.\n\nC.A.F. Clark\n\nCopy to Regional Supervisor, Regina.\n\n\" \" Superintendent, Carlton Indian Agency.\nTo whom it may concern:\n\nI have received a copy of Mr. C.A.F. Clark's suggestive memorandum of May 25th, written at Regina. I am attaching some comments on the points raised by Mr. Clark.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nThe Rev'd N.D. Pilcher\n\nCopies to Mr. C.A.F. Clark\nSuperintendent Ostrander\nSuperintendent Jones\nThe Rev'd Canon Cook\n\n\"I enjoy seeing these gentlemen taking the trouble to record their views. Then we all know the situation and the prospects.\"\n\nE1\n\nGood\nRe Report of Mr. C.A.F. Clark to the Superintendent of Education\n\nRe Washing of dishes. Although the engineer was out of the building during part of the Sunday afternoon in which Mr. Clark called, I understand that the tank is normally hot before the serving of a meal but that even a capacity quantity can be run off before all the dishes are finished. I think this requires better supervision in the kitchen on the part of staff personnel. I hope to achieve this through changes that will be taking place this summer. I normally at least think it wise that kitchen staff have nothing to do with the boiler room. If the need should arise when the engineer is off duty, we can act accordingly.\n\nRe employment of assistants in laundry, etc. On my appointment here I was informed that children ought not to be taken from class to do work and that assistants had been appointed to eliminate this situation. I am glad to know that the Department does not take such a rigid view of this matter as I am aware how necessary practical and adequate training in domestic science is for our girls. I think this can be achieved by training of girls in school hours within reasonable limits. I think that all our staff can learn to appreciate the need for integration of the academic and practical.\n\nRe suggestion for introducing Grade 5. This proposal seems unnecessary in view of what has already been noted. In any case, the arrangement of the Saskatchewan course of studies with \"A\" and \"B\" courses taught in alternate years precludes the grouping of Grades 4 and 5. To follow the curriculum as set out it is necessary to group Grades 1 and 2 together, 3 and 4, and so forth.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6323, file 658-6, part 1)\nRe fire hazard. The presence of very small children in our building does not, in my opinion, expose them to any unusual fire hazard. The dormitories for younger children have direct exits of a satisfactory kind. If there is doubt about the adequacy of fire exits the building should certainly not be used but the Fire Commissioner is satisfied on this point although, like myself, he would feel happier if certain additional improvements were made.\n\nRe grants for pupils who have already reached their seventeenth year. (Age 16) If the Department sees fit to continue in some cases the provision of grants for these girls I should be very happy. I am sure that in certain cases the girls would benefit from an additional year at the school and certainly some have wanted to come back. In such cases, I should like to see a special sort of course provided in which there would be plenty of practical experience and also an opportunity to give some simple instruction in subjects like home nursing, handicrafts, etc. We are certainly prepared to do something like that here. I think that such a course would probably be of more value to the academically retarded than the Grade 5 course as laid down in the provincial curriculum.\n\nRe radio-phonograph. The radio-phonograph is kept in the staff lounge when not in use in the class-rooms or girls' play-room. The usual school broadcasts of C.B.C are used. Grades 3 and 4 have had an average of an hour per week. Grades 1 and 2 and the Primary group listen to a half-hour broadcast weekly and records are used for dancing, singing and general instruction. It is true to say that the machine is used much more for the girls than for the staff. The girls also listen in during some of their favorite programmes,...in their playroom. Perhaps we may look forward to being included in any circuit of recordings which may be arranged by the Department.\nSUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION\n\nOnion Lake C.E. (St. Alban's) Indian Residential School\n\nI visited this school briefly on Sunday, September 24, and had a discussion with the Principal.\n\nThere has been no change in the teaching staff but the former matron, Miss Jackson, is now at Moose Port Residential School and has been replaced at St. Alban's by Miss Twigg from Old Sun. Miss Twigg was succeeded at Old Sun by one of the teachers, Miss Moore. I always regret the transfer of competent classroom teachers to non-educational duties. It seems to me that matrons might rather be selected from women with experience as wives and mothers.\n\nSt. Alban's, as you are aware, is an all-girl school limiting its work to the first four grades. Earlier this year I suggested adding Grade 5 but the Principal and staff discussed technical objections based on curriculum requirements. The Principal now complains that it is difficult to get 100 girls in the first four grades whose families will permit them to be separated from their brothers and sisters at the Lac la Ronge School a mile away. The request that this should be a girls' school was made by the Church authorities and they should be encouraged to find a solution for filling their complement of pupils.\n\nC.A.F.

Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nINSPECTION REPORT\n\nOnion Lake Residential School\n(St. Alban's)\n\nAdministration\n\nThis school is situated in the former Anglican Theological College. It is an old building but the Reverend Mr. Pilcher is developing into a good Principal. Actually, the cleanliness and order of this building were definitely better than that at the Lee la Ronge School.\n\nJunior Room:\n- Miss Burger has recently returned to teaching after several years out of the profession. She is genuinely keen about her work and is trying hard to introduce new methods. It is difficult to assess the results of her work at this time.\n\nIntermediate Room\n\nThere are 28 pupils in Grade 2 and 20 \" \" \" 3.\n\nI doubt if Miss Hamilton is too effective a teacher. She had but little work prepared but there was no time table evident. The discipline is only fair and many children seemed to be reading without direction. I felt better organization was definitely required.\n\n(cont'd.)\nSenior Room: Mrs. McKee\n\nShe is a capable and conscientious teacher. Even though she is an older woman, I found her using modern teaching methods and the results were quite satisfactory.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nApril 13, 1957.\n\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nInspection of Residential Schools at Prince Albert:\n\nIt is some years since we had provincial inspectors' reports on what is being done at St. Albans and Lac La Ronge schools.\n\nAlmost two years ago Mr. Percy was requested to inspect (letter flagged - April 19, 1949) but he retired before acting.\n\nI suggest that much the same letter now be sent to Mr. Percy's successor, Mr. E.H. Waugh. The letter to Mr. Percy might be repeated to Mr. Waugh, deleting the words \"since last September\" in paragraph 2.\n\nIt would be well to have these reports soon for reference when suggestions for changing the set-up at Prince Albert are discussed.\n\nC.A. Clark\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nSCHOOL: St. Alban's Indian Residential\nPRINCIPAL: Mr. N.D. Pilcher.\nLOCATION: 2028 Central Avenue, Prince Albert, Sask.\nINSPECTION: May 10, 11, 1951.\n\nGENERAL TONE AND PUPIL PROGRESS:\nDays appear to be well scheduled and the pupils busy and happy at their work. The classes are receiving careful instruction and the pupil progress is generally quite satisfactory.\n\nRECORDS GENERAL:\nOffice records of pupil standing are very limited. However, Principal Pilcher is planning this necessary data for next year. It is felt that Intelligence quotients for the older pupils at least should be on record.\n\nOPPORTUNITY CLASSES:\nThis very desirable feature of Indian education is impossible because of limited space. It is believed that a number of the girls would benefit greatly by being in a class designed for optimum individual progress and development.\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION AND RECREATION:\nRather limited during most of the school year by lack of playroom space. The only available floor space for this valuable feature lies between classrooms and the partitions offer no soundproofing which makes it impossible for classes to exercise during the school day. Evening recreation for these pupils is very limited by lack of space.\n\nORGANIZED GAMES:\nIt is difficult to realize much in this field with girls in Grades I - IV. However, it is hoped that a girls softball team may be organized to compete with other public school teams.\n\nLIBRARY WORK:\nThere is no available space for recreational reading and library activities. Some library material is available in each classroom, but here again limited space makes it difficult to encourage pupil reading. It is felt that an essential feature of this work is an attractive display of books and materials.\n\nVOCATIONAL TRAINING:\nThe girls have been doing very good work in sewing under the direction of Mrs. A.I. Wood. Many practical garments have been made which will be used by the girls. It is regretted that Mrs. Wood is seriously ill and may not be able to complete the work planned for this term.\n\nPUPIL DRESS AND COMFORT:\nThe girls are cleanly and comfortably clothed. There are no unpleasant odors in the crowded classrooms.\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nST. ALBAN'S SCHOOL (Continued)\n\n(2)\n\nCLASSROOM ACCOMMODATION:\n\nAs indicated in the attached forms classroom space is quite inadequate. A careful study of the whole building would indicate that there is no neat solution of this problem. This situation is serious and worthy of special consideration by Departmental and Church authorities.\n\nDINING ROOM AND KITCHEN SERVICE:\n\nThese rooms are clean and made as attractive as limited space will allow. Although no meals were taken with the pupils it is my impression that the pupils are properly nourished.\n\nDORMITORIES:\n\nThe sleeping quarters are generally satisfactory. However, sections accommodating the smaller girls are overcrowded. The washroom and toilet facilities are quite inadequate throughout. The dormitories are neat and tidy and the bedclothing is clean. It is felt that staff supervision in the older girls section might be improved, but here again, lack of accommodation presents a problem.\n\nHOSTEL AND HIGH SCHOOL WORK:\n\nThis feature of Indian Education is difficult to administer and the results thus far are not too encouraging. Two girls were enrolled in Grades IX and XII at the Prince Albert Collegiate last fall opening. The Grade XII student was forced to drop out at Christmas by a personal difficulty; the Grade IX pupil is still attending, but her Collegiate record for the year indicates a June failure.

In Grade 1 the addition and subtraction facts of 5 and 4 were taught, with apparently little interest being aroused in the children by the teacher. In Grades II and III there did not seem to be any definite aim in the number work taken up. There was not any seat work activity provided for the pupils who were not receiving instruction. An examination of exercise books indicated that very little work was being accomplished in this school.\n\nATTENDANCE PROBLEMS.\n\nTwenty-one pupils were enrolled, but only twelve being in attendance on the morning of my inspection. Five of the children present belonged to the Roman Catholic religion. There are five children of the Church of England denomination attending the Onion Lake Indian Residential School. Mr. Mullens appeared more concerned about the attendance of these few Protestant children at the Onion Lake Residential School than the non-attendance of the nine children of his own school. I asked Mr. Davis, Indian Superintendent, and Mr. Grant, Assistant, who were present to look into the whereabouts of the absentees, and to enforce the attendance of those not ill, at school.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n\nThe general condition of the school is most unsatisfactory. Although the new school building under construction, there is no reason why the present classrooms should be permitted to become so dirty and untidy. If the primary objective of the elementary school is to assist the child to enjoy and to appreciate health and healthful living and to promote the interests of health in the community, then this school is not in any way performing its duty in this respect. Although the teacher is not expected to pay out of\n\n(cont'd).\n\nIndian Affairs.

The drinking water was kept in a pail with a cup for dipping the water from the pail. One roller towel was provided for the use of all the pupils. How long the hole in the floor by the stove has been in existence, is not known.\n\nI do not consider that Mr. Mullans is capable of supplying the vigorous type of leadership so essential now in the teacher of the Onion Lake Indian Day School. A replacement for Mr. Mullans at the end of June, 1952, is strongly recommended.\n\nE. N.

Gibbald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have received a letter from Mr. Agent Macdonald of Battleford forwarding correspondence regarding the application by the Rev. Father E. Lacombe for the transfer from the English Church Boarding School at Onion Lake to the Roman Catholic Boarding School at the same place, of two daughters of Joseph Bugler, Eva and Edna, aged 10 and 13 years respectively.\n\nFather Lacombe assumes responsibility for making application on the ground that Joseph Bugler had given him \"full powers.\" In his letter to the Agent he asserts that \"the fear that these two girls would become Catholics was the motive why the Principal of the Onion Lake School did not want to send them home for their vacation\" commenting that this was a \"nice way of recognizing religious liberty and parental rights.\"\n\nBugler appears to have spoken to the Agent in regard to his children not coming home for the holidays.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nOTTAWA.\nand in reply to Mr. Macdonald's letter to Mr. Ellis, the Principal, asking him for the reason, the latter stated that some of the children from outside the Onion Lake Agency were not sent home but taken instead to a summer camp for one month.\n\nMr. Macdonald in answering Father Lacombe's letter explains therefore why the two girls did not go home and pointed out that as he is Agent, it was Bugler's duty to state his own case to the Department's representative.\n\nThe stand Mr. Macdonald takes is correct and Mr. Bugler should have laid the matter of the transfer before him and been advised so to do by Father Lacombe.\n\nThe Agent submits the question to me and I do not consider the capricious application of a pagan Indian to a Priest sufficient ground to warrant the transfer of these children.\n\nI shall be glad to have your suggestions in regard to the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner.\n040 - Edna entered to replace a brother (name) who was discharged.

E. Lacombe, for the transfer of Eva and Edna Bugler, daughters of Joseph Bugler, from the Onion Lake Church of England Boarding School to the Onion Lake Roman Catholic Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your letter is the first intimation the Department received that a question is being raised regarding the religious belief of these children or, that any steps were being taken to have them transferred to a catholic school.\n\nThe record which the Department has of their admission to the Church of England Boarding School is as follows; Eva was a pupil for two years at the Battleford Industrial School and, after the closing of that school, she, along with her brother Louis and a sister Ida, were admitted to the Church of England Boarding School. The applications for their admission were signed by their father, Joseph Bugler, and their religion was stated to be Anglican. Edna was admitted in September 1915, to replace her brother Louis who was granted his discharge. The application for Edna's admission is signed by the father and her religion is stated to be \"Protestant\".\n\nAs these two girls have been pupils in a Church of England Boarding School for several years without, so far as the Department is aware, any question being raised regarding their religion, it is considered that there are no grounds, at the present time, for their transfer to the Roman Catholic School. It is considered also, that the principal acted without\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ellis, the principal of the Onion Lake (C. of E) Boarding School, in which he makes application for the admission as grant earning pupils, of the following children:\n\nEva Abraham\nJohn * (Neepowquatow)\nJohn Macheas\n\nall children belonging to Frog Lake band of this agency.\n\nI would point out to the Department that these children are three of the four * whose admission was approved by the Department in letter of the 15th. of July last, No.117555/10, provided that the admission of these children would not make the number of children in the school in excess of thirty-two, the full number that should be in residence. However, as the school has been keeping these children for several months, and as the principal has had a separate dwelling place prepared for himself and family - thus making available part of the old main * mission building for dormitory accommodation - he considers that the Department should allow him to keep these children as grant earners; thus increasing the number for which the per capita grant is allowed, from thirty to thirty-three.\n\nAs will be seen from a perusal of the principal's letter, the two Abraham children are orphans, and\nthe other child, John Macheas, has been deserted by his father and already has two of his sisters in the school, and as his mother is living immorally, there would seem to be no place for these children to go to if the XXXX school authorities declined to keep them; therefore, if the Department is inclined to accede to the principal's request in this matter and allow the children to remain as grant earning pupils, it would have my approval.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nONION LAKE AGENCY\n\nC. of E.

The mother of these girls has always been a catholic, the father, Jos. Bugler became a catholic a year ago. Both parents desire that their children be brought up in a school of their own denomination, either at Onion Lake, or at Delmass. It seems to me that their right to do so cannot be denied by any fair-minded man, and I can hardly believe that the decision given to the Indian Agent of Battleford by the Deptt. has received your approbation. Anyhow, I ask you, dear Sir, to reconsider the case and to give it the only fair and just solution by transferring the two Bugler girls to one of our catholic boarding schools.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

E. Boarding School, I have the honour to report as follows:\n\nThere are 19 boys and 16 girls enrolled at this school; of these 3 boys and 2 girls are now absent, leaving 16 boys and 14 girls (enrolled) in residence. In addition to these, two halfbreed children, a boy and a girl, also board at the school; making a total of 17 boys and 15 girls resident.\n\nThe boy's dormitories measure 35 x 25 x 16'4\" and 17 x 14'6\" x 9'6\", a capacity of, roughly, 11400 cubit feet, or sufficient accommodation for nearly 23 boys at the rate of 500 cubit feet per boy; so it will be seen that there is plenty of accommodation for the Baptiste children who are all boys; even should only one of the enrolled children remain absent, I may add that there is little likelihood of two of the three absentee boys returning. Joseph Smith, is away with his mother with some hunting Indians to the north-east of here; and the other, Edward Photographer, is a very sickly boy who has been unable to return to the school for some months. I would, therefore, in view of the foregoing, recommend to the favourable consideration of the Department, the admission of the three Baptiste boys into the school as supernumerary pupils. I may say there is ample classroom and other accommodation for these children.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a letter received from Mr. H. Ellis, the principal at the Onion Lake (C.E) Boarding school, asking for the admission of Samuel Faithful, of Frog Lake band, into his school.\n\nThe boy has been attending the Frog Lake Day school, but only irregularly, as his home is a distance of about three miles from the school, and the weather is often adverse to his attendance. However, in view of the fact of there being a Day school at Frog Lake reserve; and to the further fact that the Onion Lake school has more pupils enrolled than the number allowed, I told the principal that there was little likelihood of the Department acceding to his request in this matter; but that I would forward his letter and hold the application form until a reply was received from the Department.\n\nIn connection with the above I would refer you to my letter of yesterday's date, even number, mailed with this.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nChurch of Eng.

Father Lacombe, OMI. Re the transfer of the Bugler children, this letter will explain itself.\n\nI might add that this application was refused last year, when all the correspondence was sent you in my letter No. 303-301, Sept. 4th, 1919, and was covered by your reply dated Sept. 30th, 1919, no File number.\n\nYou will note by Father Lacombe's letter that he has taken the responsibility of advising the parents not to send the children back pending reply from the Department. In the meantime we have a letter from Mr. Ellis, Principal at Onion Lake advising that the parents have been notified to send the children back and that they are now overdue.\n\nI will await your instructions before taking any action, as there is some friction now about the School question on Red Pheasant and it has been reported to me that Father Lacombe is advising the R.C. Indians not to send their children to the Day School, and Ottawa has refused admittance of children from there to Delmas on account of their being a Day School on the Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) S.L.

Macdonald,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg the permission of discussing again the transfer of Jos. Bugler's daughters from Onion Lake to the Delmas School. The Department has refused to do it, last year, but we are convinced that the case was not put properly, before the proper authorities.\n\nLet us first lay down some fundamental principles that will guide in this discussion:\n\na) Liberty of Conscience. This principle is accepted all over the world. Jos. Bugler had perfect right to sever his connection with the Church of England to join the Catholic Church.\n\nb) The most sacred rights of the parents over their children is the right of giving them an education in conformity with their own religious conviction. This is a natural right.\n\nc) It is immaterial to your Department whether an Indian is a Catholic or a non-Catholic, or in what particular denominational Indian School the Indian children are educated.\n\nd) It is admitted by all ligists that where there is conflict between two laws viz., between a natural law and a manmade law, the natural law has the preference over the other; so much more so, when a Government Departmental regulation comes into conflict with the natural law.\n\ne) There is no clause in the Indian Act to forbid an Indian to use any intermediary to negotiate his affairs with the Department; and if there was such a clause, it would certainly be unjust, therefore not binding.\n\nIn the light of the above principles, it should be easy to bring to a fair settlement, this Bugler affair.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6323, file 658-10, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nPut yourself in the place of Jos. Bugler, and also recall to your memory this great command of Our Lord: \"Do ye to others what you want them to do to you\". How would you like to have your parental right disregarded as they are in this case?\n\nJos. Bugler has always been a very obedient and respectful Indian. He has always tried to work in cooperation with his Agent and his Instructor. When he was a member of the Church of England, he was the right hand of Mr. Pink; he very often neglected his own work to go and do Mr. Pink's work, and this old gentleman was never afraid of advancing him all the food he was in need of. But as soon as he joined the Catholic Church (it was during the Spanish flu) Mr. Pink would have seen him with pleasure starve to death with all his family.\n\nMr. Pink who was always more anxious to promote the interests of his Church on the Red Pheasant Reserve, than to do the work which he was supposed to do, made it a duty of his religious zeal to make Jos. Bugler feel that he had done a very wrong action in changing religion.\n\nIn my letter of the 18th Aug. 1919, I was perfectly right in stating that the Bugler girls were not being sent home because of the eventuality of them becoming Catholic. And I have never insinuated in that letter that the Department had anything to do with this action of the Church of England's authorities, because I was sure of the contrary. You certainly misunderstood my letter.\n\nAnd this year before being sent home, how strongly these girls were forbidden to ever join the Church of their parents.\n\nMy Dear Sir, Jos. Bugler, has given me all authority to deal with the Department for the transfer of his girls to the Delmas School, where he has a boy already. We are all confident that the Department will give a favorable and prompt answer, because we know that it is always the Department's aim above all things to consider carefully all affairs of a Denominational nature and a fair decision can always be expected from\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6323, file 658-10, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nfrom them\", and we are sure that the right settlement of this our case will go a long way to re-establish among our Indians the confidence they should always have in their Superiors, but which they have unfortunately lost in great part, through the mismanagement of their affairs during the last Agent's administration.\n\nWe are all interested, Indian Department's Officers as well as Missionaries, in destroying in our Indians their slavish mentality, and to bring them to understand and to believe that they are free citizens of a beautiful and free Country, under the liberal administration of our Indian Department. It is the only way to civilize them and to make them ready as soon as possible for their final enfranchisement.\n\nAs I have advised Joe Bugler, to keep his girls home till we hear from Ottawa, I trust you will give this affair your immediate attention, and that you will bring it to a fair conclusion.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nyour very devoted.\n\n(SGD) E. LACOMBE OMIi\nBattleford, Sask.\nOct. 6th, 1919.\n\nSir,-\n\nIn reply to your letter Sept. 30th, Re the Departments decision in the application for the transfer of the Daughter of Jos. Bugler from the Anglican to the Roman Catholic School at Onion Lake.\n\nI beg to report that I have advised the Mr. Ellis Principal of the Anglican School and also Rev. Lacombe of the Departments ruling.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(SGD) S.L. MacDonald.\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSept. 30/19\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nReferring to your letter #303-301 of the 4th instant I beg to advise you that I communicated with the Department in regard to the question raised of transferring the daughters of Joseph Bugler from the Onion Lake Church of England Boarding School, to the Onion Lake Roman Catholic Boarding School and have to inform you that it is the desire of the Department that these girls should remain at the Onion Lake Church of England Boarding School.\n\nYou will please be good enough to notify the principal to that effect advising me that you have done so.\n\nYours truly,\n\nS.L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\n\nCommissioner.\nOttawa, September 26th, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, regarding the application which you state has been made by Rev. H. Lacombe, for the transfer of Eva and Edna Bugler, daughters of Joseph Bugler, from the Onion Lake Church of England Boarding School to the Onion Lake Roman Catholic Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your letter is the first intimation the Department received that a question is being raised regarding the religious belief of these children or that any steps were being taken to have them transferred to a catholic school.\n\nThe record which the Department has of their admission to the Church of England Boarding School is as follows; Eva was a pupil for two years at the Battleford Indian School and, after the closure of that school along with her brother Louis and a sister Ida, were admitted to the Church of England Boarding School. The applications for their admission were signed by their father, Joseph Bugler, and their religion was stated to be Anglican. Edna was admitted in September 1916 to replace her brother Louis who was granted his discharge. The application for Edna's admission is signed by the father and her religion is stated to be \"Protestant.\"\n\nAs these two girls have been pupils in a Church of England Boarding School for several years without, so far as the Department is aware, any question being raised regarding their religion, it is considered that there are no grounds, at the present time, for their transfer to the Roman Catholic School. It is considered also, that the Principal acted within his discretion in sending them to a summer camp instead of allowing them to go home.\n\nYou may inform both the Agent and the principal that these girls are to remain at the Onion Lake Church of England Boarding School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(SGD) J.D. McLean.\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have received a letter from Mr. Agent Macdonald of Battleford forwarding correspondence regarding the application by the Rev. Father E. Lacombe for the transfer from the English Church Boarding School at Onion Lake to the Roman Catholic Boarding School at the same place, of two daughters of Joseph Bugler, Eva and Edna, aged 10 and 13 years respectively. Father Lacombe assumes responsibility for making application on the ground that Joseph Bugler had given him \"full powers.\" In his letter to the Agent he asserts that \"the fear that these two girls would become Catholics was the motive why the Principal of the Onion Lake School did not want to send them home for their vacation\" commenting that this was a \"nice way of recognizing religious liberty and parental rights.\"\n\nBugler appears to have spoken to the Agent in regard to his children not coming home for the holidays and in reply to Mr. Macdonald's letter to Mr. Ellis, the Principal asking him for the reason, the latter stated that some of the children from outside the Onion Lake Agency were not sent home but taken instead to a summer camp for one month.\n\nMr. Macdonald in answering Father Lacombe's letter explains therefore why the two girls did not go home and points out that as he is Agent, it was Bugler's duty to state his own case to the Department's representative.\n\nThe stand Mr. Macdonald takes is correct and Mr. Bugler should have laid the matter of the transfer before him.\n\nD.G. Scott,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nand been advised so to do by Father Lacombe.\n\nThe Agent submits the question to me and I do not consider the capricious application of a pagan Indian to a Priest, sufficient ground to warrant the transfer of these children.\n\nI shall be glad to have your suggestions in regard to this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCommissioner.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK. Dec. 1st, 1920\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nReferring to my letter of the 19th September 1919, with reference to correspondence that passed between Reverend Father Lacombe and the Indian Agent, regarding the transfer of two children from the English Church Boarding School at Onion Lake to the Roman Catholic Boarding School at Delmas; your instructions to me after having the information put before you were, that the children were not to be transferred to the Catholic School. I passed on your instructions to Mr. Macdonald, and in due course they were given to Father Lacombe.\n\nThe matter has again been brought up by Father Lacombe, and I thought the best thing to do was to have the correspondence copied, and forwarded to you for any further instructions you might wish to give. It seems to me that if Father Lacombe gets his own way in this, there will be trouble arise in other quarters.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nD. C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6323, file 658-10, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of a communication from the Rev. E. Lacombe, Principal of the R.C. School at Delmas, stating that he has applied for the discharge of two Bugler children belonging to the Red Pheasant Band, through their father now attending this school. We have had some previous correspondence over these children which I received a letter from Agent Macdonald of Battleford stating that the Department had given instructions that the said children were to remain at Onion Lake and that we could use the letter as authority should any attempt be made by the said priest or the parents, to remove them. The said children were placed on the working staff of the school during the summer vacation, intending that they should receive their holiday afterwards, this was arranged with Agent Turner of Onion Lake. Now that the time has elapsed it is our intention to take the children back to school, and ask therefore that the said children be refused acceptance into the Delmas School and returned to us.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Commissioner Graham forwards copies of correspondence regarding the transfer of Eva and Edna Bugler, daughters of Joseph Bugler, No. 301 of the Red Pheasants Band, from the Onion Lake (C.E.) Boarding School to the Thunderchild's Boarding School.\n\nThe records in connection with this case are as follows:- Eva was admitted to the Battleford Industrial School at six years of age in 1912, and, upon the closing of that school, was sent to the Onion Lake (C.E.) Boarding School in August, 1917, where she has been a pupil up to the present summer holidays. She is now fourteen years of age. Her sister, Edna, was admitted to the Onion Lake (C.E.) School on September 1st, 1916, to replace her brother Louis, who was granted his discharge. The applications for the admission of both these girls are signed by the father and on the application for Eva her religion is stated to be Anglican, while on that for Edna it is stated to be \"Protestant\". Both these girls have been pupils in the Onion Lake School since the date of their admission - Eva for six and Edna for four years - and no question was raised regarding their religion. Father Lacon of the Thunderchild's School now claims that the father has become a Roman Catholic and has severed his connection with the Church of England and wants the two girls sent to the Thunderchild's Boarding School. They were both allowed home on a holiday and Father Lacon has advised the father to refuse to return them to Onion Lake and now asks that they be allowed to enter his school. A protest has been received from the Principal of the Onion Lake (C.E.) School against their admission to Thunderchild's and he asks that steps be taken to have them returned to his school.\n\nWhile the father has, no doubt, the right to change his religion, yet, it seems to me that, as these girls have been for a number of years in the Anglican School, they should remain there.\nthere. If we allow the transfer of these girls to the Thunderchild's School because the father has changed his religion it will open the door to considerable trouble in similar cases in future, as the Indian parents change their religion with great frequency. I consider that when a child has been in a school for a year or more without any question being raised as to the religion that, although the parents afterwards change their views, the child should remain in the school to which he was first sent. The two girls above mentioned should be returned to the Onion Lake (S.E.) Boarding School, and I would advise that Commissioner Graham be requested to instruct Mr. Agent Macdonald of the Battleford Agency to take the necessary steps to have them returned as soon as possible.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6323, file 658-10, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI have the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant enclosing copies of correspondence between Father Lacombe and Agent Macdonald regarding the transfer of the two Bugler children from the Onion Lake (C.E.) Boarding School to the Thunderchild's Boarding School.\n\nThe Department has carefully considered this matter and has decided, as Eva has been in the Church of England School for six years - also two years at the Battleford Industrial School - and Edna for four years and no question was previously raised regarding their religion, that they are both to remain in the Church of England School. It is considered that, when a child has been in a school for a year or more without any question being raised as to its religion, although the parents afterwards change their religious views, the child should remain in the school to which he was first sent.\n\nThese two girls should be returned to the Onion Lake (C.E.) Boarding School, and I have to request that you will be good enough to instruct Mr. Agent Macdonald of the Battleford Agency to take the necessary steps to have them returned there as soon as possible. I shall be pleased if you will inform the Principal, as well as Father Lacombe, of the decision of the Department in the matter.\n\nIf we allowed the transfer of these two girls to the Thunderchild's School on the ground that the father has changed his religion it would open the door to considerable trouble in similar cases in future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Ferrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nThe Rev. Henry Ellis, Principal of our Society's School at Onion Lake, has forwarded to me a copy of your letter (File No. 115-1-10) of Dec. 29, addressed to him, and a copy of his reply. As the question referred to in this correspondence, namely, the transfer of the pupil Augustine Steinhauser, from the Onion Lake School to the new Methodist School at Edmonton is liable, as Mr. Ellis has pointed out, to be followed by the transfer of other pupils, I beg to request that this transfer not be allowed until after we have had an opportunity of further discussing this subject towards the end of February, when I expect to be in Ottawa. I am extremely anxious that no situation should be allowed to develop which might open the way for almost interminable difficulties in the way of requests for transfer.\n\nAlready a number of Indian parents who are members of the Church of England but have children in the Brandon and Portage la Prairie institutions, have requested that their children be transferred to Elkhorn as soon as that school is opened. In response to their request they have not, up to the present, received any encouragement, our Society having agreed to the following opinion expressed by Mr. Scott in a letter addressed to Canon Gould, our General Secretary, on Oct. 18, 1922, in connexion with this subject:\n\n\"I believe that a child that has been resident in a school and may have imbibed religious opinions should remain in that school for the full tuition period.\"\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have discussed the question with Canon Gould and Dr. Westgate of the M. S. C. C., and they have no objection to the transfer of eight pupils, provided that their places are immediately taken by recruits from the regular recruiting grounds of your school. I am writing to Mr. Indian Agent Turner, advising him that the Department would be pleased if he would assist you in securing eight pupils for the Onion Lake C. of E. Indian Residential School. I am requesting our representative to make an interim report and also to inform the Department when he is sure of this number of applications. He will then be authorized to have you escort the Saddle Lake children to Edmonton.\n\nThe Department is hopeful that funds will be provided in the near future for a new main building for the Onion Lake C. of E. Indian Residential School and it will be of distinct value to you to see one of our modern buildings. The Rev. Mr. Woodsworth, Principal at Edmonton, is informed concerning the proposed transfer and will be requested to show you the Edmonton building and equipment if you are able to escort the children yourself.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

S. C. C., proposes to transfer some eight Saddle Lake children from the Onion Lake C. of E. to the Edmonton Indian Residential School - such transfer to take place only when recruits from the regular constituency of the Onion Lake School can be secured. I should be pleased if you would confer with Rev. Mr. Ellis, who has received a communication in this connection, and do your best to assist him in securing applicants for the proposed vacancies. You might acknowledge this communication and make an interim report regarding the possibilities and then inform me when it is timely to have the children escorted to Edmonton. You may authorize Mr. Ellis to take the children to Edmonton and submit properly certified vouchers in his favour for the expense incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

H. Ellis on the matter therein referred to, and he has informed me of eight children that he is expecting to take the place of those to be transferred to the Edmonton Indian Residential School. Four of these children he has already secured and I will do all that I can to help him get the others, but in the meantime it is Mr. Ellis's intention to take the Saddle Lake Children to Edmonton as soon as he hears that it is convenient to do so.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 16, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, in which you state that you have arranged with Rev. H. Ellis, Principal of the Onion Lake C. of E. Residential School, for the transfer of eight children from that school to the Edmonton Residential School. You should instruct Mr. Ellis to communicate with the Principal of the Edmonton School, viz.: Rev. J. F. Woodsworth, Edmonton, Alta., and ascertain from him when he desires the children from Onion Lake sent to Edmonton.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of the 20th ultimo, you may submit properly certified vouchers in favour of Mr. Ellis for the expense incurred in transferring these children.

E. Residential School to Edmonton, the guardian of the Houle children made a special request that they also be sent to Edmonton. Although he had no authority from the Department to do this, the agent states that, as these children are Methodists and as the Edmonton school is the closest to the Saddle Lake Agency, he felt it advisable to accede to the guardian's request.\n\nIf this matter had been referred to the Department you would have been consulted before the transfer was authorized, but I believe that the agent, in taking this action, felt that, for the reasons stated, he was justified in transferring them and had no desire to deprive the Onion Lake school of the pupils to which it was entitled.\n\nPlease let me know if you insist on the return of the Houle children to Onion Lake. If you can recruit up to strength, it might be well to allow the matter to stand as at present.\n\nOur obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. H.

Pupils Nos. 103, 106, 114, 115, 064, 065, 077, 079, 084 were late in returning to school after the mid-summer vacation. Pupils Nos. 84, 076, 078 are still medically unfit to return. Pupils Nos. 121, 098, 0102, 0103, and 0104 have been taken to the Elkhorn Anglican School as their parents requests for their transfer to the Onion Lake Anglican School was not approved of by the Department. Pupil No. 0803 was a new pupil but was transferred because of her sister returning to the Elkhorn School. The aggregate number of days has been reduced accordingly from 7538 to 7321, making the per capita grant earnings for the past quarter $2785.30.\n\nWith regard to the new pupils whose applications and certificates of health have not yet been received by the Department, I have to inform you that they have been sent to the Agencies from where the children were recruited from.\n\nTrusting this will meet with the Department's approval.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I informed them that I had come for Angus as she had to return to the boarding School at Onion Lake. The grand-father did not wish the child to go although the mother wanted her to return to the school, and the girl herself wanted to go, after a lot of persuading by me Thomas Knife consented that the girl should return to the school, at my request the girl got dressed and accompanied Indian Agent Weir and myself in the car.\n\nI then proceeded to the home of John Ermine, step-father of the above named boy Angus Ahenakew and informed them that I had come for Angus as he had to return to the Boarding School at Onion Lake.

He was discharged from the school, it was thought that likely there was a misunderstanding on the boy's parents part in regards to the boy having to return to the school, therefore Mr. John Weir, Indian Agent sent a requisition to the boy by Mr. Gregson with instructions for the boy to meet Mr. Ellis, in Prince Albert on Friday morning October 29th.\n\nOn Friday afternoon October 29th when I met Mr. Ellis, at the train in Leask for the purpose of handing over to him two other Indian children from Sandy Lake reserve who were absentees from the school.

It is presumed that this child is still in the hospital and, as she will not likely be able to return to the Onion Lake School for some time, at least, she should be considered discharged. Please inform the Principal accordingly.\n\nIn your letter, you state that this girl was allowed to go to Edmonton for the Christmas holidays. On reviewing the December quarter return from the Onion Lake School, it is found that this return, which was signed by you as correct, asked grant for this girl for 92 days.

H. Ellis, principal at the Onion Lake Church of England Residential School, spoke to me some days before Christmas holidays regarding the advisability of letting Maggie Abraham go to Edmonton to her friends for a few days. Mr. Ellis thought he was acting within his rights in showing the child's name on the return as in residence, and I thought also that there was nothing improper about this, as the child was intended to return by the New Year. She left the school on December 23rd, and was to be away simply for the time the remainder of the pupils were having holiday, but was taken sick and could not return.\n\nI have spoken to Mrs. Ellis over this matter and he agrees to deduct the days in question from the next quarterly return, if the Department considers the school has been improperly paid for them.\n\nI would ask the Department to kindly let me know if the eight days are to be deducted from the next quarterly return of this school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 6th, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, with reference to Maggie Abraham, pupil No. 056, of the Onion Lake C.E.

The name, of course, should be retained on the return and a note should appear opposite the name in the column provided for that purpose, stating the length and the reasons of the absence. Grant should not have been requested for this girl for the period she was absent from the school during the December quarter.

School at Delmas, Sask.\"\n\nUnder these circumstances the Commission would be grateful if your Department could give favourable consideration to the enclosed accounts.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Secy-Treas.\nIndian & Eskimo Commission\nOttawa, November 22nd, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, enclosing vouchers to the extent of $95.90 for disbursements by Rev. H. Ellis, Principal of the Onion Lake C.E. Residential School, in connection with travelling of children returning to the school from their vacations and expenses incurred for recruiting new children.\n\nThe Department does not pay the travelling expenses of a Principal but we are prepared to consider payment of the expenses incurred in returning children to the school after the summer holidays. I am, therefore, returning the accounts which you forwarded and would appreciate your requesting Mr. Ellis to forward, through the office of his local Indian Agent, that portion of the enclosed vouchers which covers the expenses of children returning to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:- Re - Expenditure incurred in returning pupils to\nthe Onion Lake School after summer holidays.\n\nI have received your letter of the 22nd instant,\n(115-1-10) pertaining to the expenditure incurred in having pupils\nreturned to our Onion Lake School after the summer holidays. The\nvouchers are going forward today to Mr. Ellis with a request that\nhe should take the matter up with the local Indian Agent in\naccordance with your instructions, and you will no doubt hear\nfurther from your representative in this connection.\n\nIn the meantime I trust you may not consider our request\nfor assistance in meeting the cost of an escort for these children\nas either unfair or unreasonable. In the first place the School\nis situated 40 miles from the railway with a wide river to be\ncrossed on the way. Until a heavy truck was provided the labour\nand anxiety and expense which fell upon the School management in\ntransporting the children out and back over this distance has been\nmuch greater than can be readily appreciated. From Lloydminster\nmany of the children had a long railway journey to their homes\nand changed from one train to another at Battleford. To the\nPrincipal, and I may add, to our Commission also, it seemed that an\nescort should be provided for this part of the journey also.\nHitherto the cost of an escort has been provided by our Society and\nour Commission very earnestly desire you to assist them as much\nas may be in your power in meeting this expenditure in the future.\nIf a fixed sum, say of $250, were included in your annual\nappropriation for this specific purpose, leaving our Society to\nmeet any expenditure incurred over that amount, it would probably\nmeet the needs of the case. If this total amount were not required\nit would not, of course, be expended.\n\nCommending this suggestion to your favourable consideration, I have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, November 30th, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 25th instant, in which you request the Department to provide a definite sum for expenses incurred by the Principals of the Onion Lake and Alert Bay Residential Schools escorting pupils. In reply I beg to say that it is only in exceptional cases that we pay the travelling expenses of Principals. All such cases are considered on their own merits and the Department is not prepared to set aside specific amounts for this purpose.\n\nI might add that pupils whose homes cannot be easily reached should be discouraged from taking holidays every year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I eventually located his camp, but there was no one around there and on making further enquiries, was informed that Joe Minney had gone to the residential school to interview the Rev Mr Ellis, the Principal, to have the boy returned there.\n\nIt appeared from information received that Joe Minney had taken the boy away from the school for help to get in hay, but that they had quarrelled and he then wanted the boy to return, but the boy had left him.\n\nI was unable to locate either Joe Minney or the boy on that occasion, but I left word that Joe Minney was to take the boy back to the school immediately on his return. I reported this to Mr Turner, and he was to return me, should this not be done. Up to the present time I have not heard from Mr Turner, and have no doubt that the boy has been returned to the school.\n\nI intend however, to take up this matter again when next on duty at Onion Lake.\n\nH.

November 17, 1928\n\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe: the attendance of pupils and grant for the Onion Lake School C.of E. Sept. quarter, 1928\n\nMy attention has been directed to the grant paid by your Department for the Sept. Quarter, 1928, for our Onion Lake School, the attendance for that period, according to the report of the Principal, being 71 but the grant allowed being furnished for an average attendance of 69.36.\n\nFrom a letter recently received from the Rev. Henry Ellis, Principal of this School, it would appear that five children from the Carlton Agency at Leask, who had been in residence at his school \"for four years and more\", were transferred by order of your Department to the File Hills School, without any reference to him whatever. The names of the children are as follows:-\n\n#91 Samuel Dreaver Age 14 years -\n#61 Lydia Dreaver \" 13 \"\n#99 Ivan Dreaver \" 14 \"\n#68 Christie Dreaver \" 16 \"\n#69 Mary Dreaver \" 12 \"\n\nAs the above pupils were in attendance at our Onion Lake School at the end of the June Quarter when a grant was allowed for 80 pupils, it appears to me that their absence from the School during the September Quarter, apparently by order of your Department, and without the admission of other pupils to take their place, is responsible for the reduction in the grant for that period.\nAs the transfer of pupils from one school to another does not harmonize with the wishes of your Department, so far as I understand them, I am wondering if any mistake has been made in this matter by the Indian Commissioner, on whose authority it would appear the transfer was effected.\n\nI shall be grateful, therefore, for any explanation you may be able to furnish in this connection, and for a reconsideration of the amount of the grant which our Society should have received for the September Quarter. So far as our Commission can see, and they have given their careful consideration to this matter, they are of the opinion that the grant should certainly have been paid for an attendance of not less than 71. They were also of the opinion that when pupils are removed, as those mentioned appear to have been, by an order from your Department, without giving our Society an opportunity of replacing them, the grant should be paid on the basis of the average attendance for the last previous Quarter.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from the Field Secretary of the M. S. C. C., in which he protests against the transfer of Samuel Dreaver, Lydia Dreaver, Ivan Dreaver, Christie Dreaver and Mary Dreaver of the Mistawasis Reserve from the Onion Lake C.E. Residential School to the File Hills Residential School.\n\nOn reviewing the September quarter return of the File Hills School, it is found that the names of only two of these children - Christie Dreaver and Mary Dreaver - were shown and, on the admission and discharge sheet accompanying the return, it was stated \"Transferred from Onion Lake School auth. Commissioner Graham's letter 305-11B, Aug. 20th/28\". The Department would appreciate your advising the reasons for transferring these children and you should also state if the other three children mentioned above have also been sent to File Hills.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6323, file 658-10, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, November 24th, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 17th instant with reference to the September quarter grant of the Onion Lake C. E. Residential School, I beg to say that, on reviewing the return, it is found that the principal made a mistake in his additions on page 4 of this return. He computed the aggregate attendance for the quarter as 6,552 days whereas the correct aggregate attendance was 6,381 days. The average attendance based on this aggregate was 69.36, for which number grant was allowed.\n\nIncluded in the aggregate of 6,381 days was 43 days' grant for each of the five pupils mentioned in your letter.\n\nI am writing Mr. Commissioner Graham with reference to the transfer of these children to the File Hills Residential School and, on receipt of his report, you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDecember 7, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nMy attention has been drawn to your 303-11B of the 29th ultimo, regarding the Dreaer children of the Mistawasis reserve. This summer, when you brought to my notice Dreaer's request for a transfer of his children from the Onion Lake to the File Hills Indian Residential School, I understood that they had recently been admitted to the former institution. I find that such is not the case, and I now believe his request should not have been granted. These children had been at the Onion Lake School for some time, and the Department does not transfer children on religious grounds. Further, the File Hills School is not Presbyterian but United Church.\n\nEvidently, William Dreaer did not intend to send his children to File Hills. I find that only two of them are registered there, and I am satisfied that those that are still on the Mistawasis reserve should be returned to Onion Lake. If you concur, please take steps to this end without delay and let me have a report concerning your action. I agree that it would be a mistake to take these children from boarding school and enroll them at the Mistawasis Bay School. Your remarks regarding the Rev.

He told me that he had arranged with the Priest at the R.C. School that he, Francis, should send his girls to the Roman Catholic, and his boys to the Anglican school. However; I thought it better to have the Rev.M.Ellis take a declaration from Harper; this is attached to the application.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 16th, 1928.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant enclosing an application and certificate of health for the admission of Louis Francis Harper to the Onion Lake Anglican Indian Residential School.

(See Section 10 (1) of the Indian Act.)\n\nI would, also, point out that you should not request Indians to sign a declaration unless this is specially requested by the Department.

Grant will be paid at the above rate upon receipt of a voucher, in duplicate, from you from time to time when considered timely to request payment. When forwarding these vouchers, I shall be pleased if you will also obtain from the Principal of the College and forward to the Department a report showing the progress this boy is making in his studies, as the continuance of the grant will depend entirely upon the success which he is achieving in his studies.\n\nIt is noted that it is the intention to arrange for the transfer of this boy from the Onion C.

There are two considerations, however, which incline me to think that it would be wise to give this matter further attention before making that ruling final and unalterable. They are as follows:\n\n(1) When the Rev. Principal Ellis forwarded the enclosed declaration, he wrote, in part, as follows:\n\n\"I herewith enclose a statement from Francis Harper regarding his boy Louis, to the effect that he wants his boy to remain in the Anglican School. I informed him that the Department stated that his boy was to be returned home. He immediately went down to the Agency and signed this statement that was made there. Mr. Turner handed it to me at his last inspection. Francis Harper has stated that he will not allow his boy to attend the Roman Catholic school and if the Department will not approve of him staying here then he will remain at home. I have had nothing to do with the statement nor have I advised Francis in any way.\"\n(2) You will recall from your letters of May 2, 1927, #116-1-10 and September 6, 1927, #115-8-10, that the pupil Anna Quinney, a child of Anglican parents was permitted by your Department, at the request of the parents, to be allowed to remain in the Roman Catholic School.\n\nIt seems to me that for these reasons this question deserves further attention, and in view of the apparent determination on the part of the Indian parent Fran\u00e7ois Harper, I beg to suggest that the matter be referred back to your representative at the Onion Lake Agency with a request that he submit a further report and recommendation to you on this important subject.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nSir,\u2014\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Anglican Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Department of Indian Affairs may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child:\nEnglish name:\nAge:\nName of Band:\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid:\nFather's full name and No.:\nMother's full name and No.:\nParents living or dead:\nState of child's health:\nReligion:\nMoral character:\nDoes applicant speak English?\nPreviously attended school for years:\n\n(Signature of Father)\n\nNOTE\u2014If mother or guardian signs, agent must forward full explanatory note.\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\nSignature of Missionary or other Witness.\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNOTE\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band\", \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion\".

March 26, 1929\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of March 5, and your reply to the same on March 11, #115-1-10, relative to the admission of the pupil, Louis Francis Harper, to our Society's Onion Lake Indian Residential School, I beg to state that our Commission have noted, with much surprise, your statement that \"the Department is not prepared to consider approving of the admission of this boy to the Onion Lake C. of E. Residential School.\" As they feel that this matter cannot be allowed to rest where it stands at present, they have instructed me to direct your attention to the following paragraph in the letter of the Deputy Superintendent General, dated Ottawa, June 5, 1922, and addressed to the Rev. Canon Gould, General Secretary of our Society:\n\n\"In accordance with this view, if a Protestant parent wishes his child placed in a Roman Catholic school and brought up in the Roman Catholic religion, or a Roman Catholic parent his child in a Protestant school and brought up in the Protestant religion, he may do so, but for the protection of the Department, we demand in such cases an affidavit to that effect by the father. Such affidavit must be made before a justice of peace, Indian Agent, or other person authorized to take affidavits, and the person who takes such affidavit must certify that the statements set forth in the affidavit were read over or interpreted and explained to the deponent who thoroughly understood the same. In cases of bona fide adoption, the religion and wishes of the foster father will be recognized by the Department. The Department reserves the right to make decisions in special cases that are brought to our attention.\"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6323, file 658-10, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIn the case of the pupil in question, the affidavit required was duly made out and forwarded to you in my letter of the 5th instant, and unless the ruling set forth in the Deputy Superintendent General's letter, as quoted above, has since been amended, or, it is the intention of your Department to treat this as a special case, our Commission can see no valid reason why the application of the parent in question should not receive the further consideration suggested in my letter. The suggestion was that the matter be referred back to your representative at the Onion Lake Agency with a request that he submit a further report and recommendation to you on the subject. In the case of the pupil Anna Quinney, a child of Anglican parents admitted to the Roman Catholic School, the action now suggested was taken by your Department, on more than one occasion, and our Commission are quite unable to understand why similar action should not again be taken in connection with the case of the pupil in question. Their request, in this matter, appears to them to be so manifestly reasonable and fair, that they respectfully desire you to give it further consideration.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTERW/JP\nIndian & Eskimo Commission of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nAnglican Indian Residential School\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\n26th March 1929.\n\nL. Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake Indian Agency,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Turner:\n\nWith reference to your letter of recent date concerning Louis Francis Harper, I have made known to the father that the Department advises that the boy should be returned to his home at once.\n\nIn view of the fact that the father is not willing that his boy should attend another school, the father being an intelligent person and speaks English fluently, it is felt that he should be given some consideration as father of the child and state just where his child should be educated. I have therefore, asked our Field Secretary, the Rev. Dr. Westgate to request the Department to give this case further consideration and to refer the matter again to you. I would appreciate if you will do this at the earliest possible moment.\n\nFurther, as Francis Harper has stated that if the boy is returned home, he will stay home for good, it has been thought advisable to retain him at the school until such time as the case has received further consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOnion Lake Agency\n\nApril 5, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of December 18th last, No. 115-1-10, respecting Louis Francis Harper, an Indian boy of Onion Lake band, for whom application was made for admittance to the Onion Lake Anglican Indian Residential School.\n\nImmediately upon receipt of the above mentioned letter, I informed the Rev. H. Eldridge, principal at the school, of the Department's decision in the matter; and am now in receipt of the enclosed letter from him, in which he requests the Department to give the case further consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Harry Ellis, Principal of the Onion Lake C.E. Residential School, with reference to Louis Francis Harper. In view of the instructions contained in circular letter of November 12th, 1926, the Principal should not have permitted this boy to enter the school and, when you advised him of the Department's decision, the Principal should have sent the boy to his parents.\n\nThe application form stated that the religion of this boy is Roman Catholic and, while the Department considers that it is in the best interests of all concerned to have children educated in a school conducted under the auspices of the religion which they profess, I may say that the Secretary of the M.S.C.C. has written the Department requesting further consideration of this application. It is desired, therefore, that you interview the father personally and ascertain definitely why he apparently wishes his son placed in the Church of England School rather than in the Roman Catholic School. Any further information that you can obtain regarding the father's reasons for making this application should also be forwarded for our consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, April 19th, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo with further reference to the application for the admission of Louis Francis Harper to the Onion Lake C.E.

He says that he told Father Boiter, the Principal at the R.C. School here, of his intention to put the boy in the Anglican School, and, while the Father did not altogether agree to this being done, he did not raise any objection. Francis already has one girl at the R.C. School, and has told me that he intends to leave her there, and has told Father Boiter so, and has promised him that he will send his girls to that School. Briefly, Francis thinks that the Anglican is the best school for boys, and\nOttawa, June 8th, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of March 26th, last, regarding an application for the admission of Louis Francis Harper to the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School, I beg to say that the Department is now in receipt of a further report from Mr. Agent Turner.\n\nAfter again reviewing very carefully all the information received regarding this application, the Department is requesting Mr. Agent Turner to inform Rev. Mr. Ellis that we are not prepared to approve the admission of Louis Francis Harper to the Onion Lake C. E. Residential School at the present time and that he should be returned to his father.\n\nPermit me to refer to the last paragraph of official letter of April 19th. The eligibility of this boy, on religious grounds, was doubtful and, in view of the instructions contained in circular letter of November 12th, 1926, it is felt that Rev. Mr. Ellis should not have allowed him to remain at the Onion Lake C. E. School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. F.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, June 8th, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th ultimo with further reference to the application for the admission of Louis Fran\u00e7ois Harper to the Onion Lake C. E. Residential School.\n\nThe Department considers that it is in the best interests of all concerned to adhere as strictly as possible to the intention of Section 10 (1) of the Indian Act. The original application stated that the religion of this boy is Roman Catholic and, while the father's statement contained in your recent letter conveys the intimation that he is considering joining the Anglican Church, the Department feels that it must be kept in mind that the father, up to the present, considered himself a Roman Catholic by placing his girl in the Onion Lake R. C. Residential School. His opinion that the one school is better for boys cannot be considered.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to approve the admission of this boy to the Onion Lake C. E. Residential School at the present time and it is considered that he should be returned to his father at once. Please inform Rev. Mr. Ellis accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ.

As the father emphatically declared that he will never send this boy to the Roman Catholic School, and has already forwarded to your Department an affidavit setting forth his desire to have him admitted to and educated in our Society's School, your decision in this connection is quite as perplexing to him as it is to me. His perplexity in this matter is further intensified by the fact that he requested the Principal of our Society's School here to admit this boy to membership in the Church of England, and this admission has already taken place. I have talked the situation over today with Mr. Indian Agent Turner, and recommended to him, when until further notice, the request of the Father that the boy be permitted to attend our Society's School as a day pupil be granted, and Mr. Turner agreed to support this recommendation. Mr. Turner will, I understand, write to you in this connection. I further recommended to Mr. Indian Agent Turner that a strong effort be made to have the question of the admission of this boy to our Society's School as a grant-earning pupil, finally decided at an early date, and gave it as my opinion that this decision should be reached not later than the middle of August, when the school will reopen after the summer holidays. Mr. Turner agreed to this recommendation, and will, I believe, write you accordingly.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have written Mr. Turner asking him on whose authority these children have been admitted, as it is contrary to all regulations to admit halfbreed children to our schools. I am of the opinion that these children should be discharged at once, as we are liable to have other schools doing the same thing. We have the situation pretty well cleared up with regard to getting halfbreed children out of the schools who were in without authority, and if we are not very careful it will only be a short time before we are having the same difficulty again.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

I would ask that Doctor Westgate be written to by the Department in this regard, and, if it is the Department's wish, the children should be discharged at once.

Indian Residential School, I have to state that they first entered the school in February, 1928, coming from Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan. Their mother had just died and their father asked to have them placed in the school temporarily. Mr. Ellis, however, lost all trace of the father, but finally located him and he promised to take the children away. He has not done so and Mr. Ellis is in communication with him and expects that he will come and take the children away soon. I note in the Agent's report for the month of November that they are still in residence, and, as it is not the intention of the Department to educate them, if the father does not take them away and look after them they should be transferred to the Department of Neglected and Dependent Children.\n\nWe are frequently being asked to allow the admission of half-breed children to our Indian schools and are as constantly refusing, and the Reverend Canon Westgate should not have informed the Principal that they could be admitted, as their cases were evidently ones which should have been dealt with by Provincial authorities and not by the Indian Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nW.

E. Indian Residential School is approved. Please inform the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI am forwarding herewith Indian Agent Turner's reports on the R.C. and C. of E. Indian Residential Schools in the Onion Lake Agency, also reports in the Day Schools.\n\nI would draw your attention to the fact that the three Lawrence children are still in residence at the R.C. School, and the three Peterson children at the C. of E. School. These children should be discharged and handed over to the proper authorities, as they are certainly not a proper charge against the Department of Indian Affairs, being halfbreeds.\n\nWith reference to the Peterson children that are in the C. of E. School, I think Dr. Westgate should be called upon to see that they are removed. I have done everything I could in the matter. I have spoken to the authorities of the Provincial Government, and they led me to believe that they were going to have the children removed, but they will certainly keep them there as long as the Indian Department will allow it.\n\nMy own opinion is that the Department should issue explicit instructions to the Principals that they are not to admit these halfbreed children. On the 7th instant I wrote you in connection with a number of halfbreed children that had been admitted to the Qu'Appelle School by the Principal. If we relax our vigilance in this matter we will soon have our schools filled up with halfbreeds, as the information soon passes from one school to another.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

And this was done in contravention of the regulations of the Indian Department, which had decided that no Catholic child should be admitted in a Protestant school and vice versa.\n\nThe child, Elizabeth, has never been admitted into the Anglican Church, the parents always having been adhered to that. Therefore the parents want their daughter to be admitted in the Thunderchild Residential School, where she ought to have been put in the first time.\n\nI trust that you will recognize the legitimacy of their demand.

E. Indian Residential School for the past three years. In reply I beg to say that the parents' request will receive consideration and Mr. Agent Macdonald will be advised of our decision in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

E. Indian Residential School. It appears from your letter that you are now convinced that this family is Roman Catholic. When you forwarded the original application for the admission of this girl to the Onion Lake C. E. School under cover of your letter of January 12th, 1928, the application form stated that her religion was Anglican and it was signed by yourself and witnessed by Rev. E. Ahenskew.\n\nIt is noted from the statement forwarded by the father that he claims the family has been recognized as Roman Catholics for the past twelve years. In view of this information, the Department would appreciate your advising why, in 1928, you signed the application form stating her religion to be Anglican. A written statement from Rev. Mr. Ahenskew, who witnessed the signatures on the application form and who, apparently, considered the girl was eligible for admission to the Onion Lake C. E. Residential School, would also be appreciated.\n\nWhen replying, the Department trusts that you will give as complete information as possible in order to permit us to have all the facts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Macdonald Esq.\nIndian Agent\nBattleford, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Macdonald:\n\nI called at the Office Friday P.M. as I promised you by post card which I sent in response to your note but found that you had been called away to Regina.\n\nI understand that a protest in connection with Elizabeth Medicine Child being at the Onion Lake C.of E. School has been made by Father Lacombe.\n\nThe facts of the case, as I remember them, are these. Mr. Ellis came to the Reserve some two years ago, more or less, to see one or two people who had signified their intention to send children to his school. Naturally I went around with him. While I made a call at Sapoostayekun's he walked over to Medicine Child's and was back to Sapp's within four or five minutes to tell me that Mrs. Medicine Child was sending Elizabeth to Onion Lake. There was no time for conversation of a persuasive nature.\n\nLater on Medicine Child came to see me and said he was glad Elizabeth was going to Onion Lake.\n\nMr. Ellis left the application form with me.\n\nNow as regards the protest. The rule at the Onion Lake School is this. Parents write to the principal when they want their children to come home for the holidays. They send the money for the R.R. Fare of the child and if they have not got the money, they write any how. Elizabeth's fare would come to 85 cents, but Medicine Child did not even write to say he was at home and wanted Elizabeth to come home, much less send the small sum required for her fare. The only thing Mr. Ellis could do was to hold the girl pending word from the father.\n\nMedicine Child was clearly at fault and yet this is the only reason he had for seeking to transfer Elizabeth. He told me so himself about three weeks ago! Mr. Ellis offended me for not sending Elizabeth back,\" he said, \"that is the only reason I am taking the girl out of that school.\" He further stated that he did not press the point when he went to the office to see you but it was the priests who were so insistent (ka aylmesichik, who were fierce). He said that if the Dept. were not favorable to the transfer the girl would go back to Onion Lake.\n\nArchdeacon Burd and I are going to the Board of Man-\n\nIndian Affairs.

In most cases the children are taken to schools before I get the forms they are examined there and then the forms are sent to me.\n\nThere is no question, but that the whole trouble was agitated by Father Lacombe, as wherever he goes there is trouble following.\n\nAs this girl has been at the school for two years now without any protest, the parents were apparently satisfied. I believe a ruling that the child stay at the school she is at, would be accepted without further protest by the parents.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 20, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 955-308A of the 12th instant, with reference to Elizabeth Medicinechild, pupil at the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School. I have discussed this case with the Rev. Mr. Ahenakew, and I am now satisfied that if all the facts had been known to the Department, this girl's admission would not have been approved. The application form shows her religion to be Anglican, but Mr. Ahenakew, who prepared the form, states that he left the space for religion blank. It would be interesting to know who wrote the word \"Anglican\" on the form.\n\nThe girl's father professes the Roman Catholic religion and the Rev. Mr. Ellis should not have considered admitting Elizabeth without laying the full facts before the Department. You will please so inform Mr. Ellis. For the purpose, I am enclosing a copy of this letter.\n\nIf any further protest is received, concerning this girl's presence in the Anglican School, you will please inform the Department forthwith. It is not the practice to transfer children from one Indian residential school to another for religious reasons, because this would lead to endless difficulty; but, if Medicinechild insists on withdrawing his child from the Anglican school, the Department will give favourable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell J.

H. Ellis, Principal of the Onion Lake C.E.

I informed the Chief then that it was no time to make such a proposition when the Principal was here in order to take children back to school, and that he would have to take the matter up with the Department as I had no authority to interfere with Boarding School regulations. The Chief would not allow Samuel to return with Mr. Ellis, claiming that the boy belonged to him and on account of old age and not feeling well he needed the boy at home in order to help make a living for the family. I may mention that Chief Brewer is in receipt of a double ration.\n\nA month later when Mr. Ellis again returned in order to take some pupils back Inspector Hamilton was here and the Chief again refused to let his son return. I considered it better to write you fully in this connection giving you the Chief's viewpoint before calling upon the R.C.M.P. Police as I consider that some strong action will have to be taken in order to have this boy returned to school.\n\nI will await your further instructions before proceeding further as yesterday I informed the Chief of your communication and he refused to comply with your instructions to allow the boy to return.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

E. Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that this girl was brought to the Frog Lake Reserve from Cumberland House last July. Do you consider that the aunt brought her to Frog Lake simply for the purpose of having her admitted as a grant-earning pupil to an Indian residential school? Before replying, it might be advisable for you to communicate with Mr. Indian Agent W.G. Tweedell, The Pas, Man., and obtain from him some additional information regarding this girl.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, No.115-1-10, and, in reply, to inform you that I have communicated with Mr. Indian Agent W. G. Tweddell respecting the girl Nellie Sahyese, for whom application was made for admission to the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School.\n\nMr. Tweddell informs me that the girl is a half-breed, and that her father, Angus Sahyese, is living at Big Eddy, The Pas. She was living with her grandfather, Baptiste Sahyese, at Cumberland House, at the time Mrs. Harriet Quinney, her aunt, of Frog Lake in this Agency, brought her back here. Although Mrs. Quinney will not admit that she brought her niece here solely for the purpose of having her placed in the school as a grant-earning pupil, she had the girl with her only a short time before making application for her admission.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 26th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Agent Turner, Onion Lake, Sask., has recently forwarded an application for the admission of Hellie Sahyese to the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School. The girl was placed in the school by her aunt, Harriet Quinney of the Frog Lake Band, Onion Lake Agency.\n\nThe Department wrote Mr. Turner for further information and I understand that he has written to you in connection with this application but the information that the Department has, at present, received, is not sufficiently definite to permit us giving a decision.\n\nThe application form shows that the mother is dead and Mr. Turner states that you advise that the father, Angus Sahyese, is living at Big Eddy. Please let me know if this girl's mother was an Indian, also, where the family has been residing for the past few years. Has the father contributed to the support of his daughter or has she been wholly cared for by the grandfather, Baptiste Sahyese. If so, you should state if the grandfather is an Indian and where he resides.\n\nDo you consider that this girl comes within the terms of the Department's ruling regarding the admission of half-breeds to Indian residential schools, viz., has she been living the Indian mode of life on a reserve?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.G. Tweedell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSir:\n\nPer Department letter 115-1-19, Nov 26th, I was able yesterday to locate Old Antoine and he assures me that he is satisfied and wants his son Louis Antoine to go the Onion Lake C.E. School.\n\nHe states that it was on account of his first wife that he sent two boys to the R.C. School that he was never rightly R.C. himself and that he is going to send the rest of his children to the Anglican School.\n\nIn view of the above, I would recommend that the Application for admission be accepted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 31st, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your 111-308A of the 19th instant, with further reference to the application submitted for the admission of Louis Antoine to the Onion Lake Anglican Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that Old Antoine has recently informed you that \"It was on account of his first wife that he sent two boys to the R. C. School, that he was never rightly R. C. himself\". On the other hand, Mr. W. D. Taylor's letter, enclosed with your 45-308A of the 15th ultimo, stated that Old Antoine is a Roman Catholic and that the family of four boys and one girl were all baptised in the Catholic Church. Further, Mr. Taylor stated that Old Antoine simply wished the boy admitted to the Onion Lake School on account of the mother being Anglican. In cases of this kind, extreme care has to be exercised and, owing to the divergence in the information now before the Department regarding this man's religion, it will be necessary to make further inquiries. Please endeavour to ascertain what church this man and his family have been attending recently and any other information available with a view to determining what religious belief they have been recognized as professing. On receipt of your reply, the application will receive further consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nS. L.

It appears that this girl is a half-breed and, previous to the time Mrs. Quinney took charge of her, was not living on a reserve. Under these circumstances, she was certainly not eligible for admission as a grant-earning pupil up to the time she went to live with Mrs. Quinney.\n\nIt is noted from your letter of the 12th ultimo that she only resided with Mrs. Quinney a few months before application was made for her admission to the Onion Lake School and the Department is inclined to feel that Mrs. Quinney took her simply for the purpose of having her placed in the school mentioned. Under these circumstances, the Department does not consider that this girl is eligible for admission as a grant-earning pupil to an Indian residential school at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Correspondence enclosed with application shows that the father of this boy is recognized as a Catholic and that the family of four boys and one girl were all baptized in the Catholic Church. This correspondence further showed that the father simply wishes the boy admitted to the Onion Lake School on account of the mother being Anglican. The Agent stated that two older boys had been sent to the Thunderchild Residential School.\n\nOn being requested for additional information, Agent Macdonald writes, as follows:\n\n\"I beg to report that, yesterday, I went to see Antoine and his wife and they are both satisfied to have the boy in the Onion Lake Anglican School.

I have even discussed it with Father Lacombe and explained the whole situation to him and he did not state any opposition.\n\nThe parents I understand have sent the boy to the School, but in view of the Departments instructions I have written to Mr Ellis to send the back reading definite instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

E. Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department still feels that it is in the best interests of this family that all the children should be educated under the same religious auspices. The Department is, therefore, not prepared to give any decision at the present time with reference to the application for the admission of this boy to the Onion Lake C. E. Residential School. You might report further in May or June, next.\n\nIt is noted from the last paragraph of your letter that you have instructed Rev. Mr. Ellis, Principal of the Onion Lake C.E. School, to return the boy to his parents and your action in this regard is approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nOttawa, March 20th, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your 4926-104 O.L. of the 16th instant, enclosing an application and certificate of health for the admission of Gilbert Lazarus Sanderson to the Onion Lake C.E. Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that the application form states that the boy has lived all his life on the reserve, while the last paragraph of your letter mentions that the boy's mother and foster father have been living on and off the reserve. Please let me know if the boy has been maintained by his mother and foster father since 1924 or has he been living with someone on the reserve.\n\nWhile it has no direct bearing on the matter, the Department would, also, appreciate knowing if any other children have been born to Isabella Sanderson since her marriage to Descharmes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

If their admission has not already been approved I beg to recommend that approval be granted in the immediate future. The Rev. Principal Ellis informs me, in a letter dated, Onion Lake, March 12th, that these two boys, their brother Alexis, their Sister Annie Eleanor, and their Father Antoine, were admitted to membership in the Church of England on that date, and I can see no reason whatever for any further delay in having the admission to our school of the boys mentioned, approved.\n\nIt appears from the correspondence before me that your Department has approved the admission to the R.C. School at Duck Lake of the two children Hilda and Grace Daniels, who, along with their Mother were members of the Anglican Church until January 18th last, when they were admitted to membership in the R.C. Church on that date.\n\nIt seems to me, therefore, to be a legitimate request that the approval of the admission of the Antoine boys to our Onion Lake School be granted, and I beg to request that this action be taken without further delay.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Residential.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that when the child was born the mother was living with, (keeping house) for her brother Alex James Sanderson a member of the band who is separate from his wife.\n\nSince her marriage to Descharmes, who has no home of his own, the mother has spent most of her time at her brothers home. In summer months Descharmes works for outsiders, when they live in a tent. When out of work and during the winter months they come back to her brother's home on the reserve.\n\nI believe it can be said that the boy lived all his life on the reserve, and that he considers the reserve and his uncles home, his also. The uncle Alex James Sanderson has provided more for the boy than the foster-father has.\n\nIn my #4926-104-D.L. of the 16th instant I referred to Alex Descharmes as an outsider of Fort-a-la-Corne, P.O. This address may be misleading. Descharmes or Ducharme came from the Battleford district as a labourer looking for work. On July 9th 1924 shortly (some months) after his arrival, he was married to Isabella Sanderson by the Rev. R. McNamara, missionary in charge of the reserve.

Henry Ellis, Principal of our Society's Indian Residential School, Onion Lake, Sask., he states that he had been informed by Mr. Indian Agent Weir of Leask, Sask., that your Department had authorized the transfer of the girl pupil Lydia Dreaver from our Onion Lake School to the Birtle Indian Residential School (see your letter to Mr. Indian Agent Weir, July 13th, #116-1-10). The Rev. Principal Ellis in his letter to me expresses very keen surprise at the authorization given by your Department, and states that this girl pupil has been in residence in his school for nearly eight years. He also reminds me that some three years ago you allowed other children of the Dreaver family to be transferred to the File Hills School, but subsequently returned them to our Onion Lake School at his earnest request.\n\nAs Lydia Dreaver has been in our school for nearly eight years, and will be sixteen years of age next year, it seems to me that the transfer you have authorized should be immediately cancelled, unless there is some very urgent and imperative reason for the same which has not been communicated to either Mr. Ellis or the Indian Agent. I shall be obliged if you will kindly look into the matter again and if at all possible, take action along the line I have indicated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Residential School.\n\nIn applying for the transfer of the above mentioned girl to the Birtle Residential School, Mr. Agent Weir pointed out that her father is a Presbyterian and that it is his intention to send two of his younger children, together with a granddaughter, to the Birtle School after the summer holidays, and that his reason for wishing the transfer of Lydia was in order to have all the children attend the same school.\n\nIn view of the Agent's recommendation, the Department felt that the father's request was a reasonable one, and the transfer was approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Mrs Maud Bear the mother was formerly Widow Simeon Red-Nose pay ticket #III James Smith's Band.\n\nSimeon Red-Nose died in May 1921 leaving a widow but no children.

On December 3rd 1926 the widow married Gilbert James Bear #122 John Smith's Band and the young child was taken on his ticket with her mother. Two children were born to Bear and his wife since. Bear has his house on the East side of John Smith's reserve, across the South Saskatchewan river from the day School on the reserve. The child cannot attend the school in summer because of having to cross the river and in winter it is too far for her to walk.

Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nMr. Lang Turner  \nIndian Agent  \nOnion Lake.\n\nDear Mr. Turner,\n\nIn reply to your letter of Aug. 26, will you allow me to say that the expla-\nnation you are giving me about Joe Littlewolf's ward does not alter my views in the matter.\n\nI know that boy Philip Moona is not the son of Joe but his brother-in-law; that he is a catholic, that his sister Maria is a catholic, that two other sisters, Edna & Ida, as well as another brother are all catholic and brought up in our school at Delmas.\n\nI have been told that the same Phillip was baptised a protestant on the day after his reception in the Anglican School, and so on the application for his admission there he could be labelled as a protestant.\n\nShortly after my arrival here in 1930, I had the visit of Littlewolf's wife, and she told me what I did not know at the time, that a brother of hers was at the neighbouring school, that she wanted to take him out and to have him admitted in my school. Then I refused to take any action and did not want any trouble with anybody, but this woman has come to me again and again, and with her husband. On July 15th last, they were again in my office, and besides the story I have related to you in my last letter of July 15th, they told me also that you have referred them to me to obtain the admission of the boy in the R.C. School, and that they do not want the boy to be brought up as a protestant.\n\nNow in your letter of the 28th ultimo, you say that you are referring the matter to Ottawa, without any recommendation, but only stating the facts.\n\nIf you had all the particulars that I am giving you today, I would feel confident that it would be you that would alter views in the matter, and that the facts would have been presented by you to Ottawa in a different light.\n\nAll this is the result of a mistake made by the sister of Phillip Moona, mistake that has given you a wrong impression, kind of which you and I are not responsible. But these people want to amend their mistake; it remains that they are R.C., and they are anxious to have their ward educated as a R.C.\n\nNow please take note that I did not go after these Littlewolfs, that they had come to me from their own volition, and even then I did not say anything against anybody, that I did not take the one way or other, although I think that in spite of their mistake they should get the satisfaction they are begging for. All I have said is that the solution of the difficulty is in the hands of Mr. Turner, Indian Agent, and I referred them to you, and I told them I would make application to you the way they wanted me.\n\nYours sincerely,\nPortier Jos., Principal.\nAug. 28 1931\n\nR. T. Ferrier Esq.\nSupt. of Indian Education\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn July 16th last, I have sent to Mr. Turner, our Indian Agent, an application for the transfer of a boy from the Anglican School to our R.C. School, and I did that on the repeated & pressing demand of the boy's guardians. Mr. Turner for various reasons did not at once forward my application; he is telling me now that he is sending it but with a statement of the facts. As I am under the impression that Mr. Turner does not know all the true facts, I have made a statement that I am addressing him this day, and I beg leave to present you with a copy of that statement.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal,\nR.C. Indian Res. School\nvia Lloydminster, Sask.\nOttawa, September 2nd, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter protesting against the admission of Philip Mooswa to the Onion Lake C.E. Indian Residential School. It is presumed that this protest refers to pupil No. 146, whose application was forwarded to the Department under cover of your letter of November 14th, 1929.\n\nOn reviewing that application, it is found that the boy's religion is stated to be Anglican but, although the mother was stated to be living, the application was signed by Maria Wolf. No inquiry was made by the Department at that time why Maria Wolf signed the form.\n\nThe letter that has been received by the Department states that this boy has always been recognized as a Roman Catholic and that a mistake was made by his sister in requesting his admission to the Onion Lake C. E. School. The Department would appreciate your reporting fully in regard to this matter, stating who Maria Wolf is and what authority she had for signing the application. You should, also, make careful inquiries with a view to ascertaining what religion this boy and his parents were recognized as professing. Please state the approximate length of time since his father died and, also, if his mother is living at the present time. The Department would also appreciate your supplying any other information that you may have available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, September 2nd, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, protesting against the admission of Phillip Mooswa to the Onion Lake C.E. Residential School.\n\nWhen the application for this boy was first submitted to the Department in November, 1929, it stated that he was an Anglican but, in view of your letter, Mr. Agent Turner is being requested for a report and, on receipt of his reply, you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nRussell F. Ferrer,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Jos. Portier, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nOnion Lake C.E. Res. School,\nLloydminster, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mission,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Father Portier,\n\nI have your letter of yesterday's date. Am sorry that I have not yet taken any action with respect to Philip Mooswa, other than to tell Joe Littlewolf to take the boy back to the Anglican school where he belongs. This boy, Philip, was placed in the Anglican school on November 5th, 1929, by Joe Littlewolf's wife, Maria, who signed the application for his admission, and the application was witnessed by her sister Ida Mooswa; the Mooswa family being described by them at that time, as Anglicans.\n\nYour letter to me on this subject is dated July 16th, which happens to be the same date that I was forced to make my best look; which is one reason why action was taken at the time. Another reason is that as soon as I read the letter I noticed in it an incorrect and misleading statement, which was that \"the boy being a Catholic and the charge of a Catholic family, should be at the R.C. School.\" This goes to show how a simple remark can be misconstrued.\n\nThe fact is this - last June when I was obtaining information from Joe for the Census, he mentioned to me that Philip was at the Anglican School, and remarked that it was queer that one boy should be there when all the rest of the family were R.C.; but at that time I was forgetting that Philip was not Joe's own boy, and thought that as soon as this was explained to you, you would alter your views in the matter.\n\nI am today sending your letter of July 16th to the Department, with an explanation for the delay in forwarding it. I am making no recommendations in the matter, but am just stating the facts. In the meantime I would ask you to kindly use your influence to have Joe return Philip to the Anglican School. It was only the day before yesterday that I told Joe to take the boy back there, instead of doing so he went yesterday to see you in the matter.\n\nThank you very much for your good wishes respecting my health. It is much improved and I hope to be able to get to see you in the course of the next few days.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir,\n\nThe wife of Joe Wolf has come to see me several times about her little brother, and she begged me instantly to write you and the Department in order to get the transfer of that boy from the Anglican School to our school. She told me that you have encouraged her in her purpose and that you have said: \"The boy being a catholic and the charge of a catholic family should be at the R.C. School.\" I do completely agree with you, since in that case it is according to the will and the express demand of the guardians of the child.\n\nLet me tell you that, according to my rule, I did not use any influence to bear on the minds of the interested parties, and consequently I feel at ease in applying for the transfer of Philipp George Moswa, & I beg you to forward my letter to the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a letter received from the Rev. Jno. Portier, principal at the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School, in which he makes application for the transfer of Philip Mooswa, No.16 at the Onion Lake Anglican Indian Residential School, to the Roman Catholic School; and also a copy of my reply to his letter.\n\nPhilip Mooswa was admitted to the Anglican School on November 5th, 1929, and is paid on ticket No. 44, Onion Lake Band. The boy was transferred to Union Lake Band, from No. 44, Government House Settlement Agency, in 1926, vide Department Letter No. 62-115, dated April 23, 1926. When the boy was placed in the Anglican School he was described as an Anglican, and the application for his admission was signed by his sister, Maria Littlewolf, as guardian; her signature being witnessed by her sister, Ida Mooswa.\n\nThe reason for the delay in forwarding Father Portier's letter to the Department is that I have been very unwell and was confined to my bed for several days, afterwards having to into hospital for a short while.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nRef.

This pupil has been in residence for two years. His parents were devout Anglicans and though their eldest daughter became a Roman Catholic through her marriage, I have been informed that the principal of the Roman Catholic School at Onion Lake has succeeded in persuading the sister not to have the boy returned. This child was brought back by her last year without any difficulty. We did not anticipate any trouble this year but feel confident that if it had not been through the interference of Father Portier, the child would be here now. I would ask, therefore, that specific instructions be given to Indian Agent Turner to have the boy sent back.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6323, file 658-10, part 4)\nMr. L. Turner,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to our recent conversation with reference to Phillip Mooswa, I beg to state that due to the unwarranted interference of the Rev. Jos. Portier, the principal of the R.C. Indian Residential School at Onion Lake, Sask., I have requested the Rev. Edward Ahenakew who will be visiting the Moosomin's Reserve to-morrow to obtain from Phillip's mother a statement that it is her wish that the boy is to remain an Anglican and that the Son-in-law has not been given any legal authority over the child. As the boy is absent without leave from school since the mid-summer vacation, I would ask that the Department issue specific instructions to have the boy returned at once.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, No. 115 L.16, with respect to Philip Mooswa, pupil No. 146, at the Onion Lake C. of W. Indian Residential School.\n\nAs stated in the Department in my letter of the 26th ultimo, even number, Philip Mooswa was transferred here in 1926, from Wosomin's band, Battleford Agency, to which band his father and mother both belong, Joseph Littlewolf No. 44, of the Onion Lake band, and Maria Mooswa, Philip's sister, in 1926, and after the death of Mooswa, the father of Philip and Maria, in 1926, arrangements were made for the transfer of Willis from Battleford Agency to this Agency, to Joseph Littlewolf's ticket, so that he could live with his sister, Maria. Then, in November 1929, Maria, accompanied by her sister Ida, took Philip to the Ontario School here, and, describing him as an Anglican, had him admitted to that institution; Maria signing the application form.\n\nI have made inquiries respecting the religion of Philip's father and mother from several Onion Lake Indians, but the only one who appears to know much about the family is John Wiskaco, and he told me that Mooswa and his wife were always recognized by him as Anglicans; and this information is borne out, in a measure, by a letter from the Rev. H. Hillis enclosed.\n\nWhen the statement from Philip's mother, mentioned in Mr. Hillis, is received, I will at once forward it to the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Doctor Duncan examined the boy and he said the boy was in good health. My boy took sick soon after he got to the school and was in bed. We did not know anything about it till in December. We wrote to find out what was wrong with the boy. Mr. Ellis answered and said the boy was getting better and would be out of bed in a day or so. This is the answer he would give us, whenever we wrote or wired to him about the boy. Then when I got anxious I told my husband to go to the school and see what was wrong with the boy. I went to see Mr. Weir and asked him if he would let my husband go, as I was not able to go myself. Mr. Weir said he could go as long as there was someone to do the work. So my husband went to see about the boy. When he got to the school he was surprised to find my boy in very poor health. My boy was not able to get out of bed. He was so weak. Then I worked hard to get my boy home for he was sick. He could not go to school, so I thought I could look after him better if he was at home. Then when he was coming home he had no coat. He had to buy a coat from the boy's matron to wear home. He had to pay his fare to come home, with his own money that he had. When he arrived home Doctor Duncan again examined the boy. The Doctor said \"the boy was far gone with T.B.\" A few months after my boy died. This is the complaint I have, that the children are neglected. This is the report I gave to Mr. Weir. That is why I decline to send my daughter Mary Dreaver back to school, until I get justice. She is going to school everyday. She goes to the Mistawasis Reserve Day School.\n\nFrom\n\nMrs. W. F. Dreaver\nSir:-\n\nI beg to forward copy of a letter which I have received from Mrs. W. F. Dreaver of the Miptawasis Reserve. I received from the Principal of the Onion Lake C. of E. Residential School a list of pupils from the Carlton Agency who had not returned after the summer holidays, one of them being Mary Dreaver. I took this matter up with the Indian Agent and presume that he has now secured the return to school of the other five pupils.\n\nWith regard to the case of Mary Dreaver, you will note the statement that the girl is attending school every day on the Mistawasis reserve. Under all the circumstances, I would believe it would be better to allow the situation to stand as it is.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 3rd, 1931.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your 309-11B of the 28th ultimo, enclosing copy of a letter received from Mrs. W.

Please forward copies of Mrs. Dreaver's letter to the Principal, Rev. Mr. Ellis, also to Mr. Agent Weir, and request them to furnish full reports in connection with the points raised in this woman's letter. When replies are received, you will be able to decide what should be done.\n\nThe last return received from this school shows that this girl is fourteen and a half years old.

Indian Residential School; and to enclose herewith a letter received from Mr. Agent Macdonald at the Battleford Agency, with respect to the religion of the parents of this boy. From this letter it will be seen that Mr. Macdonald looks upon the boy as a Roman Catholic charge, and states that Moswa, the father, and all the children were all of that faith.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSept. 25 1931\n\nRev. Dr. Ellis  \nPrincipal  \nC.A. Res. School  \nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI would like to explain to you the position I have been obliged to take with respect to Philip Mooswa, as I do not want you to think I am prejudiced and looking for any unchristian & petty fight.\n\nShortly after I took charge of the R.C. Res. School here, I had the visit of Joe Littlewolf and wife; they told me that the boy Philip was in your school, but as they are all R. Cath., they wanted to have their ward in the R.C. School. I refused then to take any action since the boy has been admitted to your School on their own application. I told them that, if they had made any mistake, it was up to them to fix it and to see Mr. Turner about it.\n\nAgain and again they came to me, and during vacation timethey have been more insisting, and they went so far as quoting Mr. Turner as saying: \"Since you are catholic, the boy should be at the R.C. School. So go and see Father Fortier who might be able to do something for you.\" On the strength of these words, and acting only as interpreter of Littlewolf and wife, I wrote to Mr. Turner, asking according to their wishes the transfer of the boy. Later on, I had to answer a communication of Mr. Turner, and to give what appear to be the reasons of the transfer, specially that the boy is a catholic, the ward of a catholic family, the brother of two girls and a boy all brought up in our R.C. School at Delmas.\n\nSo, you see, all I have done is to interpret & to act according to the wishes of the boy's real guardians, since the mother practically does not belong to any church as she is living irregularly with a married halfbreed, and practically also does not give any care and attention to her children.\n\nI trust you will judge I have been fair in the part I have taken in that case.\n\nWe are neighbour and both working for what we believe is a good cause, and I do not wish anything better than a friendly feeling between us, and a good & helpful understanding.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal  \nR.C.

Henry Ellis, Principal of our Society's School at Onion Lake, informs me in a letter dated Sept. 4th, that pupil No. 146, Philip Mooswa, aged 12\u00bd years, and who was admitted to our Society's School two years ago, had not returned to the school after the mid-summer vacation. He states that this boy is now living with his sister who married a man named Joe Wolf who is a member of the R.C. Church. He further states that the boy was persuaded not to return to our school by the Rev. Father Portier, Principal of the R.C. School. He also states that all the Mooswa family are Anglicans and requests that an order be given by your Department to your representative to have Philip Mooswa returned to our Society's school until the age limit for Indian school instruction has been reached. It is my understanding that it is the ruling of your Department for children of Protestant parentage to be educated in Protestant schools. This boy in addition to being a child of Protestant parents, has already been in residence in our Society's school for two years, and I trust that you may see the reasonableness and justice of Mr. Principal Ellis' request to have him returned at once to our Society's school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Portier, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Anthony's Indian School,\nLloydminster, Sask.\n\nDear Father Portier:\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 25th instant with reference to Phillip Mooswa, a pupil of the Anglican Indian Residential School. In reply, I beg to state that I appreciate your very friendly and frank explanation. I regret, however, that what I know of the Mooswa family, it does not agree entirely with what you have stated. Mrs. Joe Littlewolf was an Anglican before her marriage with Joe. Mrs. Littlewolf's father was also an Anglican, though I believe he agreed to Ida and boy attending the Delmas School. The mother is still an Anglican; therefore, the child in question is also a member of the same church. I think you will agree that I am within my rights when I protest against what has happened since the mid-summer vacation. Knowing that the boy was absent from school without leave, I think, the Christian attitude to have adopted would have been to advise Mrs. Littlewolf to have sent the boy back to the school which he was attending. I wish here, however, to assure you that it is far from me to do anything unchristian and have no intention of interfering with your work. We are neighbours, (using your own words) doing what each believe to be a good cause, i.e., bringing our Indian brethren from a state of darkness to the Light and to acknowledge the glory of the Eternal Trinity. I trust, therefore, that our relationship with each other will be such that we do not hinder that work by anything that would appear to be unseemly or unchristian. In conclusion, let me state that I hold the best of good-will towards you and I trust it will always be the same.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, No. 115-1-10, and, in reply, to inform you that I read the same to the Rev. H. Ellis, principal at the Onion Lake C. of E. Indian Residential School, and requested him to concur in the transfer of Philip Mooswa, pupil No. 146 at his school, to the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School. This Mr. Ellis refused to do, and told me that he would write direct to the Department stating his position in the matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 13th, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to Phillip Mooswa. The information received by the Department indicates that, after living sixteen years with Mooswa, the mother deserted the father and children - one a baby in arms - and married Cardinal. Under these circumstances, it is felt that her wishes regarding Phillip's education should not receive any consideration. More prominence should be given to the wishes of the deceased father and those of the foster father, who has looked after Phillip for some years. I believe that the civil courts of the province would regard his wishes. He requests an education under Roman Catholic auspices and, as this is the religion of the home to which Phillip will return, the Department believes that it is in his best interests to be placed in the Onion Lake R. C. Residential School.\n\nI know that you are interested in the future welfare of this boy and it is felt that a careful review of the different angles of this case (as outlined in both this and my former letter), will lead you to reconsider the decision conveyed in your recent letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSir\n\nreferring again to Department letter 115-1-10 of 3rd October last I beg to say three pupils of Onion Lake School are still absent without leave. Of these, the Indian Agent reports that Norbert Head is over sixteen years of age and unless there is some circumstance that would bring his case within the provisions of section 3 of chap. 25 of 1930 I am of the opinion that his discharge should be arranged for.\n\nMary Dreaver is still in attendance at the Mistawasis Day School and I would suggest, as in my former letter, that she remain there.\n\nWith regard to Gladys Wardman, the Indian Agent offers no reason for not returning her to the Onion Lake School nor does he state that she is attending any other. In my opinion in the absence of any reason to the contrary she should be sent back to the Anglican School at Onion Lake and I will so inform the Agent on hearing from the Department.\n\nWill the Department please advise me as to the action to be taken in these three cases.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs.

E. Indian Residential School. They should be considered discharged and the Principal so informed.\n\nUnless there are some special reasons to the contrary, it is considered that Gladys Wardman should be sent back to the school. The September quarter return states that this girl is only twelve years of age. Please give the necessary instructions to Mr. Agent Turner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of October 17th, and your reply to the same on October 29th, 115-1-10, re the above-mentioned pupil, I beg to state that after a very careful study of all the communications I have received in this connection, I am strongly of the opinion that he should be returned to our Society's School at Onion Lake. I have before me a copy of the Deputy Superintendent General's letter of June 5th, 1922, addressed to our General Secretary, and would direct your attention to the closing paragraphs of the same which read as follows:\n\n\"As intimated in my earlier communication in this connection, I do not wish this ruling to be the occasion of requests that children be transferred from one school to another on the grounds of the present decision. I believe that a child, that has been resident in a school and may have imbibed religious opinions, should remain in that school for the full tuition period.\n\nThe Department enlists your sympathetic cooperation in the event of difficult cases for decision in the future.\"\n\nThe ruling and wishes of your Department as set forth in that letter have received from our Society the most careful and sympathetic consideration ever since it came to hand, and will continue to do so until the specific rulings therein laid down have been finally altered. It seems to me, however, that your approval of the transfer of the pupil in question from our Onion Lake School to the R.C. School presided over by Father Fortier is a direct departure from the opinion expressed by the Deputy Superintendent.\nGeneral, namely \"that a child that has been resident in a school, and may have imbibed religious opinions, should remain in that school for the full tuition period.\" Philip Mooswa was in residence in our Onion Lake School for two years. I have before me an affidavit signed and witnessed, that the father and mother and family were Anglicans. I have before me also a letter from our Missionary, the Rev. Edward Ahenakew, who is himself a Cree Indian, in which he states that he and the Principal of our Onion Lake School drove 160 miles to interview Mrs. Mooswa who is now married to a half-breed named Cardinal, and in this letter he states that Mrs. Mooswa herself told him that she was glad the boy was placed in the Anglican School.\n\nFor these reasons, and others, which I do not consider it necessary now to mention, I am forced to the conclusion that the admission of this pupil to the R.C. School should never have been allowed, and I consider it only fair to our Society, and to the management of our Onion Lake School, that his transfer to our School be effected immediately, all expense in connection with the same being met by your Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRN/JF\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nAnglican Indian School\nLloydminster, Sask.\nNovember 26/31\n\nA.

A few days ago I spoke to her with reference to the proposed adoption of the Indian boy, and she told me that although she felt sure that she would not be in a position to bear the cost of his education, she had felt a desire to have such control over him as to ensure that he obtained one, if the Department would bear the cost. Her fear seemed to be that the lad's father would take him away from school in a few months time, and would then put him to work, and that the boy would then have no further chance of education.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 3rd, 1931.\n\nMadam,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo regarding the Indian boy in whom you are interested, I beg to say that the Department considers that he should remain at the Onion Lake C.E.

Coombes G.A., 1/2 Shellbrook Detachment dated the 1st inst., local enquiries were made regarding the whereabouts of Angus WAIRABOOSK in the locality, but without result. It was thought that he might be found with a band of Indians who reside about 12 miles north of Big River in the Stoney Lake Dist. (Delaronde Lake).\n\nAs it was necessary for me to patrol to the Stoney Lake Dist., this A.M. on other matters, I hired a \"atron to accompany me, in the event that Gladys WARDMAN be found living with the above mentioned band of Indians. Inquiries were made throughout the Indian's residing in the \"tron Lake Dist., but no information I could obtain was that Angus WAIRABOOSK was trapping in the Taggard Lake Dist., but was unable to obtain his correct location. Owing to the fact that Taggard Lake was about 25 miles away, I was impossible for me to proceed there this date. I returned to Big River in the P.M. of the above date.\n\nIn the early A.M. of this date, I left on patrol per Livery Team, accompanied by Matron, via Delaronde Lake, to the Taggard Lake Dist., arriving there in the P.M. of the above date. After making considerable inquiries, I located Angus WAIRABOOSK, two miles east of Taggard Lake. I took the above named into custody, and accompanied him back, proceeded to a point known as the \"Pampero\" where I remained at the home of Mr. J. Olson overnight. I might state that Angus WAIRABOOSK objected strongly in regards to taking Gladys WARDMAN away, making all kinds of excuses, in order to prevent me from doing so.\n\nAt 6:00 A.M. of this date I left on patrol on return to Big River, arriving at this detachment at 2:00 P.M.\n\nIn compliance with instructions contained in C.O. of Sergt. Coombes G.A., I endeavoured to get in touch with but was advised that he was away, and would not return to Shellbrook until the following A.M. I therefore telephoned the Indians Agents Office at Leask, and was instructed to make arrangements to have a Matron escort the above named to Lloydminster. Also that arrangements would be made with Mr. Ellis, Indian School Principal, Union Lake, to meet the Matron at that point, and take the above named over.\n\nContinued\n\nFyle numbers must be quoted.\n\nIndian Affairs.

School to the Anglican Indian School, Onion Lake, for the following reasons, viz:\n\n(1) The father, John Muskage did not agree to have his children placed in the Roman Catholic school. They were placed there while living with the grandfather after the death of the mother.\n\n(2) That the father and mother were members of the Anglican Church.\n\n(3) That the said children were baptised by the Rev. E. Ahenakew as follows:\n   No. 395 - Maria Muskago, born Nov. 11th 1914 baptised Dec. 1st 1914 Sponsors Staff at the Mission and Mrs. Antoine Muskago, mother of the father.\n   No. 436 - Eliza Muskago, born Dec. 28th 1916 baptised Feb. 4th 1917, Sponsors, the father and Miss Reina Matheson.\n\nThe mother of these children you will perhaps remember was a sister of Johnny Heathen and also a sister of Mrs. Antoine Chief. All these are known to you to be out and out Anglicans.\nAs the father has written to me and has repeated his request to have these girls transferred, from time to time, I feel that it is my duty to support him and make this formal application for their transfer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nAnglican Indian Res.

Hill, M.D., C.M.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Dr. Hill:\n\nThis letter was sent to Mr. Turner as dated by an Indian - it however did not reach the office, so I am forwarding the same by mail. Trusting you will forward the same with the least possible delay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, No. 115-1-10, regarding Maria and Eliza Muskego, and to enclose herewith a letter addressed to Mr. Lang Turner, just received from the Reverend H. Ellis, Principal of the Onion Lake C. of E., Indian Residential School, with his explanation why this letter did not reach the office sooner.\n\nOn looking up our records I find that the admission of Maria Muskego (pupil No. 0148) at the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School to that institution, was approved by Departmental Letter No. 115-6-10, dated February 24, 1921. The application was signed by John Muskego, the father, and witnessed by Archie Masson. The admission of Eliza Muskego (pupil No. 064) to the Onion Lake R. C. School was approved by Departmental Letter No. 115-8-10, dated October 7th, 1924. This application was signed by John Muskego and witnessed by Christine Carson.\n\nI spoke to John Muskego, the father of these girls, and he informed me that Mr. Ellis had spoken to him three times in the last 7 years about having the girls transferred to the Anglican School. The second time Mr. Ellis spoke to him, which was about three years ago, he agreed with him, as he also did the last time Mr. Ellis spoke about it, which was during the first week of November last.\n\nJohn Muskego is himself an Anglican, although his father and mother, with whom the girls were living at the time of their admission, are Roman Catholic.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 1st, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your 99-18 of the 23rd ultimo, with reference to the request of Reverend Mr. Ellis for the transfer of Maria and Eliza Muskego from the Onion Lake R. C. Residential School to the Onion Lake C. E. Residential School.\n\nAs you point out, the former girl was admitted to the Onion Lake R. C. School in 1921 and the latter in 1924. The application forms on file in the Department were, presumably, signed by the father, approved by the Indian Agent at that time, and state that their religion is Roman Catholic.\n\nThese children have been in the Onion Lake R. C. School for eleven and seven years, respectively, and, during that period of time, the Department has no record of any official protest having been made against their being educated in that school. It is not the practice of the Department to transfer children from one residential school to another after such a considerable lapse of time, during which they may have imbibed religious opinions, or even convictions.\n\nUnder these circumstances, you should inform Reverend Mr. Ellis that the Department considers that these children should remain in the Onion Lake R. C. Residential School until their education is completed.\n\nAn extra copy of this letter is enclosed, which you may hand to Rev. Mr. Ellis.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

After a very careful review of all the correspondence and documents which have reached me in connection with this matter, I find it very difficult to alter the request set forth in my letter to you on Nov. 23rd, 1931, as I am still convinced that Father Fortier, the Principal of the Roman Catholic Onion Lake School, should not have allowed this pupil to enter his School, when he knew that he was born of Anglican parents and had actually been in residence for two years at our Society's School. The Indian Agent's statement that \"the Mooswe family have all been recognized as Roman Catholic\" does not harmonize with a certified statement, duly witnessed, which I have received from one, John Muskego, who writes as follows:\n\n\"I, Johnny Muskego, Treaty Indian, living on the Onion Lake Reserve, do certify that I knew Mooswe who lived near my house, and that I knew him to be an Anglican with his wife and family\".\n\nThis certified statement is dated Onion Lake, 7th November, 1931.\n\nWhen the father died, and the mother left the Reserve because of Mr. Indian agent Macdonald's attitude towards her, (see letter of Rev. Principal Ellis to you, Nov. 5th, 1931) this boy was taken care of by her sister, who also was an Anglican, and remained an Anglican until she married a Roman\nCatholic named Littlewolf. It was she who placed the boy Philip in our Society's School, and no question was ever raised about his transfer to the Roman Catholic School for two years, or until after she herself had been received into the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nAs I understand that you have received a copy of the letter of the Rev. Father Fortier, Principal of the Roman Catholic School at Union Lake, and addressed to Mr. Principal Ellis of our Society's School, I need not repeat the information therein set forth with regard to the part he took in the matter, except to point out that in answering the communication he had received from Mr. Indian Agent Turner, he gave the following information, which, so far as I can make out, is not true to fact:\n\n(1) that the boy is Catholic, (I presume he means Roman Catholic). My understanding is that the father and mother of this boy, and the boy himself, were all baptized members of the Church of England.\n\n(2) that the boy was the ward of a Catholic family. My understanding is that when this boy was placed in our Society's School, and was registered under the number 146, he came under the official guardianship of the Principal of that School, a guardianship which cannot be cancelled without the united consent of your Department and the Principal himself.\n\n(3) that he was the brother of two girls and a boy, all brought up in the Roman Catholic School at Delmas. My understanding is that the two girls referred to are Maria and Eliza Muskego, (I have no information about the boy mentioned) who have been in residence for some time at the Roman Catholic School at Delmas, and should never have been admitted to that institution, as your Department was furnished with the dates when these children were baptized in the Anglican Church, the father himself being present at the service (see letter of the Rev. Principal Ellis to your Department, March 15th, 1932). Official protests were made against the admission of these Anglican children to a school under Roman Catholic administration, but the protests were non-effective. I have before me a statement from the father in which he declares that these children were taken into the Roman Catholic School without his consent, and while they were living with his father during his absence. As the boy Philip Mooswa was placed in our Society's School by his aunt, and with the full consent of his mother (see my letter of Nov. 23rd, 1931), and remained there until the aunt was received into the Roman Church when she married the Roman Catholic Littlewolf, it seems to me that he should have been allowed to remain there, and that he would have remained there had it not been for the united efforts of Father Fortier and Littlewolf and his wife, to take him away.\nAs you ask for my sympathetic cooperation in the settlement of this difficult case, I can only say that although I can see no valid reason whatever why this pupil should be transferred, after two years of residence, from our School to a Roman Catholic School, I am content to leave the matter in your Department's hands and to abide by the ruling laid down in the Deputy Superintendent General's letter of June 5th, 1922, addressed to our General Secretary, and which reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"The Department reserves the right to make decisions in special cases that are brought to our attention\".\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hill, M.D., C.M.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nUnion Lake Agency,\nUnion Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Dr. Hill:\n\nI herewith ask the Department to admit and allow Bella Patemude, age 7 years to become a grant earning pupil in the C. E. Indian Residential School on the grounds of her being desitute and has no responsible person to take care of her.\n\nIt appears when the father died, the child was adopted by the grandmother (a treaty Indian) as the mother married again and did not want the child. When the grandmother died, the child was given to Josephine, an aunt, on the understanding that when the child reached the age of 7 years, she would place the child in school. This promise has now been carried out. The aunt states that she cannot look after this child herself as she has a family of her own and is in very poor circumstances herself.\n\nAs the mother of this child is in treaty, I would suggest that the Department admit this child also and approve of the said child taking up her residence here in our school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit the following regarding Bella Patnaude (breed) age 7 or 8 years, whose guardian, Mrs. Josephine Patnaude, and mother, Margaret Patnaude, desire her to enter an Indian Residential School at Onion Lake. The former signed an admission form for her to enter the C. of E. Indian Residential School, while the latter signed a similar one for admission to the Roman Catholic Indian Residential School.\n\nBella Patnaude is the daughter of Margaret Patnaude (treaty Indian) and \u201cJim\u201d Patnaude (deceased breed). The Principal of each school have applied for her admission to their church claiming that she was baptized into his church. The information I have in this connection is that she was baptized by the late Father Dupre in infancy, and by the Reverend H. Ellis, Principal of the Anglican School, about two years ago. It is quite apparent that this girl was adopted by her grandmother when her father died, and later when the grandmother died, she was placed with an aunt with instructions that she was to be placed in school when she reached the age of seven. The parents in this case were both Roman Catholics and the grandmother was buried by a priest. Mr. Ellis stated that the grandmother was received into his church.\n\nAt present both schools are over strength as the returns will show, and have been for some time. I am enclosing the two admission forms uncompleted and unsigned for the Department\u2019s information.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 12, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your 99-18 of the 5th instant, with reference to a request received for the admission of Bella Patnaude to an Indian residential school. The information contained in your letter has been carefully noted. The Department is inclined to feel that, if this girl is admitted to any school, she should be placed in one conducted under Roman Catholic auspices.\n\nHowever, it is noted, from the last paragraph of your letter, that both the Onion Lake C.E. and the Onion Lake R.C. Residential Schools have their full quota of pupils, and the Department is not prepared to consider admitting this girl to either school at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nfor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. T.

Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Dr. Hill:\n\nI herewith ask for permission for the following children to be allowed home for their annual vacation, the Department assuming the costs of their transportation in the event of the children's parents not being in the position to meet the same.\n\nIt is believed that it will be possible to keep the costs within the sum of $150.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a requisition from the Rev. Principal of the C. of E. Indian Residential School for transportation of children returning to their homes for the summer vacation. There are eighty-four children in residence in this school from outside Agencies, and in many cases it would be difficult or impossible for their parents to come for them. The amount asked for would in my opinion be the absolute minimum for this work.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 15th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your 99-18 of the first instant, enclosing a letter from the Principal of the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School requesting a grant towards the cost of the transportation of the pupils going home on holidays.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that our appropriation has been considerably reduced and the Department can only allow, this year, the sum of $75.00 - this amount to include the transportation of children going home on holidays, also the transportation of children being discharged and the transportation of new pupils coming to the school after vacation.\n\nYou should assist the Principal, as far as possible, by urging the Indians to come to the school and take their children home and, also, return them after the holidays without cost to either the school management or the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Indian Residential Schools:\n\nAs a result of an X-Ray Examination of the children in residence at the Indian Residential Schools, by Dr. H. C. Boughton, of the Saskatoon Sanitarium, three children at the R. C. School and four at the C. of E. School, have been found to have such definite tuberculosis of the lungs that they must be considered \"spreaders\". There is little or no clinical evidence in these cases, but they are being discharged. Upon my inspection of the R. C. School on the 27th and the C. of E. School on the 15th, the remaining children were physically fit.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nSaddle Lake, Alta.

Hill, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have just heard that the admission of Maria Anne Fox, daughter of Edouard Fox has been approved by the Department for the C.E. Res. School, and it is quite a surprise.\n\nEdouard Fox, who has always been a Rom. Cath., and his daughter was baptised in the same church on the 6th of May 1925, so far as I know, has never been baptised in any other church. That same Edouard Fox came to my office, and applied for the admission of his daughter in the R.C. Res. School; the form was filled up before witness and properly signed. Moreover he told me that he never signed any other application and never gave his consent for the admission of his daughter in any other school.\n\nFor your edification, I would like to give you the history of his marriage, history which he told me himself. It was in the year 1925, Edouard Fox was visiting at the protestant School with five or six of his friends. It was known that he was anxious to marry a girl, ex-pupil of that School. He was invited to come in and visit the chapel; he went in and was surprised to find there his girl and also the minister. This gentleman asked him if he thought he wanted to marry \"this girl\", and he answered affirmatively; the reciprocal question being made to the girl, they were told to be married. \"Of course,\" he said to me, \"I did not believe in that marriage, and I did not consider myself tied up by such, so much so that I did not take the girl with me until three months after the girl turned to be a Rom. Cath. like myself, was baptised by Father Therien and were really married by the same priest.\"\n\nFrom that marriage are two children: the girl mentioned above, and a boy; both have been baptised in the R.C. Church.\n\nNow here is what happened just last week: The wife of Edouard Fox, dangerously sick, asked and begged twice, of her volition, for the Cath. priest; they sent for the priest. The last time was saturday at 5 a.m., the sick woman saying that she wanted to see the priest once more before her death.\n\nBut I trust that is plenty enough to convince you there is something wrong somewhere, and I beg you to reconsider the approbation you have given. I may tell you that with you I dislike such controversy, and many times I have refrained to make complaint and to bother you, even when I thought I had good reasons for it. In the mean time I take pleasure to say that in dealing with the Department I have generally received fair treatment, and I am sincerely thankful for that.\n\nYours truly\n\nRev. Joe. Portier, Principal\nThe Union Lake R.C. Res. School\nOttawa, January 26, 1934.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, protesting against the admission of Maria Anne Fox to the Onion Lake C.E. Residential School.\n\nThe application form for the admission of this girl, which was forwarded to the Department in October, last, stated that her religion was Anglican. In view of the information contained in your letter, Mr. Agent Hill is being written for a full report and, on receipt of his reply, you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Jos. Portier, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nOnion Lake R. C. Residential School,\nLloydminster, Sask.\nOttawa, January 26, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nUnder cover of your letter of October 15th, 1933, you forwarded an application and certificate of health for the admission of Maria Anne Fox to the Onion Lake C. E. Residential School. This application form stated that the child's religion was Anglican. The Department is now in receipt of a letter from the Reverend Principal of the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School which reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"Edouard Fox is and has always been a Roman Catholic, and his daughter was baptized in the same Church on the 6th of May, 1926, and as far as I know, has never been baptized in any other church. That same Edouard Fox came to my office and applied for the admission of his daughter in the R.C. Res. School; the form was filled up before witness and properly signed.

Cath. like myself, was baptized by Father Therien and we were really married by the same priest.\"\n\nFrom that marriage are two children; the girl mentioned above and a boy; both have been baptized in the R.C. Church.\n\nNow here is what happened just last week: The wife of Edouard Fox, dangerously sick, asked and begged twice, of her own volition, for the Cath. priest; they sent for the priest. The last time was Saturday at 5 A.M., the sick woman saying that she wanted to see the priest once more before her death.\"\n\nPlease advise on what grounds you signed the application form stating that this girl was a member of the Church of England. You should also comment on the statements quoted above. Please give this matter your immediate attention and let me have a full report.\n\nIt is presumed that E. Fox, No. 0163, for whom an application form has not yet been submitted, is a sister of Maria Anne Fox.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. T. Hill, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nMr. J.D. Sutherland  \nSupt. of Indian Education  \nOttawa.\n\nIn reply to your No. 115-1-10  \nRe-admission of Maria Anne Fox.\n\nDear Sir, I had today the visit of Edward Fox and his wife, and these are the declarations they made:\n\nBoth are R. Catholic; the man has always been so, the wife who once was anglican has joined the Cath. Church eight or nine years ago and was baptised in that Church. Their daughter has also been christened R. Catholic.\n\nEdward has not signed any application for the C.E. School, and if his name appeared in such application it has been given by his father-in-law. But he has given his name before witness for the R.C. School.\n\nLately the wife, dangerously sick and giving all hope of recovery has confided the care of her daughter to her parents who are protestants. They said that the C.E. minister came often to their place, several times accompanied by the Indian Agent and by a councillor of the Reserve.\n\nStill both are declaring they belong to the Cath. Church and will continue to stick to that Church.\n\nIt is clearly evident that they would like to bring up their children in their Church, that is in the Cath. Church, but they are afraid of the parents of the wife, of the Indian Agent and of the C.E. minister: That is my impression and what they have clearly expressed.\n\nI trust that you will judge that a cath. child born of cath. parents has to go to a cath. School, according to the rule of the Department.\n\nOnce more I want to say that I dislike such trouble and controversy, but certainly I did not start it, neither look for it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Jos. Portier, Principal  \nOnion Lake R.C. Ind. Res. School.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your 115-1-10, of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the admission of Maria Anne Fox to the Onion Lake C. of E. Indian residential School, and in reply.\n\nI based my recommendation on the information available at the time the application was forwarded to the Department. Briefly, it was as follows: Edward Fox, R. C., was married to Agnes Waskahat, an ex-pupil of the Anglican School, on June 17th, 1925. The ceremony took place in the Anglican church, Onion Lake, Rev. J. T. Ellis, at Fox's request, officiated. The bride's father and mother witnessed the marriage and signed the register. Fox accepted the Protestant faith on that occasion and has been a consistent Anglican ever since. The applicant, Maria Anne (their first child) was baptized in infancy by Rev. Canon Ahenekeew. Fox, whom I interviewed again today, stated most emphatically that he was a Protestant and had been since his marriage. He signed the application form for the admission of his daughter into the C. of E. School, but did not sign any other.\n\nRe Rev. Father Portier's statements. There is an entry of the baptism of Maria Anne, on May 6, 1926, in the R. C. records. It is quite correct that Mrs. Fox, who was sick, had asked for the priest, meaning the Anglican priest. The message went to the Catholic priest and he responded. The Rev. Ellis was sent for immediately after, and attended the sick woman. The remaining statements in Rev. Fox's letter are undoubtedly what Fox told him. Fox denies this, but he is not reliable. It is quite common for the Indian children of mixed marriages to be baptized into both churches, and this apparently happened in this case.\n\nE. Fox, No. 0163, is from Sweet Grass reserve, Battleford Agency, and is not related to Maria Anne.

E. Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of January 26th, the Department wrote Mr. Agent Hill giving him the information contained in your letter of January 12th. His reply, dated the 3rd instant, has just been received and reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"I based my recommendation on the information available at the time the application was forwarded to the Department. Briefly, it was as follows:- Edward Fox, R. C., was married to Agnes Waskahat, an ex-pupil of the Anglican School, on June 17th, 1925. The ceremony took place in the Anglican church, Onion Lake, and the Rev. H. Ellis, at Fox's request, officiated. The bride's father and mother witnessed the marriage and signed the register. Fox accepted the Protestant faith on that occasion and has been a consistent Anglican ever since. Their daughter Maria (their first child) was baptized in infancy by the Rev. Canon Aheneke. Fox, whom I interviewed again today, stated most emphatically that he was a Protestant and had been since his marriage. He signed the application form for the admission of his daughter into the C. of E. School, but did not sign any other.\n\nRe Rev. Father Portier's statements, there is an entry of the baptism of Maria Anne, on May 6, 1926, in the R. C. records. It is quite certain that Mr. Fox, who was sick, had asked for the priest, meaning the Anglican priest. The message went to the Catholic priest, who responded. The Rev. Ellis was sent for immediately after, and attended the sick woman. The remaining statements in the Rev. Father's letter are undoubtedly what Fox told him. Fox denies them but he is not reliable. It is quite common for the Indian children of mixed marriages to be baptized into both churches, and this apparently happened in this case.\"\n\n\"I am still of the opinion that the application I signed for the admission of Maria Anne Fox into the C. of E. School was correct and proper.\"\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Jos. Portier, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nOnion Lake R. C. Res.

Blackstar \" 15 \" 98 \"\nPeter Northwind \" 15 \" 146 \"\n\nWith regard to the first two, they are from Anglican parents and the only doubt is their age; they have never been at school and would have to enter the Baby class and it looks to me, more a condition of the times than an effort for education which induces the parents to apply for their admission. If the age does not disqualify I would recommend that they be accepted as they are both bright children.\n\nWith regard to Peter Northwind, this family has had their previous children entered at Delmas R.C. School and though the Man claimed to be a pagan, his wife was R.C. and he entered as R.C. when those children were admitted, but now claims to have joined the Anglican Church, on account of some grievance and as the boy is old to enter this also looks like a case of convience and personally I do not think he should be accepted as an Anglican pupil.\n\nAt the present time, the schools are not in want for young pupils and children entering at the age of 15 & 16, with no previous schooling can benefit very little, as if conditions improved, the parents would be wanting them out in a year to help at home.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept fo Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hill, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nMr. J.D. Sutherland  \nSupt. of Indian Education  \nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn answer to your letter of Feb. 13, (No. 115-1-10) referring to the admission of Maria Anne Fox to the C.E. High School, I am sorry to say that I can hardly digest the statements sent to you by Mr. Agent Hill, and even I will venture to say that I am rather surprised of the position he has taken in the whole matter. Very likely he has been fooled and deceived, and I may have been too. But how is it that one day last fall Mr. Hill came to me and said: \"Say, I have received from the C.E. School an application for the admission to that school of the daughter of E. Fox.\" \"What! replied, that is not right; the girl is catholic, and Fox has repeatedly here promised to give us his daughter.\" \"Well,\" he said, \"I am giving you a hint.\"\n\nMr. Hill said in his letter to you that Fox denies the statements I have sent to the Department, but the same Fox has also with me denied all the statements made by Mr. Hill or any other. Where is the truth?\n\nWill you kindly let me again expose briefly the particulars of the case? Here it is:\n\nEdward Fox has always been a Catholic, and still claims that he is so, and has never accepted the protestant faith. In 1925, he was visiting at the protestant school with five or six of his friends; it was known that he was anxious to marry a girl, ex-pupil of that school. He was invited to come in and see the chapel; he went in and was surprised to find inside there his girl and the minister. This minister asked him if it was true that he wanted to marry \"this girl\", and of course he answered affirmatively; the record-book question being inside of the girl, they were declared to be united. I cannot understand why, it was told me by Fox himself; so it does not look that it was at Fox' request that such marriage ceremony took place. Moreover, he told me that he did not believe in that kind of ceremony, and did not consider tied up by such, and he did not take the girl with him till after three or four months the girl joined the Oath Church, was baptized by Father Therien and both were properly married by the same priest.\n\nHere are the extracts of baptism and marriage:\n\n\"On the 4th day of Oct. 1925, we undersigned priest, after the publication of the banns of marriage made in the R.C. Church between Edward Fox, son of age of J.B. Fox on the one part, and Aldina Marie Waskahat, minor daughter of Joe Waskahat on the other part, we have received their mutual consent, and have solemnly united them in the sacred bonds of matrimony. Then, during the celebration of Holy Mass, we have given them the nuptial benediction in the presence of the witnesses: Jos Opesinaw and Isabelle Opesinaw.\n\n(sgn); J.A. Therien O.M.I.\"\n\n\"Indian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6323, file 658-10, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe daughter, Maria Anne, was born of this marriage on the 3rd May 1926, and here is the extract of her baptism:\n\n\"On the 6th of May 1926, we undersigned priest have solemnly baptized Maria Anne, born in legitimate wedlock from Edward Fox and Marie Aldina Waskahat. The godfather has been Antoine Wolf and the godmother Mary Wolf.\n\n(sgn): J.E. Teston O.M.I.\"\n\nNow in contradiction with what says Mr. Agent Hill that Fox is a protestant since his marriage by the Rev. Ellis, Fox states most emphatically that he is a catholic. When his wife was sick, the catholic priest was sent for, and there was no mistake, or the same mistake have been made twice on the same week. The wife told me that Mr. Ellis called at their place later on, but that she did not need him since she already had the administration of the catholic priest. Moreover, after her recovery, that woman came here with her husband; both received the sacraments in my church. I don't suppose that for such public and open demonstration of their faith they were taking my church by mistake for the C.E. church. And after that, the same day (last 3rd or 4th of febr.) they came in my office and told me again that their faith was the R.C. faith, the wife speaking that way even more lengthily than the man.\n\nFor the application form Fox denies that he has signed none for the admission of his daughter to the C.E. School, and he certainly gave his name for the admission to the R.C. School and did it in my presence and in the presence of another witness.\n\nMay I add some little details that have some importance? Edward Fox has never been to school, so speaks and understands very little English, and I do speak and understand cree, i.e. his language, and I have no clerk or secretary to write my letters, I do that myself and I do it without any prejudice, if not (I beg your pardon) very grammatically.\n\nThat is the last letter I am writing to you on the above occasion, and by the way on any other matter of Indian Affairs, since I am leaving this week the principalship of the Onion Lake R.C. School. I am indeed very sorry that such painful controversy had arisen just before my departure. I have always tried to be true, fair in all my dealings with the Department, to be polite and considerate with anyone connected with this Department. But I want earnestly to thank you personally for the very appreciated, gentle, kind manner you have always treated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. Joe Portier\nPrincipal (for two more days)\nOnion Lake R.C. Res. School\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6323, file 658-10, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your 115-1-10, of the 16th instant, respecting the admission of Mary Ann Fox into the C. of E. Indian Residential School, and in reply.\n\nI do not think I can add anything useful to what I already conveyed to the Department in my letter of February 3rd, excepting that I had Fox and his wife together in my office a few days ago, when I questioned them closely re their marriage. They told me that their marriage had been arranged in the usual way, and that the Reverend H. Ellis was requested by Fox to perform the ceremony at least one week before the event took place. They said they were not married in church but in Mr. Ellis' office in the presence of the bride's father and mother and some friends. They further said that they lived together immediately after the ceremony, and continued to do so. When confronted with Father Portier's letter Fox denied the statements attributed to him. Fox is a vacillating weakling with no character at all, and is absolutely unreliable. There is no doubt in my mind that he told Father Portier everything the Father claims. I have known Father Portier for many years and have always found him absolutely reliable. Fox and his wife were both insistent that Mary Ann should continue at the C. of E. School.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6323, file 658-10, part 5)\nRe te Mr. Edward Fox & Child.\n\nBoth Mr. and Mrs. Edward Fox are here again this evening, to say that they desire to have their girl admitted in the R.C. School, being Catholics they want their children to be of the same creed.\n\nMr. Edward Fox now admits that he did sign the admission of his girl for both schools, but he added, \"If I did sign for the C.E. School, it was through vexation, I was continually harassed by my father-in-law, Joe Waskahat to send my daughter to the C.E. School.\"\n\nBoth Mr. and Mrs. E. Fox state that on one occasion, at table a discussion on the child's schooling arose. Mr. J. Waskahat was most imperative in his wish to send the girl to the C.E. school but Mr. Fox refused to comply with his request, when the dispute was at its hottest, Edward left the room saying, \"Place the child wherever you wish,\" this he said, to get rid of the row and have peace. Mrs. Fox, for her part did not want to grieve her parents in going against their wishes so she suggested that the girl should be given to the grandparents. Later she sought the Agent's advice on the matter. Mr. Cameron who was present objected, saying that both father and mother being alive, it was impossible to do so.\n\nSome time after the fact mentioned, Mr. J. Waskahat drove up, he was accompanied by J. Heathen, accountant, both Waskahat and Heathen pressed on Mr. E. Fox to sign the admission of his daughter into the Anglican school, they drove him up to the school and there disregarding his determination not to send the girl to school, Edward signed the admission in order to free himself from his harassing relatives, for he was in no hurry to send his daughter, he declared.\n\nLater, said he, \"I met the Indian Agent who inquired where I intended to send my boy, I replied, I do not want to be bothered with the question, but if ever I decide to send him to school I'll send him wherever I please.\" My wife added, \"It is alright for him to be a Roman Catholic, is this the Indian Agent replied, \"See here, I do not favour one school more than the other, I simply want these children where they belong, any way, by the time you will be ready to send your boy to school, I'll perhaps not be an Indian Agent then.\"\n\nBoth the Indian Agent and Mr. Ellis are notified that the boy will be placed in the R.C. School.\nRe to the baptism of Marie Ann, my first born. It is a fact that the child was baptized in the R.C. Church two days after her birth, the mother herself took the baby to church, accompanied by the godmother, Mrs. Joe Little Wolf, who is here present. This took place the 16th of May 1936. Later when the child was over a year old, Rev. Aheneckew rebaptized her. It happened thus, Rev. Aheneckew was at Onion Lake, he was leaving for Lloyminster, with Mr. Joe Waskahat, the latter sent his daughter to see Mr. Aheneckew, she did so, and Mr. Aheneckew asked Mrs. E. Fox to baptize her baby; he offered a blanket in return, she accepted.\n\nAs a proof that they adhere to the R.C. Church, seven children born from their union, were baptized in the R.C. Church and five of these were attended by the R.C. priest at their burial.\n\nE d Fox \u2014\nJoe little Wolf\nMrs. Fox\n\nMrs. J.

H. Ellis of the above mentioned Mission informing me that two Indian girls, namely Maggie ARNOLD (16 years old) and Edith MURDOCK (17 years old) had disappeared from the Mission on the afternoon of the 7th inst., and that he and the staff had been unable to locate them, and requested me to investigate the matter.\n\nSub-Division\n\nI immediately patrolled per Pte.Auto to the home of John MURDOCK, father of one of the girls, and he informed me that neither of the girls had come there, and he was of the opinion that they may have gone towards Frenchman's Butte, enroute to LITTLE Lake Reserve. I then patrolled to Harlan, P.C. Pratt and Frenchman's Butte District, making enquiries enroute, but was unable to find any trace of these girls. I then returned to Onion Lake and to District North and to the home of Mrs. Pratt, Grandmother of Edith MURDOCK, but Edith had not come there. I then returned to Onion Lake, where I learned that the two girls in question had stayed the previous night at the home of Mr. Dufrene, near the border of the Reserve, and that they had left there in the morning at daylight, ostensibly heading for Frog Lake Reserve. I then patrolled to Frog Lake making enquiries enroute, and learned from the Indians of Frog Lake Reserve that the girls had not been seen there. I then returned to Onion Lake in the late P.M. of this date.\n\n9-10-34.\n\nIn the A.M. I patrolled per Pte.Auto to Onion Lake Reserve and made further enquiries in this connection, but was unable to obtain any further information. In the P.M. of this date I patrolled from Harlan District, off other Police duties, to Onion Lake Reserve, and interviewed an Old timer named MILLER who informed me that he had seen the girls had been seen in that vicinity about noon that day, and that they might be found at the home of Edward FOX on the South side of the Reserve. I then patrolled to the home of Fox and found both girls hiding in an old building near Fox's place. I escorted both girls to the Anglican Mission this date, and then returned to Onion Lake.\n\nBoth these girls had hidden in the brush on the Reserve, on Sunday afternoon until 2 A.M. Monday morning when they went to Dufrene's place, and all day Monday and that night until noon Tuesday, and had lived on berries.\n\nCopy of C.R. to Onion Lake Indian Agency.\n\nExpense statement submitted.\n\nCONCLUDED.\n\nFyle numbers must be quoted.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Residential school at Onion Lake, Sask.\n\nFor your information, I might mention that these two boys attended a public school in the Roseneath district North of the reserve for a period of about one year. Hunter has one boy in the Edmonton Residential school but he does not wish to place the other two boys in that institution. I have on various occasions endeavored to persuade Hunter that Irvine and Ernest should be placed in an Indian Residential school but he adopted the attitude that in view of the fact that the children were attending a school, he was complying with the school regulations. He is now willing, as stated, to send them to the C. of E. school at Onion Lake. I should be glad to have your advice in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

It is a fact that my eldest daughter has been placed in the Anglican school some seven years ago and later my son was also admitted in the same school.\n\nMy husband has been for a time negligent catholic and it was during this period that the children were sent to the Anglican School. Mr. Cook has now come back to better sentiments towards his church and wants to be a better catholic, consequently he wants his children in a catholic school. We have kept the children home this year, up to the present time, but we were ordered by the Indian agent to send them back to the Anglican school and it was in spite of our will that the order was executed yesterday.\"\n\nWill you kindly obtain an immediate report for the information of the Minister.\n\nGeorge Bushard\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nPer:\nJanuary 7th, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable The Superintendent General,\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of the 4th instant, with reference to a letter received from His Grace Bishop Prud'homme regarding the children of Mrs. Cook.\n\nOn reviewing the quarterly returns of the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School, I can only find two children by the name of \"Cook\". One child, Catherine Cook, was admitted to the Onion Lake C. E. Residential School in May, 1930; the other, Edwin Cook, was admitted to the same school in February, 1934. The application forms are signed by the father, Sam Cook, and I presume that these are the children to whom Bishop Prud'homme refers. In each case, the application forms, which have been approved by the Indian Agent, state that the religion is \"Anglican\".\n\nThere is nothing on file to indicate that incorrect information regarding the religious belief of the children was given to the Department at the time of their admission to the Onion Lake C. E.

With reference to the above, in the late afternoon of this date,\nRev. Ellis, Principal of the Anglican Mission, Onion Lake Reserve,\ncommunicated with this Detachment, and stated that he had endeavored\nto get the above named children to attend school since it had opened\nthis fall, but had not been able to do so. He requested that I make\nthe necessary patrol on the following day, to get these children, and\nthen take them to school. These children are registered at this\nschool, having attended prior to the Summer Holidays.\n\nSub-Division\n22-9-35.\n2. In the early morning of this date, I patrolled per #6 Auto to\nthe house of Sam Cook, father of these two children, and on arrival\nfound that the children had been waiting for me, and run away into\nthe brush, as soon as I appeared. I questioned Cook about his children\nnot returning to school, but he was unable to understand English and I\nfound it necessary to get an Interpreter. Cook has apparently had a\nmisunderstanding with Mr. Ellis, and consequently had not sent his\nchildren back to school. However when it was explained to him that the\nchildren had to attend, he helped search for them; the boy as the girl\nhad returned by this time.\n\n3. As the boy could not be found, it was decided that we take the\ngirl to school, and then search for the boy afterwards. This was done.\n4. No trace could be found of the boy, so I returned to the\ndetachment where I remained until further orders.\n\n5. At 9:00 p.m., I again patrolled to the house of Sam Cook, and on\narrival found that the boy had returned. Sam Cook handed him over to\nme. I took him to the Mission, there handed him over to the Principal.\nReturned to the Detachment at Midnight.\n\nP.C.R.\nSUBMITTED, No. 49.\n\nIndian Affairs.

E. Residential School.\n\nYou may inform the Principal that the readmission of Jennie Thunderchild is approved. She should, however, be shown on future returns with her former register number, viz. No. 0144. Before children are readmitted to a residential school, a formal application should be made to the Department, stating the reasons for desiring such action.\n\nThe discharge sheet from this school shows the deaths of Roy King, No. 210, and Lily Chief, No. 0175. If these pupils died at the school or in a hospital to which they had been sent from the school, the \"Memorandum of Enquiry into the Death of a Pupil\" should be prepared in each case and forwarded to the Department. Please give this matter your immediate attention.\n\nThe necessary forms for this purpose were forwarded to you some time ago, but as they may have been mislaid, I enclose some additional copies for your office.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. T. Hill, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\nDear Sir:\n\nAgain I come to you, to ask you if it will be possible to have my boy transfer from the Anglican School to the R.C. Residential School. I have there two children which have admitted before and the girl who has only one more year to go can stay there, but the boy who has few years more to go to school I would like to have him transfer to the R.C. School.\n\nIn fact, you state that being before the Dept. officially known as an Anglican I was never baptised in that religion and was drawn to follow Anglican Religion only because I had been promised many things. My knowledge at that time, of the religion was very limited, and through ignorance I made that mistake to let my children go to learn a religion in a school not of my own creed. It was really a mistake and I regret it.\n\nWhen writing to you again today, may I say that no one had exercised influence on me but I do it according to the dictation of my conscience.\n\nTherefore, I will greatly appreciate, if your answer be favorable to my request.\n\nI am, Sir\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Twatta Band, Carleton Agency, by her husband Richard Gilbert Buck, a non treaty Indian halfbreed.\n\nThe woman commuted her annuity under authority of Department letter No.25-107, dated September 21st, 1932.\n\nThis couple separated some years ago. I am told that she is living with another man on the outskirts of the City of Prince Albert. The husband, Buck has no home and works at odd jobs for farmers and others. He is an addict to liquor, and has been picked up several times by the police for being drunk.\n\nAfter the parents separated the boy made his home with his paternal grandparents, Arthur Buck and his wife, old destitute Indian halfbreeds who were receiving old age pension, and lived in a borrowed shack on the outskirts of Prince Albert City. The grandfather died in August 1935, after which the old blind helpless grandmother and the boy went to live with her sister widow Mrs. Whitehead, No.40, on James Smith's Reserve.\n\nLast year I asked Mrs. McFarlane, teacher at Fort la Corne North Indian Day School to take him into her school. After a few months his attendance became irregular, and he would turn up at all hours of the day or night at different Indians homes on the reserve.\n\nThis boy born of a treaty indian woman has no home other than with the Whiteheads, his relatives on the James Smith's Reserve. His parents lead miserable lives and cannot care for him, moreover I would not take the responsibility of sending him back to his mother to live with her under present conditions. He is a bright intelligent little fellow and four years in one of our schools would do him a great deal of good. I therefore strongly recommend that his admission be approved. He is at present at the school having been taken there by the Rev. Mr. E. Ellis when he came to James Smith's Reserve for the other pupils.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nCPS/S.\n\nIndian Affairs.

ANTHONY'S SCHOOL\n\nRefer to--File E--2\nOttawa, November 3rd, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a very strong protest against the admission of Arsene Fox to the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School. We do not appear to have any record of an application form for a boy of this name but it is noted that, in your letter of the 20th ultimo, you submitted an application for the admission of Morris Fox. If Morris Fox and Arsene Fox are the same person, the approval of his admission to the Onion Lake C. E. School given in official letter of the 28th ultimo should be considered cancelled. Whether Arsene Fox is the same or a different boy from Morris Fox, you should report very fully, stating the religion which his parents are recognized as professing and the boy should not be placed in any Indian residential school until all the facts have been placed before the Department and our decision has been given.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nDr. J. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, November 3rd, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, protesting against the admission of Arsene Fox to the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is presumed from your letter that your protest refers to a boy who has been recently admitted or for whom you expect an application form will be submitted. For your information, I may say that no application for a boy of this name has been received by the Department within the last six months. We did receive an application form for Morris Fox, son of Edward Fox. This application stated that Morris Fox was an Anglican.\n\nMr. Agent Hill is being written for a report regarding Arsene Fox.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. E. Pratt, C.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nOnion Lake R. C. Indian Res.

With reference to the above, in the a.m. of this date, a telephone message was received from Dr. J.C. Hill, Indian Agent stating that the above named boys had run away from the Anglican Mission. He requested that a search be made for these boys, and when located that they be taken back to school.\n\n(2). Accordingly this same p.m. patrol was made per pte. auto to the Reserve east and south and return for the purpose of finding the boys. We learned that they had been seen at the house of an old Indian by the name of Fox on the previous night, and that they had hidden in the brush. The parents had not seen Edwin, as they were also helping to search for him. Johnny BIRD was from another reserve, so his parents were not interviewed.\n\n(3). After making numerous enquiries from Indians on the reserve and also searching the bush it was decided that there was little possibility of finding these boys until night, when they would turn up somewhere for food, and so I returned to the Detachment. Various Indians were asked to keep the boys and report immediately if any trace was found of them.\n\n(4). The above search was conducted in co-operation with members of the Anglican Mission Staff.\n\n17-10-36.\n\n(5). In the a.m. of this date, patrol was again made with the pte. auto to the Reserve east to make further enquiries. The Mission Staff called at the home of Edwin COOK, and arrested Johnny BIRD, but were unable to locate Edwin COOK.\n\n(6). The parents of this boy were again interviewed by me, and requested to assist with the search, and if they were successful to take the boy back to the Mission. I returned to Detachment.\n\n18-10-36.\n\n(7). This date, the parents of Edwin COOK were successful in locating and returning Edwin to the Mission.\n\n(8).

The two referred to are undoubtedly Sarah and Simon. They entered the R.C. Indian Residential School here, immediately after the Department's official notice of their admission, dated June 3rd, reached this office. They have been in residence continuously since, excepting the summer holiday and three days in September. The date referred to by Rev. H. Ellis was on a Friday, September 24th. The mother, Mrs. Sam Cook, visited the R.C. School on that date and got permission to take the children home for the week end, agreeing to return them to school on the following Monday morning. But before returning home with them she visited the C. of E. School and interviewed Mr. Ellis re their admission into his School. On September 29th I was notified by Reverend Father Pratt that the Cook children had been given two days leave from school and had not returned. Upon receipt of this notice I visited the Cooks and had the children returned to the R.C. Indian Residential School, where they are at present.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

Indian Residential School.\n\nI recommend the admission after conferring with the Reverend Father Pratt and telling him that I had received an application signed by the boy's father for his admission into the C. of E. School, and Father Pratt assuring me that he would not contest it. My object in interviewing Father Pratt was to avoid a repetition of what occurred in 1935 when this boy's sister, Marie Anne Fox, No. 0167, was officially admitted into the C. of E. School on November 8th.\n\nMay I refer the Department to my replies to their letters 115-1-10, of Jan. 26, 1934, and 115-1-10, of Feb. 27, 1934, which deal quite fully with the religion of Fox and his wife in 1933. There has been no change since and the situation is practically identical. Father Pratt when confronted with what I consider a change of attitude repeated he would neither fight nor contest the admission but considered it his duty to put in a formal protest.\n\nMr. Ellis, principal of the C. of E.

Hill, our local Indian Agent is perfectly right when stating that I answered him I will not fight the case but only put in a formal protest.\n\nI had in mind that he understood what that would mean, after the fight for the first child being admitted to the other school and also after the facts were well known.\n\nCertainly I was surprised when the question was asked me \"If I was going to fight the present case.\"\n\nCertainly in presence of the actual situation my only mean left in my power was to answer \"I will only protest formally\" and it is why I sent to the Dept. the letter concerning the Fox boy.\n\nI still maintain strongly my protest and the Dept. may be sure that nothing else will be done. I repeat also that Ed. Fox is a catholic and is known by every member of this Reserve as so.\n\nAlso, when our Indian Agent, asked a second time about the Fox's child I told him exactly the very same thing and I never had and will never have a change of attitude in this question and my duty is to maintain the formal protest put in.\n\nThis M. Fox had been in my school over more than two months a year or so ago, I made a Regular and Official Formal Application for Admission and nothing was heard of.\n\nIn Justice Dr. Hill, our Indian Agent, is not to be blamed for the present situation and the reasons causing such frictions are outside his jurisdiction and power and I feel not to mention the reasons which made Ed. Fox changing his mind.\n\nI am pleased to say that when I had applied to the Dept. for a what I consider justice, I had always received the most appreciated consideration and decision.\n\nI am always resolved to follow exactly all the Regulations of the Indian Dept. regarding the Indian Boarding schools.\n\nHoping sincerely that this letter will be received with the very same spirit with which she has been written and not to hurt or knock down anyone.

H. Ellis, Principal of our Society's School at Onion Lake, writing on the 4th inst., informs me that he received word on Nov. 4th last that the admission of the above mentioned Indian boy had been approved by your Department.\n\nHe also states that a few days later he received a telephone message from the local Indian Agent informing him that your Department had cancelled the approval previously given, and stating that the boy's name should not appear on the returns for the December Quarter. Why the cancellation order was given is not fully clear to the Principal of our School, but it would appear that some communication or other was sent to your Department by the Principal of the Roman Catholic School at Onion Lake. The facts of the case as they have been presented to me are as follows: Agnes Fox, mother of Morris Fox, is a graduate of our Society's School; Edward Fox, father of this boy, is a graduate of the Roman Catholic School.\n\nWhen they were married the ceremony was conducted by the Rev. Principal of our Society's School, and the children were baptized by him. In 1933 one of their children\u2014a girl\u2014was admitted to our School, and is, I believe, still there.\n\nWhen the father was informed that your Department had refused to admit his boy Morris to our School he asked the Rev. Principal Ellis to admit him to membership in the Church of England. He was duly admitted, and I understand that another application has now been sent to your Department.\nrequesting the admission of the boy Morris to our Society's School. If the facts of the case are as they have been presented to me, and as I have set them forth above, then I can see no reason whatever why this boy should not be admitted immediately to our School. The Rev. Principal Ellis informs me that no attempt was ever made by him to persuade Edward Fox to join our Church. It is my understanding, therefore, that this Indian sought admission to the Church of England of his own free will, and consequently his wishes with regard to the education of his son should be respected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/KH\nOttawa, January 21, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to Morris Fox.\n\nA strong protest has been received against this boy's admission to the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School on religious grounds. It is understood that he is, at present, in the Onion Lake C. E. School and he may remain there until the end of June, next. In the meantime, Inspector Robertson is being instructed to proceed to Onion Lake and make a full inquiry into all the circumstances and report to the Department. When this report is received, a decision will be made regarding the religious auspices under which this boy should be educated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R.

E. Indian Residential School until the end of June. Inspector Robertson is being instructed to proceed to Onion Lake within the next few months and investigate all the circumstances carefully and report to the Department.

Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Dr. Hill:\n\nI herewith request that the following pupils be removed from the nominal roll of the above school, having reached the required age limit for their discharge:\n\nPupil # 0108\n# 0147\n104\n\nPupil # 133 - Francis Pitt entered school after the mid-summer vacation with Typhoid Fever, after which he developed perforation of the bowel, from which he did not recover.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your 115-1-10, of the 16th ultimo, with reference to the C. of E. School returns.\n\nThe following who had arrived at the age limit were discharged by the principal without the usual procedure of asking for authority: No. 104, Lawrence Quinney; No. 0108, Elizabeth Medicine; and No. 0147, Margaret Fiddler. No. 153, Francis Pitt, died during the September term.\n\nThe certificate portion of the application forms corresponding to: No. 0197, Elsie Brown; No. 0199, Stella Jackson; and No. 0126, Alice Bird, were completed by me at the C. of E. School during the December term and were forwarded by the principal to the Indian agent's concerned - those of Alice Bird and Elsie Brown, going to Mr. Davis, of Carlton, and Stella Jackson's to Mr. Macdonald, of Battleford. I have requested Mr. Ellis, the principal, to get in touch with these agents and have them forward the forms to the Department.\n\nEnclosed herewith is a formal request from Mr. Ellis with reference to the above.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 2, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th ultimo, you may inform the Principal of the Onion Lake C. E. Residential School that the discharge of the following pupils is approved:\n\nNo. 104 - Lawrence Quinney\n# 0106 - Elizabeth Medicine\n# 0147 - Margaret Fiddler.\n\nIt is noted that you are arranging to forward the necessary forms for pupils Nos. 0187, 0190 and 0126.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. J. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, March 17th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nLast October, the Department received from Indian Agent Hill an application form for the admission of Morris Fox, son of Edward Fox, #124 Onion Lake Band, to the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School. As the application form stated that the religion of the boy was Anglican and was approved by the Indian Agent, the admission was approved. Later, Reverend Father Pratt, Principal of the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School, wrote the Department protesting against the boy's admission to the Onion Lake C. E. School on the grounds that the Fox family are Catholics.\n\nOn the occasion of your next visit to the Onion Lake Agency, please interview all parties concerned and, after you have made your investigation, you should let us know the results, with a view to assisting us to determine under what religious auspices this boy should be educated.\n\nYou will note sub-section 2 of Section 10 of the Indian Act. The intention of this section is that an Indian child should attend a school conducted under the auspices of the church with which the child and its parents are affiliated. The Department believes that strict adherence to this rule is in the best interests of its wards. Whenever any disagreement arises regarding the religious auspices under which a child should be educated, we endeavour to ascertain the religion of the parents and the real wish of the father at the time application is made for the admission of the child to a residential school.\n\nIn the case under discussion, there is disagreement regarding the religious auspices under which the child should be educated and, as mentioned above, the Department desires you to fully investigate the matter and report.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nT. H. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Your 115-1-10 of Nov. 3/37\nMorris Fox children\n\nIn this case in going over our correspondence I find\nthat changes have been made, that the marriage of this couple\nby the Church of England occurred under circumstances that\nmight be looked on as that Fox had been practically forced\nand that his signature to the application for admission to the\nChurch of England school was forged.\n\nMr. Fox, on being questioned, stated that his marriage\nby the Church of England had been pre-arranged and that there\nwas no compulsion or advantage taken of him. He was also shown\nthe application for admission of his child to the Church of\nEngland school and acknowledged that it was his signature.\n\nMr. Fox stated that he had been a Roman Catholic before\nhis marriage but that owing to family quarrels over religion\nhe had gone over to the Church of England one year after his\nmarriage. He said his boy had been baptised by Mr. Ellis and\nhis girl by Canon Ahenehew. He states that he wants his child-\nren educated in the Church of England school.\n\nMrs. Fox states that she has always been Church of\nEngland and wants her children educated in the Church of England\nschool. Mrs. Fox is very aggressive and it is plainly evident\nthat she wears the trousers in this family.\n\nR. A.

I am at the same time very doubtful if he would tell the Priest the same story, and personally I am doubtful if he is one at heart, he would, however, not dare tell his wife he was not.\n\nWhile we may have doubts as to whether this man would send his children to the Church of England school were he free to do so, the fact remains that he and his wife both state they want them educated there, consequently I cannot see why their wishes should not be granted.\n\nI also feel that any interference here would mean the disruption of this family which would not be in the best interests of any one.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThe Principal of our Onion Lake School has requested our Commission to ask your Department to authorize the re-admission of the Indian girl, Jessie Burns of the Fort-a-la-Corne Reserve, to that School.\n\nIn support of his request he points out that this girl was released (not discharged) from his School about two years ago on account of kidney trouble; that last summer her father requested that she be brought back to the School as she was much better; that, instead of being brought back she was enrolled as a pupil at the Indian Day School at Fort-a-la-Corne. The Principal has forwarded the original of a letter he had received from her father, and you will find this enclosed herewith. As the father gives permission for his daughter to return to our Onion Lake School, I trust that his wishes in the matter may be respected, and arrangements made for Jessie to be sent to the School in the immediate future.\n\nIn the letter embodying the Rev. Principal Ellis' request for the return of this girl, he refers to what appears to be \"an organized attempt between the new Inspector at Regina, and recently appointed Indian agents preventing Indian parents from sending their children to Residential Schools\". He further states that these representatives of your Department are making it known \"that the new policy of the Department is to drop the Residential Schools from now on and to bolster the Day Schools by furnishing the children with plenty of new clothing and providing meals for the mid-day\". The Principal states that, to his knowledge, such action has already been taken on two reserves.\n\nIndian Affairs.

If any change of policy is contemplated, I have never been informed of the fact. It is impossible, of course, for us to prevent the circulation of rumors that may arise from time to time. My personal opinion is that these rumors should not be taken too seriously.\n\nIt has never been the policy of the Department to send pupils to residential schools from reserves where Indian day schools were established and where home conditions were reasonably satisfactory. I have discussed this particular phase of educational effort with representatives of all the churches. The policy appears to be reasonable and satisfactory to them.\n\nIt is my intention to communicate with the Indian Agent and obtain from him a report with respect to this\n\nRev. T. B. R.

Dr. Westgate, in which he asks for the transfer of Jessie Burns, of the Fort a la Corne reserve, to the Onion Lake Residential School.\n\nThe records here indicate that this girl was enrolled at the school a few years ago and was released owing to illness.\n\nIt has not been the policy of the Department to send pupils to Indian residential schools from reserves where Indian day schools are established and where home conditions are reasonably satisfactory.

H.E. Ellis, Principal of the Residential School, to have this girl re-admitted to his School, I made enquiries as to why she was taken from the Day School without first consulting this office. I was informed that Mr. Ellis had this girl taken from her home on the Reserve on Sept. 2nd last, without even advising Mr. E.S. Jones, the Reserve Inspector, who lives near one of the Reserves.\n\nWhile on the Namu Smith's Reserve on Oct. 26th, I interviewed Angus Burns, father of Jessie, and asked him why Jessie had been sent back to the Residential School. He advised me that this girl should be home attending the Day School as he was able to look after her.\n\nI also made enquiries from Mr. Jones, Farm Instructor. He advised me that this girl had a fair home on the Reserve and that her parents were able to properly provide for her; also that her home was within easy reach of the Day School.\n\nOn Nov. 2nd I wrote the Rev. Mr. Ellis to the effect that in view of the circumstances pertaining to this case I could not recommend that Jessie be re-admitted to the Residential School.\n\nOn receipt of Inspector T. Robertson's letter of Nov. 15th quoting Departmental letter #115-1-10, dated Nov. 8th last, I advised the Rev. Ellis as to the Department's wishes in this matter. He replied to my letter on Dec. 6th, which reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"Would you kindly ask the Department and recommend that they reconsider the decision recently made.\"\n\nFor your information, I wish to state that I am asking the Secretary of the Indian Eskimo School Commission to also take the matter up personally with the Department at Ottawa.\"\n\nOn Dec. 11th I advised Mr. Ellis that as no further reason had been submitted as to why this girl should be taken away from her home and Day School on her Reserve I could not grant his request.\n\nI feel that if the Principals of the Residential Schools are permitted to come onto Indian Reserves and take children from good homes and Day Schools, as has been done in this case, it will eventually result in having to close our Day Schools. I also feel that a Principal has no right to go onto an Indian Reserve and take children into Residential Schools without first obtaining permission from the Department.\n\nTrusting that the Department will concur with the action I have taken in this matter.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nS.H.

H. Simpson, Duck Lake, Sask., in which he deals at considerable length and in detail with the request received by him for the re-admission of the above-named pupil to the Onion Lake Residential School.\n\nMr. Simpson's report reads in part as follows:\n\n\"On receipt of application dated Oct. 4th, and received on Oct. 12th, from the Rev. H. E. Ellis, Principal of the Residential School, to have this girl re-admitted to his school, I made enquiries as to why she was taken from the Day School without first consulting this office.

I also feel that a Principal has no right to go onto an Indian reserve and take children into residential schools without first obtaining permission from the Department.\n\n\"Trusting that the Department will concur with the action I have taken in this matter.\"\n\nIt is of the utmost importance that the closest possible cooperation should exist between Principals of residential schools and Indian agents and farm instructors charged with the administration of Indian affairs on the reserves. It is just possible that, at times, the Principals may find it somewhat inconvenient to consult the officials, but I am personally of the opinion that a great many misunderstandings could be prevented and a great deal of trouble avoided if Principals and officials got together more frequently and discussed a number of these matters. This procedure seems to work out well in the other provinces, but latterly there seems to be a lack of cooperation in the province of Saskatchewan. It is scarcely necessary to add that anything you can do to remedy this condition would be deeply appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hosy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, December 24, 1937.\n\n- Re Jessie Burns\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your report of the 18th instant, relating to the admission of the above-named pupil to the Duck Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department appreciates the information supplied by you in this report.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nS. H. Simpson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have received your letter of the 24th inst., No. 115-1-10, dealing with the case of Jessie Burns, and beg to state that I have this day written to the Rev. Henry Ellis, Principal of our Society's School at Onion Lake, asking him to have this girl returned to her home at his earliest convenience, and to notify the Indian Agent concerned of the date of her return.\n\nAs Onion Lake is approximately 40 miles from the railway there is a possibility that weather and road conditions may make it impossible for her to be sent home immediately, but I have no doubt my instructions will be carried out without any avoidable delay.\n\nI am reminding Mr. Ellis of standing instructions issued to the principals of all our Society's Schools some time ago to maintain at all times the closest possible harmony with your Department's local representatives and to give them the fullest possible cooperation.\n\nBy way of explanation of Mr. Ellis' action in taking Jessie Burns back to his School, I may say that he was adhering to a Departmental ruling given some years ago, and carefully observed by us ever since, that\nchildren who have been admitted to one School should not be transferred to another without being officially discharged after having completed their education. As Jessie had not been officially discharged, Mr. Ellis felt that he was justified in having her returned to his School after recovering from her illness, as her name was still on the register.\n\nI am, however, at a loss to know why he did not consult your representative on the Reserve at the time, and I have asked him for an explanation. While dealing with this subject, I may say that some years ago our Society and the Diocese of Saskatchewan, where a number of Day Schools are maintained, came to an understanding that children who had been in the Indian Day Schools until they reached eleven years of age, should then be transferred to the Residential Schools.\n\nWhile your predecessor, the late Mr. Ferrier, thought this a very helpful arrangement on the part of Church authorities, he felt that it would not be prudent, at any rate at that time, for his Department to issue a standing order making this arrangement applicable throughout the Dominion.\n\nSpeaking for myself personally, as well as for our Commission, I would like to say that I still consider the arrangement possesses very real benefits for all the Indian children. It would leave them while still very young, under the immediate care and tutelage of their parents. Then the transfer to the Residential Schools would help to widen their vision and establish contacts with children from other parts which may lead to life-long friendships, and help to prevent the in-breeding process, which has proved so disastrous amongst these, as well as other peoples.\n\nWith very good wishes for the incoming year,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBRW/KH\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Canada\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Anglican Indian Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Department of Indian Affairs may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: [Name]\nEnglish name: [Name]\nAge: [Age]\nName of Band: [Band Name]\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid: [Ticket No.]\nFather's full name and No.: [Name]\nMother's full name and No.: [Name]\nParents living or dead: [Living/Dead]\nState of child's health: [Good/Bad]\nReligion: [Religion]\nDoes applicant speak English?: [Yes/No]\n\nPreviously attended school for: [Duration]\n\n[Signature of Father]\n\nNote\u2014If mother or guardian signs, agent must forward full explanatory note.\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read aloud or interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\n[Signature of Missionary or other Witness]\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nI recommend the admission of the above child, who is of good moral character and is eligible to be admitted as a grant-earning pupil.\n\nAgent\n\nNote\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

McVady, M.D.\nOttawa, November 29, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Fisher:\n\nWe have your letter of the 4th instant enclosing application for admission of children to the St. Alban's Residential School.\n\nThe Department is concerned with the very large number of children whom you have enrolled. The accommodation must be taxed to the utmost.\n\nWith regard to the application forms which you have forwarded, it is noted that Laura Mabel Constant, Irene Ruby Head, Hazel Alice Head and Mary Ann Burns are from the James Smiths reserve. In all these cases the parents are stated to be living and in addition there is a day school in operation on the reserve. Under these circumstances we would like to know why you have accepted these children in view of the extremely large enrollment that you have at the present time. This enrollment, as you know, is greatly in excess of your authorized pupilage.\n\nPlease let me hear further from you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. G.W. Fisher,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Alban's Indian Res. School,\nPRINCE ALBERT, Sask.\nRev. G. W. Fisher,\nPrincipal.\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Your Letter 115-1-10 (WT 1)\n\nI have received your letter of November 29, 1947 commenting on the over-crowded condition of this school, and asking why I took in so many children.\n\nThe chief reason for my taking in some of these children was that it had come to my knowledge that a new school would be opened in Prince Albert as a temporary Lac la Ronge School, and that when this school was opened some of our children could be transferred to it. Unfortunately, and much to my personal disappointment, the Church did not at once accept the Department's offer of this school, and so thus the transfer could not be made.\n\nReferring specially to the four children from the James Smith's Reserve, these were brought into school at the special request of the Rev. Canon Ahemakew who gave me the impression that these particular children's home condition was not particularly good, and that they were not attending school regularly in any case. I might add that Louise Constantine's mother is at present in the Prince Albert Sanatorium, hence she would be without her mother's care at home.\n\nSometime ago Inspector of Indian Agencies Ostrander was in to see me. He mentioned it was his intention to write to the Department regarding the over-crowded condition of this school. Mr. Jones was with him. It was agreed that it would be a pity to have to return children to their homes, and I suggested that it might be possible to use one of the Army Huts offered for school purposes as an annex to this school. Mr. Ostrander appeared to be in favour of this, and told me that if this were agreed to, he would be willing to recommend that we be paid grants for all the children enrolled.\n\nThe plan I have in mind would be to be to open up one building as dormitory for our boys. Then to bring them by truck to St. Alban's for meals and classroom work, and to return them to the annex each evening after supper. The annex would be placed in charge of a married couple. The distance between St. Alban's and the annex would be but one mile, and it should present no greater difficulty in getting the boys backwards and forwards to school than is experienced by day schools where bus service is provided. One of the buildings for school purposes could be fitted up within two weeks for the plan suggested. Of course, I put forward this idea merely as a temp-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6323, file 658-10, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\norary measure, until such time as the other buildings can be adapted for use as a complete school unit.\n\nMay I say I do not wish it to be thought I am wishing to go over the heads of any local Departmental officials in bringing this before you, but rather to give greater emphasis as to the reason I took in such children. I would not wish to have to return any of the children in question to their homes, and I feel sure that there would be no difficulty in taking care of all of them until such time as the complete new set-up is ready if the annex suggestion were agreed to. I would ask that the idea be given careful consideration, and that I be notified of the Department's decision in the matter.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nDecember 23, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Fisher:\n\nWe have your letter of the 12th instant with reference to the overcrowded conditions in the St. Alban's Residential School. It is now the intention of both the Department and the M.S.C.C. to proceed with the temporary school in Prince Albert military camp. Arrangements for this are being completed as quickly as possible.\n\nAs soon as these buildings are formally taken over, there will be plenty of room to relieve the overcrowding in the St. Alban's School. In the meantime you should exercise every care.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. G.W. Fisher,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Alban's Indian Res.

I am sorry to lose these children, as they were doing quite well in school. The father asked whether at some later date he could return them to school. With the Department's permission, I shall be glad to have them back whenever they can come. It is my understanding they are at present attending the day-school on John Smith's Reserve.\n\n#320 Dorothy Constant was discharged at the request of the father, and since she is nearly sixteen, she will not be returning.\n\nIn the case of #341 - Mary Agnes Burns - she had already been in school two years ago, but stayed out for a year. I did not this, so a new application form was made. The mistake was not discovered until last quarter. I regret this mistake was made.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nP. S.\n\nThere are a number of children whose names appear on the Return who did not return to school last fall. As the school has been crowded, I have not endeavoured to get them, but I would like keep them on the roll, with a view to getting them back to school when the new school is opened.\n\nG. W.

It would seem evident that every co-operation will have to be extended to the Reverend Mr. Fisher in order to help in putting a stop to this condition.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard E.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nRe: Runaway Children-All Saints Indian Residential School, Prince Albert, Sask.\n\nAs arranged during our discussion in your office this morning I send you herewith a copy of a letter, dated 21st October, 1948, from the Rev. G.W. Fisher regarding the difficulties he is experiencing in the matter of children running away from All Saints School, Prince Albert.\n\nIt is of interest to note that the Principal feels that discharge of any of the culprits will aggravate the present situation.\n\nI have informed Rev. G.W. Fisher that you are asking your local Agent to cooperate with him and the R.C.M.P. in an effort to put a stop to this practice of children running away from the School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent\n\nEnclosure\nAll Saints School, Prince Albert, Sask.\n\nFile: AS-4\n\nOctober 21, 1948\n\nThe Superintendent\nIndian School Administration\nM.S.C.C., 102 Bank St.\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a sense there is a connection between this and the letter dealing with the unfinished condition of our buildings, and which is going forward with this.\n\nI would first of all apologise for having allowed a great deal of my office work to get behind. But this has happened not because of neglect, but because I have had to be on the road a great deal trying to bring back runaway boys.\n\nEver since the school opened children have been continually running away from school, and many precious hours have been spent, and much gasoline used in trying to get them back. Many fruitless trips have been made. Since September 5th, my car has travelled 2400 miles, two thirds of which at least, were in connection with trying to get children back to school. I am really in despair. Many of these runaways have been off four and five times. It is hard to know just what to do. I really feel like turning some of them out of school altogether, but this is probably what many of them would like me to do, and others might do the same in order to get out also.\n\nMy chief regret is that the Quarterly Returns are not yet completed, but I am hoping they will be ready to forward next week. Petty Cash Statements for August and September will also be sent as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.) G.W.

When the parents were advised to come into this area it was found that only four families could be accommodated again with the results that due to overcrowding in the St.Albans School arrangements were made with the parents to remove their children to their homes on their reservation and have the children attend at Day Schools on their reservation.\n\nThe above named children were therefore only in attendance for a two month period at St.Albans Indian School and I recommend that their admission be approved for that period only and the usual grant paid to the St.Albans Indian Residential School covering the months of September and October, 1948, on behalf of the children above mentioned.\n\nM.
