A coat of paint on the outside and better fences would improve appearances on this Provincial Highway, where tourists by the hundreds pass it in the course of the summer.\n\nIn October I reported to you that owing to a defective waste-pipe, water was leaking on to the floor from the sink in the basement. It is just the same today.\nOttawa, June 19th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Tyendinaga Eastern School, draws attention to the need of painting the exterior of the school building and also to the providing of a fence. In this connection I have to refer you to official letters of April 19th and May 3rd, last, authorizing you to arrange for the painting of the exterior of the building and the outside closets and screens during the coming summer holidays. You were requested to furnish a report stating what new fencing you would recommend be carried out, giving an estimate of the materials required and the cost of same. The Department will be pleased to have this information at an early date, in order that any new fencing required may be carried out at the same time as the painting and other renovations to the school building are being undertaken.\n\nThe Inspector further states that, owing to a defective waste pipe, water leaks onto the floor from the sink in the basement and that these conditions have existed since October, last. The Department fails to understand why you should allow conditions of this nature to exist without taking the necessary action to have the repairs required carried out. You should see that this waste pipe is placed in good condition at an early date.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. M. Campbell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter June 15th re Eastern School, I have asked for prices to paint this school and costs and expect to have them this week.\n\nAs to the fence, if we put a common woven wire it will take 11 rolls and 12 new posts which would cost about $11.00 for material and if we put in the steps as it is now they would cost for material $12.00.\n\nAnd if you want a fancy fence it would cost around $3.00 per foot and the post would have to be next to the feet apart. I think the first fence would be the cheapest.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. M. Campbell\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Ind. Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, June 28th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, relative to the painting of the exterior of the Eastern school on the Tyendinaga Reserve, also to the erection of a fence. It is noted that you will obtain prices for the painting, and it is hoped that you will be able to commence this work at an early date.\n\nRelative to the fencing, as this school is situated on the main highway the fence fronting same should be of woven wire of an ornamental type, with sufficient new posts at proper intervals in order that it can be substantially erected. You should, therefore, obtain prices for the supplying of the fencing material and for the labour in erecting same, and this matter should receive your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

The laterals are two No. 13 wires, cable twisted together. Uprights are made of No. 9 gauge hard steel wire, deeply crimped and secured in the cable twist.\n\nLawn Fence is regularly supplied in the galvanized finish, but if desired can be given a dip coat of green or white paint.\n\nPIPE POSTS AND TOP RAIL\u2014(Continuous)\n\nThis construction, illustrated above, helps to set off the fence and makes it solid. If wood posts are used, a top scantling is required to protect the top of the fence.\n\nThe 1-5/8 (O.D.) pipe line posts are 6' 3\" (or 7' for fence over 4 ft.). The 1-5/16 (O.D.) top railing is continuous through the post cap, and we supply a pipe sleeve for connecting the rails. For End posts, use 2\" round pipe posts on short stretches or 3\" pipe posts on long stretches, also for hanging single drive gates. Set them in cement.\n\nOUR LAWN FENCES are woven absolutely even on Automatic Machines, and will stretch up straight and true on the posts.\n\nFROST STEEL AND WIRE COMPANY, Limited\nHAMILTON - CANADA\nTwo Other Good Styles\n\nErected on steel posts with top rail, the \"LP\" Lawn fence illustrated above with a neat walk-gate adds dignity to any property\u2014the fence and gates can be given a dip in white or green paint to suit the requirements or supplied in the plain galvanized finish of the wire.\n\nSTYLE \"LP\"\nMesh 2\"\n\nThe illustration on the left shows STYLE \"LP\" Lawn Fence used on a front lawn. It is also used as a backyard fence because its narrow mesh, which is 2\" throughout, will keep out even the smallest chicks.\n\nStocked in heights 36, 42 and 48 inches, but can be supplied $4 or 60 in. high.\n\nSTYLE \"L\"\nMesh 3\"\n\nThe STYLE \"L\" Lawn Fence, which you see at the right with a wider mesh (3\") erected on turned wooden posts, also makes an admirable job and gives the necessary protection to any lawn.\n\nIt lets the sunshine in.\n\nStocked in heights 36, 42 and 48 inches, but can be supplied $4 or 60 in. high.\n\nThe advantages a Woven Wire Lawn Fence has over the ordinary wooden fence are many. Steel fence lasts longer than wood, looks very much neater, and does not block out the sunlight.\n\nWooden fences prevent the flowers or sod from receiving the full benefit of the sun's rays, a very necessary adjunct to good growth and healthy sod.\nLawn Fence Arch and Drive Gates\n\nThe Posts to which the panel is rigidly bolted at the top, are made of heavy 3\" pipe, which also act as gate posts. The panel is 2 ft. wide, with 3/4\" pipe frame, and filled with wire mesh, on which any lettering desired may be attached.\n\nFor entrances to Cemeteries, Parks and Public or Private Grounds, an arch like this can be made to suit any of the three styles of Lawn Fence illustrated on the previous pages.\n\nThis Arch is simple in design, but decorative in appearance. It can be made to suit any width desirable, with single or double drive gates as illustrated, or with additional walk gates at the sides. Usual width between posts is 10 or 12 feet.\n\nBrass letters are 1 inch face and 4 or 6 inches high.\n\nNOTE: The Drive Gates can be furnished in either single or double style and with plain, instead of scroll top, if desired.\n\nAngle Fence Arch and Drive Gates\n\nFor Strength and Permanence this Angle Picket Fence is unsurpassed. It is widely used for Cemeteries, Churches, Schools, Parks, Manufacturing Plants, as well as private grounds.\n\nThis Angle Picket Fence presents a massive yet neat appearance. Pickets are 3 inches apart and are inserted through a V slot in the 2-inch angle rails and then riveted to the rails, making them perfectly secure.\n\nInstead of the 6 inch posts some prefer to use stone or cement columns. In this case the hinges should be put into the columns when they are being constructed.\n\nDouble gates should be used for all spaces over 5 or 6 feet wide.\n\nAsk for Special Folder on Angle Fence.\nFROST LAWN FENCE\n\nIMPROVES ANY PROPERTY\n\nFLOWER GUARD AND TRELLIS\n\nFlower Guard or Border\n\nFlower Bed Guard is made in two heights of 12\" and 18\". Cable wires are No. 13 gauge and uprights are of No. 9 gauge hard steel, galvanized wire. Every fourth wire is longer so that it can be stuck in the ground and held securely in position.

CLARKE,\nDATED OCTOBER 15th, 1929, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE\nTYENDINAGA EASTERN INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 34-2-6.\n\nI am pleased to note the preparation for a new fence in front of this property. Being situated directly on the Provincial Highway, this school is very conspicuous and should be kept up well. At present it looks tidy, except for the fence.\n\nThere is no drinking water here this morning. Is it not possible to provide your own water supply here? Children, as you are aware, require far more water than do adults and, when they have to carry it any considerable distance, they do not get nearly the amount they should have. It would not cost a great deal to drill a well here and, in my judgment, a drilled well is much to be preferred to a dug well at a school. You have a demonstration of this at the Mission where you dug a well some time ago and the children refuse to use the water.\n\nThis school is still without a clock, although I have repeatedly referred to the omission.\n\nThe only recommendation that I have to make at this time to improve your premises is that well and I sincerely hope that you will consider this favourably.\nOttawa, November 26, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Tyendinaga Eastern Indian Day School, recommends that a well be drilled in order to furnish an adequate supply of water for this school. He states that a drilled well is much preferable to a dug well and that the cost of obtaining a good supply of water at this school would not be large.\n\nI shall be pleased to receive a report from you regarding the drilling of a well, stating whether you could arrange to have this work carried out at the present time, and, if so, the approximate cost per foot, and the depth you consider it would be necessary to drill in order to obtain a good supply of water. The cost of supplying the pump and necessary piping and the cribbing of the well should also be stated. You should give this matter your early attention and forward the information asked for, when consideration will then be given to having the well drilled.\n\nPlease also state whether the work in the erection of the new fence has been completed.\n\nThe Inspector states that this school is still without a clock and that one should be supplied. I have to request that you will arrange for the purchase and supplying of an inexpensive clock of the wall type. The clock, while serviceable, should be obtained as cheaply as possible, and an account, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded by you covering the cost. The purchase and delivery of this clock should receive your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. M. Campbell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of November 25th Re the Eastern school on this Reserve, I have not been able to find out as yet the name of any person who drills wells, but I expect to be in Belleville in a few days and I will see Mr Cartley and he will be able to give me the name of some drillers and the cost of same by the foot, and I will report on it, also the price of a pump.\n\nAs to the Fence I beg to say that it has been put up and has been paid for by the Dept at $57.75.\n\nAs to a Clock I will get a clock when I am in Belleville and get it as cheap as I can.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nG.

Cartley, who is a well driller and agent for pumps, and his price for drilling is $2.50 per foot and casing up to twenty feet is included and over the twenty feet $199\u00a2 per foot (one Dollar).\n\nPumps are from $15.00 up to $20.00 and pipes are 35\u00a2 per foot.\n\nAs to the last part of the letter Re a clock for this school, the wall clock is dear and a desk clock can be bought for less than half the price, and will answer for the school.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nG.

It is noted that the cost will be $2.50 per foot, including the supplying of casing up to 20' in depth and over 20' the casing will be $1.00 per foot; also that a suitable pump can be obtained for approximately $20.00 and the necessary piping for 35 cents per foot. The Department desires that an adequate water supply be obtained for this school, and you should arrange with a competent well driller to drill a well to the depth necessary to secure a good supply of water. You should also arrange for the purchase of the pump, piping and any casing required, and you should see that the work is satisfactorily carried out and the pump properly installed. After this work has been completed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to see that a satisfactory job in drilling the well and installing the pump is carried out.\n\nRelative to the supplying of a clock for the use of this school, you should arrange, as soon as possible, to purchase and have delivered at the school a desk clock of a type that would be satisfactory.

Boxes have been emptied but the\nseat in boys' toilet is filthy, and the broken boards\nin the side of the building have not been repaired.\nBroken windows in girls' entrance should be\nrepaired. Glass for windows in boys' toilet has been\nin the school since last Fall. Why is it not put in\nplace?\nOttawa, June 9, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Tyendinaga Eastern Indian Day School, drew attention to the condition of the toilets. He states that the seat in the boys' toilet is filthy and the broken boards in the side of the building have not been repaired. He says, further, that glass for the windows in the boys' toilet has been in the school since last fall and asks why same was not put in place. He states also that there are some broken windows in the girls' entrance, which should be repaired.\n\nI have to request that you will arrange to have the toilets repaired and placed in good condition during the summer holidays and any broken windows replaced. The Department will expect you to attend to these repairs in due time and that it will not be necessary to again draw the matter to your attention. After these repairs, etc., have been completed, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. P.

On the day of my visit there were 157 pupils present. The register shows a very satisfactory average attendance. The pupils are reported as making excellent progress. Discipline in the different schools is good and the deportment of the pupils shows the results of the interest taken in them by their teachers. Besides the regular curriculum they are taught the rudiments of agriculture, sewing, knitting and mending. The classrooms are well equipped and on the whole clean and well ventilated. The outside closets are not cleaned out often enough. They should be cleaned once a month during the summer months and treated with lime to prevent odor. This applies to all four schools.\n\nThos.

Stoddart, teacher, Eastern Day School, Tyendinaga Reserve.\n\nMiss Stoddart in her requisition has asked to be supplied with a school clock, and also a book case. I have to state that the only clock in the school at the present time is a broken alarm clock, which is useless. I would suggest that if possible a wall clock be supplied for this school, preferably an eight day clock with twelve inch dial, the approx. cost would be $12.00. In regard to the request for a book case, I have to say that there is a large library in connection with this school, and the present cupboard is full, with quite a number of books ever and no suitable place to shelve them. I would suggest that a book case be supplied, as many of the new books recently received are costly and should be shelved properly and taken good care of. The cost of a book case such as required would cost approx. $22.00, and should be completely enclosed with at least three adjusting shelves.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nH.J.

(RG 10, Volume 6925, file 494-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nThe Griffith Chemical Toilet has been designed to take care of problems of sewage disposal in districts that are not supplied with sewers or water supply.\n\nNo water is required. One illustration shows a vitreous china bowl with seat and cover set over a large cylindrical tank. The sewage drops directly into the tank where chemical sterilization and liquefaction takes place. All odours are carried off by the system of ventilation attached to the top of the bowl. This ventilation is extended upwards to a point above the roof peak.\n\nInstallation of the Griffith Toilet is a very simple matter as it is only necessary to place the bowl on the floor\u2014place tank in position beneath the floor line\u2014connect the bowl to tank\u2014extend the ventilation pipe above the peak of the roof. All materials are supplied for a complete standard installation.\n\nGriffith Toilets are absolutely odourless. Thousands of installations prove the merits of this equipment. Various sizes are built to take care of each problem. Full information mailed on request.\nJUNIOR\n\nOur \"Junior\" is constructed on the same sanitary principles as the \"Griffith\" but is a more moderately priced unit. The same chemical sterilization of the sewage takes place and the liquid sewage may be drained off from bottom of tank into pit as shown in illustration. Standard equipment includes only parts above floor line.\n\nGRIFFITH CHEMICAL TOILETS\n\nfor Homes Summer Camps Schools Factories\n\nManufactured by\n\nEASTERN SALES CO.\n\nSUCCESSORS TO\n\nT. G. GRIFFITH LIMITED\n\n165 KING ST. EAST\n\nTORONTO ONT.\nSir,\n\nI beg to ask if there are any funds available for the current year that could be applied toward the installation of a chemical toilet at the Eastern Day School, on the Tyendinaga Reserve.\n\nI have to state that the present outside toilets connected with this school are unsanitary and not very satisfactory. This school which accommodates some forty seven pupils, is situated on the public highway which runs through part of the reserve, and the toilets in question are in a very exposed position both to the passing public, and also to the weather; during the winter time especially it is very hard to keep these toilets clean and sanitary owing to the fact that the snow and rain drives in causing the seats to become wet and frozen, the result is that the children who are confined at school all day without going home for midday meal, are constantly using the toilets, and in many instances have to stand upon the seats rather than use them in the ordinary manner, then again under the present conditions it is very difficult to keep these toilets cleaned properly.\n\nThis school is built in such a way that the installation of a chemical toilet would be an easy matter to install in the basement of the building, the approx cost of a toilet complete with two seats would be $250.00 or if a single seat is desired $125.00 this price includes all equipment making a complete odorless toilet, in the case of this school it would be necessary to have separate toilets for both boys and girls, but I think that one seat in each case might be sufficient for the present time.\n\nI may say I have had an interview with a representative of the Eastern Sales Co., of Toronto Ont. who is handling this equipment, and from the description of the working of this toilet given by him I would suggest that it would be very suitable for this particular school.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nH.J. Eade\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, June 21, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your conversation while in the Department yesterday, regarding the installation of a chemical toilet at the Eastern Bay School on the Tyendinaga reserve, I have to say that, after discussing the matter with the Deputy Superintendent General, and with the Architect of this Department, it has been decided not to incur the expense this year. Our funds are extremely limited, and it has not been found possible to provide the amount required for this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Seddall, Esq.,\nEastern Sales Company,\n168 King Street East,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, June 21, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, regarding the installing of a chemical toilet in the basement of the Tyendinaga Eastern Indian Day School and giving an estimate of the cost.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department is not prepared to authorize the expenditure required in the installing of these toilets. A representative of the Eastern Sales Company, Toronto, visited the Department today, and he is being informed accordingly. There are many demands for repairs, equipment, etc., at the Indian schools, and it is considered that the present toilet arrangements will have to be continued during the next school year.\n\nI would request that, when the school closes for the coming summer holidays, you will see that the outside toilets at this school are securely fastened, in order that no access can be made to them by the travelling public.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Name of heater, Good Cheer, No. 520. This heater has always given satisfaction and is a suitable type of heater for this school.\n\nIn regard to the new desks required, single seats are preferable, the present seats in the school are Style 3, supplied by A.S.M.C. School Furniture Co., Preston, Ont.\n\nYour remarks in regard to the Eastern school have been noted and as much repair as possible will be placed on this school. I was hoping that this school at least could have received a coat of paint on the outside this year, but as this is impossible with the expenditure allowed for all four schools, I trust the Department will make a note of the fact that all schools are badly in need of outside painting, and that provision will be made in next years estimates if possible for the work to be done.\n\nI should like to be advised as to when the work in the matter of repairs may proceed, and whether the Department will purchase the new equipment, or whether it will be in order to purchase through our local merchants.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nH.J.

Hendry Co., Toronto, Ont. have a \"Preston\" B.B.C. adjustable desk, either of these makes would be satisfactory and preferable for the Eastern School.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Spruce and cedar trees have been obtained from the Ontario Forestry Branch and have been planted around the yards at all four schools. All school grounds have been landscaped and a program of improving the appearance of these grounds commenced by the planting of shrubs and plants and it is hoped that this program can be continued in the coming years. The work of planting has been done by the pupils under the supervision of the teachers and I am trying to create a feeling of pride among the pupils in caring for school property which has been lacking considerable in the past. $5.00 a school was authorized for purchase of shrubs and plants and is not sufficient to make much impression and I would ask that this be increased to $15.00 a school, the extra $10.00 being needed for levelling of grounds, hauling earth for beds, and other necessities in preparing the grounds. An accountable cheque for $60.00 should come forward to pay for these needs.\n**REQUISITION FOR CHEQUE**\n\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\n**DEPARTMENT:** MINES & RESOURCES  \n**BRANCH:** INDIAN AFFAIRS  \n**DATE:** April 29, 1948\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE No. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | Tyendinaga Indian Agency Trust Account | $60.00 |\n\nSend cheque to:\nMr. A.B.

This purchase was made from funds advanced by departmental cheque #12891.\n\nIn an endeavor to improve the appearance of the school grounds a program of planting of spruce and cedar trees for a wind-break and elm and maple trees for shade trees has been inaugurated, flower beds made and shrubs planted by the pupils under the supervision of the school teachers. The trees were planted in good shape in sod and are now being kept clear of weeds and grass by the pupils so that they may obtain maximum growth.\n\nTeams have been engaged to haul good earth for the planting of the shrubs and flowers and stone borders are being made around these beds and along with the fence posts of the school yards will be white-washed with lime, which I am procuring from the funds advanced.\n\nWhile no great improvement can be expected this year it is hoped that the pupils will take an interest in the proper care of what has been supplied and that each Spring additional trees and shrubs will be planted, so that eventually a marked change will take place at these school grounds, which with the exception of Eastern School have been quite barren in the past.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nA.

It will be unnecessary for you to take any further action regarding these requisitions.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, July 7, 1946.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your requisition for desks for the Tyendinaga Eastern and Western Indian Day Schools.

Moore, Indian Agent, Deseronto, Ont.\n\nInspector Arneil has recommended that additional land be obtained for the Tyendinaga Eastern School. I understand that he has discussed this matter with you and that the extra land needed can be obtained for an amount not exceeding $100.00. You should obtain an agreement from the person owning this land offering to sell it to the Department and at the same time you should describe the land in order that we may have the information required to obtain the necessary Order-in-Council.\n\nMr. Arneil also suggests the erection of a flag pole at this school. Arrangements can be made to have a flag pole cut in the bush and it should be placed at the Eastern School on a cement base. The expenditure should be kept as low as possible.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI have your letter of May 18th concerning extra land for Tyendinaga Eastern School and would advise you that I approached Herbert Brant owner of the adjacent lot and learned from him that when the Ontario Highway Department constructed their No. 2 Highway they ran a large drain tile across this lot and material for levelling could not be obtained without interfering with the tile. Herbert Brant was also reluctant to sell as he had promised the lot to one of his son's to erect a home on the cement foundation in the lot.\n\nConsidering the cost of purchase at $100.00 and the cost of filling, levelling and seeding this ground with the cost of additional fences necessary, I am now of the opinion the better plan would be to install tile drain in the present school grounds and drain this land to an adjacent water course some total distance of 300 feet to which there is a very good fall. I enclose a rough sketch of how I would propose to install these tile and would not consider the cost of tile should exceed $50.00 with some cement at the outlet to eliminate damage by frost. The cost for labour should not exceed $75.00 at the most or a complete job for $125.00\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\n\nADM/JL\nOttawa,\nJune 9, 1943.\n\nMr. A.D.

Two new entrance doors are needed, the present ones being the original doors and are very much repaired and dilapidated. A new floor is needed on the boys porch entrance on the west side of the school. Conductor pipes should be installed to the saps troughs on the west and north sides of the school to protect the foundation of the school proper. A complete new fence should be installed on the east side of the school lot.\n\nAs the children use the basement of the school for manual training and sewing work and this basement is also used by the Homemakers' Club, it is recommended that Donnacona board or Ten-test be installed on the ceiling rafters and stripped, thereby improving the appearance and heating of these rooms.\n\nIt is requested that authority be granted me to secure these supplies by local purchase which purchases can be\nkept below $50.00 from separate merchants and by obtaining competitive prices.

Both involve special manufacture, and there is a tremendous accumulation of business at the factory to clear before individual items, such as those mentioned, can be placed in work.\n\nOn account of these circumstances, we can neither estimate shipping date, nor price, because it is beyond the ability of anybody to forecast the costs of labour and materials that might develop in 1948 when the Cupboard happened to be built.\n\nWe are forced by these circumstances to accept open orders only, on the understanding that they will be filled at the earliest possible date, and at price prevailing at time of delivery.\n\nIf such an arrangement is not satisfactory, we can only suggest that you try to find a local carpenter or factory who will take care of the job based on whatever specifications you prepare.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE GEO.

The Purchasing Agent endeavoured to obtain the type of cupboard requested by the teacher but has been informed by George M.

Our school yard requires fencing and we have approached the Chiefs in Council concerning it; but they with the Agent refuse to grant our request to provide for the fence. It is impossible to keep the yard clean as cattle are often allowed to be at large, especially those of the neighboring farmers.\n\nTrusting,\n\nJames W. Barnhart\n\nTrustees\nEXD. Ottawa, March 2, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that, as under the arrangement for the upkeep of the Indian schools on the Tyendinaga Reserve responsibility for buildings, etc., lies with the Indians, the white trustees cannot institute any proceedings which would result in an outlay of Indian funds.\n\nAs to the fencing of this ground I beg to say that this matter was brought to the attention of the Department by the Inspector last May and Mr. Stainton, the Indian Agent, was communicated with. I beg to quote from a letter received from him:\u2014 \"It would to my mind be a waste of money to have this school fenced standing as it does in a beautiful hickory grove and in a secluded spot with very large grounds and on a side road not traveled as it would be were it situated on a main travelled road. It would scarcely appear that cattle would be troublesome as no cattle are allowed to run at large on any public road on this reserve. It would therefore appear to me as not being necessary to have a fence built and a waste of money therefore I would not recommend building a fence.\" In view of this information the Department did not consider it would be necessary to take any action to have the grounds fenced.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJames N. Bumbert, Esq.,\nDeseronto, Ont.\n\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume C225, file 495-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nTo J. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nYour favour of the 2nd inst., received, and noticed that you apparently misunderstand one part of our letter. We are Indian Trustees of an Indian school in which there are no white trustees connected with it. We want to know if we, as Trustees of the Mission School, have any power in the management of the said school. We are elected regularly by the people of the school section, in the usual way.\n\nThe Chiefs claim that we have no power to engage teachers, or to discharge them, nor any of the powers usually vested to the trustees of the white schools.\n\nRegarding the situation of the Mission School, we beg to inform you that it is not on a side road, but on the Slash Road, and that is a concession road. Moreover, the school lot lies at the jog in the Slash Road and cattle run across it when being driven to and from pasture. The untidy condition of the yard would convince anyone that a fence is badly needed there.\n\nWe beg to state further that there is no hickory grove near the school house. There is a small maple grove but that is on a neighbor's property.\n\nTrustees,\n\n[Signature]\nJames H. Barnhart\nDavid H. Barnhart\nJohn A. Maracle\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 1C, Volume C225, file 495-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT.\n\nMessrs. J. N. Barnhart, D. H. Barnhart and J. A. Maracle, state that they are trustees of the Mission school on the Tyendinaga Indian Reserve, regularly elected by the people of the section in the usual way and they want to know if they have any power in the management of the said school, such as engaging teachers and discharging them and the powers usually vested in the trustees of the white schools.\n\nThese trustees I think have only such powers as may have been expressly given to them by the band or Council with the approval of the Superintendent General. Without such express authority I do not see how they could deal with school property or assume obligations with respect to school matters that would be binding on the band. They do not even represent the whole band, having been elected by one section of the band only. I am inclined to think that these trustees are in the position of a committee whose duty it is to make recommendations to the band with respect to school matters; but that the control of the school and the school property is in the hands of the band or Council, subject to the approval of the Superintendent General.\n\nLaw Clerk.\n\nOttawa, March 25, 1911.\nOttawa, March 27, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant in further reference to the powers of yourself and the other two trustees of the Mission school on the Tyendinaga Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that as trustees you have only such powers as may have been expressly given to you by the Band or Council with the approval of the Superintendent General. Without such express authority, therefore, you could not deal with school property or assume obligations on behalf of the band. It would appear, however, that your duties are confined to the making of recommendations to the Council in regard to school matters and that the claims of the Chief that you have no power to engage or discharge teachers or any of the powers usually vested in the trustees of white schools is well founded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

I shared my lunch with them and\nthey ate with a relish.\n\nDate of Inspection,- September 29th, 1915.\nOttawa, October 7th, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reporting on the Tyendinaga Mission school, Inspector Clarke stated that two of the smallest boys had no lunch and that he had to share his lunch with them. The Inspector did not give the names of the boys.\n\nAll the parents should take enough interest in the education of their children, to see that they are provided with lunch. Moreover, it is considered that all the parents are in a position to supply lunch for their children. You will be good enough to look into this matter and point out to the parents, in question, their duty in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG.M. Campbell, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nBesserente, Ont.\nDuring the first quarter the average was very low, only 6, since Easter it has been better and is increasing. Only about 8 are fairly regular in attendance. Progress is impossible under such conditions. Can nothing be done to make these children attend?\n\nWhy not lay out boundaries for each school and then you could keep some record of whether or not they were attending. At present they go where they please and often not at all.\n\nSUGGESTION RE TEACHER\n\nThe matter of irregular attendance in these schools is serious. In this school with 39 registered the average is only 11 and in the Eastern school it is 20.3 out of a registration of 42. You should take this up seriously.\nSir:\n\nI beg to ask the Department to increase my salary as teacher at the Mission School and make it at least equal to the salary paid to the other teachers on this Reserve. The cost of living and labor has increased considerably during the past year, and I feel that I am compelled to make the request of an increase in salary in order to meet the demands made upon me. Making a request of this nature is not a pleasant duty, but rather an unpleasant duty.

We have not got as good a Teacher in the Deseronto Public school as Miss Warren is and the Children at the Central school have learned more during the one year that Miss Warren has been there than they did in the five years before.

The Indian Office says the fuel at the schools will be done by the first of March if the weather keeps as cold as it has during January. The attendance for Jan. has been poor, average about 5.

This school is the hardest school on the Reserve as the children are very shy, and Mrs. Brant has got them pretty well over it now and I would recommend that her salary be raised as you cannot get a White lady to take this school as there is no Boarding place within 2 miles from the school and no teacher could handle the children as well as Mrs. Brant.

He states that this house is in fair condition and there are two acres of land in connection therewith. He will make enquiry and report to the Department regarding the matter.\n\nMiss Bell, the present teacher, would take the Western School next year if Mr. McIvor gives up duties at that point. If a residence is secured, Mr. McIvor could be transferred to the Mission School. His reasons for giving up duties is because he cannot obtain suitable living accommodation at any of the schools. Mr. Campbell stated that if Miss Bell resigns, or is transferred, and it is impossible to obtain a house and have Mr. McIvor placed in charge, it might be possible to obtain the services of Mr. Fyle for the Mission School. The Agent will furnish full reports later regarding a teacher for this school for next year and any other changes that may occur among the teachers on the Reserve.\nApril 28, 1927.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. McLean,\n\nWith reference to the Honourable Mr. Malcolm's letter of the 26th instant, concerning Mr. M. McIvor, teacher of the Western Tyendinaga Indian Day School, I wish to report that I, too, believe a school with residence should be found for this worker. It may be that no suitable vacancy will occur in the near future. I recommend that the provision of a teacher's residence for one of the Tyendinaga schools be favourably considered. Mr. Indian Agent Campbell, upon the occasion of his last visit to Ottawa, urged the erection of such a building for at least one of the schools. If this were done, Mr. McIvor could be transferred to the school with residence.\n\nThe Capital Funds of the Band on the Tyendinaga Reserve amount to $61,392.87 at the present time. I do not know how these Indians would view a proposal to use their moneys for a teacher's residence. If Band Funds cannot be used, it is possible that arrangements could be made in connection with Indian Education Vote, although, of course, there is no specific item for the purpose this year.\n\nMay I suggest that Mr. Malcolm be given an interim letter at the present time and that Dr. Scott's attention be drawn to the matter. He understands the circumstances attendant upon last December's transfer of Mr. McIvor.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, May 30, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department has decided to transfer Mr. McIver to the Tyendinaga Mission Indian Day School for the coming academic year.

Agriculture is, or should be, a very live issue among these people. Would you consider some such scheme to encourage your teachers to take up this subject more systematically? The grant referred to above is, as you probably know, $15 per year where the work is approved by the Inspector.\nOttawa, November 29, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your report on the inspection of the Indian schools on the Tyendinaga Reserve regarding the teaching of agriculture by the teachers with second class certificates, I have to say it is expected that teachers in Indian schools, who are qualified to do so, will give instruction in agriculture in those schools where the pupils are sufficiently advanced to profit by same. This Department does not pay any bonus to teachers, as the regular salary allowed covers payment for any instruction which they give the pupils in agriculture.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

These pupils and as complaints have come to me about this matter, and after investigation I find it will be necessary to put in five more seats in this school.\n\nAnd in Centre School there should be seven seats as there are seven there, which are utterly useless and cannot be repaired and will have to be discarded. I have examined these seats which were taken out of the Public School in Deseronto they having closed the 20th. They were in such condition that they could not be bought at a considerable reduction and are in good shape.\n\nI would therefore ask your advice as to whether I should put these seats in these schools or not.\n\nJ.

In July last I visited all these schools to ascertain what repairs and improvements were needed and called on the Methodist ladies of the Mission School and called their attention to the matter of separate closets for the boys and girls. Supposed they had three closets built. However, I shall attend to this matter at once.\n\nI may say in connection of building a fence around the Mission School as this school stands on a beautiful grove of probably an acre and being being bounded on the east by a road as also a road on the south and in a secluded spot not much travel on these roads it would appear an unnecessary expense to have a fence built. However, should the Department think otherwise I will prepare an estimate of same and submit it to the Department.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The present closets are in good state of repair only they are to fall for the school. As to the plaster I will get that done in the holiday, it is only a small patch that has fallen.

The plaster walls thoroughly painted as well as the wood work and show evidence of care and attention and a desire to maintain the building (including the floors) in a thorough sanitary condition. The painting, I am informed, was done entirely by the teacher and pupils, the money necessary having been provided through an entertainment held for this purpose. The efforts of the teacher in this direction is to be commended, as it is the only evidence found here during these inspections.\nThere are certain small repairs necessary in the interior, about three yards of plaster having fallen off and requires renewing, which should be repaired with wood fibre or other hard wall plaster at a probable cost of two or three dollars.\n\nThe closets are too small for the pupils these, and new ones should be provided at an early date.\n\nSchool grounds are 120 x 240 ft. equal to about two-thirds of an acre. They provide adequate facilities for drainage and is a satisfactory school site.\n\nThe pupils enrolled here number 37 with an average attendance of 14, which is not a creditable showing.

The repairs should be made at once with wood-fibred hard wall plaster, so that the can be tinted to correspond with existing walls.\n\nThe closets should also be enlarged during the holidays as authorized.\n\nThis school appears to be much better condition than any of the others on this reserve, and warrants a better and more regular attendance of the pupils there, as an average attendance of 14 pupils with an enrollment of 37 is not a creditable showing.\n\nIt will be necessary for you to have the truant officer enforce regular attendance and report reasons for delinquency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.

You should have this work completed at once, and also state what authority the teacher had for selling the old seats.\n\nThe Inspector also states that there are no seats small enough for the smallest pupils and recommends that some of the seats in this school be moved to one of the other schools that require seats and that a row of smaller seats be taken from one of the schools that can supply them.\n\nIt is thought that arrangements could be made with some of the other schools to make a change in the seating at the Mission School. You will be good enough to look into this matter and try and arrange the necessary requirements as to the seating in these sub-clas.\n\nThe Inspector states that if the broken board in the rear of the boys' closet is not repaired the place will drift full of snow.

Campbell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the TYWNDINAGA MISSION SCHOOL, May 23, 1923.\n\nThat partially dug well is a menace and dangerous in its unprotected state.\n\nOutbuildings should be cleaned out.\n\nHeating - Bad.\n\nVentilation - None.\n\nLighting - Bad.\n\nRoof leaks and plaster is falling.\n\nIt is not so much cleaning that the closets require as it is proper construction. They are comparatively well kept but they are all open at the back making the pit an excellent breeding place for flies. They must also be desperately uncomfortable places in winter or windy weather.\n\nA few desks should be varnished. Several desks are loose from the floor while most of those that are fastened down are too far from the seats. Usually the desk should overhang the lowered seat by from 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) to 2 inches for best results.\n\nH. J. Clarke,\nInsp.\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Mission School on the Tyendinaga Reserve, states that the partially dug well is a menace and is dangerous in its unprotected state. In this connection I beg to say that, if this well is not required, it should either be filled in or a cover securely placed over the top to prevent any danger to the children. We understand that the water for school purposes is obtained from the well of Mr. R. Loft, which is situated about 200 yards from the school. It is hoped that the arrangement to provide the water needed from Loft's well can be continued. I shall be pleased to hear from you stating what you would recommend having done with this partially dug well.\n\nThe Inspector states that the toilets should be cleaned out. He says they are open on the back, making the pit an excellent breeding place for flies, and that they are very uncomfortable in winter. You should arrange to have these closets thoroughly cleaned out and put in good condition. The back should be closed in and made as comfortable as possible. Please have this work done at the lowest possible cost.\n\nThe Inspector further reports that the roof of the building leaks and the plaster is falling. You may arrange to have any repairs needed to these parts carried out.\n\nSome of the desks should be revarnished and there are several which need to be fastened to the floor. The Inspector has found that some which are fastened are too far from the seats - that the desks do not overhang the lowered seat by from 1\u00bd to 2 inches for best results. You may arrange to have the desks revarnished where needed and re-arrange all the desks in accordance with the Inspector's recommendation: they should all be properly fastened to the floor.\n\nAll the above work should be performed during the coming summer holidays and as cheaply as possible. You will forward properly certified vouchers in duplicate covering the expenditure incurred. You have already been authorized to arrange for the repairs needed to the roof and plaster. No doubt, you can arrange with Chief John W. Maracle to do the other work mentioned above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The first Man that took the job dug the well down 20 feet and quit the job and it caved in in the spring of 1923 and in fall of 1923 H. Barnhart took the job to finish it and gleaned it all out did not stone it up and it has caved in again this spring. His excuse for not finishing the well was that the people in the section would not draw the stones for him as they agreed to do when he took the job.\n\nI went and saw Mrs Brant who is at the head of the digging the well and told her that if they did not finish it during the holidays that it would have to be filled in and she said that she would try and have it finished before the school commences in September. She has Twenty Dollars on hand yet, and I think it will take about $40. to finish it.\n\nIf the well was stoned up at the present depth it would furnish plenty water for the school, and it would be a good thing to have water in the school yard, and I believe that we will finish it now.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa.\n\nG.M.

The teacher informs me that the snow is never shovelled to the toilets during the winter unless she does it, and owing to the distance that the girls have to evade through the drifts to reach these toilets, it is very inconvenient. There is amply room to place these toilets to the north of the coal shed without endangering the water supply.

The inspector states there is ample room to place these toilets to the north of the coal shed, without endangering the water supply. He also thinks wood manure can be more easily accessible in winter as there is always a path to the coal bin. He states he hopes that this matter will be attended to at once.\n\nPlease give your views regarding the inspector's recommendation. If it is too late this season to make any change in the situation of the toilets, would it not be possible to arrange with the janitor to see that the snow is removed and a good path made to these toilets. If you agree with the inspector that they should be removed to the site suggested, please give an estimate of the cost.\n\nThe inspector states that the well curb, which has been graded up with gravel, is sinking and that, to be safe, the waste water should be led at least 16 feet away from the well, by means of a trough, which could readily be made to do this. He also states that the well curb should be graded up again to prevent waste water sinking into the well. Please arrange to have the necessary grading carried out at once. No unnecessary expense should be incurred.

They have had the humiliation of having to decline a challenge from another school for the reasons stated above. Is there any fund from which an inexpensive outfit could be provided for these children?

On the day of my visit there were 137 pupils present. The register shows a very satisfactory average attendance. The pupils are reported as making excellent progress. Discipline in the different schools is good and the deportment of the pupils shows the results of the interest taken in them by their teachers. Besides the regular curriculum they are taught the rudiments of agriculture, sewing, knitting and mending. The classrooms are well equipped and on the whole clean and well ventilated. The outside closets are not cleaned out often enough. They should be cleaned once a month during the summer months and treated with lime to prevent odor. This applies to all four schools.\n\nThos.

Inside dimensions - 29 ft long by 18 ft wide, with 2 small cloak rooms at entrance.\n\n2. 50 pupils on register with an average attendance of 42. This is an increase of more pupils this year.\n\n3. To accommodate this increase in pupils at least 5 more seats are required.\n\nIn regards to size of school adding 8 more seats cannot be done without overcrowding (and I believe it is overcrowded at present) and certainly not conducive to health of children. The cloak rooms are far too small and unhealthy.\n\nTo accommodate increase I believe a 12 foot addition must be built as possible and as soon as possible. Masonry under school is quite open in spots and needs repair to prevent draughts. Would recommend if addition is added to have doors include larger cloak rooms.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nH. A.

It is noted that at the present time there is an enrolment of 50 pupils, with an average attendance of 42. It is doubtful if this attendance will keep up during the winter months. If there are any desks not in use at any of the other schools, you might arrange to have them transferred and set up in the Mission School. It is considered that, with a re-arrangement of the desks at the various schools, there should be sufficient desks to provide for all children who would attend.\n\nPlease endeavour to make the best arrangements you can by a re-adjustment of the desks at the different schools. Later, if funds permit, consideration would be given to supplying a small number of extra desks for the Mission School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. M.

A lot of loose\nplaster on the ceiling and side walls should\nhave something done to it this summer. The\nfloor should be fixed.\nOttawa, June 22, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your report on the Mission School on the Tyendinaga Reserve for the current month drawing attention to the condition of the ceiling and side walls, I have to say that we will have very little funds to carry out any extensive repairs this year. You should inform the Department what work is absolutely necessary to repair the plaster of the ceiling and side walls, and also in fixing the floor, giving an estimate of the cost of the material and labour. When we have this information, consideration will then be given as to whether funds for the purpose can be provided or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nG. M.

You should see that the work is completed before the school re-opens after the present summer holidays.

(RG 10, Volume 6226, file 495-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir,\n\nI beg to ask whether any appropriation has been made this year for repairs to school buildings on the Tyendinaga Reserve. I have to report that the following repairs and improvements are necessary as follows.\n\nMission School.\nThe ceiling of this school room is badly in need of repair, the plaster is very loose in places and is dangerous to the pupils, this ceiling has been patched many times and should be renewed. The window blinds are worn out and should be replaced by four new standard blinds. The fencing on the front and west half of the school lot is badly broken and should be replaced. 15 cedar posts and 15 rods of wire fencing are necessary for this work. Four screens should be supplied for the windows. The foundation of the school needs re-pointing as snow blows through the open joints and comes up through the floor in the winter time, causing dampness.\n\nEastern School.\nThree door handles are necessary for this school also six window screens and three door screens, the water spouts also need repairs.\n\nCentral School.\nWindow screens are necessary, four in number and one door screen.\n\nWestern School.\nWindow screens are necessary and four are required also one door screen.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nH.J. Eade\nOttawa, July 11, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th ultimo, please let me have an estimate of the cost of the repairs that you consider necessary at the Tyendinaga Mission School.\n\nSeparate files are kept for each of the schools on the Tyendinaga reserve, and consequently, when writing to the Department, a separate letter should be forwarded regarding each school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. J. Eade, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to my letter of June 28th in connection with repairs necessary to the Mission School on the Tyendinaga Indian Reserve, and your reply of July 11th, file 34-3-5 asking that an estimate of the cost of repairs be submitted.\n\nI have to report that in connection with the ceiling, sidewalks and foundation of this school which badly needs repair, the amount estimated to do the work would be $100.00, for repairs to fencing $24.00 for four new window blinds and screens $16.00. The total estimate for repairs to this school would be $140.00 as stated in my previous letter the repairs to the ceiling and foundation are very necessary.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nOnt.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nH.J. Eade\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, August 3, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, with reference to the Tyendinaga Mission Indian Day School. In reply I have to say that you may purchase the four new blinds and screens, at a cost of $16. You may also have the fence repaired, at a cost of $24.\n\nIt is noted that you estimate the cost of the repairs to the ceiling and foundation of the school at $100. There are so many demands on our Appropriation, that it is impossible for the Department to provide this sum. Would it not be possible to make minor repairs this year?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. J. Reid, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to my letter of July 31st and your reply of August 3rd, file 34-3-5 relative to repairs necessary at the Mission Day School on the Tyendinaga Indian Reserve. I have to state that the question of making minor repairs to the ceiling and walls has been taken up again and the building looked over, a considerable amount of the plaster on this ceiling is loose and it is feared that once the plasterer commences to remove portions of it, that it will be found necessary to remove more than can be now seen, it appears that some time ago the ridge boards on the outside of the roof of this building were open allowing the rain to get into the building resulting in the plaster of the ceiling becoming loose. The price asked to make minor repairs to this ceiling and foundation walls is $75.00.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOnt.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nH.J. Eade\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, August 20, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of August 15th, I beg to say that you may have the necessary repairs made to the ceiling and foundation walls of the Tyendinaga Mission Indian Day School.

I understand Agent Bade has included an expenditure in his Estimates covering the work.\n\nThos. McGookin,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nOntario.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo file 34-3-6, in connection with the report of Tyendinaga School Inspector Clarke, in which he expresses the opinion that cheap sand tables are necessary for the day schools on the reserve. And your request to be advised as to whether tables can be made, and if so the approx cost of the lumber which would be necessary.\n\nIn reply I have to state that the pupils of the schools could make the required tables in connection with their manual training studies, and the approx cost of lumber nails etc. would be $8.00. If it considered necessary to line the tables with galvanized tin the extra cost would be $20.00 or $5.00 per table, it is usual I believe to have a galvanized tray with the table so that the sand will not run through, although by making the table with tongue and groove lumber it may not be so necessary.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nH.J.

McCracken, Esq.,\nIn Charge Tyendinaga Indian Agency,\nDeseronto, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to bring to your attention the following extracts from Inspector Clarke's reports regarding his recent inspection of the four schools on the Tyendinaga reserve.\n\nMISSION SCHOOL\n\nToilets are poor affairs, particularly the boys'. The draw-box is not properly placed and the interior of the box so light that it will soon be the breeding place of millions of flies. You have no screen door, and one window is unscreened.\n\nThe above-mentioned matters should receive immediate attention, particularly the cleaning of the toilets.\n\nFor your information I may add that in the current year's appropriation an amount of $350.00 was provided for general repairs and painting at the four schools in the Tyendinaga Agency. It would be appreciated if you would let me know in what manner you consider the above amount should be expended. In the event of any material being required full particulars should be given in order that purchase can be made by our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6226, file 495-5, part 2)\nDear Sir:\n\nI would beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter 54-1-5 of June 16th with reference to Inspector Clarke's reports concerning the four Indian day schools on the Tyendinaga Reserve and would beg to submit a report on the general repairs which are considered necessary at each of the following schools.\n\nMISSION SCHOOL\n\n1 screen door required for front entrance.\n1 screen for window.\n\nA new shingle roof is necessary on boys' toilet, also new flooring and repairs to screens.\n\nToilet boxes need adjustment and new gate at rear to help darken the interior.\n\nEstimated cost of material and labour for above repairs is estimated to be $20.00.\n\nI would recommend that authority be granted have this repair work done as outlined above for each of these four schools. Indian carpenters would be engaged to do the carpentry work and Indian labour on the fencing to be done would be used. The unexpended balance of the $350.00 available would be ascertained when this work has been completed and could then be used in painting the Eastern school or any one of the other schools as they all badly in need of painting.\n\nIn connection with Inspector Clarke's recommendations concerning the emptying of the toilets at the Central School, I would advise that these were not more than one-quarter full on date of my visit. However, toilets at the Western school do need emptying. This at each of the four schools will be attended to in the very near future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.W.

General repair work found necessary at these schools is being done by Indian labour. It was impossible to secure an Indian carpenter in July to do carpentry work at the schools due to the fact that all Indian carpenters were employed in the construction of the storage granary. This caused delay in having repair work done on the schools but repairing has now been started and should be completed by the end of next week. After the repair work on the schools is completed, it is thought that there will be some unexpended funds from the $250.00 which was set aside by the Department for school repairs at this agency and if so, it is suggested that one or two of the schools be painted this year. However, the unexpended balance cannot be ascertained until the repair work has been finished. A letter in connection with the painting of the schools will be forwarded to the department at a later date.\n\nM. W.

If the painting of the Mission School and residence can be done with the amount available and at the same time leave a small balance for emergency repairs that may be required at the other three schools between now and the end of next March the Department has no objection to the painting mentioned in your letter.\n\nPlease let me know what quantities of paint would be necessary, also if Indians can be employed to do the work. If so, you should give an estimate of the cost of the labour. If white painters will have to be employed you should so advise me.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. H. M. Jones,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI thank you for your letter of May 11 re: my recommendation for the painting of the Tyendinaga Mission School and Residence this year.\n\nI believe that this can be done and still leave enough to take care of repairs and improvements on the four Indian Day Schools for the balance of the fiscal year.\n\nI have had one quotation from an Indian painter to supply labor and material necessary to give the school and residence two coats for $95.00, or this party will supply labor necessary for $55.00. I estimate the material will cost as follows:\n\n- Under coat: 6 gals. @ $3.50 = $21.00\n- 100 lbs. white lead = $13.00\n- 5 gals. of oil @ $1.25 = $6.25\n- 3 qts. of green outside paint = $4.00\n\nTotal = $44.25\n\nI believe that this work can be done for $100.00 and if you will authorize, I would like to have it done next month. The present scheme is a light brown body with a dark brown trim but I propose to have these buildings painted white with a green trim and in doing so the four schools will then all have been painted alike in colour.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. M. Judge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa,\nMay 30, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th instant you may arrange for the painting of the Tyendinaga Mission School and residence.\n\nIt is noted that the materials can be purchased at a cost of $44.25. These should be secured from a firm on the approved list.\n\nIt is also noted that Indians will be employed to do the necessary work and that the cost of labour will be $55.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nThe Sport Shop,\n98 Bank Street,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe exterior of the Mission Bay school is not in bad state of repair but considerable work is necessary to the interior of the whole building. This structure is quite old and the wall plaster is in bad shape, being loose and broken from the lath in many places. The floors are in such a condition and have been repaired so often that the classroom cannot be kept warm from winds coming up through. The doors have been resung so often that there is no place on either the door or the door frame that can be utilized to make further repairs.\n\nThe following repairs are recommended for this school and grounds,\n\nRemove all wall plaster to the lath and replace with ten-test or some suitable wall board and panel same. Above the wainscoting these walls are 7' high by 28' long and the ends are 3' high by 20' wide. The cloak-rooms are 6' square by 6' high.\n\nRepair all wall plaster where needed and paint the same with a light colour to increase lighting in the class-room. The walls should also be painted a light colour to increase lighting. The wainscoting to be painted with an additional coat of its light grey.\n\nProcure and install new doors on both the outside and inside of the school, one 6' 7\" X 33\" X 1 1/2\" and the other 7' 4\" X 3' X 1 1/2\" on the outside that should have six small lames for lighting.\n\nProcure and install two new door frames of a wood suitably hard to meet the wear and tear of a school. Install a new floor over the present one of 2\" hard wood flooring, size 19' by 28' which excludes the platform at the end of the class-room.\n\nRepair and nail down school desks.\n\nRenew 10 new lengths of heavy stove pipe, 7\" X 24\".\n\nPoint chimney to prevent leakage in north end of building.\n\nCut down and remove dead pine tree.\n\nProcure 1 1/2\" T & G lumber to refloor porch 5' X 7'.\n\nInstall 36 coat hangers in the two cloak rooms.\n\nErect a new fence across the front of the school and teachers residence, 7 strand 4' high. Renew 15 fence posts and brace posts. Procure and install two small wire gates 3' X 4', one for entrance to the school and the other for entrance to the teachers residence, where there are no gates at present.\n\nPlace 3 loads of gravel at the entrance to the school and the outhouses.\n\nTo do a regular job of this nature some leeway will be necessary to purchase small items not now listed. It is estimated that the materials will cost at least $200.00 and the labour $150.00 to complete this work. An advance for wages should be made and accounted for by credit voucher.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6226, file 405-5, part 2)\nOttawa, July 1st, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letters of the 19th ultimo, with reference to repairs required at the following schools:\n\n1 - Mission: Material $200; Labour $150 = Total $350;\n2 - Central: $55 = $60 = $115;\n3 - Eastern: $60 = $60 = $120;\n\nIf the above repairs were allowed it would involve a total expenditure of $415. We have already authorized expenditures of $45, and you have also sent in a request for new desks for two schools.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation we only found it possible to include an amount of $250 for repairs and improvements at the Tyendinaga Schools this year. Consequently, you will easily realize that the total that you have requested cannot be considered.\n\nDue to present conditions, I feel that it would be better to handle one school a year. I realize that this would take some time to put all of the schools in good condition but unfortunately there does not appear to be any other solution for the matter. Of course, there are a few minor repairs at all the schools that should receive attention.\n\nIn view of the above, you should again review your recommendations and let me hear from you later.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A. D. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6226, file 495-5, part 2)\nDeseronto, Ont. July 21st 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 34-3-5.\n\nI have your letter of July 1st in connection with the requisition for repairs I made on the 19th of June last for Tyendinaga Agency schools and I am sorry to be informed that funds are not available for this work.\n\nAs $45.00 has already been authorized for repairs at Western School leaving a balance of $205.00, I would ask your authority to make the repairs necessary to the Central School this summer, estimated at $145.00 and use the balance for small repairs at the Mission and Eastern Schools.\n\nWhile Eastern School is in fairly good shape and needs many small repairs, Mission School is in such bad shape that a considerable sum will be necessary to make much of an improvement and the funds available this year would not suffice in their entirety and there is little sense in making partial repairs at this school.\n\nAs I am now preparing the estimates for the year 1943-44 I am going to include in these estimates sums sufficiently large enough to repair Mission School and also to supply single school desks for Western and Eastern Schools, the requisition for which desks have already been turned down this year for lack of funds.\n\nOf the funds available this year at this date $205.00 I would ask that $100.00 of this be sent forward to pay wages and the balance used to pay materials by voucher.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJuly 23, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to repairs to the day schools in the Tyendinaga Agency.\n\nIn view of your recommendation, the Department approves the expenditure of $145.00 for repairs to the Tyendinaga Central School. It is noted from your previous letter that the cost of the material will be $85.00 and as we are required to purchase anything costing over $50.00 through the Purchasing Branch it will be necessary for you to forward detailed information regarding the materials that you require.\n\nRegarding the second-last paragraph of your letter, there will not be much use in your including new school desks in your estimates for the fiscal year 1943-44. Due to the use of metal in school desks, it will be impossible to obtain these for the duration of the war.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A.D.

May 29th 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant in connection with repairs necessary at the Mission Indian Day School and I have prepared a requisition for supplies, which is enclosed, that are needed to make repairs to the interior of the class-room only for if $400.00 only is available it will take this amount at least to do a suitable repair job inside without consideration being given to the ante-rooms, outbuildings, fences and grounds. If funds are available it is recommended that another $200.00 be authorized, which would allow needed repairs to the outbuildings, fences and grounds.\n\nRoughly estimating the cost of materials on the enclosed requisition I find that it will be in the vicinity of $220.00 and there will be other small needs that are not listed but which are necessary when you attempt a renovation such as is now needed at this school. When I reported the condition of this school on June 19th 1942, I at that time did not consider it necessary to remove the ceiling plaster, but during the past winter large pieces of plaster broke away and luckily fell while no pupils were in the class-room and this now makes it necessary to remove all plaster and replace with a wall board, thereby increasing the cost of both materials and labour.\n\nAn advance cheque of $180.00 for payment of labour should be sent forward during the latter part of June and the materials should be on hand the first week in July so that the work may be commenced at that time. If further funds are made available I will then forward a requisition for wire fencing, posts, gates, shingles, etc., needed for repairs to the cloak-rooms, outbuildings and grounds.\n\nEncl.\n\nA.

Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nThe furnace at the Mission School Teachers Residence, Tyendinaga Reserve, needs a new set of grates and a new T pipe with check damper complete. This set of grates is composed of three pieces and the furnace was made by the Pease Foundry Company, Toronto, Ont. the model of furnace being a \"Brampton # 17-34\".\n\nThrough dampness the pipe is badly holed from rust and creates a fire and gas hazard and it will be necessary to have an exact duplicate made to ensure a proper fit and I believe the old check damper can be used in the new pipe. The total cost of these repairs should not exceed $10.00.\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 27, 1945.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMr. A.D. Moore, Indian Agent, Deseronto, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd instant, the Department approves an expenditure of $10.00 for making the necessary repairs to the furnace at the teacher's residence at the Tyendinaga Mission School.\n\nR.A.

Please advise this office.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nREPORT ON TIERENHAGA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH NOVEMBER, 1943\n\nSchools:\n\nThe attendance at the reserve day schools has improved considerably during the month of November, no doubt on account of the very favourable weather. Cheques were issued to the teachers so that they may procure manual training and sewing materials at their best convenience. A meeting of the teachers was held and a program of exhibits to be shown at the 1944 Fall Fair was arranged, as the Fair Board has agreed to set aside $25.00 for prizes for children's exhibits which articles will be made at the four schools under the supervision of the teachers. The teacher of Mission School reports the repairs made at that school during the summer has greatly increased and lighting in the class-room and also has made the school much warmer.\n\nA.D.

A survey of the immediate vicinity reveals that the fall attendance will be approximately 41 pupils\u2014which number cannot be accommodated at Mission School. To offset overcrowding it will be necessary to direct some of the children to Eastern and Central schools but these children will then have considerable further distance to travel, thus creating hardship on them. It is recommended that if any programme of school building is contemplated, that consideration be given to either a new Mission school or the building of a consolidated school for Tyendinaga Reserve, with a school bus service.\n\nThe teacher of Eastern School, Miss N. Stoddart, reports that she has not as yet received the yearly report form which should have been submitted to the department, and we request that these forms be forwarded to her at your earliest convenience.\n\nJ.H.

In my letter I asked for $60.00 for wages and only received an advance of $40.00 and I would ask that an additional $40.00 be sent forward as this amount will be needed to complete the work. It is also expected that the cost of materials will exceed the $40.00 authorized by $25.00 at least, which would bring the total repairs to the vicinity of $150.00.\n\nNo furniture was supplied for this residence for 15 years and what small amount on hand has been roughly handled and a part of it unfit for use. I have purchased a complete bedroom outfit for the use of Mrs. Elliot to a cost of $109.00 and she has her own furniture to equip the other rooms of the residence which she is prepared to use in view of the fact she is being supplied with a bedroom outfit. The suit consists of bed, a dresser, chest of drawers, a mattress, springs and a bench and is very moderately priced.\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\n\nADM/JMcV\n\nIndian Affairs.

Campbell, Esq.,\nDeseronto,\nOntario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will find enclosed the reports on the Western and Central Schools which I visited today.\n\nAfter I had completed my inspection of the Western School, I had a complaint from the man who lives next door. I do not know his name, that his child had not made satisfactory progress. He is of the opinion that Miss Picard does not always do all she might for the advancement of her pupils. They certainly have not done much this term so far. He also stated that she is in the habit of saying that she does not like teaching, but is doing it for the money. Of course we all work for money, but it would be better for her not to say such things to the children, if she has done so. All I have for it is his statement.\n\nI have no authority over your teachers, but it would be well if you would point out to all your teachers that we expect the standard raised to that of the white schools just as fast as possible, and if she used the language credited to her advise her not to do so again. I do not think she works as hard as some of the other teachers, but I see them so seldom that I would not like to be too positive in my opinion. I do know that the standard is lower than in white schools, and as I say in the reports I expect better work in the lower grades now that these girls are trained.\n\nYou know these Indians better than I do, but that man this morning seemed to be quite an intelligent man, and if what he says is true, it should be stopped.\n\nDo you know why the Indians object so to these girls? There seems to be quite a feeling against them in some quarters. With the present supply of teachers, you\nshould be able to get better qualified teachers soon. These teachers you have do very well for the standing they have, but it would be quite possible to have better work done than you are getting in any of your schools.\n\nYours respectfully\n\nI did not care to put the above in the report to the Department, but if you handle the matter as I know you can, we can improve conditions in these schools in the future.\nSIR,\n\nIn reference to your letter of May 2nd\n\nRe the Teacher of the Western School of the Tyendinaga Mohawk Reserve, I beg to say I have talked to a number of the Indians over this Teacher and they all say that their children do not learn anything but to cut paper and make fancy work, and play checkers, and dominoes and craps. I do not know why the Indians are so down on this Teacher; it is not only now but before I came into office they were down on this Teacher for some reason which I do not know.\n\nWhen Mr Abraham was here the first of April and we had a meeting at the Council House on the 3rd and Miss Pickard closed her school and came there and Mr Abraham told her that we would be to her school on Thursday the 5th and when we went to the Western School the door was locked and Miss Pickard was gone and she was not supposed to close the School till Thursday at 4 o'clock.\n\nI have asked Mr Clarke to report on the Schools on this Reserve as he finds them when he visits them this spring.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter from Mr Clarke on the 21st of Sept., 1916 to me.\n\nTHE SECRETARY\n\nDEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nOTTAWA.\n\nYOUR OBEDIENT SERVANT\n\nG.M.

Campbell\nAGENT.\nOttawa, Aug 1st 1917\n\nMr. Benson\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nMEMORANDUM,\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to Mr. Campbell's letter of the 30th ultimo in regard to complaints made against Miss Picard, teacher of the Western School on the Tyendinaga Reserve, I beg to say that in April, last, a complaint was made by some of the women of the band that the children were not making progress under Miss Picard and Mr. Campbell was asked to furnish the Department with a complete report on this matter.\n\nMr. Campbell replied that he had talked the matter over with the Indians and they all said that their children did not learn anything, but to cut out paper, do fancy work and play checkers. He claimed that he did not know why the Indians were so down on this teacher, but they had been down on her before he was made Agent. He stated he had asked Mr. Clarke to report on the schools on the reserve as he found them when he visited them in the spring.\n\nMr. Clarke, the Public School Inspector, visited this school on the 28th of May, last, and the following are\nare his general remarks on the work there,\n\n\"Primer Class - 1 present - Word recognition - Fair\nNumber work - Fair\n\nFirst Class - 2 \" - Reading - Fair\nNumber - Fair\nSecond Class - 1 \" - Reading - Very Fair\nLiterature - Fair\nArithmetic - Weak\n\nThird Class - 1 \" - Reading - Fair\nLiterature - Fair\nArithmetic problems - Weak\n\nFourth Class - 1 \" - Reading - Very good\nLiterature - \"\nGeography - Weak\nArithmetic - Weak (problems)\n\nNature Study - Very good\n\nArt - 3rd & 4th \" \"\n\nWriting - Fair\n\nManual Training - Model Barn, etc., - very creditable\n\nGeneral progress - some, but in so small a school it should be much greater. Not what you have a right to expect.\"\n\nHe also stated that some inquiry should be made as to why the children are leaving this school.\n\nWhen Mr. MacKenzie was going to Chemong to inquire into school matters there I suggested that he stop off at Tyendinaga and find out what was the trouble on that reserve about the schools. This suggestion was not acted on and it was decided to let the matter stand.\n\nIn the meantime I wrote to Miss Picard and asked\nasked her to call here on her way east for her holidays, which she did. I told her of the complaints made against her and she admitted that she had had trouble with some of the Indians on the reserve, but that she was getting on alright with them now and that, if Mr. Campbell had given her any assistance, she would have had no difficulty. She claims that Mr. Campbell is unfriendly to her and, as far as I can make out, he is more anxious than the Indians to have a change made.\n\nMr. Campbell says that, owing to her unpopularity, many of the Indians are sending their children to the Central School. Miss Picard says that this is not the case, but that they go there because they are nearer that school.\n\nIf you will refer to the map of the reserve which shows the school sections laid out by Mr. Campbell you will see that the Western School section includes lots which should properly belong to the Central School section and some of the children living on these lots are two miles from the Western School and less than a mile from the Central School and this is why they go there.\n\nThere were no reports against Miss Picard until Mr. Campbell took charge and Mr. Inspector Clarke's reports were most favourable previous to that. Miss Picard is quite\nquite competent to teach and it would be a difficult matter for anyone to satisfy the Indians at Tyendinaga at the present time. Miss Picard will be returning after the summer holidays and it would be only fair to her that an inquiry should then be made.\n\nMr. Clarke and Mr. Campbell have been written to about the appointment of a teacher to succeed Mr. Leween at the Mission School.\n\nMartin\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6226, file 496-1, part 1)\nOttawa, August 5, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo enclosing a resolution of the Council of the Chippewas of the Thames asking for the dismissal of Miss Mary E. Vining, teacher of the River Settlement School on the Caradoc Reserve, together with a petition to this effect from eight members of the band.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, while the Department is not disposed to comply with the request of the Indians and dismiss Miss Vining, it is considered that it would be in the interests of all concerned if a change were made. The Department would like you to communicate with Miss Vining and suggest that this might be carried out, as there is a similar situation existing at the Western school on the Tyendinaga Reserve in the County of Hastings. The Indians have apparently grown tired of both these teachers and it might be to the advantage of all concerned if an exchange were made.\n\nThe Department would like you to submit this suggestion to Miss Vining and obtain her views. Kindly reply as soon as possible.\n\nIn case an exchange can be effected the Department would like to know what accommodation there is for the teacher of the River Settlement School and the rate charged per month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The teacher of the River Settlement School on the Caradoc Reserve, near St. Thomas, Ont., is in the same position as yourself. She has been in charge of this school for about six years and the Indians are asking for a change and the Department would like to know whether you would be willing to change positions with Miss Vining, the teacher of the River Settlement School.

Teachers are very scarce and there are a number of schools that have not yet got any teacher and some have not received an application. I wrote Miss Leacock of Brockville the teacher for the Central school asking her if there was a teacher down there that she could get and have not yet got a reply so far.

Quarterly Report Forms are being sent you under separate cover, and before you leave the school you should prepare a return showing the attendance and days taught by you from the 1st of October to the day you close the school.\n\nIn connection with this matter, I beg to refer you to official letter of October 8th, last, in which you were informed of an over payment on salary of $21.00 for the September quarter, last. This amount will be deducted, as well as the advance now being sent, from the current quarter's salary.\n\nRegarding your resignation, I beg to say that the same is accepted. This school will likely remain closed during the winter months, and if re-opened next Spring the question of engaging the services of a teacher will then receive attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

A cheque for this amount is being sent to you.\n\nMr. Watson informs the Department that he intends to close the school and return to his home on the 10th instant. We have, therefore, requested him to prepare a return showing the attendance and days taught by him during the current quarter and hand it to you for transmission to the Department in order that the balance of salary and bonus due him can be paid. These cheques will be sent in your care, and you will be good enough to see that from these cheques settlement is made of any amount due by Mr. Watson to Mr. Samuel Hickerson, as instructed in official letter of October 27th, last.\n\nMr. Watson is being informed that his resignation is accepted. He has requested that he be re-engaged to re-open the school after the Easter holidays, but he has been informed that the school will likely remain closed during the winter months and if it is decided to re-open it next Spring the question of obtaining a teacher will then receive consideration.\n\nI will be pleased to hear as to what arrangements you have been able to make in having the Indian children attend neighbouring white schools, or whether you would advise that the school be closed for the winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Chief Marmole met with the Department the application at a meeting in Mr. Macdonald's office, Dundas St., Belleville Ont. He claims that this Indian girl might give better satisfaction than the daughter of Levi Louis, upon whom you were asked to report in official letter of the 15th ultimo.\n\nThere seems to be a consensus of opinion that Mr. W. F. Watson, late teacher of the Western school, is too old to give satisfaction and that it would be undesirable to engage him for this position. The Chief explained that Miss Marmole had had two years high school work, plus some commercial training. He intimated to me that, if she or the daughter of Levi Louis were engaged, the salary would be $300 plus bonus. If you feel that one of these Indian girls could fill this position satisfactorily, it might be a good arrangement in the interim before a new building is erected.\n\nI explained to Chief Marmole that the Department was hopeful concerning the erection of an entirely new school on the Spadina reserve this year and I requested him to make overtures to the members of the band in an effort to have a minute passed in the Council authorising the Department to use roughly $6,000.00 of the band's capital funds for a second new building, to be erected as soon as possible.\n\nYour opinion and advice concerning these matters is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.

Chief Maracle went with the Department the application of a Miss M. H. Maracle of 15 Dundas St., Belleville, Ont. He claims that this Indian girl might give better satisfaction than the daughter of Levi Louis, upon whom you were asked to report in official letter of the 12th ultimo.\n\nThere seems to be a consensus of opinion that Mr. W.

If you feel that one of these Indian girls could fill this position satisfactorily, it might be a good arrangement in the interim before a new building is erected.\n\nI explained to Chief Maracle that the Department was hopeful concerning the erection of at least one new school on the Tyendinaga reserve this year, and I requested him to make every effort to have the members of the band in an effort to have a minute passed in the Council, authorising the Department to use roughly $4,000.00 of the band's capital funds for a second new building, to be erected as soon as possible.\n\nYour opinion and advice concerning these matters is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.

We have also been informed that there is a vacant school about 1/2 mile from here and for which a teacher is needed. Our daughter is at Detroit University (first year) and will not be free till after her exams. After Easter she will be much pleased if you can recommend her for this school and she will be willing to teach all during the summer holidays if necessary. We expected to have her to Detroit's holidays to attend Mrs. Johnston's sale but she is prevented and intended going to the ague.\n\nWill you please let me know as soon as possible how the salary given by the Education Dept. could reach a very serious if it is prepared to open the school next earlier than this time my daughters can start Mrs. Stone.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter from Mrs. Kinn, wife of the English minister at Shamrockville, as if her daughter could get the Western School she is attending College at Toronto and will be home after Easter but her brother who was a school teacher said if she could get the School that she would teach for a few weeks till her Daughter could come and also that she would teach all through Summer Holidays up to October as she would have to go back to College then to finish up her first Class Certificate.\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary\nDept. of Ind.

Before considering the application of Miss Irvine, we will be pleased to have your opinion and advice concerning the appointment of one of the Indian girls to the position.\n\nIt is noted in the application of Mrs. Irvine that her daughter would be prepared to teach during the summer holidays. The Department cannot consider this arrangement, as it would not be fair to the Indian children to ask them to attend school during the two months of summer holidays and besides it is doubtful if the attendance during that period would warrant the school being kept open.\n\nAs soon as we hear from you in reply to letter above mentioned, we will then consider the question of making a selection from the applicants received and appointing a teacher for this school to begin duties about the 1st of April, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

I expect to go to Bella Coola on Saturday or the first of the week and I will find out what her qualifications are and will report to Dept. As to the salary of $350.00 and Board it would not do this and pay her board as the last teacher had to pay $1.00 per day while he was here.\n\nMiss Beatrice left teacher at the Mission School told me that she thought she would quit teaching the end of this quarter and if she does Miss Miracle could take the mission as it is impossible to get a white teacher at this school on account of Board.

She has attended Bepance High School for one year and has been doing the Public School at Sherrington taking up lower school work. She seems to be a very bright girl and the teacher at Sherrington School gives her a good report which I am attaching herewith.\n\nI also saw Miss M.M. Miracle yesterday and told her the salary and she said they told her it was $600 and did not care to come for any less. I also spoke to Chief John W. Miracle to day about the two girls and he said he thought the Louis girl would be the best. I think that $600 including the bonus would be a good salary that would be $150 each quarter.\n\nAs to the qualifications of the two are equal and I would like to start this school on the first of April.\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n[Signature]\nAgent\n\nIndian Affairs.

She did not go and you are getting very small returns for your money.\n\nSchool is a long way behind in arithmetic. Reading is fair, Geography very weak. Spelling is fair in most cases.\n\nIn one primer class there are two 13 year olds and one 11, and they cannot recognize any of the words in the lesson that they read freely. They read from memory or rather they do not read at all. This is poor teaching. As a matter of fact, you cannot expect a child with one year at High School to teach. The return for this expenditure is very, very little. It is almost a waste of money.\n\nH. J. Clarke,\n\nInsp.\nOttawa, November 7th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Clarke, in a report on his recent inspection of the Western school on the Tyendinaga Reserve, states that the services of the present teacher, Miss Helen Lewis, are most unsatisfactory, and that no progress is being made by the pupils in the classroom. He states it can hardly be expected that a young girl with only one year at high school can have the necessary experience. He further states that it is a waste of money, from the results achieved, to continue Miss Lewis' services.\n\nIn view of the Inspector's report, I would request that you endeavour to obtain the services of another teacher to take charge of this school at the beginning of the new year. In the meantime, Miss Lewis may remain as teacher. You will be good enough to keep this matter in mind and, if possible, obtain the services of a teacher with the necessary qualifications.

I am pleased to offer you the position of teacher at the Tyendinaga Western Indian Day School. This school is on the Tyendinaga reserve and is situated two miles from Shannerville, Ont. The Indian Agent, Mr. G. M. Campbell, lives at Deseronto, which is seven miles from the school.\n\nThe classroom is three years old and is in good condition. The parents on this reserve show considerable interest in the matter of education. There is no residence for the teacher, but suitable quarters can be secured either in Shannerville or on the reserve. The last teacher boarded less than 200 yards from the school. Two Indians perform the duties of janitor and of trusty officer.

Your appointment as teacher of the Tyendinaga Western Indian Day School as from the first of January, next, is confirmed. Salary will be allowed at the rate of $100 per teaching month. Concerning moving or the securing of suitable quarters, if you wish any advice, you might write to Mr. Indian Agent G. M.

This is not known near this school where he can get a bus in and I do not know what he will do unless he travels. I was talking to him about it and I told him there was a house near the mission school about 6 rods from the school and I told him if this house could be rented we could make a change with the teacher at the mission school, as there is no place for a teacher to board at this school.\n\nI will find out if the above house can be rented and will report later.\n\nJohn Abbein Servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Ind.

McIvor, teacher of the Western Tyendinaga Indian Day School, I wish to report that I, too, believe a school with residence should be found for this worker. It may be that no suitable vacancy will occur in the near future. I recommend that the provision of a teacher's residence for one of the Tyendinaga schools be favourably considered. Mr. Indian Agent Campbell, upon the occasion of his last visit to Ottawa, urged the erection of such a building for at least one of the schools. If this were done, Mr. McIvor could be transferred to the school with residence.\n\nThe Capital Funds of the Band on the Tyendinaga Reserve amount to $61,352.67 at the present time. I do not know how these Indians would view a proposal to use their moneys for a teacher's residence. If Band Funds cannot be used, it is possible that arrangements could be made in connection with Indian Education Vote, although, of course, there is no specific item for the purpose this year.\n\nMay I suggest that Mr. Malcolm be given an interim letter at the present time and that Dr. Scott's attention be drawn to the matter. He understands the circumstances attendant upon last December's transfer of Mr. McIvor.\n\nRussell T. Kerrison,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nCONFIDENTIAL.\n\nOttawa, May 6, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI should like to know, without delay, if you would accept the position of teacher at the Tyendinaga Mission Indian Day School if the nearby house, recommended as suitable by Mr. Indian Agent Campbell, be rented as a teacher's residence. I understand that you would like a school with residence facilities and the Department is favourably disposed to making the necessary arrangements if it is your wish to continue in our service.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

If not I will accept your generous offer of the main school.\n\nOf course, it would not be worth while changing schools until Sept 1st.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMalcolm Macdonald\n\nIndian Affairs.

I guessed at the morning's attendance so I could get it off the 31st. I'm having exams so they'll likely all be there. Didn't fill out that section after school at top as I don't know what should be there yet.\n\nI've heard through the neighbors quite decidedly that there is to be a change of teacher in our school. It seems they all understand that Mr. Claus' son is to teach next year. Is that true? If so, I'd like to be certain now, as I'll have...\nto look soon for another position. I'd like to stay here some more time so I can complete my study of my first class subjects. Also I'd like to know as soon as possible if Mr. Claus is not leaving the school.\n\nThanking you and hoping the report is O.K.,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHelen Clarke\nMEMO.\n\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter from Miss Clarke, teacher at the Western school, that she has heard that Herman Claus' son was going to teach in the Western school.

The water therefore would have a tendency to be foul and bad therefore imperilling the health of the children. I may say there is a well about 200 yards from the school at a farm house the water of which is excellent owing to a lot of water being used. This school has been using this well for years and being nearest to the school it would appear an unnecessary expense to dig a well as we would not have nearly as good water.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6226, file 496-5, part 1)\nOttawa, December 3, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 28th ult., I beg to say that you may purchase a wall clock for the Western Tyendinaga school at a cost not exceeding $5.00.\n\nAs to the well, if there is no objection to the school using the private well mentioned by you, no action need be taken at the present time to provide another supply of water.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

And when your Mr. Benson inspected these last he found them in fine condition and will bear me out when I inform you that they are as good as any schools in rural districts and I am sure far better than a great number of schools under Inspector Clarke's jurisdiction and in some respect better than the Public School of this town. This I know having been a member of the School Board of this town for some twelve years.\n\nHowever, Mr. Clark having only recently been appointed Inspector naturally must find fault where fault should not be found.

However I have succeeded in getting a good stone foundation built on first class shape for forty-five dollars which is now complete and in order to get it built for this money it was necessary for me to procure a stone mason who was not in the hold up ring and who knew nothing of the prices which had been tendered.

I have written the agent twice about the repairs and nothing has been done yet. The foundation of stone is in such a bad condition, that unless it is \"banked\" we shall not be able to have school on cold windy days, for the wind blows up through the floor. Also there is a separation in the wall where the wind always blows in. This separation is 1/2\" wide.\n\nSgd. Ethel Mae Picard\n\nTeacher.\nOttawa, December 26, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the attention of the Department has been called to certain needed repairs to the Western School on the Tyendinaga Reserve. It is stated that the foundation is so badly pointed that unless it is banked it will be impossible to keep the school open on windy days during the winter, as the wind blows up through the floor. There is also said to be a crack in the wall about half an inch wide. You will be good enough to have these matters attended to at once.\n\nThe Public School Inspector in his report on this school states that the painting has not been completed and that a water tank is desirable. You should see that the painting is finished and you may purchase a suitable water tank for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. Donnelly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume_6226, file 496-5, part 1)\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAm sorry to be forced to annoy you with my troubles but I can get nothing done for the school any other way.\n\nPainting of the interior of the school was started the last of August and has never been finished. The paint has been in my\nway, under the desk all\nthe year. Before the painting\nwas started, some repainting\nof the wall should have\nbeen done.\n\nIn October a cupboard\nwas put up in the wrong\nplace and given one thin coat of paint. To\nmake room for this\ncupboard, where it is, the\nmost useful blackboard\nwas taken down as still\ndown. At last I gave the\ncupboard another coat of\npaint as it looked so\nvery badly.\n\nWindows were brought up\nto be put in during Easter\nvacation. They are still\nthere and as there was\nno safe place for them except in front of my blackboard, they are very much in the way. The door is partly off its hinges. The outbuildings need attention. Curtains are needed; I have had to use a dust pan for a coal shovel most of the winter, so am now without shovel or dust pan and I am also without chalk.\n\nAs pupils, who have been absent most of the winter, are now returning, I am short of seats. One seat is useless because it is not nailed down. I've tried several times to nail it.\ndown myself but failed.\nA pupil the her dresson\nit to-day. It is time\nthe banking was removed.\nI hope you will be so\nkind as to see that\nsome of these things\nare attended to.\nI gave my report to Mr.\nDonnelly March 30th but\nas yet I have not received\nmy check. Was anything\nwrong with my report?\nSincerely Yours.\nEthel Picard\nTeacher\nWestern Mohawk School\nShannonville,\nOntario\n\nApril 28th 1914.\nOttawa, May 4, 1914.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo in regard to your salary for the March quarter, last, as teacher of the Western School on the Tyendinaga Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets the delay which has taken place in paying you and which has been occasioned by the neglect of the Agent to forward your return for that quarter. Your salary cheque will be sent you tomorrow and the Agent will be instructed to see that the building is put into proper condition at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Ethel Picard,\nTeacher,\nWestern Tyendinaga School,\nBox 383,\nShannonville, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6226, file 496-5, part 1)\nOttawa, May 5, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have again to call your attention to your neglect of your duty in regard to school matters on the Tyendinaga Reserve.\n\nSince your appointment as Indian Agent for this reserve you have failed to send in the monthly reports called for on the four schools under your charge and it is presumed that you have made no official visits to these schools during that time. You have also disregarded the Department's instructions to furnish an annual report on the work of these schools, although the fiscal year closed on March 31st, last.\n\nAs a result of your negligence the teachers of these schools are kept out of their quarterly salaries, no returns having been received from you for the quarter ending March 31st, last. The Department considers this a serious matter, as the teachers are put to great inconvenience by the non-receipt of the money they have earned and I wish to assure you that unless you reply to this letter immediately giving some sufficient explanation of your carelessness in the past and forwarding without any further delay your annual report and the quarterly returns serious notice will have to be taken of your disregard of the Department's\n\nThos. Donnelly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6226, file 496-5, part 1)\npartment's explicit instructions.\n\nYou will also be good enough to explain why the repairs to the different schools have not been attended to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, May 6, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nYou will be furnished with a copy of an official letter addressed to Mr. Donnelly, Indian Agent, Deseronto, calling his attention to his neglect of his duty in regard to school matters on the Tyendinaga Reserve. This letter referred more particularly to Mr. Donnelly's personal lack.\n\nHe has also failed to carry out his instructions in regard to repairs to the school buildings. Shortly after his appointment he was authorized to have the following repairs made to the different schools on the reserve:\n\nEastern School.\n\nWindow sashes to be tightened and broken panes of glass replaced; closets to be battened and repaired and window lights placed in each. New desks were to be purchased and hyloplaste blackboards put in position. There was some pointing to be done to the foundation.\n\nCentral School.\n\nBroken panes of glass and sashes repaired; the coal bin cleaned out and the screens for the closets moved or covered so as to prevent the snow from accumulating. The ground around the entrance was to be raised with sand or gravel, new blackboards placed in position and the stove put in order and cleaned.\n\nWestern School.\n\nThis school was to be painted inside. This has only been partly finished, as the paint pots have been left in the\n\nChas. McGibbon, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6226, file 496-5, part 1)\nthe school. The cupboard, which was ordered, was made and placed in the school in the wrong position. To make room for this cupboard a blackboard was taken down and is still on the floor. The windows were to be repaired and window sashes have been brought there and are still in the school-room in front of the blackboard and are much in the way. The door is partly off its hinges. The outbuildings need attention, curtains are needed and there is no coal shovel provided for the coal stove in the winter. The banking around the school needs to be levelled off and the coal bin and shed cleaned and put in repair.\n\nMission School.\n\nThe closets were to be repaired, the loose plaster on the walls to be mended, broken panes of glass replaced and the sashes repaired.\n\nFlag poles were to be furnished for all the schools and it was hoped that Mr. Donnelly would have made regular visits and seen that his instructions were carried out. A truant officer was also to be appointed. As far as the Department is aware none of these matters have been attended to and you should see that the schoolhouses and out premises are put in proper condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McTavish\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nReport of Inspector H.J. Clarke on the Western School, Tyendinaga.\n\nRoof leaks badly, foundations are faulty, windows fit badly.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nWestern School\n\nThis building is very poor and I strongly recommend the erection of a new school building at an early date as possible. I have never seen as poor a building as this one made use of as a school. The building was moved some years ago and was badly wrecked and it is impossible to repair it satisfactorily. The school was not in session. The teacher stated she had dismissed the children on account of the cold. No wood being in the school. This was a flimsy excuse as in none of the schools was there any fire on the day I visited them. I visited them all the same day. A new teacher should be secured as soon as possible.\n\nThere appears to be 22 on the roll; 5 boys and 6 girls had been at the school the morning of the day I visited the school.\n\nThe building is in poor condition and before another winter a new building should be erected.\n\nCharles McGibbon,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, June 18, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. Benson in charge of the Schools Branch of this Department will visit the Tyendinaga Reserve early next week to see that the repairs to the schools there, which should have been made last year, are carried out at once and you will be good enough to see that any instructions he may give you in regard to school matters are carefully attended to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6226, file 496-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, August 8th, 1918.\n\nMemorandum Mr. Scott,\n\nOn my recent visit to Tyendinaga reserve to procure data in reference to condition of schools, I inspected the Western school and beg to report that this school is similar in size and design to the Mission school, but is in worse condition as the walls at foundation are bulging outwards until the sills are almost plumb with eaves of roof, although walls have been tied in with rods to prevent further spreading and the collapse of the building.\n\nA new shingled roof is also required as the shingles are badly broken and rotting off. The lean-to entrance addition also requires a new felt roof, the present one being entirely worn out and leaking badly, and should be replaced as soon as possible.\n\nThe school building is lighted on the two sides with two windows in each. The class-rooms being 20 x 30 with floor space for 34 pupils and air space for 24, the number enrolled.\n\nThe average attendance is 12, being one-half of the number registered, which is scarcely a creditable showing.\nThe school grounds are 117 x 197 ft. with gradual fall to rear of lot, admitting of satisfactory drainage for basement under school.\n\nAs a new building is necessary and should be erected next year, I would recommend that sufficient patching only be done to render the roof temporarily water proof until a new building is ready.\n\nArchitect.\nOttawa, August 15, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nAt a recent inspection of the Western School, Tyendinaga Indian Reserve, it was noted that the shingled roof was in a very bad condition and requires a new roof covering. As it is necessary to build a new school at this place in the near future, patching of the roof only should be done, providing that this will keep the building dry for the season.\n\nA new felt roof is necessary for the entrance addition, which should be of similar felt to that specified for the recovering of the drive-house connected with rectory.\n\nThis work should be proceeded with during the Summer holidays and completed as economically as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

No unnecessary expense should be incurred, and properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the cost.\n\nThe Inspector has also drawn attention to the necessity of individual drinking cups at this and other schools on the Reserve. You might interview the teachers as to the arrangements that could be made if individual cups are provided. It would be useless to supply these cups if each child did not at all times use the one provided for his sole use.

This matter was drawn to your attention in official letter of October 20th, 1927. I shall be pleased to hear whether some arrangement could not be made for the proper storing of the kindling wood where it could be kept in a dry condition. Please state what you would recommend be done to provide the storage facilities required.\n\nThe Inspector also states that there is an inadequate supply of drinking water. At the present time they are getting water at a distance from the school and are only allowed to obtain one pail per day, which is insufficient. The Inspector states he considers it would be a simple matter to drill a well at this school. Please also report regarding the question of drilling a well, stating how you would propose the work be done, giving the approximate cost of same.\n\nThe above matters should receive your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst.

The Department has no information as to the necessity for the painting of this building, nor has it received any report from you in the matter. You should furnish a report at once, stating whether you consider it necessary that this building be painted, and, if so, you should state whether you consider the price quoted by Eno Brant is satisfactory, also if it would not be possible, if the work is absolutely necessary, to obtain prices from other persons for doing same. The Department will expect to hear from you in this matter at an early date.\n\nI would draw your attention to official letter of June 11th, last, relative to the need of storage facilities for the kindling wood, and to request that you will furnish the information asked for.

Very little information is supplied as to the amount of painting that would be carried out by Brant at each of these schools. The Department, before authorizing the work, must have a report stating definitely and in detail the full amount of the painting, repairs, etc., required at each of the above schools.\n\nWith reference to the renovating of the interior of the Mission and Central Schools, please state whether you would recommend that the walls be kalsomined or painted, as it is noted that Enoe Brant submits a price for both kalsomining and painting.\n\nIt is noted that you will try to see if you can obtain other offers for doing the painting. Would it not be possible to have all the work required done by day labour under the charge of Enoe Brant or another competent Indian painter, you to purchase all paints and other material required? Indian labour might be employed to assist Enoe Brant. Proper time sheets could be kept of the labour employed, and you could forward accounts covering the cost of the paints, oils, etc., required. I shall be pleased to hear definitely from you at the earliest possible date regarding this painting, stating what you consider the best arrangement to make in having the work carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

You will be good enough to see that, during the summer holidays, the floor and woodwork are thoroughly scrubbed and cleaned. After the floor is dry, it should receive a coat of oil.\n\nThe Inspector reports that one of the desks is broken, and that the latch on the front door is out of order, and that in windy weather the door will not stay shut. Please state whether you can have the necessary repairs made to the desk, or whether a new part will have to be ordered. If so, you should state the name of the manufacturer of the desks and the size of same. Regarding the fastening of the front door, I would refer you to official letter of May 3rd last, authorising you to have a new lock installed. The matter of repairs at the schools should receive more prompt attention after you receive the necessary authority.\n\nThe Inspector again states that a well should be drilled at this school, as the children have to carry drinking water a considerable distance.

CLARKE,\nDATED SEPTEMBER 29, 1930, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE\nTYENDINAGA WESTERN INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 54-4-6.\n\n1. School proper is new and modern. There are a few broken\nwindows that should be repaired at once.\n2. Toilets are very unsatisfactory; they are too close\ntogether, about 4 ft.; they are very inconveniently placed; being\n50 paces from the school door. Hence are inaccessible in bad\nweather.\n3. You should have your own water supply. These children\ncarry water for a considerable distance and, therefore, do not\nget nearly what they require.\n\nI fail to understand why your Agent so persistently\nignores my advice concerning these toilets. Advise that I have\ngiven so many times that I am weary of it, and probably you are.\nThey would not be tolerated at all in a Public School. Teachers\nin the past have told me that in bad weather the children either\ncannot or will not go to them at all. They could readily be\nplaced a respectable distance apart and say 20 feet in the rear\nof the school, where they would be easily reached in any weather.\n\nA coal fire may not be necessary yet, although they had\none at the Central today, but it is too cold here today for children\nto sit at their desks without a little fire. There is plenty of\ncoal but practically no wood. All I could find is some old posts\nthat will not go into the furnace. There should be a supply of wood\nprovided at once.\n\nWhen your coal was put in, it was carelessly done for there\nis a good pailful on the ground outside the bin.\nThe metal connection between your furnace and the venti-\nlating opening in the wall has been so bruised that it is useless as\na ventilator. A few minutes work by one who knew how, would repair\nit.\nOttawa, October 15, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Tyendinaga Western School, states that the toilets have not been cleaned out and that the boxes are full. He further states that there are several broken windows in the school, which should have been repaired before this. In connection with the cleaning of the closets and the repairing of the windows, I have to refer you to my official letter of June 16th, last, in which you were requested to see that the closets in the closets at each of the schools on the reserve cleaned out and the windows of the school repaired. The Department fails to understand why there has been delay on your part in having these toilets cleaned and all broken window glass replaced. I have now to request that you will give these matters your prompt attention.\n\nThe Inspector further states that while there was sufficient coal on hand, there was practically no wood. He recommended that a supply of wood be provided at once. I have therefore to request that you will arrange to obtain and have delivered the quantity of wood necessary for the coming winter's use. You should see that the wood is properly stored.\n\nIt is also stated by the Inspector that the metal connection between the furnace and the ventilating opening in the wall has been so braced that it is useless as a ventilator and that a few minutes' work, by one who knew how, would repair it. You should have this connection repaired and placed in good condition as soon as possible.\n\nThe Department will expect you to see that the above mentioned work is carried out, not only at this school, but where any work of a similar nature, or repairs, are required at the other schools.

On the day of my visit there were 139 pupils present. The register shows a very satisfactory average attendance. The pupils are reported as making excellent progress. Discipline in the different schools is good and the deportment of the pupils shows the results of the interest taken in them by their teachers. Besides the regular curriculum they are taught the rudiments of agriculture, sewing, knitting and mending. The classrooms are well equipped and on the whole clean and well ventilated. The outside closets are not cleaned out often enough. They should be cleaned once a month during the summer months and treated with lime to prevent odor. This applies to all four schools.\n\nThos.

You might also state if the former gates were removed, and, if so, if you are aware who removed them.\n\nThe Inspector also states that the plaster on the walls of the classroom needs repairing.

(RG 10, Volume 6226, file 496-5, part 2)\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease be advised that a few small repairs are necessary at the Western Indian Day School on Tyendinaga Reserve and that the following materials are needed,\n\nLatch for one outhouse door.\n60 lineal feet of 4\" corner board.\n60 lineal feet 5\" corner board.\n1 pane glass 7\" X 9\" with putty and brads.\n1 piece of 2 X 4\", 12 feet long.\n2 lbs 2\u00bd inch nails.\n\nThe screen and boxes at the outhouses at this school need repairing, the posts of the screen having been heaved out of the ground by frost and should be again set up properly. A water pail and a small fire shovel are needed in the class-room.\n\nThe pump at this school has been out of action for nearly a year due to the cylinder and plunger arm becoming unscrewed from the pump proper and dropping to the bottom of the well, where it no doubt now is embeded in silt. It will need the services of a plumber or well driller to secure this part from this drilled hole and this repair should be made, as the school is now using water from a nearby creek which is dirty and unfit for use.\n\nThere are three holes in the bottom section of the fire-box of the coal furnacette in use at this school and this is a danger as live coals drop out and it is becoming more of a danger from fire all the time. This stove is built by the J. S. Stewart Mfg. Co., Woodstock, Ont. being a Hard Service Series, Good Cheer No. 520 model. A new part should be procured and installed as I believe these parts can be gotten separate and will take an experienced man to make the change of parts. Failing to be able to get parts it is possible the present part might be taken to a foundry and repaired.\nThe cost of the small repairs to the building should not exceed $12.00 for materials and labour. I am not able to give an estimate for the repairing of the pump or the stove as the cost of the pump will mainly be based on the time taken to get the lost part out of the well as a new cylinder could not be installed until the other is secured. The cost for the stove will depend on being able to procure the separate part.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nNovember 3, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo you may expend an amount not exceeding $18.00 for materials and labour in making small repairs at the Tyendinaga Western School.\n\nThe necessary repairs to the pump may also be made but it is expected that you will keep the cost of this as low as possible.\n\nYou may communicate with the J.S. Stewart Manufacturing Company, Woodstock, Ont., with a view to obtaining the new part that is necessary for the furnace.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A.D.

When this pump was broken nearly two years ago part of the pump dropped to the bottom of the drilled hole and through negligence the hole was never plugged with the results that children or other persons have thrown rocks and debris down the hole to within twelve feet of the surface, all of which could have been eliminated if a wooden plug had been driven in the top of the well casing. Mr. Gartley does not consider any well driller can clear out the old hole at any less expense than drilling a new one.\n\nAs the school is at the present time using water obtained from Mud Creek adjacent to the school which is far from ideal for use, it is recommended that a new well be drilled at as early a date as possible if funds are available from the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

D. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nAt the present time there are a total of twenty-four Indian children attending the Shannonville and Milltown public schools on whose account the department is paying tuition fees until the end of the present school term. Unless the Indian parents pay these fees themselves to continue to send their children to these white schools, they will of necessity have to attend Western Indian Day School and the desk accommodation at this school is far from satisfactory. If all Indian children attend there would be an enrollment of thirty-eight.\n\nThe present desks are the old double obsolete type and should be replaced with new single desks in various sizes to properly accommodate the pupils. The present desks are mainly small and cramp the children and are unsanitary when a school is crowded for seating accommodation.\n\nThe following single desks would be required to equip this school,\n\n| Quantity | Description                  |\n|----------|-----------------------------|\n| 4        | only single school desks size 1 |\n| 1        | rear for single desk         |\n| 7        | single school desks          |\n| 1        | rear for single desk         |\n| 1        | front                        |\n| 10       | single school desks          |\n| 2        | front for single desk        |\n| 1        | rear                         |\n| 11       | single school desks          |\n| 2        | fronts for single desk       |\n| 2        | rears                        |\n\nMr. Phelan on his visit to this agency last spring did visit this school and is familiar with the class-room situation.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This man lost his equipment through a fire and could not do this work and it made necessary the engagement of Mr. Chalk as there is no other well driller in this part of the country.\n\nTo properly protect the well and to save filtration of sand, which caused the trouble in the old well, it was necessary to drill and case a hole, forty ft. in depth. The cost of repairs and parts, to the old pump, were quite expensive although a good well has been secured and strict instructions have been given to the teacher and pupils, with regard to future care of this pump, so that there should not be a repetition of the neglect in not capping the well hole, which caused a new well to be drilled.\n\nA.

Moore, Indian Agent.\n\nADM/JL\nEnc.\nDeseronto, Ont.\nMarch 2nd, 1943.\n\nREPORT FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY, 1943.\n\nEDUCATION.\n\nDue to severe weather in the early part of the month and to thawing in the latter part, the roads of the reserve were blocked most of the month from either snow or water and the attendance of children from outlying parts of the reserve was poor. The local Indian Constable did make a trip concerning truants to two of the Agency schools. A new well for drinking water was drilled at the Western School, which had been urgently needed for some time. Due to unsatisfactory attention to his duties, Isaac Maracle was relieved of his caretaking at Mission School and Morris Maracle assumed these duties. Mrs. Gladys Maracle continues as teacher at the Mission School, although I am continuing to make inquiries for a suitable teacher as replacement at some future date.\n\nA.D.

If after this conversation you feel that she will be a satisfactory teacher for this school, please advise me immediately when an official letter will be sent to her.\n\nWith a First Class Certificate and two years' of experience, she would be entitled to a starting salary of $1620. an academic year.\n\nHer school for the past two years has been S.S.

During heavy snows the route will be much longer and may approximate 12 miles.\n\n4. That a tender be obtained from local taxi drivers in Deseronto for the transportation of these children. Please find attached a tender which Mr. Indian Superintendent Cassie has forwarded. In his covering letter he states as follows:\n\"Enclosed please find a tender to transport the children to Western School. This driver is quite reliable and do us a good job. He will use a 7 passenger Dodge car (3 seats). His price is figured for 10 - 14 children and does not seem unreasonable to me. Also if the teacher should reside in Deseronto, she would be able to ride with him by paying her way and this would cut our costs by that amount.\"\n\nWhile I did not meet Mr. Maracle during my visit, I am informed that he is a reliable Indian who has been in the taxi business for some years in Deseronto and whose taxis are used by white and Indians alike.\n\nI would like to discuss this contract with you when opportunity presents itself.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

It would be unfair to put her off until the next term when the beginning of October was promised to her, and she willing to accept provided salary be $400.00 dollars per annum.\n\nI regret to Mrs. McLaurin I wonder very much at such arrangements made by Dept. to retain Mrs. McLaurin's services temporarily, when Mrs. McLaurin herself is begging me now for nearly two years to accept her resignation and find another teacher. I thought then despondency was the cause and always temporized. But for the last few months she has good reasons have a small child to care and the\nand the separate Inspector directing me to find another teacher because the new responsibilities of Mrs. McLaurin had so increased that she could no more attend to her school properly. While I was corresponding with the School Inspector about Miss Cole, Mrs. McLaurin volunteered to teach yet during the month of September so as enjoy the whole benefit of her year's salary and that was granted to her; she also insisted upon her resignation with the end of the month of September and that she would teach no more after that date.\n\nNow a last word about Miss Halloran - Her trip up here is pleasant voyage by boat in summer time whereas in winter by train the journey becomes interminably long being obliged to travel so far as Fort-Quarre in the west or as far as Sudbury in the east before making her last transfer on the main C.B.R. line which passes at Port-William. If the Dept. be willing to pay these winter travelling expenses for Miss Halloran it would be unfair to ask her to wait three more months and then I am not sure she would accept this. - Waiting the last word of Dept. in this matter\n\nYour humble servant\n\nJ.

Brown our Indian Agent, that Miss S. Flood had been appointed to teach school at the Mountain Road of the Indian Reserve. He had notified me at two different times, on what authority I do not know, that Miss Flood would not be accepted as teacher this year. I was not surprised to hear that, because I was going myself to ask for the appointment of another one. Until now it had been the privilege of Indian missionaries to look for teachers that would likely be more convenient for their schools. For more than a month I had been corresponding with a young lady who had been teaching an Indian school at Pie River, and been teaching also in a Public school. As I required a recommendation from the Missionary who attends to that mission, but was away at that time, she only came last week with a very good recommendation, and I had promised her that I would recommend her for the Mountain Road School, as she wished to take night school training to obtain a school diploma for Ont.; she has a diploma for Quebec for primary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

For that reason we would appreciate it if you would try to secure a teacher for us. Our school was closed because of poor attendance two years ago. But I can assure you that the children will attend every day.\n\nYou mentioned paying a man to drive them to the Mountain Village School every day. This could be done during...\nThe worst weather but we have some families here who cannot afford to clothe their children to make the trip during the winter months. Besides the children at the Mountain Village can go to the Orphanage in Fort William and return every day without any trouble.\n\nThere are also two families with seven children who don't belong to the Band. This would bring the attendance at Mountain Village to about three or four.\n\nI am interested to see that the children of Squaw Bay get some schooling and some of them have none at all. We have talked over this matter and the parents will take it into their own\nhurds to see that the children go to school every day.\n\nHoping you will look into this matter as soon as possible I am\n\nYours Truly,\n\nFrank Pelletier\nChief.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of a letter received from Chief William Ross.\n\nHe moved close up the school at the Mountain Road and moved the school teacher to Mission Bay where the school teachers residence is large enough for school purposes. He said the lines (street railway) for the few Indian children from the Mountain Road the cost would only be $5 per day. They could attend a separate School in Westport a distance of two miles.\n\nIn previous years the attendance at Mission Bay has been very poor but as they now have so many more children than the Mountain Road it might be advisable to move the teacher to Mission Bay and close the Mountain Road School.\n\nMr. Dunham, the new teacher from the move to Mission Bay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.R. Brown\nAgent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA, October 8th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, enclosing a communication from the Chief of the Fort William Band requesting that the Mountain Road Indian Bay School be closed and a school at Mission Bay be opened, for the reason that the larger number of children now reside near the latter school.\n\nIn this connection I would point out that the school building at Mission Bay was destroyed by fire this summer, and, no doubt, it would be necessary to make extensive alterations in order to provide sufficient class room accommodation in the teacher's residence; also desks, blackboards, etc., which have to be supplied. The Department cannot approve of the reopening of a school in the teacher's residence at Mission Bay until full particulars are received as to the accommodation that could be provided, and the cost of fitting up the class room.\n\nThe Department would like to receive full particulars regarding the providing of educational facilities for the children at Mountain Road, if it was decided to close that school, so that they could attend a separate school in West Port providing street railway fares were paid. I may say that this arrangement does not require approval, as the Department does not consider it advisable to have children travelling to and fro each day on the street railway. Full particulars should be given before the Department can come to a decision regarding the request submitted by you.\n\nI beg to refer you to your letter of August 2nd, reporting the destruction by fire of the Mission Bay School and stating that you were taking up with the Insurance Company the matter of the collection of the insurance on the building, which amounted to $1,000. I have to request that you will state when payment of this insurance may be expected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. R. Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have yours of the 8th inst re closing the Mountain Road school and opening a school in the teachers residence at Mission Bay.\n\nThe alterations to the residence would cost probably $1000 and we have all the school furniture required as this was all saved when the building was burned.\n\nWhen a move is made to Mission Bay I should consider if advisable to close the Mountain Road School and do not consider it as far as the few Indian children that are there to go by street car to west Port William a distance of two (2) miles.\n\nThe teacher is however now almost settled for the winter and he is now not very anxious to make any change until spring unless it is considered advisable to make the change soon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.R.

Mr. Ludhomme, present teacher at the Mountain Road School, would not take the new school at less than $900.00 for the year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.R. Brown\nAgent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, April 19th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of recent date in which you recommend that the Mountain Road Indian Day School be closed at the end of the present school year, viz: June 30th, next, and that a school be opened in the teacher's residence at Mission Bay.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is considered the teacher's residence at Mission Bay would not be suitable for school purposes. If it were used as a classroom there would be no accommodation for a teacher. Besides, it is considered that it would be necessary to still conduct the school at Mountain Road to provide educational facilities for the children residing on that part of the Reserve. The Department recognizes the need of a school at Mission Bay, as Mr. Bennett, the Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Mountain Village school stated that there were 20 children at Mission Bay for whom school facilities should be provided.\n\nAt the present time we have no funds available for the erection of a new school building at Mission Bay and until such is available, the question of erecting a building and providing educational facilities at this point will have to remain in abeyance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. R. Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 4th inst I beg to inform you that the teacher would be satisfied if a picket fence was built in front of his residence. He claims that he can get this done for not over $20.00.\n\nI wrote you previously and recommend that this school be closed at the end of the current year as there are only three Indian children attending and I consider it a waste of public money to keep it open. The street runs past through the Indian Village and it would be no hardship if the few children there were sent to one of the Fort William schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6226, file 497-1, part 1)\nOttawa, May 19, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has decided to close the Mountain Village School at the end of the present quarter, namely, June 30th, next. In view of this decision it is not considered necessary to build a fence, place new floors in the building or supply screen doors.\n\nKindly advise the teacher of the Department's decision in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell F. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. R. Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Arthur,\nONT.\nFort William,\nOntario.\nOctober 14, 1922.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent-General,\nIndian Affairs,\nParliament Bldgs.,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe situation as to children of school age living at the Mountain Road Village on the Indian Reserve has come before me several times recently and I have become seized of the unfortunate position in which these children are situate.\n\nThere are at least ten children that should have some chance of attending school. Of this ten there are only three, according to the information which I have, who are definitely wards of your Department. The others are the children of Indian women married to white men or adopted Indian children from other Bands or other localities.\n\nThere is a school house with all the equipment lying idle and vacant. The only thing that seems to be required is a school teacher and I am told that one of the young Indian woman, the wife of one of the young Indians, is a school teacher who formerly taught school at Squaw Bay, and that arrangements could be made whereby she would conduct the school at a comparatively small salary.\n\nIt so happens that by reason of my position as Chairman of the Board of Park Management, and because in that capacity I have been actively engaged in the work of development of Chippewa Park, I have necessarily\nTHE DEPT.SUPT.-GEN.\n\n10-14-22.\n\nIn consequence become acquainted with the general situation in both of the Indian villages as we have been endeavouring to use wherever possible, Indian labor from both villages.\n\nIt is from the knowledge thus acquired and a certain amount of sympathy with the position in which these children are, that this letter is being written and I am writing in the first place to your Department in the hope that you will be able to furnish me information as to how far your Department would go towards paying the salary of this teacher. If you cannot give me that information my intention is to take it up with the Provincial Department of Education and see what they can do towards the salary of a teacher to the end that there might be worked out some plan by means of which the children in this village could have schooling.\n\nI will be very glad if you will let me have any information you can in connection with the matters discussed in this letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6226, file 497-1, part 1)\nOctober 18th, 1922.\n\nSir -\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the providing of educational facilities for the children of school age residing at Mountain Head Village.\n\nAs you may be aware, we conducted a school for a number of years on this Reserve, but in May, last, our Agent, Mr. W. R. Brown, Port Arthur, recommended that it be closed as there were only three Indian children attending. The school was, therefore, closed at the end of the last school year, viz: June 30th. We re-opened the school at Mission Bay on the 1st of September, last, and instructed our Agent to forward all school material, etc., from the Mountain Village school to Mission Bay, which we understand has been done.\n\nIn view of the recommendation received for the closing of the Mountain Village school on the ground that there were only three Indian children attending, I do not consider that we would be warranted in undertaking the expense of having the school re-opened or providing a grant towards the salary of a teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nWm. A. Dowler, Esq., K.C.,\nBarrister, Etc.,\nFort William, Ont.\nFort William,\nOntario\nOctober 20, 1922.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your favor of the 16th inst., and have carefully noted contents.\n\nThe fact, does, however, stand out that there are three Indian children who cannot possibly receive any Education of any kind unless there is some schooling provided at the Mountain Road Village. The total number of children who are in this position, according to the information I have, are ten or eleven.\n\nIf for the purpose of providing schooling for these ten or eleven children an arrangement could be made by means of which the teacher could be provided at say $300.00, and I could succeed in getting an appropriation from the Province of $100.00, from the City of $100.00 and from the Department of $100.00, this would cover the item.\n\nUnder these circumstances would it not be worth while still considering the possibility of making such a Grant? I would be very glad to hear further from you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nWAD/McK.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6226, file 497-1, part 1)\nOctober 25th, 1922.\n\nSir -\n\nI have yours of the 20th instant, with further reference to the provision of educational facilities for Indian and other children of school age residing at the Mountain Road Village. I note your recommendation that this Department cooperate with the Provincial and Municipal authorities in this connection.\n\nIn reply I wish to state that the Department of Indian Affairs will permit of the use of the school building on the Reserve, will pay its share of the school equipment and furnishings required and will make a grant of $100 towards the salary of a properly qualified teacher. Mr. W. R. Brown, our Agent at Fort Arthur, is being informed of this decision, and you would do well to communicate with him regarding the opening of the school, if it is found possible to secure the assistance of the City and Province.\n\nI believe that a school board should be appointed and the cause should be known as a combined one. Our share of the teacher's salary and other expenses would be paid through Mr. Agent Brown.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. A. Dowler, Esq., K.C.,\nBarrister, Etc.,\nFort William, Ont.\nOttawa, Oct. 26, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose herewith copy of official letter to W. A.

We have been advised, however, that some interested parties are anxious to secure school facilities for the few Indian and half-breed children residing at that point, and that they are trying to arrange with the Provincial Department of Education and the School Board of the City of Fort William to provide the necessary funds to pay the salary of a teacher and other expenses. This Department has agreed to provide the sum of $100 as its share of salary and expenses.\n\nWe are informed that the total salary that would be paid a teacher for the few children who would attend would be approximately $300 per annum. If the school is re-opened, it will be under the control of the Provincial Department of Education, and this Department will be responsible for the payment of the amount mentioned above only. You will, therefore, see that nothing would be gained by a transfer, and we hope that you will remain as teacher at the Mission Bay School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D.

A. Dowler, Esq., K.

Full information regarding what has been done in this matter should be stated by you. An early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. R. Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Arthur, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 7th inst., I beg to advise that I have heard nothing officially re opening of this school but Councillor Mr. C. of the Indian Band addressed the City Council about the need of opening this school. However, I do not think he made much headway. The City Clerk has just told me that the city would sooner pay car fare for the children to come to one of their schools at sweat fort than to spend money on opening a school where the maximum attendance would not be more than ten and the average attendance would likely be not over five.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.R.

I find that if you keep the school open for every school day during the present quarter and send in returns at the end of June, next, we will be able to pay you the balance due to complete your full year's salary.\n\nThe bonus is paid monthly and, as you only began duties at this school on the 15th of September, the Department will be unable to pay you the balance of the bonus for that month. In other words, from the date you commenced duties until the close of the present quarter, you will receive 9\u00bd months' bonus.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS. A.

You should fill in the columns showing the number on hand, the date of last receipt and the number required, but not the last column.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nMrs. A.

I estimate the cost of material at $20.00 and recommend that Gyrette's tender be accepted.\n\nIf the Department chooses to authorize the work it would be advisable to do so at an early date, as the School will re-open about Sept. 1st next.\n\nYours truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nActg.

In reply I beg to say that you are hereby authorized to have this work done by Ambrose Gyrette. You may supply him with the necessary material and you will be good enough to see that the work is expeditiously done. In a letter of the 13th instant you were asked to give the sizes of the black board and the desks. You have omitted to furnish this information. The Department does not consider it advisable to make black boards as they never give proper satisfaction. If you will give the exact size of the board, one of hyloplate will be ordered. In regard to the desks, if you will send in a diagram of the school room showing the position they should be placed in, the Department can then order them and it will not be necessary for you to give the sizes.\n\nIf Gyrette is a reliable man, it is thought that the better way is to pay him by the day at a fair rate.
