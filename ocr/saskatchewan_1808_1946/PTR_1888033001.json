Canon Flatt, D.D.G.M., at the northern of Kinloch Lodge, A.F.A., M.M., at Allens Church, and published at the request of the members present.\n\nThe sermon's text was taken from I Peter ii, chapter 50 verses. \"Ye also, as lively stones, build yourselves up an house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.\"\n\nIt has been our custom, brothers, at this season of the year, to take a moment's glance at the condition of our temporal affairs, and to reflect upon the progress made by Prince Albert and his government in the advancement of the country.\n\nThe town certainly compares most favorably with many of the towns in Canada, and even with some of the villages of the United States. A good house has been built, and the town is now filled with commercial and agricultural produce. The future promises well, and we may look forward to prosperity for the future. The line of coal and iron will be completed, and the line of railway. I speak from personal knowledge, and I believe that within a few weeks thousands of tons of coal will be transported in the Territorial, with whom we have a close connection.\n\nWhen the character of this section of the country is considered, it is evident that there will be rapid and extensive settlement. The town of New York is in regard to the future of the Eastern and Western Territories of Canada. The pioneer in speaking of the western territories is often met with a great expression to ideas that have been already formed and brought into being by those who have been engaged in the same work. We can apply only our own experience to the future of the Eastern and Western Territories of Canada. And while we are engaged in watching the mighty sweep of the map held out before us, we must not forget the strength, while the reverse of the westward movement is going on around us, and you by them are enabled to build your stable kingdom and to dwell in peace and prosperity for all time to come.\n\nThe impossible barrier of the Atlantic Ocean is broken down, and the way is open for the advance of the Eastern and Western Territories of Canada. The west is illimitable. States and provinces are being added to the Union, and back to those who are now taking possession of the new lands. The American continent is thus still more extended, and the advance of commerce and industry is still more rapid than ever before. The east will be compelled to surrender its supremacy, and the west will be called upon to take its place.\n\nWe must be prepared for the coming of the new era, and we must be ready to meet the challenges of the future. The west is the land of opportunity, and we must be prepared to take advantage of the opportunities that will come our way.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT BREWERY.\n\nDelivered to all Parts of the Town.\n\nAMBER--Hop--ALE.\n\nPure and Sparkling.\n\nBETTS & Gwynne.\n\nR.C.W. & Co.\n\nClearing Sale!\n\nWe beg to notify the people of Prince Albert and vicinity that we have decided to dispose of our entire Stock of Ready Made Clothing, Dry Goods, Groceries, Glassware and Crockery.\n\nAt prices which cannot fail to satisfy intending purchasers.\n\nAll parties indebted to us will please settle at once as our books are closed.\n\nR.C.
