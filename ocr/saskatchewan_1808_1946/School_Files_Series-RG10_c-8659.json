The home is not a healthy home. They lost one child from T.B. this winter. The father is now himself in poor condition. And so the parents are anxious to get this girl in the school for a couple of years, both to get a bit of training and be cared for physically. The Doctor too is anxious to get her out of her home where she is so liable to infection. Before letting her into the School however he X-rayed her chest to make sure there was no disease.\n\nI hope the Department will consider her case and allow her to have a couple of years in the School.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Under these circumstances favourable consideration cannot be given to admitting Mary Jane Albert to the Norway House School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. P.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nNorway House Indian Residential School\n\nREV. R. T. CHAPIN, B.A.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nNorway House, Man.\nJuly 6, 1940\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of Feb 26th before me. I thank you for your letter and appreciate the situation as you explain it. The mentioned pupils are leaving the school this summer.\n\nMay I put before you our views concerning our children. Re. the boys, we feel that for the most part it is best for them to get out with their parents after 16 years of age. But there are always a few who wish to continue their school work and whose parents wish that they remain if possible. We feel that these boys benefit by the extra time and training in responsibility, for the school really needs three or four older boys to help with the more responsible work. This year there are four such boys now 16 years of age whose parents wish to continue another year in school.\n\nAs to the girls we feel that in this locality it is to their benefit to remain a year or two in school after 16. There are usually a few...\nOpenings in hospital work or domestic service for responsible girls. At 16 years the girls are hardly ready for such positions. If they go back to their reserves at 16 the likelihood is that their people will soon arrange a marriage for them. For this also we feel the girls are better prepared if they can have another year or two in the school. So we are glad when the parents so wish and the Dept. is willing to keep some of these girls on. We feel it is more beneficial for the girl to have this time even if a young applicant has to wait another year for her admission. This year some of the parents wish their girl home but some would like them to remain if possible. Two parents from Cross Lake I have not been able to see yet but would like permission for the girls to remain if they so wish.\n\nThe following then are the children for whom I would ask permission to remain another year:\n\nJacob Wm York\nRobert Crate\nTommy Anderson\nLazarus Dee V\n\nLena Perch\nPriscilla McKay\nChristina Beandy\nMatilda Moon\n\nYours truly,\n\nP.T. Chapin\n\n(I am writing this from Winnipeg and have not the children's numbers with me)\nOttawa, July 15, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant, the Department approves the following pupils remaining in the Norway House Residential School for another year:\n\nJacob Wm. York, Lena Perch,\nRobert Crate, Priscilla McKay,\nTommy Anderson, Christina Beardy,\nLazarus Bee, Matilda Moor.\n\nIf you wish them to remain after June 30, 1941, it will be necessary for you to make another application. It is presumed that the four pupils mentioned in my letter of February 26, last, are being discharged this year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend R. T.

The above child however was adopted a year or two ago, by the uncle and aunt of the mother namely, Johnnie Budd, No; 567 Norway House Band, and his wife. The child's annuity is paid under the ticket of Johnnie Budd, No; 567 Norway House Band.\n\nWith regard to the applications of Henry Chubb and Betsy Hart of Oxford House Band, it will be noted that these have been made out on foolscap, with the Physical Examination Certificate attached. These applications were signed at Oxford House Reserve where there were no forms available at the time, and it is hoped that these will be acceptable.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G.

Both are bright students.\n\nThe father's request is that the girls might be permitted to remain as pupils of the school until they reach the age of 16, and I would recommend favourable consideration of his request by the Department.\n\nThe father, Donald Bradburn, I may say, is operating a trading store at Oxford House.\n\nWill you kindly advise me what decision the Department arrives at in the above matter.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G.

N. C. Roberts,\nClerk in Charge Indian Agency Office,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Children of Albert Richard\nNo. 448 Cross Lake Band.\n\nDuring Treaty payments at Cross Lake this year I was approached by Mr. A. E. Caldwell, Principal of the Norway House United Church Indian Residential School who requested a ruling in connection with the above noted.\n\nMr. Caldwell gave me a statement signed by Albert and Sarah Richard - copy of which is attached - and explained he had received an application from these people to have their sons William and Walter who are now pupils in the Cross Lake Roman Catholic Indian Residential School admitted to the Norway House United Church Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Principal of the Norway House School refused to accept applications for admittance of these children until a ruling from the Department was received.\n\nRichard Albert states he has always been a Protestant. He married a Roman Catholic woman but he informed me she changed Faith and was accepted into the United Church at Cross Lake in 1933.\n\nIn 1936 the oldest child, Katie, now aged 12, was admitted to the Norway House School.\n\nIn 1940, William, now aged 11, was baptised into the Roman Catholic Church and admitted to the Cross Lake School, January 27th of that year.\n\nOn October 3rd, 1940, Walter, now aged 8, was admitted to the Cross Lake School.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nThe father now wishes to remove his two sons from the Cross Lake School and place them in the Norway House School.\n\nWill you kindly advise what action should be taken in this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC. Roberts,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nSTATEMENT OF ALBERT RICHARD, TREATY INDIAN, CROSS LAKE BAND,\nTaken This 11th Day of August, 1941.\n\nI am, and always have been, Protestant, a member of the United Church of Canada. My wife was Catholic but was received into membership of the United Church of Canada in 1933. My wife and have six children, three being of school age. In August, 1938, I placed one child (my oldest) in the Norway House Residential School. In 1940, I placed two children in the Cross Lake Roman Catholic School, having been sent for by the Principal and requested so to do at the Catholic School.\n\nIt is the wish of myself and my wife that our children should be raised in the Protestant Faith and attend a Protestant school. I hereby voluntarily make the request that my children, at present in the Cross Lake Roman Catholic School, be transferred immediately to the Norway House Residential School.\n\nNo inducement has been offered and no influence brought to bear by anyone connected with the Norway House Residential School or with the United Church of Canada to require me to make this request.\n\nDated at Cross Lake Indian Reserve this 11th day of August 1941.\n\nSigned: (Albert Richard)\n(Sarah Richard)\n\nWitnessed: (F.

John McDougall in reference to some extra land in connection with the Mission at that point.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that no agreement such as the one to which you refer is to be found on the school files and the Department is of opinion that none was forwarded.\n\nThe Department has under consideration the erection of a new boarding school at Norway House next year and would esteem it a favour if you would take into consideration, while in the locality, the matter of a site. In looking into this matter you should consult with the Principal of the school and the Indian Agent.\n\nThe site for the school must be on Government property and should be high and dry and easily drained and an efficient water supply should be available. In connection with institutions of this kind it is desirable to have a goodly portion of land which can be cultivated for gardening purposes and if at all possible for the conducting of farming operations on a small scale.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. K. McLean, Esq.,\nNorway House, Keewatin.\n\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report on the Treaty trip for the year 1910 in the Norway House Agency as follows.\n\nThey agreed unanimously to the proposed surrender of part of the reserve and also they agreed to give the use of 40 acres of land on the point at Roseville Village for the use of a Boarding School if a new one should be built. Mr. J.K. McLean D.L.S. was present at the Council.

Will later send a plan and fuller report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. W. Maclean\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6270, file 581-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nIn accordance with instructions I beg to enclose a sketch showing site for a proposed new Boarding School at Norway House Indian Reserve.\n\nI consulted both the Principal of the School and the Indian Agent and went over the ground with them separately and can assure you that this is the best site on the Reserve.\n\nIt is high and dry, well above the lake, can be easily drained, and is away from the main trail of the Reserve and public portions, at the same time being conveniently situated. The drain will probably have to be cut through rock but the distance to be blasted is short and of no great depth.\n\nA dock with a good depth of water and a convenient place for storehouse can be cheaply built.\n\nA sufficient area for playground will also be about the school while with the old grounds and the proposed extension all the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6270, file 581-9, part 1)\nall the land required for garden or farming purposes is available.\n\nI may say that land suitable for cultivation is yearly becoming a matter of more concern with the Indians. They may not use much of it at present but do not care to part with it, as they see that before long it will be of value to them. The amount of land on the reserve suitable for cultivation is very limited.\n\nWhile the whole of the 40 acres promised is not good, a large proportion probably will be suitable for cultivation when cleared. At present except the proposed site it is covered with small spruce and scrub.\n\nI counted 85 Indians present at the meeting when the matter was discussed and the land promised and only 5 voted against the proposal. These were men or those influenced by men whose so-called improvements were affected. I think only two are really touched.\n\nA promise was given that where any improvements were taken the owner would be recompensed. It might possibly be necessary to take this small house near the...\nnear the school site to fully complete the grounds and remove what might be undesirable neighbors, but this is a matter for future consideration.\n\nThe proposed South limit of the extension east of the old grounds is moveable as it may infringe on the improvements of our Balfour an Indian which will consist only of some fences.\n\nIt was promised that his house and garden would remain undisturbed.\n\nAs the South limit is moved North the East limit will be moved East so as to include 40 acres. All the grounds, gardens, buildings etc. of the present School are included in the land promised.\n\nI might say that the 85 Indians present at the meeting would contrast favorably in physique, dress and intelligence with an assembly of an equal number of white men taken from an average village, and were the finest body of Indians I have ever seen together.\n\nThe Chief William Craig is a very intelligent man, reads, writes and speaks English.\nEnglish and takes an active part in promoting the welfare of his people. Agent Calvert has a great deal of influence with them and they pay great attention to what he says. This is one of the few reserves where I have not heard anything said against the Agent especially by the young men.\n\nThe old school is in a bad condition. I went over it in company with Agent Calvertly on the 11th August and nearly three inches of water was then standing in the cellar. This has been caused by dampness. It looks as if it would be almost impossible to heat it. The partitions are open from the basement to the top of the building and is open at the eaves.\n\nThere is a continual draft between the walls and were a fire to start the whole thing would be in flames in a few minutes. As the windows in the sleeping dormitories are barred I do not see how the children could be saved. The danger is fresh as no less than 18 stories are in use in different parts of the building, which is necessary to have the windows barred as owing to the position of the building.\nCare has to be taken to watch the inmates or patients.\n\nIn passing I may state that all the department buildings at this Agency are in a bad state. The plastering in the Agent's house is in a very bad state especially for a Government building. It is all cracked, a great deal is loose and large patches are off. The Hudson's Bay Co. people tell me it is a mistake to plaster buildings as with the dry cold, poor wind exposure, it always cracks and becomes loose in a few years, and that the only satisfactory way is to use lumber for walls and ceilings.\n\nA storehouse is required as what was used as one is now the nurses quarters between the two tents used for hospital purposes. If the Department see fit to continue and build an hospital there would be sufficient room on the proposed new school site or on the old grounds. Tent Hospitals do not seem suitable for winter patients except consumptives.\n\nThe question of fuel at this point is also rapidly becoming a serious question. There is not a large amount on the Reserve and what...\nand what there is will have to be concerned.\n\nFuel can now be got off Dominion Land,\nbut with the extension of the Reserve a\ncertain amount of this has been cut off,\nand in the future will have to be brought\na considerable distance.\n\nWhile not personally greatly in favour\nof Boarding Schools if there is any possibility\nof getting the children to attend Day Schools\nor a School where they are not entirely\nseparated from the home, I may say that\na Boarding School seems to me the\nonly kind that is suitable for this particular\ndistrict. Even on the Reserve living as\nthe Indians do, scattered over the whole\nReserve on each side of the Lake it is\nimpossible to have many of them attend.\nIn summer boats are not always\navailable or if so the fishing interferes\nalso the chances of a heavy sea setting up\nat any time prevents children from coming.\nIn winter they cannot come without being\naccompanied by some older person.\n\nThis being a central point to which\nmany Indians from the outside, North and East\ncome during the summer a new complete\nand up-to-date school seems to be a\nnecessity.\nI omitted to mention that the road to the cemetery as well as the winter trail to Oxford House across the 40 acres will be required to be kept open. This is a mere matter of gates or fencing and will not interfere with the value of the land for garden or farm purposes.\n\nIn the above letter I have confined myself to what I saw personally and may have expressed opinions on matters outside my instructions relative to a school site but have done so with the best of intentions and to point out that something should be done at Norway House.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn Allan\nSecretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs.

He is willing to accept Thirty-five Dollars as compensation for the stable and fence.\n\nAlec Neckaway's residence is situated on the surrendered part of his lot.

McLean Esq.,\nSecretary and Assistant Deputy,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONTARIO.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn company with Inspector J. R. Bunn, from offices of your Department in Winnipeg, I arrived at the Norway House Indian Agency on the evening of September 6th, the trip having been arranged by instructions from your Department for the purpose of choosing a location for the new Methodist Indian Boarding School, it having been reported that a better location than the one selected by Rev. Lousley, some months previous, was readily available and that although there had been some work done under the charge of Mr. Lousley, in the way of excavation on the site selected by him, the value of that work was evidently not considered by Rev. T Ferrier, the Superintendent of Methodist Missions, to be sufficient to settle the location on a site which, on examination, Mr. Ferrier could not entirely approve of. The views of Mr. Ferrier on this matter were stated by him in a letter to me dated August 15th 1913, and of which you have informed me a copy was sent to your Department by Mr. Ferrier.\n\nIt was not possible for Mr. Bunn and myself to attend to the business for which we made this lengthy trip and leave on the return run of the steamer from Warren's Landing to Selkirk, so we had about four days time for investigating the various matters in which we believed that our opinions would be quite acceptable to your Department and in the interests of the Public Service. Mr. Bunn had with him a blue print copy of a survey plan made by Surveyor McLean, dated August 10th 1913, and with the aid of it I had a drawing prepared of which a copy is enclosed, that will, I believe, be found to be of use in reference.\n\nAfter deciding to abandon the site where excavation had been done under the auspices of the Methodist Mission, we examined other possible locations and decided on that which is indicated by the plan herewith. Four test holes were dug to a depth of five feet below the ground surface at the new location, down through clay without meeting any of the granite rock, which is so often encountered in other places near by, both at the surface and close to the surface. The lower foot of excavation in the test holes showed a hard clay, that in my opinion, has a bearing capacity of two tons per square foot, which is more than ample for the purpose of this building. The lower clay was found to be of the same nature in all of the holes.\n\nIn answer to my inquiry as to the nature of the site for the Methodist Boarding School at Norway House, I am pleased to inform you that the soil is suitable for the purpose intended.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6270, file 581-9, part 1)\nWINNIPEG, MAN. October 4th 1913.\n\nJ. D. McLean Esqre #2\n\nHouse, I was informed in a letter dated November 8th 1912 that the site \"is described as high and dry\". I now know that such description cannot be relied upon for anything but the ground surface and I have to regret that we did not provide in the specifications for putting weeping drains at the footings of exterior walls for such drains are surely a requisite to all buildings of a permanent character in this district where the basements are to be adapted for usage. More will be said in this connection when describing the conditions found at the Indian Agents dwelling.\n\nUnder the assumption that the Boarding School would be erected on the site selected by Mr. Lousley we were informed that water could be obtained from the Lake, some seventy yards from the building, and we were further informed that a drainage outlet could be had within a comparatively short distance from the building. With the new location neither of these conditions exist, as will be seen by reference to the plan here-with. I feel free to state that we would make a great mistake if the water supply for our building were obtained from the source named in the specifications, for from my observations of the conditions prevailing on September 8th, I can inform you, that the water from that source would be unsuitable for drinking purposes especially at times of low water in the Lake.\n\nThe new location of the Boarding School, and other conditions affecting the district require that a well be sunk for procuring a supply of good water and that a system of drainage be provided of much greater extent than we had been advised would suit the conditions of the site that had been abandoned. I requested Mr. Jno. Little, who is a very practical man, in charge of the construction of the buildings for which Messrs. Snyder Bros. have the contracts, to make investigations in regard to the possibilities of obtaining water by means of sinking a well. When Little tells me of his findings I may, at some future time, suggest to you a method of supplying water not only to the boarding School, but to the Hospital and possibly other buildings.\n\nInspector Bunn, will surely report to you of our examination of the dwelling occupied by Agent Stewart but as I do not know what Mr. Bunn may say, I would inform you that the condition of the dwelling is deplorable and that in my opinion the root of the trouble lies in the Basement and foundation walls, which on account of bad drainage conditions have been very much damaged by the action of frost through past winters. Owing to the\nGranite rock underlying this district, surface water gathers in places which may not be determined from superficial observation, and unless such accumulations be carried away by drainage, the water will remain and in the cold periods when frost extends fully five feet below the ground surface, a foundation, especially if it is of masonry construction will suffer much damage.\n\nThe Boarding School and Hospital Buildings at Norway House will be, without doubt, the most important erections within a radius of several hundreds of miles and inasmuch as the district is more primeval and the requirements of drainage have not been investigated or properly recorded by others before us we had either to anticipate contingencies that might have proven to be non-existent, or to act as we have on the meagre information given to us when drawing up the specifications. On account of what was discovered at the dwelling of the Indian Agent, I directed that weeping drains be put to the foundations of both the Boarding School and Hospital and I hope that the drainage pipes may be delivered at the site so that they may be put in place before the Contractors stop their operations for this season.\n\nOn the plan herewith we have indicated a location for a main drain from the Boarding School to the Nelson River or its enlargement named Little Playgreen Lake, also a branch from this drain to connect to the Hospital Building. The costs for putting down of these drains together with the weeping drains at both of the new buildings are matters that will have to be taken up in due course with the contractors, whose representative, Mr. Little, has no doubt by this time become acquainted with the nature of the excavation which will have to be done for laying the main drain to the river as stated.\n\nIf you should desire my opinion on matters relating to the Hospital or matters specially appertaining to the Agency buildings I may give such opinion upon request, for as intimated herein I did not confine my observations to the Boarding School proposition alone.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6270, file 581-9, part 1)\nOttawa, October 17, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to forward at your earliest convenience your report on the examination and selection you made of the site for the proposed new Norway House Boarding School in company with Mr. Matthews, Architect, Public Works Department, Winnipeg.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nJ. R. Bunn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES\nLAKE WINNIPEG INSPECTORATE\n\nWINNIPEG, MAN., 23rd October, 1913.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter Number 168918/1,\ndated 17th October, 1913, in reply I beg to offer the following\nas a report of the work done in connection with the examination\nand selection of the site for the proposed New Boarding School\nBuilding at Norway House. I received from the Department a\nblue print plan showing the area within which the proposed site\nwould have to be chosen and which was carefully consulted by\nMr. Matthews and myself when we were doing this work.\n\nI left Winnipeg for Selkirk at 1.30 P.M. on the 4th September. Mr. Matthews took the same car, we arrived in Selkirk in\ndue course to take steamer for Warren's Landing, the steamer\narrived at that point at 8.45 A.M. on the 5th, from this point\nwe proceeded to Norway House by Gasoline Launch and arrived\nthere at 4.20 P.M. the same day.\n\nWithout any delay and the weather conditions being favorable, Mr. Matthews, Mr. Lousley and myself took up the work of\nmaking a selection of a suitable site. Mr. Matthews was the directing spirit in doing this, and as he was an entire stranger on the\nground, he desired to see all the possible available sites first.\n\nSELECTION OF SITE.\n\nThe first site looked over was that chosen at some previous time and on which an excavation and some other work\nhad been done under the charge of Mr. Lousley, Mr. Matthews and the party I have mentioned, examined the site thoroughly. Then other grounds were looked over, the site of the old school was visited, this was examined and enquiries made with reference to it. Then a site located, in what was used as a potato field and vegetable garden was examined, this site at once created a favorable impression on Mr. Matthews and myself, and so far as we could see presented natural conditions that easily made it a very desirable location on which to erect a New School Building. However, it was decided that we would take more time to arrive at a decision, so on the following day (the 7th) Mr. Matthews and I went over all the grounds again, we visited all the sites that were thought to be possibilities, and we were more fully convinced that our opinion about the site in the Potato field was right, it was decided to test the new location in the Potato field; the tests made were performed under the direction of Mr. Matthews. Test pits were sunk to prove the grounds, the result was very satisfactory, these tests and results definitely convinced us it would be wise to abandon the site on which work had been done, as from the examinations we had been making, we were fully satisfied that we had located a much better one. The selection of the new site on which the New School Building will be located at Norway House, opens up new problems as to water supply, drainage and sewerage, proper consideration was given to these in making the selection, and in this connection I beg to offer the following.\n\nWATER SUPPLY.\n\nA supply of water from the lake is one that is open to very serious objections, looking to sanitary conditions, the Lake as a source of water supply is too doubtful as to the quality of the water. At certain seasons and under certain conditions the Lake is not a safe source. On the new site the water should be from a well, this source of water\nsupply would be safest and best. The Contractor has obtained a liberal quantity of water and of good quality, by sinking to a depth of 11 to 12 feet.\n\nDRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE.\n\nThe question of drainage is one that I think will be evidently readily and satisfactorily adjusted, the Contractor has proved this. He opened up a surface drain to carry off any surface water that might accumulate and interfere with his foundation excavation operations, this resulted in a satisfactory manner. This drain can be continued and sunk to a proper depth and extended to the Lake very easily, as there is no apparent interruption by rock.

Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 25th ultimo I beg to say that a copy of the same has been sent to the Rev. T.

Lousley,\nPrincipal,\nNorway House Boarding School,\nNorway House, Man.\nOttawa, 14th July 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer you to letter of the 10th May last and to request you to be good enough to forward a plan showing approximately the limits of the lands to be used for the purpose of the school and the consent of the Indian Council to the effect that the lands may be so used.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.G. Stewart Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nAast. Deputy and Secretary.\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nMy Dear Mr. Scott:\n\nIn dealing with Mr. Lousley's reply to your letter of April 24th re the deficiency in the management in the Norway House Boarding School with respect to the training of boys, I have discussed this matter with Mr. Lousley and think that he was under some misapprehension as to the information that prompted you to write him. I think that the correspondence will lead to more practical results in the training of the boys that is suggested and the object you had in view will not be lost sight of.\n\nThere are a couple of lots owned by the Indians, one by Mr. Moody of Nelson House. These 2 lots are in such close proximity to the new building that, in order to fence it in any kind of a decent way, they should be secured by the Department, and I think they could be by paying a small sum of money for their individual right to same. Both are without buildings. Mr. Lousley fenced one of them some few years ago and was using it for a garden, but some of the Indians made such a fuss about it that he gave up the use of this lot. These 2 lots could be used immediately for growing garden stuff and ought to be secured for school purposes. The school building is situated so close to them that to run a fence along the line of what is looked upon as the school property, gives the place a very absurd appearance. If you could have these lots secured for the school grounds, it would be a very great advantage to the appearance and also for a play-ground and garden purposes.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, has written the Department to say that there are a couple of lots owned by Indians, one by a Mr. Moody of Nelson House, which are in close proximity to the new building, and that they should be secured by the Department to round off the school property. He is of the opinion that these lots could be secured for a small sum as they are without buildings.\n\nThe Department would like you to ascertain for what amount these lots could be purchased. The Department would like to have this information soon as possible, so that it may be in a position to acquire the land.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. STEWART\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ.

K. McLean was informed that the Department had under consideration a new school at Norway House and would like him to consult with the principal of the school and Indian agent with reference to the selection of a suitable site. Mr. McLean made a selection as shown on a plan which accompanied his report. His report states \"it was high and dry, well above the lake, easily drained and away from the main trail of the reserve and public portions, at the same time being conveniently situated. The drain would probably have to be cut through rock but the distance to be blasted is short and of no great depth. Water can be obtained from the lake where it will not be contaminated by the drainage from the buildings.\" The Indians agreed to give 40 acres for the use of the school. The old school was burnt down in February, 1913, and the Department decided to re-build. Mr. Matthews prepared the plans and Mr. Ferrier suggested that Mr.\nMatthews be sent up to Norway House to decide the exact site that the building should be put on. Mr. Ferrier forwarded a copy of a letter addressed by him to Mr. Matthews, the architect for the new building and wired Mr. Matthews to visit Norway House and select site as suggested by Mr. Ferrier. Mr. Matthews accompanied by Inspector Bunn went to Norway House in September, 1913, and then selected the site for the new building. Mr. Bunn's report is turned out herewith. This selection was approved by the Department. It is not the same site chosen by Mr. McLean but is only a short distance from the site of the old building. It is shown on a blue print by Mr. Matthews.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

At the time this site was suggested it was stated by the late J.K.McLean that Mr.Balfour would lose some fencing and that if so this would be paid for. If other improvements were affected it was stated that the line marking the proposed South limit of the new grounds might be moved in a Northerly direction and that the proposed East limit should be extended a little farther East so as to give the same area of forty acres. Was this not done? If not, can it not yet be done? Are the grounds as laid out similar to those shown on the plan? If so, please measure and give distances on the ground along the old school lot fence from the South limit of the old school lot to the South limit of the new school lot near Mr.Balfour's house, as marked in red on the accompanying blue print. If the proposed South limit is to be moved farther North, how much farther North will it have to be moved in order to clear the improvements mentioned in your letter?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.Jones Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nAast.

The grounds have been laid out according to plan shown, and I have measured the distance along the ground along the old school line fence from the South limit of the old school lot to the South limit of the new school lot. The distance is 105 ft as shown on the accompanying sketch. I am also showing the sketch the position of Thomas Balfour's house, stable and fencing, in regard to the new school fence. To have built the new school fence so as to have avoided the Northern limits of Thomas Balfour's fence would have deprived the school of a long strip of good cultivatable land, while the eastern limit of the new school fence is on land, rocky and useless for agricultural purposes. So in view of this I built the fence according to plan supplied. In doing this Thos Balfour's fence and stable are included in the new school lot. He should therefore have compensation for these improvements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, 7th September 1916\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo and accompanying sketch showing the improvements of Thomas Balfour on the lands surrendered for school purposes in the Indian Reserve at Norway House. It is noted that Balfour's improvements are valued at $35.00.\n\nIn your letter of the 27th May last you stated that Alec Neckaway's residence is situated on the surrendered part of his lot and that his house is valued at $200.00. Kindly forward a sketch showing the position of Mr. Neckaway's house with regard to the boundary of the school lot. Has the house for which he is seeking compensation been built since the surrender took place in 1910? Would it not be better to fence around his house leaving it outside the school lot?\n\nYou have also mentioned that a part of Elijah Houle's lot is included in the surrender. Is he in your opinion entitled to any compensation for improvements? In each case you should make a valuation of the improvements and state in a letter the several items for which compensation is to be paid and certify that the amounts asked for are fair and just.\n\nIn the sketch requested above you should also show the location of Elijah Houle's lot.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Enquiry is made in this connection, and it would seem advisable that this Department should be in a position to consider Mr. Saunders' claim for the exact lands set out in his declaration.\n\nUpon receipt of your reply hereto it is proposed to submit a memorandum to council recommending that Hope Island, less the land which it may be decided to except in connection with Mr. Saunders' claim, be reserved for hay, wood and agricultural purposes and placed under the control of the Department of Indian Affairs during pleasure for the use of the said Indian Boarding School at Norway House.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN.O.

Such a lease, which will have to be authorized by the Governor General in Council, will only be for a short term, and for the purposes of a school farm only, and will be terminated after due notice has been given, if the land is required for any other purpose.\n\nIn this connection I may say that no further action can be taken until the survey of the Island has been made. Mr. W.J. Deans, D.L.S., was instructed by telegram, recently, to make the necessary survey, but it is somewhat doubtful if the instructions will reach him before he closes his operations for the season.

Denyes, the Principal of the Indian Boarding School at the Rossville Mission, to secure the above mentioned island. It was decided that a lease of the island for a short term and for the purposes of the School Farm only, might be granted to the Reverend Mr. Denyes. Thereupon, instructions were issued for the survey of the island, but it is feared these instructions may not reach the Surveyor before he closes his operations for the season.\n\nA copy of my letter of my letter of the 19th ultimo to the Rev. Mr. Denyes, advising him of the decision, is sent to you herewith.\n\nI understand that the Island referred to in your letter is probably the same as that applied for by the Rev.

George E. Denyes I have to say that the decision to make it terminable at any time that the land is required for some other purpose, after giving due notice, does not appear to be satisfactory.

I may say that the affair is of no personal interest to me except as it affects the interests of our school and the people to whom I am devoting my time and efforts. If the Indian Department and your own will make some arrangement for the transfer of the land to be used, as in many other cases, for the benefit of the school, it will work the purpose I had expected when writing you. I wrote soon after I had taken charge here, as I felt that something should be done. It is very expensive getting feet and provisions up here, and the cost in many cases is doubled. There is some land which could be cleared and used for hay and vegetables but the Indians and half breeds will never go to the expense and trouble unless they have seen someone else getting results.\n\nI trust that the lease will be granted for a long term of years in order to justify us going to the expense of clearing and improving as will be necessary before it is of much use to us.\n\nThere is much muskeg and rock, but there is some land that with considerable expense can, I think, be made into good hay meadows. I think your Department, and also the Indian Department, would be glad to have some move made along this line, in connection with this work, and especially in this district.\n\nThere is a half breed living on a peninsula of the island, connected with the island by a neck of muskeg.

(RG 10, Volume 6270, file 581-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter No168918-1A before me and the sketch you sent of Hope Island which we have applied for in the interests of the agricultural interests of this school. I have marked the location of the improvements of Chas. Sanders the small peninsula has on it all the improvements that he has made. He has a house, a small stable and a warden. He has three or four head of cattle and I believe he is selling all but one. These cattle range through the island. We would not wish to deprive him of any of his property nor the necessary privileges he has had for pasture nor fuel. When asking for the island it was in my mind to let him have the point where he lives, free range for his cattle and the free chance to get his wood same as before. However I see a possible difficulty that may arise in the future.\n\nThere is a block of good land which has been partly cleared some four years ago where some wood was taken off near his peninsula. I have marked it as nearly as I can with pencil. I would suggest that No 27.6 and no 11.1 besides his point be left out of the rest for the present. If he wishes to use that, he will have all and more than he will use of good land and fire wood. If he should wish to move at any time as he has been talking to the south of Lake Winnipeg we could buy his improvements and have the complete Island. If our developments should encourage him to do likewise he could have a good chance.\n\nI have marked as nearly as I can the spots of the Island that has soil that can be made arable; the rest is rock and muskeg as well as\nsome that is marked off. We have a shack and stable which I have marked and have gone already to some expense cutting bushes besides taking special care in cutting wood with the view of getting it ready for cultivation.\n\nThe school is situated on the Indian Reservation and the Indians refuse to give any more land. We only have forty acres and some of that is rock. We are badly in need of more land and this is the only promising prospect we have. If you could arrange for us to have the rest of the island & leaving the portion I have indicated near where Sanders lives we would proceed with our improvements and make the best use we could of it.\n\nYou will understand by this letter that we wish it to be made definite that it is to be for the use of the Boarding School. The Indians do not need it as they have much more than they make use of. We are anxious that it be made clear as we do not want to go to the expense of improvements until we are assured that we will be given the use of it.\n\nIt would be a great benefit to this North country if a good farm could be developed and I can imagine that the Government would be appreciative and interested in such an attempt. This year we have corn for table use, a good many tomatoes ripening on the vines and almost every variety of garden produce. We had oats ripen by Aug. 20. We are only able to raise a little compared with what we need. In three years we have increased our cattle from five to twenty-four. Our hogs from none at that time to twenty-four, sixteen of these are large ones. We are having more sows to farrow soon. We had one team now two and expect to get another. We have made the old small log barns answer for all this stock, we have cleared thirty acres from bush and have some broken and the rest in pasture so you see we are sincere in what we ask for and are careful not to put the department to great expense in our efforts at developments. I think also that you will\nfeel that we are not trying to do any injustice to Mr. Sanders and we would be the first to rejoice at any attempt he might make to work up a little farm. I shall do anything to advise or assist him should he attempt it.\n\nI hope this letter is clear and covers the points you wish to know. I hope that the Department of Indian Affairs will be able to take over this island and that tall but no 27.6 and 11.1 and the peninsula where Sanders improvements are will be assigned for the use of this School.\n\nYours very respectfully\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S.

At that time you sent me over to Mr. Greenway of the Land Department. It was understood that it was to be transferred to the Indian Department for our exclusive use. I hope this has been done.\n\nWould you kindly look into the matter ascertain just how it stands at present?\n\nI have word from Mr. Denyes that they have been cutting the wood on it for some time and have not paid any Government tax believing that the island has been set aside for our use, in connection with the educational work at the school.\n\nYour attention to this at your earliest convenience will greatly oblige,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.

Denyes, Principal of Norway House Boarding School, March 31, 1920\n\nThere is land just outside of our fence belonging to the Indians covered with bush, mostly bushes which for their good and ours for pasture needed, should be cleared. Our boys could easily do it if the Indians would be agreeable but I do not wish to suggest it to them as they think we want to take advantage of them about the land. As soon as it is advisable they ought to be approached with the proposition of cutting their school wood on this place and allow the boys to clear and pile the brush. This is only a suggestion that would require the careful attention of your officials.\n\nWe have been looking for information as to whether any action has been taken by the Department towards securing Hope Island for the use of the school for agricultural purposes. We have one side of it cleared and will be ready to burn the brush this spring. It should be ready where the first cutting was done for the plough as soon as it is burned over.\n\nGeo. F. Denyes,\n\nPrin.\nOttawa, 18th July 1922\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the correspondence carried on by Principal Deneys with relation to the acquiring of Hope Island or a portion thereof for the purposes of the Norway House Boarding school, I have to inform you that Mr. Sanders' declaration given to the surveyor in October 1916, laid claim to the N.W.\u00bc Sec.30-5S-2-W.P.M., Legal subdivisions 9 and 16, Sec.25-5S-3-W.P.M., as indicated in red on the enclosed blueprint.\n\nMr. Deneys had previously stated it would suit the purposes of the boarding school if Hope Island were set aside for the school, except the N.W.\u00bc Sec.30- and Frac.L.S.3 and 4, Sec.31-5S-2-W.P.M., indicated in black on the enclosed print.\n\nThe Land Patents Branch of the Department of the Interior have stated they are now prepared to request His Excellency in Council to set aside Hope Island for the purposes of the boarding school, except the portion to which Mr. Sanders has laid claim in his declaration and as indicated in red on the blueprint.\n\nThe Department is disposed to approve of this arrangement but before notifying the Department of the Interior to this effect, you are requested to inform the Department if this latter arrangement will be fully as satisfactory as the one outlined by Mr. Deneys.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[A.F.

(RG 10, Volume 6270, file 581-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir,\n\nIn February last Mr. James Blackford, Principal of Norway House Boarding School, wrote the Crown Timber Agent in Winnipeg, asking for a free permit for a number of years, and a first option thereafter, to cut hay for the School on two islands some eight miles from the settlement. These islands were not being used for any purpose, were covered with willows, and useless for hay or apparently any other purpose in their present condition. Mr. Blackford offered to clear off the brush so that hay could be secured. The work this would entail would be worth the hay secured for some years.\n\nThis application was referred to the Controller of the Timber and Grazing Department, and his request denied. Mr. Blackford handed this correspondence to me some time ago, but since the refusal appeared to be absolute, except under the regular permits, I took no action. Since, however, I find that consideration is being given to an application on behalf of the Cross Lake Boarding School for the reservation of certain hay meadows for the use of the School, I think the same consideration should be given to the Application of the Norway House School.\n\nI will endeavor to secure a sketch of the islands in question, showing their location, approximate area, and an estimate of the average annual yield if cleared, and a definite application to have these islands reserved for the use of the Boarding School for hay purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 5th August 1922\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th ultimo, relating to the acquisition of further hay lands for the Norway House Boarding School, I am enclosing for your information a copy of a letter recently forwarded to the Principal of the boarding school, concerning certain lands which were applied for by Principal Denys and which are being obtained for this school.\n\nIn making application for this portion, one of the arguments advanced was that it was to be used for agricultural purposes by the school. Is it to be understood that the land in Tp.55, R.3, W.P.M., will not sufficiently relieve the hay situation at the school and that it will be still necessary to endeavour to acquire a further supply?\n\nIn your report, kindly state the approximate number of tons required per annum and the average number of tons now available, including the probable yield of the land referred to in Tp.55, R.3, W.P.M. It was expected by the Department, in applying for this land, that the parcel could be utilized to yield a sufficient supply for the purposes of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.D.

(RG 10, Volume 6270, file 581-9, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith an agreement entered into by the Norway House Indians, The Norway House Boarding School, and myself, with regard to an exchange to be made between the said Indians and said School, and which exchange I consider would be to the interest of both Band and School.\n\nWhen I met Mr. Russel Ferrier, Supt. of Indian Education, in Winnipeg last summer, he informed me that I was authorized to make an agreement along these lines with the Indians, and that the Principal of the School had been authorized to act on behalf of the School.\n\nAlmost every Indian present at the meeting was in favor of the agreement. Some wanted more land for the roadway at the north side, in fact wanted a roadway through the School property, but this would have been a continual source of trouble.\n\nAs to the agreement, I consider the Indians are getting rather the better of it, but the exchange would put all School buildings and property within the School fence, and in this way place these properties more directly under the eye and control of the Principal, and obviate all difficulties with the Indians.\n\nAs regards the roadway to the north of the property, it has been necessary each winter to open a road through the School property by taking down the fences. The making of this no longer necessary, will compensate for the small amount of land given up.\n\nThe exchange at the front of the property will give a little more ground in the front yard, and place the boundary fence a little farther from the building. It is now much too close. It will also give the Indians an addition to their recreation ground, which is too small. The corner given up by the School is garden ground, but juts out into the football ground where the young men play, and the ball is constantly being kicked over this fence, and the garden and fence are damaged considerably every season.\n\nI may say that the map which I have of the School property includes the cemetery and the ground to the west of it, but this appears to be incorrect. I will endeavor, later, to have a fairly correct map drawn of the property, as proposed by this agreement.\n\nWhile this Agreement does not follow the regular form, it is really not a Surrender, and I trust this will prove satisfactory, and that it will be accepted by the Department, I would recommend acceptance, since I consider it will benefit all parties concerned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department is pleased that you have made this arrangement and trusts that it will be a benefit to the school.

As, however, it has been wooded, and is only partially cleared, considerable work and time will be required to bring it under cultivation, and it will probably be necessary to secure hay from other lands for a year or two. This, however, can be done by applying for permits in the regular way, but, I would suggest, that the Crown Timber Branch might be requested to grant free permits for this purpose on the lands suggested in my letter No.925-6A of July last, for two years.\n\nWhen I wrote my letter No.925-6A in July last, I was not aware that any application had been made for the lands on Hope Island for the use of the School.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Aest.

G.G. Kezar\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nAsst.Clerk of the Privy Council.\nReferring to my letter to you of the 12th ultimo, your file 123-5-9, I beg to enclose copy of an Order in Council dated the 18th ultimo (p.c.863), reserving during pleasure for the purposes of the Department of Indian Affairs for the use of the Indian Boarding School at Norway House certain portions of Hope Island situate in Little Playgreen Lake in township 58, ranges 2 and 3, west of the principal meridian, and township 59, range 2, west of the principal meridian, containing a total area of 571.2 acres more or less. Copy of the plan referred to in the Order in Council is also enclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[N. O. C\u00f4t\u00e9]\nController.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe principal of the Norway House Boarding School has cut and cleared so that it can be well burned, about 40 or 45 acres of land on Hope Island. This was secured for the use of the Boarding School. He is now busy breaking and stumping the same, having purchased a stumping machine for this purpose. The entire cost will be in the neighborhood of $1,000.00. He has also cleared about 20 acres of willow land by the shore of the island and sown the same with grass seed. He has an excellent crop of grass on it this year which will save the purchase of hay at Selkirk and having it shipped in. There are about 50 acres more of the willow brush land. This could be worked into the same condition for hay purposes.\n\nWould the Department bear the expense of having this willow land cleared? If your agent were authorized to do this he could furnish employment for some of the Indians. I have discussed it with Mr. Gordon and he thinks it a fair proposition. He assured me he would be agreeable to the same providing the Department would authorize it done. I would be pleased if the Department would take this matter up with Mr. Gordon. I would like to point out that there is no better time in the year to do this work than during the months of August and September as land cleared at that season is seldom followed by any undergrowth.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTF/GD\nOttawa, July 31, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, with reference to certain expense at the Norway House Indian Boarding School, incurred clearing land on Hope Island, a portion of which has been set apart for the use of the school. I have noted that about $1,000 will be spent in this connection and that you have discussed the matter with Mr. Indian Agent Gordon.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Department will be responsible for a portion of the cost in connection with the clearing of this land, and Mr. Indian Agent Gordon has been instructed to engage Indian labour for the purpose, up to an amount not exceeding $350.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, July 31, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\n- WITH CHEQUE -\n\nI have to inform you that the Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools and Hospitals has urged the Department to assist the principal of the Norway House Indian Boarding School, in the clearing of a portion of Hope Island, which has lately been reserved for the purposes of the school. You are authorized to engage Indian labour and to expend the sum of $350 in this connection. Time sheets, in duplicate, should be kept, properly supported by receipts. An accountable cheque for $350 is enclosed for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House,\nMan.\nThe Secretary of the Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to yours of July 31st, #125-5-9 re clearing of land at Norway House. I thought I made it clear in my letter of the 23rd of July that the management was sending about a $1000.00, and it would require about another $1000.00, to meet the expense of clearing the land required for hay. My thought was that the management would go half and half with the Department. We would then have close to one hundred acres of land on the island for crop. I am very thankful for the amount of $350.00, but would be more so if you could make it equal to the amount which the management will have to expend.\n\nYours gratefully, but awaiting to be more gratified,\n\nT. Ferrier\n\nall this year\nOttawa, August 14, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, regarding the providing of a grant to cover the expenses of clearing a portion of land on Hope Island, which is being used in connection with the Norway House Indian Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the sum of $350.00 - the amount which has been authorized - is all the Department has available for this purpose, this present fiscal year. It is thought that, if the management expend a like amount, a considerable portion will be cleared and ready for use next spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\n### Department of Indian Affairs\n\nTo: Wm.

The Balance on hand for clearing land for Norway House Boarding School is $1.00.\n\nI have also paid out for labor on the new waterline, and repairs to sewer, and cleansing septic tank for Norway House Boarding School, the sum of $354.20. My authority for this expenditure is somewhat vague, Department letter No. 123-5-5 of Aug. 3rd, stated that the Winnipeg office had been given authority to have this work done. Inspector Bunn shipped the necessary material. I wired him, Aug. 29th, \"If we to put in pipe line by day labor, send ten spades and ten shovels, and Nine Hundred Dollars, also two hundred feet three eighths; pump rod.\" Inspector Bunn sent forward the spades, shovels and rod, but to date I have received no funds. As it was necessary to have this work completed before freeze up I proceeded at once with the work. As to sewer and septic tank, this was authorized in Dept. letter No. 123-5-5 of Aug. 13th. I have made no distinction in this work, as the same gang of men did both jobs. I mentioned the necessity of funds to cover this expenditure in my letter to the Department, of Sept. 3rd. I find the labor for the waterline, sewer, septic tank, and crib for intake, will cost approximately $1200. Unless the $900. asked for reaches me by the next mail, I will be placed in an awkward position as I will have no funds for the purchase of dog fish, or to pay for anything required, as the amount paid for this work will absorb the whole balance and we will receive no further mail until December.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) Wm. Gordon\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent,\nOttawa, October 29th., 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 8th ultimo, enclosing several statements accounting for expenditure in connection with Schools, I beg to state that in future it will not be necessary to make separate statements for the different advances received by you on account of Schools. The balance of school money to be accounted for on September 1st was $723.95 and after giving you credit for the amounts of vouchers Nos. 499A and 500A, namely $166.55, the balance on hand October 1st was $277.10. The voucher for October should therefore show this balance and all school expenditure during that month should be charged in the same voucher against this advance.\n\nThe Department has not included in the above balance the sum of $900.00 advanced through Mr. Inspector Bunn on the 25th August last, because you state you had not received the amount on the 1st October. In consequence of this delay voucher No. 501A for $554.20 will not be charged against this advance, but will be paid by cheque which is being sent you.\n\nMr. Inspector Bunn informs the Department that owing to the failure of the Bank of Montreal, Winnipeg, to notify him that the advance of $900.00 had been received from the Department the money is still lying there, but he intends to send it to you by the first winter mail. This sum should be added to any balance of school money you may have on hand and used for school purposes. If you have a surplus at the end of the fiscal year you may retain it and the matter will be adjusted when your March statement is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWm. Gordon Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have to report that the amount advanced, $350.00 cheque No. 2002, for the clearing of land on Hope Island for the use of the Norway House Indian Boarding School has been expended to good advantage. The amount of land brushed has been approximately doubled. A considerable area has already been stumped, and is ready for the plow. The area brushed recently will be burned off in the spring. A considerable portion will be under crop next summer, if all goes well. This should solve, to a large extent, the problem of a sufficient quantity of feed for the cows and horses at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWm. Gordon,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter No.123-5-9 of Oct.29th last. I am glad that it is not necessary to make separate Vouchers for the different works upon which money is expended for Schools, but that one Voucher can be used to account for all.\n\nI have received the cheque No.3500 for $554.20 in payment of Voucher No.501A and credited this in the November Cash Return. This left a deficit in Vote 7. ac. at the end of November of $123.15. I have received the $900/ cash sent forward from the Bank of Montreal, Winnipeg, and credit this in December. This will leave me a comfortable balance in Vote 7. after meeting all outstanding indebtedness on stable, etc.\n\nI note also what you say re surplus at the end of the fiscal year, and thank you for this, as it is very inconvenient with our mail service to return the moneys, and wait for new moneys to be forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWm Gordon\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 21st May 1924\n\nSir,\n\nWhen you return to Norway House after surveys at Oxford, God's and Island Lakes, if time permits before the sailing of the boat to Selkirk, you are requested to arrange with the Indian Council and the Mission authorities for the selection of the limit of that property occupied by the boarding school which the Indians are willing to allow the boarding school to utilize while used for school purposes.\n\nThe Indians agreed in Council in 1910 to allow the boarding school the use of forty acres but the parcel so agreed upon has not yet been officially defined. A sketch showing the approximate position of the boundaries requested at that time is enclosed. After selection, the boundaries should be run and posted. This work should not be performed, however, if by so doing it would prevent the party coming out on the first boat after your return to Norway House.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.D.

It will be observed that the sewer line from the School passes through this field, that the septic tank is just outside of the fence, on higher ground. This is the only outlet for sewer from the Hospital building and the Agency house. I may say, that while the sketch does not show the waterline as touching this field, it is not entirely accurate, since the waterline is also about ten feet inside of the fence at the South East corner.\n\nThe south and west of the field is low, and is sometimes flooded with the sewage, if the pipeline below the tank becomes blocked, as sometimes happens. There have been times, in the past, when the tank required to be pumped out daily, and then the sewage flowed across the field to the west side. Should traders locate here, there would be sure to be some trouble sooner or later.\n\nShould the Department secure possession of the field, which contains approximately 1\u00bd acres, it could be used for growing feed, and we could dig it up or flood it at our own pleasure when necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 11th August 1924\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has been informed that certain traders are making applications to you for submission to the Methodist Board for building sites on the plot indicated in red on the accompanying sketch of Rossville Point, Norway House.\n\nThe following is an extract from a report made by the Indian Agent with reference to this parcel of land:\n\n\"For some time I have had in mind a suggestion that the Indian Department make an arrangement with the authorities of the Church for the return of this property.

Bayr requesting to lease sufficient ground to build a store. I discussed the matter with your agent, Mr. Gordon and gave him to understand that I was not in sympathy with any such policy. I pointed out to Mr. Bayr that the Methodist Church did not hold the deed of the land and that we had it for educational and missionary purposes. However, he handed me his request in writing and I promised to reply to the same. Courtesy at least demanded this. I feel sure the Mission Board of our Church would never consent to leasing a portion of this property without first turning it over to the Indian Department. The land in question is a good piece of garden land, well cleared and should be cultivated from year to year. It has been so used through the past years since it has been brought under a state of cultivation. It is a question whether the missionary requires this much land as there is now sufficient under cultivation to allow them to grow a very substantial garden.\n\nIf any change is made it should be given over to the boarding School for garden purposes as land is very much needed in connection with the management of the school for this purpose. So much so that we are spending considerable money and labor on Hope Island which is four miles away. If this arrangement would be agreeable to the Department I would bring it before the next meeting of the Board of Missions in October.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT. Ferrier\n\nIndian Affairs.

A report received from an official of this Department states that this lot has been used by the Methodist Church for about forty years. A letter dated the 8th December last from Rev. S. D. Gaudin of Norway House states that the Methodist Church has been in possession of this lot since 1840.\n\nThe Indian Treaty in this locality was concluded in the year 1876 (Treaty No. 5). If the Methodist Mission occupied Lot 13 at the date of the treaty, consideration may be given by this Department to the Mission's claim to a free grant of this lot. If you are in a position to do so will you be good enough to furnish a statement showing the period of occupancy of this lot by the Methodist Mission.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[N.C.

In reply I beg to state that I have carefully examined our files and the only evidence I have found is contained in the field notes of D. Sinclair, Dominion Land Surveyor. These notes are dated September 18, 1877, and the lot in question is shown as Methodist Mission property. I wish to quote from his report: \"This Norway House band of Indians is far advanced on the road to civilization, under the joint influence of the Hudson's Bay Company and the Methodist missionaries.\"\n\nMay I refer you, however, to page 79 of the annual report of the Association of Dominion Land Surveyors, together with the papers read at the 14th annual meeting held at Ottawa, February 1921. On page 79 the following words appear: \"Another point of interest, attached to this establishment (Norway House), is due to the fact that here the Rev. James Evans (1801-46) invented his Cree Syllabic characters, which was an important step towards civilizing the Indians. His service was recognized but not rewarded by Lord Dufferin when Governor General, who said: 'The Nation has given many man a title and a resting place in Westminster Abbey who never did half so much for his fellow creatures.'\" I might point out that the Rev. James Evans was a missionary of the Wesleyan Church and his activity commenced the Methodist missions among the Indians in this part of Canada.\n\nI wish also to quote from page 284 et ff., Alexander Begg's \"History of the Northwest.\" I might point out that this work is a recognized authority. \"In a letter dated August, 1841, Rev. James Evans, General Superintendent of the Wesleyan Missions in the Hudson's Bay territories, writes as follows: 'Since my arrival in this country, I have visited York Factory, of which I made the committed aware last autumn. On my return, I remained until December, and left it early in that month, to visit the posts within my reach.

Young's \"By Canoe and Dog Train\": \"Rossville Mission, Norway House, was commenced by the Rev. James Evans in the year 1840. It has been and still is one of the most successful Indian missions in America.\"\n\nThe above information all goes to prove that the mission at Norway House was commenced in the year 1840, and in an effort to assist you in determining whether Lot 13 was the site of the original mission, I wish to quote from Egerton R. Young's \"The Apostle of the North.\" Chapter 15 quotes extracts from Mr. Evans' journals. On page 202 et ff., there appear the following extracts: \"'15th (September, 1840), I commenced a school on the opposite side of the river from Norway House fort, and had about twenty-five scholars anxious to learn. I am teaching them to read the English and their own tongue.' . . . '26th (also September, 1840) I commenced clearing the point of land selected for the settlement of the Indians about three miles from the fort, and preparing the ground for the erection of mission premises next summer.'\"\n\nThe point of land referred to is, without doubt, the present site of the Methodist mission and it would appear that clearing was undertaken in 1840 and buildings erected in 1841.\n\nI trust that this information will assist you in your deliberations.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, February 24, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nYour 1557-43A of July 24th, last, was inadvertently unanswered. The Department has been in correspondence with the Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools in connection with that portion of the Mission lot next the Hudson Bay Company's lot. There does not appear to be any necessity for a transfer of this parcel to the Department as, no doubt, the residential school can arrange with the Mission to get the use of it from time to time for repairing their pipe line, or could regularly use it for garden purposes. The Methodist Church is being informed that the Department trusts they will not release any of their property to traders. As you point out, such action might lead to difficulty.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nWm.

I am pleased to note that the Board of your Church would not consent to leasing any of their parcel to outsiders. The sewer line from the Indian residential school is on that portion of the Mission lot next the Hudson Bay Company's lot, and if this were not held by the Church, at some future date difficulties might arise.

I understand that this is a Department building built with Department funds, and it is most urgently required for the United Church Indian Day Schools of Rossville.\n\nThe Reverend Joseph Jones the last principal of the school appears to suffer from the delusion that it is his personal property and has made no gesture to remove either himself or his personal effects although he has no official status in the community. He is not the local missionary. He was away for 6 months, 1st January to 30 June acting as Principal Portage La Prairie Indian Residential School and during that time I understand he charged the teachers Misses Fleming and Heinrich for their occupancy. It seems to me that it is high time that the Reverend Joseph Jones was instructed to remove both his person and his property from this building. It is over a year since the school burned down or since he held office in this community.\n\nE.B.

He has not yet removed his personal property from the building and we are informed that while Misses Fleming and Heinrich occupied the building during Mr. Jones' absence, he charged them rent.\n\nWe are extremely anxious to secure this building for living quarters for the teachers at Norway House for the academic year 1947-48 and we would appreciate it if you would request Rev.

Goodman,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House.\n\nDear Mr Goodman:\n\nFurther to our conversation re the Principal's Residence of this school. We are proposing to rent this furnished residence to the three Day School Teachers for a term of ten months at a rental of Thirty dollars per month. This revenue we are devoting to pay insurance on the dwelling and the furnishings and also to pay for the expense in keeping it in good repair. The west side of the building was badly scorched when the school was burned, the wall will have to be scraped before repainting.\n\nIn reference to the Engineer's residence which is also Residential School property, we propose to lease this residence on a yearly basis until the time it will be required as a residence for a member of the staff of the new school. This residence is unfurnished, a rental of Twenty dollars per month is fair & just. I understand that you would like the newly appointed engineer to live in this residence, will you acquaint him with the terms.\n\nMay I explain the history of this building and its relationship to this school. Mr Stevenson the present occupant of the residence was formerly the engineer of the Residential School, later he was appointed in a dual capacity as Engineer for the Agency and the school, his duties in connection with the school in this later arrangement were to keep our machinery in repair and good working order. I may add here that we only called him in when unable to do the work ourselves, his time was so fully taken up with the hospital, agency and saw-mill that we were reluctant to call him away from his duties there. For these services of the Engineer we provided a residence and also paid one hundred and ten dollars ($110.00) per month for water, light, and part to the Engineer's salary.\n\nCheques for the rent of the residence could be made out to the above school and addressed to me at Portage-La-Prairie, or to United Church of Canada, Wesley Buildg, Toronto, Ontario.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) Joseph Jones\nR.A. Hoey Esq,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch, Dep't Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter which was left on my desk by an Indian boy. It is from the Reverend Joseph Jones, formerly Principal of the U.C. Residential School at Norway House. I have been under the impression that both the buildings he refers to are Indian Affairs Property paid for by Public Funds from Ottawa. They were built before I came here and there is no record regarding them in the office. However Dr Corrigan informs me that the Engineer's Residence was built by the Department for the Agency Engineer.\n\nI would be glad if you would put me straight as to who these buildings belong to and lay down a ruling which will settle this contentious question once and for all.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nMr. Philan\n\nNorway House School Buildings\n\nThis morning I discussed the question of ownership with Rev. Joseph Jones. I think that Mr. Goodman will not have further difficulty on this point. Mr. Jones seems to have been impelled mostly by a desire to protect the interests of his church.

Inasmuch as it is the intention of the Indian Affairs Branch to include an item in their 1948-49 estimates, it is desired to have Mr. Buck confer with the school officials, Indian Affairs Branch, immediately so as to determine the amount that should be included in the estimates and to finalize the details of the buildings described in general terms by Mr. Hoey. Will you please give this matter your immediate attention.\n\nIn connection with the above buildings, attention is directed to your memorandum of February 10th last addressed to Mr. Wardle wherein reference was made to the matter of the electric power supply and the Indian Affairs desire to install a lathe. We have noted from Mr. Wardle's file that this memorandum was not passed on to Mr. Hoey. Apparently the reason was that the Indian Affairs had not come to any decision in view of the new building program they had in mind. I would therefore like you to include in the discussion on the proposed new Indian School buildings the matter of electric power supply inasmuch as it will be necessary to provide for electric wiring in these buildings and of course the type of wiring will depend upon the demand load which the school will have.\n\nMeeting held\nMr. Buck on\nMr. Hoey 47\n27 Nov 47\n\nDirector.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose, for your information, a letter received from Reverend Mr. Jones, Principal of Portage Indian Residential School.

Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg.\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton:\n\nI am having difficulty in collecting for wood, gasoline & barge supplied to Norway House Agency.\n\nThe wood was piled on the shore and sold to the Agency @ $4.00 per cord. There was 72 cords piled in the bush and sold at $3.00 per cord. All this wood was measured by a representative of the Agency and by one of my men and the figures given to the Agency clerk and accepted by him. This wood was now in his charge and vouchers for the payment ought to have been submitted for the payment, but delay after delay has taken place without an adequate reason being given.\n\nThe gasoline was secured from the school in the Spring of 1946 before navigation opened as the Agency supply was gone.\n\nThe Barge was used by the Agency for hauling logs and taken over by them when the school was burned. Two barges were sold to the Agency but only one has been paid for.\n\nI shall be grateful if you will urge the Agent to submit vouchers for the settlement of this account.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(signed) Joseph Jones.\nA.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Winnipeg,\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of January 2, 1948 file 207-43 re letter of the Rev Joseph Jones, ex-Principal of the Norway House Residential School.\n\nThe following is a statement of wood purchased to date from the a/m school showing date, voucher number, cash and the amount of wood.\n\n| Date     | Voucher Number | Cash   | Goods                      |\n|----------|----------------|--------|----------------------------|\n| 26 Apr 47| 190            | $160.00| 30 cd wood @5.00           |\n|          |                |        | Rossville Schools          |\n| 26 Apr 47| 191            | 179.00 | 15 cd @5.00-20 cd @4.00 for Agency |\n| 26 Apr 47| 192            | 200.00 | 50 cd @ 4.00 for Hosp      |\n| 31 Oct 47| 675            | 280.00 | 70 cd wd @4.00 cd Hospital |\n| 31 Oct 47| 676            | 120.00 | 30 cd wd @4.00 Rossville Schools |\n| 31 Oct 47| 677            | 148.00 | 37 cd cd @ 4100 Agency     |\n\nThe measuring of this wood as referred to by Mr Jones in the bush was done without my knowledge and during my absence and I refuse to pay for any of the wood unless it is stacked and measured in the Agency yard.\n\nMr. Jones in his second paragraph states that the wood was piled on the shore. A certain amount of it was but the majority was not and I have had a man employed for the last 6 weeks swamping this wood out of the bush on to the shore where I can get at it with the tractor.\n\nThe wood that I have hauled to the Agency to date amounts to $1,077.00 and this has been vouchered for as indicated on my statement. As I get the rest of the wood hauled to the Agency and measured I will voucher for same.\n\nWith regard to the gasoline this transaction involved principally Dr Corrigan and I am a bit hazy as to what took place. There was no official record kept and I would like to know how Mr Jones arrives at his figure of $86.10\n\nAs for the barge I have never used it for the simple reason that it is unusable. I spent time and money trying to make it serviceable but have been unable to get it afloat and it spent all this summer sitting on the bottom of Little Playgreen Lake where it still reposes.\nI refuse to pay for this barge which was never at any time during my residence at Norway House worth $75.00. I cannot understand Mr. Jones' attitude. The wood, the gasoline, and the barge were originally paid for by monies taken from the pockets of the Canadian Taxpayer and was expended for Indian purposes and I completely fail to understand why the Canadian Taxpayer should have to pay over again for what is already his at the somewhat arrogant demand of Mr. Jones.\n\nE.B.

Consequently, we feel that Indian Agent Goodman should continue to follow the plan that he outlines in his letter.\n\nThe question of payment for the gasoline is being referred to the Indian Health Service.

The cast-iron boiler could be used in connection with some other service, such as the heating of large quantities of domestic hot water for the Residential School.\n\nWith the reduction of the Indian Affairs school programme at Norway House, for the 1948-49 fiscal year, to the erection of a standard type building, our own staff will undertake the modifications required, as soon as drawings and bills of material for the schools in the Northwest Territories have been completed.\n\nMr. Hoey,\n\nI think this will answer your problem.\n\n1/4/48.\n\nDirector.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nR.A.

(RG 10, Volume 6270, file 581-5, part 10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES  \nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES  \nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI am forwarding to you a sketch prepared by J. McLean D.C.S., in August 1910.\n\nThis sketch shows the site upon which the buildings in connection with this Agency are situated. The land is far too small for the number of buildings situated thereon. We have on this site, the hospital, Agency office, Agency residence, stable, dog kennels, warehouse, and ice house. The new stable for the horses, I have erected opposite the Agency site, down near the Lake shore, at the point marked X on the plan. You will see by this that our buildings are crowded too closely together.\n\nOn the west side of the Agency there is a piece of land owned by Councillor Charles Paul. This land is not a part of the Reserve. He is willing to dispose of his house and land to the Department for the sum of Three Hundred Dollars. The house is within fifty feet of the hospital. It is not desirable to have Indians residing so close to the hospital. If the Department sees fit to take this land over and add it to the Agency site, it will be a good location for the Doctor's residence some time in the future.\n\nOn the east side of the Agency there are two lots which have been occupied by William Sinclair and John Bull, these two men vacated this property some years ago. They have assured me that they are willing for the Department to take over their lots. William Sinclair has a close pole fence around his lot, he is willing to dispose of...\nSir,\n\nthis improvement to the Department for the sum of Fifty Dollars. I called a Council Meeting on Monday the 22nd of May, to ask the Band to surrender these two lots to the Department to be used by the Department of Agency purposes. I pointed out how closely crowded together our buildings were on the present site, and that I wished to remove the stables, ice-house, and warehouse to the land which I was asking for. Although the land asked for has not been used for years and there is no prospect of it being used in the near future, unless the Department should take it over, yet the Council refused to grant these two lots to the Department for Agency purposes. The reason for this refusal may be traced back to the time when forty acres was surrendered for school purposes. The people as a band seem to regret the surrendering of this Forty acres, and have repeatedly said that they would not surrender any more land for any purpose. So in view of this I would respectfully suggest to you that you secure these lots by expropriation, and compensate William Sinclair to the extent of Fifty Dollars for his improvements.\n\nA still better thing to do, would be to expropriate the balance of the Reserve Land on Rossville Mission Point. This would mean that the whole point would be used for School, Agency, and Mission purposes.\nSir,\n\nIf this available land was secured I could put the public playground in better shape, and reserve these two lots for this purpose. If you see fit to expropriate the whole point, we shall be better able to make model grounds of our location. At the present time both the school and the Agency are pestered with dogs and cattle, and when the fly season comes this point is the rendezvous for all the Reserve cattle.\n\nTo expropriate this point I would suggest putting the fence at a point in the Bay marked \"A\" on the plan, to the south limit of the school land, this would mean that six men would have to be compensated for their houses, and I would suggest that Three Hundred Dollars for each one is ample compensation, with the exception of Alex Neckaway, who has built a new house which I would value at Five Hundred Dollars. The names of the other men are:\n\nThomas Balfour, Elijah Houle, Sandy Crafty Baptiste Seulier, and Philip Hart. The only other Indian residing on the Mission Point is Councilor Chas. Paul, whose land is not included in the Reserve. The purchase of this land, I have already suggested in this letter.\n\nThe total cost to the Department for the expropriation and purchase of the remaining land on this point would be only Two Thousand, Three Hundred Dollars. Then this point would be for the exclusive use of the Boarding School, Day school, Agency and\nSir,\n\nMission purposes, then we could organize some concerted effort to beautify this point. I would still reserve suitable site for the Treaty payments and put this site in good shape, also I would set apart a piece of land as public playgrounds and also put it in good shape.\n\nThere is, on the Mission Point, a small piece of land owned by the Hudson Bay Company, this piece of land is only used by them during Treaty payments.\n\nI trust you will see your way to take up this suggestion and carry it out. I will take up the matter with Inspector Bunn, and he will no doubt, discuss the question with you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nDuncan C.

We actually own some 40 acres extending up to Little Playgreen Lake on the north and for some distance easterly. I have indicated the extent of this property in pencil.\n\nI understand that water was obtained from Little Playgreen Lake on the south of the peninsula and discharged on the north of the peninsula.\n\nI would particularly ask that this blueprint be carefully preserved as it is the only copy which we have available.\n\nEnc.\n\nBernard F.

Goodman, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Norway House, Man.\n\nIt is our intention to operate a residential school at Norway House under the new Hostel plan. This would mean the establishment of the following:\n\n(a) A large day school, which would not only handle the day school pupils at present in attendance, but would also educate the children from the United Church hostel.\n\n(b) A hostel for some 120 children to be operated by the United Church of Canada. This would clothe, feed and care for the children of your Agency and nearby agencies for whom we cannot hope to provide day school facilities. It will also provide care for orphans and children from broken homes, etc.\n\nThis school will be operated by the Department and its teachers will be appointed by the Education Division. In other words the Department will be responsible for the education of the children while the Church will be responsible for the health and welfare of those students who require such attention in order to get their education.\n\nIt is, therefore, our intention to erect at Norway House both a hostel and a classroom block which can be used for the purposes indicated above. We have also been advised that the Indian Health Services intend to construct a hospital at Norway House and that the\nexisting hospital there may well be surplus to their requirements.\n\nIt has been suggested to us that if we can only erect the classroom block this year, we might use the old hospital as a dormitory until the proposed hostel is erected. We are under the impression that the old hospital is in bad condition. Do you feel it would be advisable to use it for the purpose mentioned?\n\nWe will look forward to hearing further from you on the proposals contained in this letter.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\nOttawa, May 4, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Goodman:\n\nIt is our intention to operate a residential school at Norway House under the new Hostel plan.

Neary,\n\nI learned this morning that Indian Health intend to construct a hospital at Norway House and that the existing hospital may be surplus to their requirements, as well as the Doctor's house.\n\nWe are speaking for the transfer of the Doctor's house to us, as an additional Clerk's house is needed. This will obviate the necessity for the construction of a house. Dr. Moore mentioned that you might be interested in having the hospital as Dormitory accommodation.\n\nM. Walton.\nNorway House, Manitoba\n8 June 1948.\n\nEducation Division, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa\n\nAttention: Mr F Phelan\n\nRe: Proposed Hostel and Day School Block to be Erected at Norway House\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of May 7, 1948 file 123-5-5(E 1) received in this office May 29th by first boat and this letter is going out to you by first available mail leaving Norway House.\n\nIn the last 2 paragraphs of your letter you request information as to the advisibility of using the Old Hospital as a dormitory until the proposed Hostel is erected. The old hospital was erected about 1924 as a temporary building and as you state, it is in very bad condition. A lot of the wood work is rotten and it is warped and out of shape and is extremely difficult to heat in winter. It is infested with Cockroaches and has housed active T.B. cases for years. It would cost a fortune to renovate it and then you would not have anything that would be satisfactory. I strongly recommend that it be condemned entirely and demolished. Such items as windows, doors and plumbing fixtures could be salvaged.\n\nWith regard to the proposed large day school have you any definite plans or blueprints as to the type of building. It is the opinion of the writer that it should contain 3 classrooms and a full sized basement which could contain recreation rooms.\n\nIs the proposed Hostel for 120 children to be contained in 1 Building or several buildings. I would be interested in seeing blueprints for both the prospective day school and the hostel.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nAIRMAIL\n\nJune 18, 1948.\n\nMr. E. B. Goodman,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nProposed new style Residential School -\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nReference your 9-B (123) of 8 June -\n\nWe have advised the Indian Health Services that we will not require the old hospital as a dormitory, for the reasons mentioned in your letter of above date.\n\nI am sending you, under separate cover, a set of plans for our standard four-room school such as constructed at Eskasoni, Nova Scotia. While the residential school classroom block will differ in some ways from the plan sent you, nevertheless it will give you an idea of the type of structure planned. We intend to erect a four-classroom block with a full basement which will contain manual training and domestic science rooms.\n\nThe dormitories will be in separate buildings and each will have a basement designed as a recreation room. At the present time we do not have sufficient sets available of this new type residential school to send you a copy. However, we will do so when such plans are available. We would appreciate your recommendations as to which of the\npresent classroom blocks could continue to be used under our new plan.\n\nIt has been suggested to our Lands and Development Services Branch that the survey party doing the ground work for the new hospital be requested, through the Department of Public Works, to carry out a similar ground survey for the proposed residential school. It is therefore likely that in due time you will be approached by engineers from the survey party with regard to the suggested site for the school.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOttawa, June 18, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS and DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\n\nProposed Residential School - Norway House, Manitoba.\n\nI understand that the Indian Health Services will be erecting a new hospital at Norway House, Manitoba, over the next two years. The Department of Public Works will be arranging all details with regard to the construction of this hospital and I understand that they have a survey party on its way to Norway House now.\n\nAs you know, we intend to build a new residential school at Norway House. This school will be almost identical with that planned for Teslin, Y.T. It is suggested, therefore, that you approach the Department of Public Works and arrange for their survey party to carry out the ground site survey required for your use at Norway House.\n\nDirector.\nPlans for four-room school to be sent\nOttawa, July 7, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LAND AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH,\n\nProposed Residential School - Norway House, Manitoba.\n\nIn my memorandum of June 16, I advised you that the Department of Public Works was erecting a new hospital at Norway House for the Indian Health Services, Department of National Health and Welfare.\n\nIt has occurred to me that it would be advisable to approach the Department of Public Works also with regard to the construction of our residential school for Norway House.

Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAtt'n: B.F. Heary.\n\nT.S. Mills,\nChief Engineer.\nWhen your letter of 28th June, 1948, was received re survey and information concerning proposed residential school at Norway House, Man., the District Engineer at Winnipeg was asked to take the matter up with Professor Herriott who is making a survey for the proposed hospital at that place and to report what extra cost would be involved. No reply was received until yesterday, when the District Engineer reported, by telephone, that Professor Herriott was willing to undertake the extra survey if he could have Professor Riddell join him and assist him in carrying it out and have boring outfit shipped from Winnipeg. Professor Riddell was to be paid $25 per day plus all expenses. If this arrangement was not made, the District Engineer was afraid that Professor Herriott would complete the hospital survey and come out before authority was received to carry out the school survey and asked for immediate decision. As the boat was leaving for Norway House at noon, to-day, I was not able to consult anyone in your Department, but presumed that as this was the only way of having this survey made you would be willing to stand the necessary expense. I therefore instructed District Engineer Andersen to have Professor Riddell and the necessary equipment catch the boat, to-day.\n\nThe District Engineer states that the least time required for this survey would be from a week to ten days. When the survey is completed you will be notified of the actual expenditure involved.\n\n(Sgd.) A.A. Anderson\n\nfor R. Blais\nChief Engineer.\n\nMr. Hoey - Are these arrangements satisfactory to you?\n\nA/Director.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6270, file 581-5, part 10)\nJuly 16, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS & DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\n\nWe have your memorandum of July 14th with reference to the arrangements made to have Professor Riddell accompany Professor Herrick to Norway House in connection with carrying out a school survey. It is noted that Professor Riddell's services will cost $25.00 a day plus all expenses and the survey will require approximately ten days. The action taken meets with our approval.\n\nPP/MGD\nNORWAY HOUSE\nRESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nBLDGS, ACCTS, ETC.\nprepared to ration a large proportion of this section, I consider we are making a wasting on the building of homes on the resettlement homes, or on the cultivation of large diameter traps, who has a good home on the reservation, both to have it for the winter if he lives there, and journeys out to him. His visits will be few, consequently he has dead traps and no return. If he leaves his family at home, and goes to camp himself, he will be likely to spend too much time visiting his home. His family will also cost much more for support, as they will be dependent on goods. For this reason I am not greatly in favor of assistance to the graduates in the form of house materials at least at the present time. It may appear to be a movement, so far as civilization is concerned, but the support and the consequent self esteem I consider very important.\n\nAn increase in grants from both the Department and the Board for the coming year will make the finances of the school increasingly difficult. It is hard to see how cuts in costs can be made without disrupting the organization of the farm gardens, stock, etc., built up by years of effort and expenses; or by reducing the number of which would reduce the value of the school property. We cannot increase in pupils, without a corresponding increase in accommodation, should be made. A re-organization from top to bottom might be effective in reducing costs, and if done carefully need not diminish the value of the work of the institution.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWm. Gordon,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6270, file 581-5, part 10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\ncrowded with people; half day classes, not more than about three hours daily in classes, is the vogue here, and the children are supposed to be outside in the fresh air as much as possible. Some swings, slides, etc., have been provided for their amusement. A certain amount of physical drill is given. The children admitted to schools are selected, and those having Tubercular tendencies are eliminated. There should be much less danger of T.B. infection in the school than in many of the reserve homes. Yet I doubt if the graduates are superior physically to the children who have grown up on the reserves.\n\nFrom the economic standpoint, I would say, that so far as this section of the west is concerned, the school training is a failure. Our girls and boys have not learned any relationship between their earning power and those things (as to value) which they require, to live. Much of the school work is mechanical, and on a large scale, and they have not the initiative nor understanding to fit themselves into a smaller scale, and to hand work. Farming and stock-raising are of little use at Norway House, as we have very little arable land, and, in most season, little native hay. Gardening is valuable, and will become increasingly so. The ability to drive a horse, and to care for him properly, will have a value for a limited number. Cross Lake has more land and hay, and farm training will have a value to the boys of that reserve. The majority must trap, hunt, fish, paddle a canoe and carry on portages. They must build and live in winter camps, with very little social life for the winter, and without electric lighting, running water and steam heating, such as they have been accustomed to in the school. They must learn to live on a diet much less varied than that supplied in the school; consisting largely of fish, meat, berries and vegetables. They must not be too proud to see the advantages of the rabbit robe for bedding, and moose or deer skin for outer clothing.\n\nI have always insisted that the education received by the boys in the schools should so develop their intelligence that they should, in a couple of years, be our best trappers, fishermen, trippers and freighters. This does not work out in practice. Doing the work as they grew up appears to be the best apprenticeship. I am of the opinion that I was on the right track some years ago when I asked for and received permission, in conjunction with the school principals, to have the older boys take their vacation in the trapping season, when they could go out and learn how to make the sets and care for the traps and the furs. This plan, however, did not fit into school programmes very well. May I ask that authority be again given to make such arrangements for vacations, and that an effort be made to place the boys with men who are themselves good trappers, and who would be willing to teach the boys how the work should be done. This might be done in individual cases where it would be likely to prove beneficial, and might be applied for the last two or three years of school. Also may I suggest that opportunity be given that assistance in the form of traps and outfit for a part of the first winter be given to graduating boys recommended jointly by the Agent and School Principal. This, of course, on condition that the boy get out and actually trap.\nUntil we are prepared to ration a large proportion of our Indians in this section, I consider we are making a mistake in insisting on the building of homes on the reserves as permanent homes, or on the cultivation of large gardens. The Indian trapper, who has a good home on the reserve, is very loth to leave it for the winter. If he lives on the reserve and journeys out to his traps, his visits are likely to be few, consequently he has dead traps and but little return. If he leaves his family at home, and goes out to camp himself, he will be likely to spend too much time visiting his home. His family will also cost very much more for support, as they will be dependent on store goods. For this reason I am not greatly in favor of assistance to the graduates in the form of house material, at least at the present time. It may appear to be a retrograde movement, so far as civilization is concerned, but self-support and the consequent self esteem I consider is much more important.\n\nThe decrease in grants from both the Department and the Mission Board for the coming year will make the financing of this school increasingly difficult. It is hard to say where cuts in costs can be made without disrupting the organization of the farmgardens, stock, etc., built up by years of effort and expense; or by reducing the staff, either of which would reduce the value of the school training. No increase in pupils, without a corresponding increase in accommodation, should be made. A re-organization from top to bottom might be effective in reducing costs, and if done carefully, need not diminish the value of the work of the institution.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) Wm.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYours of Jan. 31st to hand re milking cows.\n\nWe have eleven milking cows. To my knowledge they have never been tested for bovine tuberculosis. Because they have not been tested and therefore we cannot be sure they are free from disease we scald all the milk and cream we use, both for table use and butter.\n\nWe do not purchase milk from any other source.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.T. Chapin\nNorway House Indian Residential School\n\nA. E. CALDWELL\nPRINCIPAL\n\nCOPY\nPlaced on\nFile_123-5-6\n\nAugust 24th 1943.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI have been expecting to hear through the Agency about the appropriation granted on our 1943 estimates, but to date no information has been received. I am anxious to hear before the end of navigation, which, by the way, may be considerably earlier this year on account of shortage of wood put up on Lake Winnipeg for fuel for the passenger and freight boat.\n\nUnless I can find some means of providing more stabling accommodation for our stock here at Norway House, it is almost a necessity that I dispose of at least some of the stock before winter sets in. I have been keeping some of the stock at the farm at Hope Island during the winter, necessitating the extra employment of a family there. In the present necessity for economy, I find that keeping this extra help will not be possible, even if it were not for the fact that the stable buildings at Hope Island, which are log, are so deteriorated that they are not suitable for winter care of stock. It would be very regrettable to have to dispose of the stock. When I came here two years ago there were only 7 head of milk cattle here, and the Principal had determined to go out of cattle altogether, as being too much expense. I saw some opportunity of overcoming this by undertaking the supply of milk and meat to the hospital. Since that time I have increased our stock so that I have now some nine or ten head of cattle to kill each fall, and plenty of milk for the hospital and the school. Just at present my stock stands as follows:\n\n- 40 head cattle, of all ages.\n- 23 Pigs, including brood sows and boar.\n- 27 Goats, 12 milking.\n- 5 Horses.\n\nMy plan is to winter all this stock (some 9 head of cattle and 20 pigs will be butchered at freeze-up) here at the school, eliminating Hope Island expense. I will require additional space for about ten head of cattle and the goats. Until such time as we can get either a new barn or a proper addition to the old one, lean-to buildings could be used. These could be built with lumber sawed from logs obtained locally, with the addition of shingles. The cost of getting the logs and the building would be approximately $500.00.\n\nThe cattle are a really fine herd, whether it would be better to go to the expense of adequately stabling them cannot be doubted.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6270, file 581-14, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIt would be almost impossible to build up such a herd again under present conditions. Further, the expense of shipping cattle in the fall to supply the Hospital and the school with meat would be almost prohibitive. However, in the present financial situation, where the school is actually operating, or trying to operate, on a 30% increase cost of operation (figuring supplies and wages) with a revenue of 25% less than pre-war, is manifestly impossible, without the most rigid economy. Even with this economy, a deficit is bound to accumulate.\n\nTo complicate matters, the hay supply is most inadequate this year. The water is very high and has covered most of our hay grounds, which are located along the banks of the river and lakes. Where I should have normally at least 100 tons of hay cut up, I will be fortunate this year to get 50. This has had to be cut mainly on islands in Playgreen Lake and has to be hauled in some cases 20 miles. Formerly, during seasons of high water, the Indians were accustomed to cut the hay in the water, spreading it out to dry. This was not uncommon. Under present conditions however, with so much work being available in the harvest fields (over 100 men have left this reserve alone for the harvest) it is impossible to get men to cut hay. However, I am fortunate in having a good crop of oats which will be cut green and stacked. In this way, I may be able to manage, with careful feeding, through the winter. The stabling room, however, is most necessary.\n\nWe have a really fine herd of goats. They have been a distinct liability thus far. I could make some revenue selling the goats milk to the hospital, but the Doctor expects to get the goats milk at the same price as cows milk (until recently we were supplying cows milk to the Hospital at 5\u00a2 per quart, this has now been increased to 10\u00a2). Goats milk sells normally at about 35\u00a2 per quart, and I would rather use it at the school than sell it at such low cost.\n\nWe have been unfortunate in our kid production during the last two years. This year, out of 15 kids, only 3 are nannies. The Billys are useless, of course, except for the small supply of goat meat which they provide. It is impossible to account for this adverse production of kids. I am changing the Billy this year. I have even suggested to Dr. Corrigan that there might be a chance to get some real results with his Vitamins in our goat herd........ but he does not seem to take kindly to the idea.\n\nOur pigs are a real asset. I have a very fine type of Yorkshire and they have done remarkably well considering the very meagre and primitive accommodation we have for them. I wish we could have even a little of the fine accommodation and housing some other schools have.\n\nI wish to make a note of the labour and staff problems. As you know, I received material to erect new outside class-rooms, we to supply all the material and labour that could be obtained here. Owing to the shortage of labour (for logging, hauling and building) I have been as yet unable to build this building. In fact, were the labour available, finances would not permit at present of the expenditure entailed. I have the material supplied stored in the warehouse where it will not deteriorate, and this work will be proceeded with as soon as opportunity affords. In the meantime, I am using the old outside class-room for the senior pupils.\nI have also gone into egg and poultry production, which had not been introduced here. I have had some 40 chickens for over a year, and this year I purchased 200 day old chicks, out of which 170 have matured. Some of these will provide poultry for the hospital, but I will have about 150 in egg production during the winter. It was necessary to build a chicken house, which is partially complete, and needs to be lined and insulated for the winter.\n\nThis gives an outline of our live stock situation. There can be no doubt that our stock has contributed very greatly to the economical operation of the school. I do not know what we would have done during these difficult times had we not built up our live stock during the past two years. I feel that more land, (if it were obtainable within convenient reach of the school) and adequate stabling, is necessary to the continued better operation. What can be done under the present circumstances I do not know, but I am putting the situation before you.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nI don't know whether Mr. Lazenby has taken up with the Department the matter of the construction of a barge to haul wood and hay. I have discussed it with him and he agrees to the necessity. The old barge is useless. I tried to use it this summer in the hauling of wood, but the hull is so rotten that it cannot be kept bailed out. In hauling our hay I purchased two old lake fishing boats (about 30 feet long) these are tied together and a rack put over them on which the hay is piled for hauling, then towed with a gas boat. The whole thing is very primitive, but it is a necessary expedient.\nR A HOEY\nDEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA\nRE MY RECENT LETTER WOULD DEPARTMENT CONSIDER SUPPLYING TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY TONS HAY SHIPPED IN TO CARRY STOCK OVER WINTER STOP COST PROHIBITIVE TO SCHOOL PLEASE REPLY CARE MR HAMILTON AS I WILL BE IN WINNIPEG NEXT WEEK\n\nA E CALDWELL.\n\nOTTAWA, AUGUST 30, 1943.\n\nWRITE A LETTER TO MR.

E. CALDWELL\nPRINCIPAL\n\nMr. M.A. Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI wish to express our appreciation for the assistance which the Department has given the school in the supplying of hay for the wintering of our stock and the lumber for additions to the barn and for the building of the barge for hauling hay and wood. The assistance is particularly gratifying in these times of difficult school financing.\n\nI am in a position now to make a full report on the matter. Our so-called \"farm\" at Hope Island is situated, as you may know, some five miles distant across Little Playgreen Lake at the entrance to the Nelson River. For two years I have had a family employed at this place taking care of the stock during the whole year. I found the situation impracticable, as it meant a duplication of services at the farm and at the school, where it was necessary to keep the milking animals. Also, during the break-up and freeze-up the farm was isolated for a considerable period of time. For instance, ice conditions this fall would have isolated the farm for about two months. Some land had been broken at Hope Island years ago and allowed to revert to sod. To put any crop in there in the spring would necessitate a double outfit of machinery and labour, one there and one at the school. About the only value the farm is to us at present is for grazing of stock during the summer.\n\nIt has been my objective to increase the herd of cattle to a sufficient number to supply milk to the school and the hospital, and also that the increase yearly should provide both these institutions with a complete supply of meat. In the short time of two years this has practically been accomplished, except that, owing to the necessity of depending temporarily on inexperienced Indian labour, the times of breeding have not so far been properly organized to ensure a steady supply of fresh milk. At the present writing we have butchered 10 head of cattle and 14 pigs, weighing 5391 lbs of beef and 2249 lbs of pork. This leaves us with 35 head of cattle of all ages, some of which we will butcher if necessary, and 11 pigs, 7 of which will be butchered next month. There are also 23 female goats and 2 male. I have previously told you of our bad luck in the breeding of these goats in the past two years. We hope for better returns of females next year. The goats are of excellent breed and are in good shape. They have been a full liability thus far but, now that I have accommodation for them here at the school, we can make better use of the milk next year. We also have some 150 pullets raised this year from chicks. These are now starting to lay. A chicken house 16' x 20' was built this year from lumber locally sawn from logs cut by the school.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6270, file 581-14, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFrom lumber supplied by the Department we have completed an addition to the barn 18' x 24' and also a building 12' x 16' for the housing of the goats. The barn itself needs inside renovation and this is yet to be done. I purchased a store building for $150.00 as additional accommodation. This building is in excellent shape and would be good value at $500.00. This has now been moved on to the school property. Altogether, the accommodation is now sufficient and I find it a distinct advantage to have the stock here at the school where it can be under personal supervision.\n\nThe supply of hay received from the Department will be sufficient, with the same 40 tons I was able to get locally, and the good crop of green oats harvested from the land here, to winter the stock through. With the high water this year, all hay had to be cut with scythes, some standing in water. I had to go as far afield as some islands in Big Playgreen Lake, 12 and 14 miles distant, for some of the hay. I do not know what the water conditions will be next year. I hope that more of the hay ground will be uncovered.\n\nI appreciate also the supply of material for the building of the barge. This will be done before open water, in the warmer weather of the early spring. I have had to resort this year to the towing of two old fishing boats for the hauling of hay and wood, and it was a very slow process. The nearest fire-wood we can now get in any quantity is about a 12 mile haul. I find that it is much more economical to haul this wood by barge in the summer rather than have teams hauling during most of the winter. Much of the wood, especially dry wood, is down the Nelson River where it is almost impossible to put a team or a tractor owing to the fast current and resultant weak ice. I have had 200 logs cut for sawing into lumber in that locality since last winter, but have been unable to get them out without a barge. I will not be able to get these sawn until next summer and then the lumber will not be useful for building until it is dried for three or four months.\n\nIncidentally, this condition considerably lessens the value of the local saw mill. It has not been possible to get a sufficient amount of dry lumber ahead so as to be available when needed. I have suggested that it might be profitable to provide an appropriation to the Agency to provide for the cutting of a large quantity of saw logs by the Indians so that dry lumber might be available when needed. The cost of rough lumber in Winnipeg is about $35.00 per M., to which is to be added $12.50 per M. freight. Lumber can be produced at the mill here from locally cut logs for $20.00 per M. The investment would appear to be profitable, as well as providing employment for the Indians.\n\nFish is practically unobtainable this winter. I am getting a small supply from Cross Lake for the school, but it is scarce there also. The fur also is scarce as this is one of the years the rabbits disappear. Should there be any evidences of destitution, which is quite possible before spring, a self-liquidating project such as suggested above would offset direct relief.\n\nMay I again express my thanks for your assistance,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6270, file 581-14, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDecember 28, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Caldwell,\n\nI have your letter of December 4th and in this letter am replying to that portion of it only which deals with the question of having on hand sufficient lumber for the various requirements at the Norway House Agency.\n\nWhen the sawmill was put into operation some assistance was given by the department, after which it was understood that the sawmill would be operated from the proceeds of the sale of lumber.\n\nLast year lumber was seen for a refrigeration plant, which was not built, and this sawing was paid for by the department. The lumber was to be kept at the agency and was to be used at the agency, school, hospital or where required. It was understood that the school or hospital, etc., would be charged up with the lumber used.\n\nThe sum of $200.00 was also furnished to pay the Indians for taking out additional logs, so that it would be possible to supply any needs at Norway House in the way of lumber.\n\nWe are today writing to Mr. Lasenby to find out what lumber is on hand, what use has been made of lumber already sawn, what logs have been taken out, etc. We are also asking for his recommendations and comments on the suggestion that an appropriation be set aside for the taking out of a further supply of logs.\n\nAs soon as I hear from Mr. Lasenby I shall be glad to write you further in the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMr. A.E. Caldwell,\nPrincipal, Indian Residential School,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nActing Director.\nDecember 28, 1943.\n\nP. G. Lazenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Man.\n\nI have received a letter from Mr. Caldwell, Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School, in which he advises that he has had about 200 logs cut for sawing into lumber, but has been unable to get the logs out, consequently will not be able to have them sawn until next summer at which time the lumber will not be useful for building purposes until it has seasoned.\n\nHe states that this condition lessens the value of the local sawmill. It has not been possible, he states, to get a sufficient amount of dry lumber ahead so as to be available when needed. Mr. Caldwell has suggested that an appropriation be secured to pay for taking out logs so that they can be sawn into lumber and a sufficiently large supply kept beyond immediate needs so that lumber will be available when required. He says that lumber can be produced at the mill for $20.00 per M. from locally cut logs, whereas shipped in to Norway House it costs about $55.00 per M. plus $12.90 freight.\n\nIn looking over the files I find that 7,000 ft. B.M. was cut last year for the refrigerating plant which was not built, and that the agency vote paid for the sawing of this lumber as well as for the taking out of the logs and operation of the mill during the time the lumber was being sawn. I also find that we advanced a sum of $200.00 for the purpose of paying for taking out 120 additional logs.\n\nI should like to know how much lumber is on hand, how much of it is suitable for the school needs, how many logs were taken out, and all other information in this regard.\n\nI should also like to know whether further assistance is required in order to keep a supply of lumber on hand at the agency, or whether there is some way this could be financed without departmental assistance.\n\nBefore replying to this letter I would suggest that you discuss the question with the Principal of the School in order to find out what his immediate needs are and future requirements in the way of lumber.\n\nActing Director.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to refer to the Acting Director's letter File 123-5-14 of December 28th last, regarding Mr Caldwell's comments in connection with lumber and the operation of our local sawmill.\n\nAt the present time we have no lumber on hand, and we have loaned to Mr Caldwell 2569 feet of lumber from the stock we did have, which he promised to replace. Part of the lumber loaned to Mr Caldwell came from what we had sawed for the refrigerator and part from lumber sawn from the advance of $200.00 from Welfare account as shown in the statement below. The amount of lumber sawn for the refrigerator was 7,000 feet.\n\nWith reference to the advance of $200.00, for taking out additional logs for lumber, I may say that of this amount I spent $100.00 for 100 logs delivered at the Agency, and an additional $18.75 for labour hired for sawing. Out of the 100 logs, we manufactured 4,740 feet of rough lumber, at a cost of $118.75, which works out at $25.00 per thousand feet. I have an unexpended balance in this account of $81.25. The following statement shows how the 7,000 feet of refrigerator lumber and the 4,740 feet of Welfare lumber has been disposed of:\n\n| Purpose for which lumber used | From Refrigerator | From Welfare |\n|-------------------------------|------------------|-------------|\n| Water intake cribbing         | 2,000 feet       | 1,000 ft.   |\n| Chicken House                 | 1,200            | 750         |\n| Engineer's Residence          | 380              |             |\n| Res. School Roothouse (loaned)| 579              | 1,990       |\n| Agency Roothouse              | 1,000            | 656         |\n| Doctor's Tent House (chickens)| 1,121            |             |\n| Coffins                       |                  | 224         |\n| New Agency Barge              | 720              | 120         |\n\nWith reference to the penultimate paragraph of the Acting Director's letter, I beg to say, that in order to provide a supply of lumber to be kept on hand at the Agency, it will be necessary for the Department to furnish financial assistance to cover the initial cost. In discussing this matter with our engineer Mr Stevenson, we figured that, with an advance of $1,000.00, we can manufacture, something over 40,000 feet of lumber in the rough. This would cover the cost of taking out 1,000 logs, hiring labour for sawing and hauling, and payment of the necessary Provincial Timber dues. We would figure on taking the logs from Sea Falls Island, which is about 17 miles from the Agency. This would involve making 20 trips with the Agency motor boat and barge. In connection with Sea Falls Island, I would refer to the Director's letter (No file number given) of\n\np.t.o.\nSeptember 10th, 1942. The work of taking out these logs would have to be undertaken as soon as possible, before the snow goes, so as to avoid swamping the logs over dry ground. Will you please advise me immediately if the necessary sum of $1,000.00 mentioned above will be provided by the Department. If so, it will be necessary to forward the amount in currency.\n\nOnce we have a good stock of lumber on hand such as the 40,000 feet mentioned, we will no doubt be able to keep this stock pretty well up by crediting the Welfare account with lumber used for Agency or Medical purposes, by charging these two votes at a rate of $25.00 per thousand, which is the cost of manufacture, and with the funds thus accumulated get out more logs and make more lumber. At the present time there is due the Welfare account $44.40 for 1776 feet of lumber at $25.00 per M used for Agency purposes, also, $18.75 for 750 feet of lumber used for Medical purposes. These amounts will be transferred from Administration and Medical accounts respectively as soon as balances in these accounts will permit. These balances are rather low at the present time as it is so close to the end of the fiscal year. When these amounts are transferred back to the Welfare account the latter balance will be $144.40. As shown in the foregoing statement 1,990 feet of lumber has been loaned to the school from this account which will either have to be replaced or paid for at $25.00 per M. The amount used for coffins is of course a direct charge against the Welfare account.\n\nP. G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nNorway House, Man:\n14th August 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI quote herewith from a letter received today from the Principal of the Norway House Residential School:\n\n\"Owing to the extremely high water I shall not be able to cut hay this year with the team of horses. If we use the scythe we shall have to cut the hay standing in waist high water. I have been to look at the hay fields and I find that the water is right up to the willows. This means that I shall have to buy hay from Winnipeg or Selkirk.\"\n\n\"I have 21 head of cattle and 4 head of horses. It will require at least 40 tons of hay to winter them. This involves heavy expense and my funds will not stand this unusual expense. May I therefore ask the Department to pay the freight on the hay I shall have to bring in?\"\n\nWill you please advise me by return mail if the Department will pay the freight as requested by the Principal? The rate of freight from Winnipeg to Norway House is $12.00 per ton, or $480.00 on the 40 tons he requires.\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 29th, 1945.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMr. P.G. Lasenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant, the Department will pay the amount requested for freight on hay to the Norway House Indian Residential School.

Mr. Sacki also at that time was in Upper Canada and I addressed to him a copy of my petition with prayer to a certain who knew he had been presented to the right party. His face looked pale after the matter and minute to me on his return to Toronto, on the 17th of April 1844 as follows: \"Upon subject of a special reserve between the Province and Canada and the Ministry des \u00c9pargnes or more land committed by the Government with greater care and attention than I at first imagined, but cannot say what will be the result, there is much hope and con...\" My petition was submitted to the Executive Council of the agents of the different Reserves as soon as I heard of this, I knew...\nIt once that I wrote back\n& through opposition &c\nindeed I soon received\nthe reply that I had anticipated.\nSome circumstances have however\nproved correct that I was\ncorrect.\n\nThe Indians went to Mr.\nMcCall the place in question\nand became so anxious\nof getting there that, of their\nown accord, they sent de-\nmanding petitions to the govern-\nment to that effect.\n\nI recently received a letter re-\nquesting me to go and see Mr.\nMcCall to prepare the way,\nand the Indians are waiting\nfor me at the Riviere des Pomettes\nLake Mempeyami to talk the\nmatter over. They mention\nit to send a petition in due\nform to the government. Mr.\nMcCall told me that he would\nsupport their petition if\nmade according to his satisfaction.\nThese Indians are also\nvery anxious to have an In-\ndustrial School, in which\ntheir children could receive\nA good education - the same they desire to obtain from the government in adopting the actual reserve of One Creek Lake Manitoba - if I am not mistaken two Indians who are to present the petition in question belong to the Battle Agency, to the Waywayseecappo, to the families and the Selkirk River bands.\n\nThe most favorable place for an industrial school is at the Riviere des Epinette (River Creek) itself or at some other place north or south in the vicinity.\n\nThe reserves which would receive benefit be comprised by this school are:\n\n1. The Reserve of the Riviere des Epinette (One Creek) and the families who would settle in the vicinity.\n2. The Reserve of Doule River (Water-pan-pan).\n3. The Reserve of Lake Hob and Flemish.\n4. The Reserve of Sandy Bay, Lake Manitoba.\n\nThe Indians of these reserves who once abandoned the treaty...\nin order to obtain ships have returned again and although hearing of Bompera I believe they would be glad to send their children to the Riviere des Epinettes there or at Bompera. There are besides some 20 families of Indians formerly of Fort Billy and belonging to the Key band who are at present residing on Shoal Lake and at Swan Lake about 50 miles from the Riviere des Epinettes. These would be glad these Indians will never go to Fort Billy and they would be glad also receive some benefit from this school. But lastly the Catholics of the Keewee-keewa band (Kipkow) of which the reserve of the Riviere des Epinettes is a portion, would be happy to avail themselves of this school. Their reserve would join in from 8 to 9 hundred Indians.\n\nI shall be able to give you before long some further facts. I have heard much from\n\nOnce\nonce the Agent Mr. Maclean spoke of the necessity of an Industrial School for his District and I would not be at all surprised if he had already made some report concerning the favour-\nment in that sense.

Father or Comber that an Industrial School in the interests of the Indians children of Mr. Mortimer's agency be established at Pine Creek; and in reply I beg to submit that the most feasible opinion the scheme proposed by L. Bonkoughart Esq.\n\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nThe current question is impracticable. The proposed location of an industrial school at Pine Creek is the most inaccessible place for such an institution in the agency of Mr. Macdonald, and the expenses in connection with its construction and with the maintenance of the children in attendance would consequently be considerably larger. The land in the vicinity of Pine Creek is low and salty, and not well adapted for farming or even stock-raising, and even if it were, how could the proceeds of any industrial farm be...\nAs marketed. It would cost more than the value of the crop to bring it in to Westminster the nearest point to a railway station. The same remark equally applies to any article manufactured there. The school would likewise be out of reach of medical attendance, inspection &c accepting occasionally at long intervals and therefore the health of the children, and the progress made by them would be almost entirely lost with the consequences of the institutions, and the Department would be largely in ignorance of how it would turn out.\nIt appears to me that it would be utterly impossible to induce eight or nine hundred Indians from the different Reserves in Treaty Nos 2 & 4 to go to live on a Reserve at Pine Creek, and even if it could be accomplished, the Government would have to feed and clothe them there, as they could not possibly raise enough of food nor cattle sufficient fish, game or furs to provide for their wives and families in that district, and even if they could...\nI would still consider it undesirable to break up other bands in Treaties Nos. 2 & 4 and leave their houses and lands which they have more or less improvements thereon, and settle on a Reserve at Pine Creek where the Indians of the band living there for years did not raise any crops whatever last year.\n\nWould it not be an infinite better scheme to increase the accommodations at the St. Boniface Industrial School which is already established and most successful.\nfully conducted by an efficient staff of teachers, and send all the Catholic children available in the Mission agency there.\n\nI have the honor to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

First, to allow us three hundred dollars ($300) for the teaching or tuition of the children, without any reference to the average of the children, because experience teaches (Referring to Mr. Denchey, Director of Touchwood Mills' Boarding School) that it is impossible to obtain a sufficient number of pupils attending regularly.\n\n2. Secondly, that the usual grant of $60 per child boarding in the school be given to us from this fall (1894).\n\nAnd your petitioners shall not cease to pray.\n\nJ. Allard, Administrator\nC.D. Langerin\n\nMontreal\nArchbishop's Palace\n19 September 1894\nDear Mr. Reed,\n\nThe enclosed petition letters were handed me here today by Mr. Justice Chamberlain who came up from Winnipeg on purpose to see me about the matter. He informed Justice C. that as far as ignorance or those who vote stood for the schools in this agency should not give him a definite reply but would write you advice in that year that if we had the funds to comply with petition signatures he all they will do whatever can. Also let them know what you can do otherwise mankind shall be treated as he desires. If Mr. Justice Chamberlain does not take them Wednesday you should come at half Monday from so late.

If we can get fifteen day scholars besides the ten boarders, but we beg leave to say immediately that there were only eleven or twelve children attending the day school on an average, and if we take five out of that number for the Boarding School it will be absolutely impossible to secure an army of fifteen day scholars consequently we ask respectfully that $300 three hundred dollars.\nbe granted to us for tuition irrespective of the number of children.\n\nBelieve me, dear Sir,\nyour humble servant,\n\nA.D.

This would make the total provision for boarders at the rate of $72 per annum, while payment for three quarter on the Return and requisition forwarded was at the rate of $60 per cap only, or for maintenance alone. Payment has therefore been made to the ten boarders on the roll at $3 each per cap for September and a Cheque for the sum of $30 has been sent the Rev.

When I reopened the Boarding School here at Pic about two years ago the conditions were as follows: $5.00 a month for every Boarder, and $1.00 a month per child for tuition and this as well as for the Boarders as for the Day pupils. Last year...\nduring June and September Quarters I was not allowed anything for the tuition of the boarders although $30.00 were due to me for each quarter. In my school report of January 1896 I mentioned the fact to the Indian Department. Since then I received thirty dollars. So thirty dollars are still due to me for one of these two quarters for the tuition of the boarders. I hope this fact will receive immediate attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Forget,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to draw the attention of the Indian Department to the following fact. So far we have been allowed fifteen boarders in our school at Pine Creek. As my School report shows I have more than twenty boarders. So more than five children are at my own expense. Moreover a good many other Indians ask me to take their children. I have to refuse them, having no funds. As our present boarding school house is large enough for thirty boarders I beg the Indian Department to take the matter into consideration and grant me thirty boarders. This would be a great benefit to the Indians who really appreciate the necessity of education and a great encouragement to us.\n\nBelieve me yours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nM. J. [Last Name], Ptr.

He is, however, at the same time advised that the application for increased number will be duly considered in connection with next year's estimates.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nCommissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you that the Pine Creek Boarding School, hitherto in charge of the Rev.

A. Chaumont, Principal of the Pine Creek Boarding School, both endorsed by the Archbishop of St. Boniface, in one of which he urges that provision be made for twenty pupils at his school, where at present the grant is allowed for only fifteen; and in the other letter he states that the school buildings are getting old and that a new building is needed, and he proposes to put up a new school-house worth $6000 if the Department will contribute $2000 towards the cost; both of which letters were answered by the Indian Commissioner in the sense that the applications will receive consideration in connection with the preparation of the estimates. I beg to report that at present there are two boarding schools in the Manitowah Agency, both under the Roman Catholic Church, namely, at Pine Creek and Water Hen River, besides nine day schools, four of which are also under that church, while the five others are under the Church of England. The grants to the two boarding schools are the same, namely, $72 per capita for fifteen pupils.\n\nMr. H. Martineau, the Indian Agent for the district in question, makes the following remarks on education in his annual report to the 30th June last:\n\nSandy\nSandy Bay Reserve, Treaty No. 1.\n\n\"Educational. There are in all about ninety children of school age, and the average attendance for the year has been thirty-five. There is only one school, under the management of one competent teacher, and it is of the Roman Catholic denomination. The following is the course of studies taught in this school, English, writing, arithmetic, geography, reading, elocution, history, vocal music, calisthenics, religious instruction, ethics (the practice of cleanliness, obedience, order, neatness, right and wrong, truth, independence, self-respect, reasons for proper behaviour, and appearance, industry, honesty, thrift,) and general knowledge. The last head embraces facts concerning things in school, days of the week, months, seasons, measures of length and weight in common use, colours, animal and vegetable kingdoms, their parts and uses, cultivation, growth, etc., money, the useful metals, use of railways, canals and ships, etc., manufacture of articles in common use, the races of man. All the above mentioned studies are taught as far as Standard IV in this school. The school is properly lighted and heated, and the hygienic conditions are all that could be desired. It is provided with the requisite number of desks, table, chairs, blackboard, cupboard, etc., and also with a sufficient quantity of school materials, books, and biscuits. It will easily accommodate sixty pupils. The discipline maintained is good, and the progress of the pupils is, on the whole, satisfactory. Quite a few boys and girls\n\n(2) were\nwere sent from here to the St. Boniface Industrial School during the year, and the parents are willing to send some more when there is room. I am pleased to note that the parents seem anxious that their children should put in their time at school.\"\n\nLake Manitoba Reserve, Treaty No. 2.\n\n\"Education. There are thirty-two children of school age. The average attendance is about nine. During severe winter weather it is impossible for them to attend. As a rule they are well supplied with clothing. The holidays are taken to suit the absence of the Indians, thus filling the full number of school days (two hundred and sixteen) required by the Department. The teacher is competent and energetic. The program of studies furnished by the Department is followed, and the pupils are advanced to Standard II. The school is of the Roman Catholic denomination. The new school house has been completed this year, and is conducive to the health and comfort of the pupils.\" The school is well supplied with materials, etc., the progress of the pupils is fair and the discipline and behaviour good.\"\n\nEbb and Flow Lake Reserve.\n\n\"Education. There are eleven children of school age, and an average attendance of eight. The school is situated in the centre of the reserve, and the children have only a short distance to go, the longest distance being one mile. The teacher is competent, and the general course of studies prescribed by the Department is followed as far as Standard IV. There is only one school, and that is of the Roman Catholic\n\n(3) denomination,\n\"denomination. The school is well equipped with all \"necessary books, materials, etc., and is well heated \"and comfortable. The progress is good, as is also \"the discipline and order.\"\n\nFairford Reserve.\n\n\"Educational.

The average \"attendance is twenty-nine, which would be better but \"for the state of the river. As a rule the clothing \"is good, owing to the free distribution of clothes \"by the Church Missionary Society. The teachers are \"competent and discharge their duties satisfactorily. \"The programme of studies furnished by the Department \"is followed as far as Standard IV at the lower school \"and Standard V at the upper school. Progress is \"good. Both schools are under the auspices of the \"Church of England. The schoolhouses are provided \"with the requisite number of books, materials, etc. \"The discipline at both schools is very good. The \"parents, having received the benefit of a primary \"school established about forty years ago by the Church \"of England, are alive to the advantages of education \"and take great interest in the education of their \"children.\"\n\nSandy Bay Reserve.\n\n\"Educational. There are twenty-three children of \"school age and an average attendance of fifteen, \"which is fairly good considering that many of these \"Indians and their families are still living at the \"lower mouth of the Little Saskatchewan River, and \"many of the pupils have quite a distance to walk.\n\nThe\n\n(4)\n\"The school is of the Church of England denomination, and the same course of studies is taught as on the other reserves.

There are twenty-four children of school age, and an average school attendance of twelve. The low average is caused from poor clothing in the winter and families being away from the reserve hunting in the spring, fishing in the winter, and visiting during the summer. The schoolhouse is kept in very good order by a competent teacher. The course of studies is the same as taught on the other reserves. The school is of the Church of England denomination. The equipment of furniture, books, material, etc., is all that is requisite. Order and discipline are well maintained.\"\n\nGrand River Reserve.\n\nEducation. There are thirteen children of school age and an average attendance of eight. The school is of the Church of England denomination and is kept in good order.

There are thirty children of school age\nhere with an average attendance of thirteen for the\nday school and fifteen for the boarding school.\nBoth schools are under the able management of Mr.\nand Mrs. Adam, are of the Roman Catholic denomination,\nand are a credit both to teachers and pupils. Eng-\nlish is fluently spoken by the scholars and the girls\nreceive instruction in the arts of house-keeping,\nsewing, knitting, cooking, making dresses, etc.\nThe progress is very satisfactory, and order and\ndiscipline are well maintained.

Nevertheless I will take the liberty of suggesting that the long and excellent services of M. Isa\u00efe Adam, the present school teacher at Water Hen's River, be recognized.

C. Boarding School at Water Hen River Reserve, Manitowap Agency, and the transfer of the pupils of that institution to the school at Pine Creek.\n\nMy reasons for making this recommendation are that the two schools are only about thirty miles apart, and the desire of most of the parents that they would like the children to attend at Pine Creek where the facilities for taking care of the pupils is so much better than at Water Hen.\n\nAs you are aware the authorities of the R. C. C. have lately erected a very large and substantial school building at Pine Creek, with accommodation for 100 pupils, this school is operated by a number of Sisters of the Church under the management of Revd. Father Chaumont, and is in every sense a desirable institution for the training of Indian youth.\n\nI have further to report that the closing of the Water Hen School meets with the approval of the Church, and it would appear that the new school building at Pine Creek was erected with the idea of gathering R. C. pupils altogether at that point.\n\nHonorable David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nFrom my own observation I have never been able to see why two boarding schools of the same denomination were located so close together.\n\nAs the Water Hen Boarding School is not named, or recognized, as such, by the order in council relating to the education of Indian children, 1894, under section II of Cap. 32, 57-58-Victoria, I presume you have full power to deal with the matter.\n\nIf this recommendation meets with your approval I would suggest that the school be closed at the end of the present fiscal year, and the per capita grant\u2014if any\u2014be transferred to the Pine Creek School, less sufficient to operate a day school at Water Hen, providing enough children of school age remain on the reserve to make it worth while.\n\nShould you decide that it is not advisable to close the school I would strongly recommend that the Church authorities be advised to procure a new principal for the institution, as from my own observations, and reports received from undoubted authority, Mr. Adam, the principal\u2014from his intemperate habits, and for other serious reasons, is unfit for the position.\n\nFor confirmation of this, I would refer you to Revd. Father Camper of St. Laurent, who appears to be the ecclesiastical head of Indian educational work in the district, and a man whom I think has the confidence of all who come in contact with him.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd.) S. R. Marlatt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to forward a copy of a letter from Mr. Inspector Marlatt urging the amalgamation of the Pine Creek and Water Hen Boarding Schools. The reasons given are of the best and the present boarders of Water Hen as well as the authorities at Pine Creek will be the gainers if the change is effected. I, consequently, concur with Mr. Marlatt and beg to submit the scheme to the favorable and early consideration of the Department. The Inspector justly points out that the school has never been declared in existence by Order-in-Council, and therefore may go out of existence without the matter being referred to the Council, Ref. No. 8, of Regulations relating to Education passed under S. II. Cap. 32-57-58 Vic.\n\nI also concur in Mr. Marlatt's opinion that a Day School should be kept open, if a satisfactory daily attendance can be secured and would like that the provision for Day pupils attending the Boarding School, viz., 15 pupils at $12.00 be used for that purpose. This will enable us to carry on the work until early next spring when it will be possible to provide, if it is found advisable, funds to complete the year in the Supplementary Estimates or out of the General Vote.\n\nSecretary,\n\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAs Mr. Marlatt will visit the place at the end of August and will be out of our reach by the 10th. of July next, I am anxious to have your instructions, so that I may ask him to arrange for the removal.\n\nI may close by saying that His Grace the Archbishop of St. Boniface agrees entirely with the scheme.\n\nThe Department is in possession of the details of the large building erected at Pine Creek, and will be satisfied that there is ample accommodation there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Commissioner,\nOTTAWA, 21st June, 1900.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant forwarding a copy of a letter from Mr Inspector Marlatt urging the amalgamation of the Pine Creek and Water Hen River Boarding schools; and in reply I beg to say that as far back as the 5th December last Mr Marlatt was advised that the Department approved of this course and would agree to maintain a day school at Water Hen River, if a sufficient number of day pupils remained on the Reserve after the removal of the children from the Boarding school to the Pine Creek Boarding school.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir\n\nJ.

Adam in which he makes certain allegations regarding school returns of the Roman Catholic Boarding School at Pine Creek. In connection with this matter I beg to report as follows:\n\nI visited, and inspected the school on the 3rd of August last, at that time all the grant earners enrolled were in attendance and a very considerable number in excess of those provided for.\n\nThe school at that time was in a very satisfactory condition, and I have had no adverse reports from that time. I do not for one moment believe that the Principal would make a false return as I have always found him upright and honourable.\n\nThis Mr. Adam is the late principal of the R.C. boarding school at Water Hen River, when the boarding school was closed he was retained as day school teacher until the 30th of June last when he was discharged on the request of his Church and my recommendation.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nHe is at war with his Church, and has great enmity towards the principal of the Pine Creek School. To my certain knowledge Adam is an unprincipled scamp, and is not worthy of the slightest consideration, that he is all that I say he is, I can prove over his own signature.\n\nHow he got his information as to returns being irregular? I am sure the Principal would not show them to him, he did not see them in this office, and I do not think he would get any information in Winnipeg.\n\nHowever, if Mr. Adam will make specific charges, so as I can have something to work on, and you consider it advisable, I will go to Pine Creek and make a thorough investigation. If returns are being cooked we want to know it.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOTTAWA, 5th December, 1901.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 11th ultimo I beg to say that after enquiry into the statements made by you respecting the manner in which the returns from the Pine Creek boarding school for September quarter last were made out, the Department has come to the conclusion that you have been mis-informed.\n\nIf, however, you are prepared to make specific charges further investigation will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Dec. 4th 1901.\n\nTo the Secretary\nDepartment of the Interior Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to ask of the Department of the Interior the privilege of cutting logs to make about 7,500 feet of lumber on Section 33, Tq. 33, R.20, for the following purposes:\n\n1st To build stables. We have at Pine Creek a large Boarding school. This necessitates a good herd of cattle to sustain the school and teach the children how to raise cattle.\n\n2nd. We need fences around the school.\n\n3rd There are also some other buildings needed as a wash house store & sheds.\n\nAs the lumber is very expensive here on account of the freight charges I intend to have a saw mill which mill could as well be used to saw lumber for the Indians of the Reserve. As this mill means a great improvement as well as for the reserve as for the school I feel confident that the favor asked for will be granted.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) W. Chamont, Principal.\nSir,\n\nI am directed to enclose herewith a copy of a letter from Mr. S. Chanmont, Principal of the Pine Creek Boarding School at Winnipegosis, in which he asks to be granted the privilege to cut 75,000 feet of lumber on Section 33, Township 33, Range 20, West of the 1st Meridian, for purposes connected with this School. It is assumed that this School is connected with an Indian Farm under the supervision of your Department and before Mr. Chanmont's application receives consideration I would be glad to be advised on this point.

A school return is a public document for which we pay, and your refusal left me with a bad impression and suspicions. Instead of trying to get some important information you prevent the truth from coming to light. I know very well that the Department is highly feared of the Roman Catholic clergy, but I am not and cannot allow them to coin money at the expense of the public to satisfy their prejudices and ambition under the guise of doing some good to the Indians. Nothing but a copy of the\nreturn asked for will satisfy me that you have\na desire to act honestly.

Children under age take a run to the school in morning or afternoon and can't say A.B.C. and those over age are kept washing floors, cooking, baking, sewing etc., and never attend the school\u2014they can hardly read and write and some of them are at the respectable age of about twenty-five years.\n\nOf course L.J.

Mr. Marlatt is of the opinion that the request for cutting timber for the purposes mentioned is highly advisable. The Pine Creek School is one of our best conducted schools. The Church authorities have spent a much larger amount of money on the existent buildings than has been done anywhere else in this part of the country, and although they have received the usual Government aid for buildings, this in proportion is much smaller than that given to other institutions.

There is no such land in the neighborhood convenient for such purpose - the land in our surroundings being marshy and salty. The sections belonging to the various Companies are hardly better; and for such cause I am compelled to demand a whole section in order to have about sixty acres of cultivable land.\n\nHoping to have that request granted by your benevolent mediation, I have the honor to be,\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) P.

Agt.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\nPortage la Prairie,\nJanuary 26th 1904.\n\nRef: Your letter January 25th 1904, No. 122/52.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of above date regarding additional land for the Pine Creek Boarding School, I beg to say that the land upon which the school is at present located is 160 acres owned by the Church, and adjoins the reserve, consequently section 23 will be about 2 miles distant, and section 26 about 1 mile.\n\nThe school quarter section is not fit for agricultural purposes as it is one mass of boulders, small and large.\n\nUndoubtedly it is township No. 34, not 24, that the Principal refers to.\n\nIf I may express my opinion candidly in the matter, I am averse to granting the school more land for agricultural purposes, because it is well known that those Indians are not inclined to agriculture. They take little interest in their gardens outside of potatoes, and it is difficult to get them to take care of their cattle during the winter.\n\nThe local district is not favorable to grain growing, as with the frozen lake on one side and swamps and marshes on the other, the springs open up too late for seeding.\n\nThe fishing and hunting are both good up there yet, with every probability of remaining so for many years.\n\nThe Honorable David Laird,\nIndian Comm.,\nWinnipeg.\nSir,\n\nI transmit herewith copy of letter from the Principal of the Boarding School at Pine Creek, applying for more land to be secured for the use of the School there, together with Mr. Agent Swinford's report on application and plan of the school land and the land applied for.\n\nIn view of the Agent's report I can scarcely advise the Department to purchase for the School a section of land, on which according to Father Bousquet's own showing there would be only sixty acres of cultivable land.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, transmitting an application for more land from the Principal of the Pine Creek boarding school; and in reply I beg to say that the Department concurs in your view that in the face of the Agent's report, it would be unwise to purchase a section of land for this school.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Com.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to submit to the Department of Indian Affairs the following request:\n\nThe country along Lake Winnipegosiss is getting settled. Hay lands should be secured at once for the use and benefit of the Pine Creek Boarding School for the following reasons:\n\n1st. As in this part of the country the land does not admit much farming, the Indian children should above all learn to raise cattle.\n\n2nd. The school could not be sustained without it.\n\nI beg to ask of the Department the privilege of buying the section (34) thirty four, township (34) thirty four, Range (20) twenty. Most of it is hay land. There is a kind of a lake or marsh which covers about a quarter of it. As it is for an Indian Boarding School I hope the price will be as low as possible.\n\nI may add that according to the Surveyor's report, only the south half of the above mentioned section is surveyed. Nevertheless a line has been drawn running south & north, east and west on the whole section thirty four. But as the work of the last half mile had not completely been done, the surveyor did not report on it.\n\nI dare say this will be no objection to the sale of the whole section thirty four.\n\nI remain, yours truly,\n\n(Sgd) A. Chammont, Pte.\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose a copy of a letter from the Principal of the Pine Creek Boarding School re additional land to be used in connection with the above institution. As will be seen the Principal proposes to buy the land, but wishes the price to be as low as possible. I beg to request you to have the matter submitted to the Department of the Interior with the best recommendation you can give to secure a low rate per acre, as the land is required for an Indian Boarding School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept.

The land is required to be used in connection with the said school. On this account it is hoped that your Department will place as low a value on the land as possible.\n\nIt would appear from the Surveyor's report that only the South half of the said Section was surveyed. The Rev. Father Chamont states, however, that the lines bounding the entire Section were actually run on the ground.\n\nI shall feel obliged if you will kindly inform me on what terms the said Section may be purchased.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.G.

But when passing the reserve last Summer, on our way up the lake, Inspector Mariatt and I both made close observation of what timber was in sight. So far as we could see the reserve was covered with scrub and brush, with scattered trees of spruce and poplar, and small clumps at long intervals that would be classed as timber.

One might take the first three grades, and the other the three higher. Each would then have about an equal division of the pupils, and could concentrate their attention on a narrower scope of work, and consequently produce better results. At present one teacher has 49 pupils and the other 26, and both cover the same ground.\"\n\nThe Department considers that Mr. McKenna's suggestion is a good one and I would ask you to take the necessary steps to have it carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

The Pine Creek Boarding School meets the requirements of this new agreement. According to Mr. J.H. Lockton who inspected this school, the two class rooms used before the inspection are capable of accommodating forty children.\n\nMr. Lockton suggested to put a partition in the chapel making a class-room 46 by 22' capable of accommodating forty-one children. So far as the chapel is needed for the service on Sunday only a thick and strong curtain is used as a partition in this new class-room. In the fall when the church which we are building is finished a wooden partition will be put up in the chapel.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Then the Pine Creek School would be about on the same standing as other schools where the Agent lives on the same reserve.

This way it would be very easy for the boys and girls to get into the two class-rooms from their respective recreation-rooms. In this case the sisters would occupy the portion of the old chapel which was intended for and is actually occupied as a class-room.\n\nIn regard to the isolation hospitals, on account of the great difficulties which we would have to locate them in the shop near the schoolhouse, we would like to have it located inside of the school building, as it has been arranged for the school at Touchwood, Fort Alexander, etc.\n\nI enclose a sketch which will show exactly how we would like to have these different apartments distributed on the second floor.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am not experienced enough in educational affairs to present to you, sirs, a good outline of the work being done, I can only report what I see, and the work done at Pine Creek is, I believe very creditable to those in charge. I have had the pleasure of visiting the Brandon Indian School on several occasions and although the children there, were excessively neat on Sunday more so than at Pine Creek, yet when occasion demands I find that this Pine Creek School can show a group of natives as well cared for as other schools that I have had the pleasure to visit.

The death of Father Chaumont, of Pine Creek Boarding School (which untimely death occurred on 10th of last March) necessitated a fresh appointment.

It is true they go into the school room and spend their time, one boy said he was at school since he was fifteen, he could talk English but did not know the alphabet. I was not testing his education when I found this out, I was trying to recruit the young man for the Army.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nsir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgn. A.E.

At the time of my report, the agency was new and I was unaware of the idea that he was a treaty Indian and I knew he had been at the mission for a number of years and was very much taken aback when he spoke English fairly well but did not know the alphabet. I asked him if he was attending the school at Pine Creek and he said yes and thus I thought it my duty to report the case.\n\nSir, I do not wish you to infer that this mission is not doing its duty by the Indians; I believe that it is better now than it has been in the past and that it is improving. My opinion may be wrong, but I would suggest more practical tuition along the lines of the purely industrial type where the opportunity is ripe here. They would be better educated and more self-supporting and I believe at less expense.\n\nI have the & be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.J.

The Chief says when the boys come out they are all liars, thieves, and do nothing but run after the girls, when the girls come out that are all liars, thieves, and do nothing but run after the boys. The Priest is not a God fearing man, the Government might as well burn the money as support this school, what the Chief now wants is a day school where the children can come home every night.

At the present time but little time is spent in teaching the Indian children reading, writing, and arithmetic. Instead of this being done the children are employed as labourers the major part of the time on the farm of the Roman Catholic Priest who is in charge of the boarding school. It is not the desire of the children's parents that the children be so employed. On the contrary it is the parents' desire that the children be taught the English language, reading, writing, and arithmetic.\n\nThe writer is authorized to sign this letter on behalf of the Pine Creek Band of Indians, and as stated above it is at their request that I am forwarding this letter to your Department.\n\nI trust that this communication will have the effect that at the investigation to be held this matter will be carefully looked into.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nFrank Flatfoot\nOttawa, June 19, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to conditions at the Pine Creek Indian Boarding School.

I consider this is a good training for the boys.\n\nThis man Frank Flatfoot is an agitator is always trying to make trouble at the school and among the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Ass'y Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nPine Creek Indian Reserve,\nCamperville, Post Office,\nManitoba, July 18th, 1923.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 13th ultimo. My people respectfully await your further advice regarding the holding of an investigation into the matters complained of regarding the conducting of affairs on this Reserve, and the character of the present Chief. When Agent Ogletree was here at Treaty payment time he made an attempt to hold an investigation but the members of the Band paid little attention to him because they are awaiting the coming of Commissioner Grahame to hold an impartial investigation. My people therefore earnestly hope that the promise given to Mr. W. J. Ward by the Department there at Ottawa that an investigation will be held by Commissioner Grahame will be fulfilled.\n\nI have a matter in which I am personally concerned that I ask your aid in bringing to a conclusion satisfactory to me. About a year ago I took action against a white man for the seduction of a daughter of mine. Police Magistrate T. H. Whale of Winnipegosis gave judgment against the white man and the sum of $200.00 was placed in the hands of Agent Ogletree to be paid to me at the rate of $5.00 per month for use in the maintenance of the child borne by my daughter. There remains now of this money the sum of $140.00 in the Bank of Montreal at Portage la Prairie, Manitoba. I have asked Agent Ogletree to let me have the full amount of this $140.00 at once so that I may invest it in milking cows now that they can be bought at a low price. Each Saturday a gasoline boat calls at this Reserve and collects Cream for the Winnipegosois Creamery. If I can get the money into my hands I can buy seven cows and by selling cream obtain a revenue of $12.00 to $15.00 a week. If the money remains in the Bank to be doled out to me at the rate of $5.00 per month at the end of 2\u00bd years it will all be spent and there will be nothing to show for the money at the end of that time. Therefore I consider that it would be much better invested in cows at their present low price so that a revenue may be obtained from the investment and the capital still remain intact. I want to impress on you the fact that I am a man of good schooling in the English language and ways of doing business, and if I can get that $140.00 into my hands it will not be squandered but on the contrary will be invested in cows as hereinbefore stated. I hope that you will instruct Agent Ogletree to remit me the $140.00 at once, and I take this opportunity of thanking you in advance for your so doing.\n\nThis Spring I suffered the loss of my buildings ex-\ncept the home, and some of my fencing around my place. I asked Agent Ogletree if he could obtain some aid from the Department for me to help me get my buildings again erected, but up to now I have not heard from him anything in connection with the matter. I may say that at a previous time I was aided by the Department to the extent of $100.00 when I had suffered the loss by fire of all of my family's effects and our buildings. I hope therefore that I will again receive some aid in a similar way.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nFrank Flatfoot\nOttawa, July 24, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with further reference to your request for an investigation into conditions at the Pine Creek Indian Boarding School. I have to inform you that, following the receipt of your communication of the 26th of May, the Department made certain enquiries, and I wish to state that it is not our intention to make any special investigation at this time.\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter, requesting that the sum of $140, held in trust by Mr. Agent Ogletree, be paid to you in a lump sum, I have to inform you that the judgment of the court was that this money was to be paid at the rate of $5 per month; and I regret to state that the Department can take no action in this connection.\n\nI have also noted that you have suffered some loss in connection with your property. All applications for relief should be submitted to Mr. Indian Agent Ogletree. In future, all requests should be directed through the office of our representative in Portage la Prairie.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Scott, Esq.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nThis is the third year I have been corresponding with you. To make certain appointments, or our recent talk.\n\nI have pointed out to you that the children going to the boarding school are not being taught as they should. They are kept doing all manner of work. The boys clean all the stables, haul wood, etc., the girls milk cows, etc. They take this up with the Rev. Fathers in charge, and tells me that he has orders from the Indian Dept. to keep the children in school half terms & make them work the balance of the time. Now we were told to understand, the children were to be educated, not go to school to learn how to clean stables. No doubt you are aware that the progress is very slow compared with other schools.\n\nThe band elected a chief in Mr. Campbell, and this is his fourth term. Before the first term expired, we feared we had chosen the\nWrong man, we have tried times too\nmany of the Indians first to make a change, but\nwithout result.\n\nNow is there no way I\novercoming this trouble, does the Indian Office\nhave authority to appoint a chief?\n\nIf the present chief was doing his duty we\nwould not ask for any change.\n\nWe do not see why the priest in charge of\nthe R.C. mission, or the Indians itself, uses their\ninfluence in such matters.\n\nI think it is up to the Band to make the\nappointment without outside influence.\n\nRegarding other things I wrote you, you\nwill see that I am right if you want\nback into the water.\n\nI am writing this out\nwith the intention of making trouble\nbut for better conditions, so as\na whole, & to make our Reserve\na place to live in be more pleasant.\n\nHoping to hear from you\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In reply I have to inform you that you would be well advised to direct your letters to the Indian Agent at Portage la Prairie. Our local representatives are acquainted with conditions on the individual reserves and can attach their recommendations to communications for the Department.\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your letter, relative to the duties and privileges of children enrolled in the Pine Creek Indian Residential School. It is this Department's wish and ruling that the children spend at least five half days per week in the classrooms; and you should understand that on the other half days the older pupils are expected to be in one of the departments, performing household and farm duties and receiving vocational training.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Flatfoot, Esq.,\nPine Creek Indian Reserve,\nCamperville, Man.\nPine Creek Indian Reserve\nCampbellville Post Office\nJanuary 3/1924\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of November 27th last, it is unfortunate but true that letters addressed to the Indian agent Mr. Aglukkaq at Pointe La Prairie are seldom replied to and it seems are not given attention by him. This is the reason for communications being sent direct to you by \u2014\u2014 this Band of Indians.\nThis Band of Indians.\n\nWith reference to the second paragraph of your letter relative to the Department policy in the conduct of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, there is no question that that policy is directly contrary to the desires of the members of this Band. There is absolutely no benefit to be derived from the attempt to teach Indian boys farming methods. Very little of the land of this Reserve is adapted to farming, being too low and wet. In addition Indians as a class...\nnever will become farmers. Their tradition, inclinations and environment here are such that their minds will never become trained to farming. This refers to this Reserve in particular. Here we are fishermen, trappers and hunters and such we will remain regardless of any attempt to teach our sons farming. Our sons require to be schooled and educated in the English language and methods of doing business in order that they may gain some knowledge of how to successfully cope with the white men.\nin the marketing of fish and furs which commodities will remain our products here until the end of the chapter. For this reason it is desirable that our children spend the entire five days per week in the classrooms in exactly the same way as the children of the white people do, so that our children may learn reading, writing, arithmetic and business methods in the English language in exactly the same way as the children of the white people.\nIn my own case I am the father of two boys. I have requested the Priest here to allow my boys to attend the classes in the school when being held but when the classes are not being held I want the boys at home with me to help me with whatever work I have to do. The Priest states that he cannot agree to this as he has to follow instructions he receives & presume from the Department at Ottawa. I ask that in any case instructions be given to the Priest.\nthat my request be\nacceded to.\nTrusting that this\nwill make the matter\nclear to you and con-\nsideration will be given,\n& remain,\n\nYours respectfully\n\nFrank Flatfoot\nOttawa, Jan. 24, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with further reference to the Pine Creek Indian Residential School and in reply I wish to refer you to my communication of November 27th, last. The Pine Creek Indian Residential School is guided in its activities by the wishes and rulings of this Department. The routine cannot be disturbed by any special privilege for your children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMrs Frank Flatfoot,\nPine Creek Indian Reserve,\nCamperville, Man.\nJanuary 15th,\n\nPERSONAL\n\nMr Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Mr Scott:-\n\nI have been requested by the Rev Fr Beys O.M.I. to make alterations in the proposition placed before the Department in connection with the purchase of Pine Creek Indian Boarding School from the Oblate Fathers.\n\nOur original estimate was for $83,000.00 as follows:\n\nSchool building, 115'x49', all stone, 4 stories: $61,000\nGranaries, 100'x36', metal roofed: $5,000\nBarn: $4,000\nStone shop, Blacksmith shop, Sheds, etc.: $4,000\nFarm Implements: $4,000\nLive stock (Cattle, Horses, Hogs.): $3,000\nLand (160 acres): $2,000\n\n$83,000\n\nRev. Fr Beys, having been advised by a committee of Principals that the quantity of land proposed for sale was insufficient for the school requirements, asks me to propose to the Department to buy from the Oblate Fathers, the four lots (instead of one) immediately adjoining the school, for the price of $6,000, thus making the sale price of said school: $89,000. Those four lots form a solid piece of land of about 640 acres. They are marked in blue on the annexed plan. The other lots farther away from the school and also marked in blue as well as many other lands the Oblate Fathers possess in the vicinity would be retained by the Oblate Fathers as those\nlands are not deemed necessary for the proper running of the school.\n\nThe Oblate Fathers would except from the land above offered the part (designed in red on the plan) on which the Church is built, amounting to approximately 3 acres.\n\nHoping that the above proposition will meet with your kind approval and will receive consideration in the Estimates, I remain\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJoseph [signature]\nFebruary 7, 1924.\n\nDear Father Guy:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th ultimo, in which you propose that the Department purchase from the Oblate Fathers certain parcels of land which were not considered in the earlier negotiations concerning the purchase of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I wish to state that certain provision has been made in the estimates for the coming fiscal year, and, if the item is allowed, I am convinced that the necessary adjustment can be made.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Jos. Guy, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOttawa, Ont.\nPine Creek Indian Reserve\nCamperville P.O. Feb 6th 1924\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd ultimo. For your information I may say that I am the father of six daughters all of whom have attended the Pine Creek Residential School. Four are now married. The whole six of them have not learned anything of any value to them at this school here. I am the father of two boys both of whom are in attendance at this school and they are not learning anything of any value to them. What I am going to do now is take those boys away from this school and send them to a school elsewhere they can get an education that will help them to obtain a living in the future in competition with the white people. I consider myself justified in taking\nThis step since the Department will not recognize complaints against the policy of the conduct of the Residential School here. I do not believe that anything can be done to compel the sending of my boys to this school here.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nFrank Hatfoot\nOttawa, February 19, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of another letter from Frank Flatfoot, in which he states that six of his daughters have attended the Pine Creek Residential School and that he has two boys in the school at the present time. He further states that his children have not profited by their attendance at this school.\n\nIn checking the returns from the Pine Creek Residential School, the name \"Flatfoot\" does not appear. If his boys are in the school at the present time they must be entered under their Indian name and I would request you to furnish me with their Indian name and also any other information that you may have available regarding this man and his children.\n\nIt is probable that Flatfoot will apply to the principal for the discharge of his sons, whom he states are in the school, and you should advise the principal at once that if he does so, their discharge must not be allowed until official approval is given by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Feb. 28, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to your sons, Louis and Rodolphe, who are enrolled at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School. I regret to inform you that the Department cannot approve of their discharge from the school until they have reached the age of discharge. The Indian Agent and the Rev. Principal have been so informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Flatfoot Esq.,\nPine Creek Indian Reserve,\nCamperville, Man.\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\n11th March 1924\n\nSir,\n\nI am instructed by the Department to advise you to cease your interference with the work of the Chief, Gambler and the Indian Agent.\n\nIf there is any more trouble with you on the Reserve, I will advise the Department to have you removed from the Reserve.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nFrank Flatfoot, Esq.,\nCamperville, Man.\nI am in receipt of your letter of Feb 28. I do believe you have misunderstood my letter\u2014for I did not mean that I wanted to draw my children away from school altogether. I meant that I want my children sent to another school. I want my children sent to the Pas school, that school conducted by Mr. Charleton. I know they would be use right at that school. I am going to leave this reserve altogether. I am going up the northern country and I want my children taken away from this school and send to the Pas school. I humbly ask that the department consent to that transfer.\n\nI do not want to make any reports on anybody but I have many reasons many a good reason on very serious considerations for asking this transfer. I hope you will give this matter fair consideration and I firmly hope that the permission of transferring my children, will be given.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours truly,\nFrank Hatfoot\nOttawa, March 26, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with further reference to your sons who are enrolled at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School. I have to inform you, in reply, that the Department considers it would be in their best interests to complete their course of studies at the school, and therefore favourable consideration cannot be given to your application for a transfer.\n\nFor your information, I wish to inform you that the Indian Residential School in the Diocese of His Lordship Bishop Charlebois is not at The Pas. It is at Cross Lake, on the Nelson river, some 40 miles from a railroad and as far from The Pas, Man., as is the Pine Creek Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

The soil is black mould from 4 to 10 inches in depth. The cultivated land is in very fair condition. The balance of the land is covered with scrub and some fair-sized trees, large enough for wood. There is considerable stone on the land. An area of the land, consisting of probably 50 acres, seemed to be rather low, but no water was on the surface.\n\nPine River runs through the land, and the property has frontage on Lake Winnipegosis. The buildings are situate about 300 yards from the Lake on one side and the River on the other.\n\nBUILDINGS.\n\nSchool building,- 115 x 50 ft. with 30 ft. studding, solid stone, metal roof. Full basement, steam-heated, lighted by acetylene gas. Contains dormitories and class-room, chapel, offices, reception-room and rooms for the staff and guests. Also, kitchen, dining-hall, store-room and laundry, etc., in the basement. It is fully equipped and in good condition. It is furnished throughout with suitable and substantial furniture, furnishing and fixtures.\n\nThe heating-plant is in good repair. There is also the lighting-plant, power for washing, churning and for water-supply which is piped from Pine River about 300 yards distant from the building. There is also a bake-oven with 160 loaf capacity.\n\nGranary and Stable,- 101 x 24\u00bd, 12\u00bd feet studding, two stories, frame with metal roof. This is a substantial building, double boards, and is used for stable on ground floor and granary on second floor. A portion is used at one end for a slaughter-house.\n\nBarn and Stable,- 120 x 50 ft. with 13 feet studding, lean-to's at either end, one 14 x 50 ft., and the other 9-9 x 50 ft.. This is a good building, with harness-room, horse and cow stables and feeding-stables, a large cellar for root house, also mows for hay and straw with fork for unloading.\n\nMachinery Shed,- 100 x 20 ft. with 8 ft. studding, frame, shingle roof. This building is used for storing the implements when not in use. Single board walls.\n\nOther Buildings consist of blacksmith's shop, store-house, laborer's house, shed, poultry house and ice house. Also, a stone building used as a workshop.\n\nAll buildings are in a good state of repair and kept in a cleanly condition and do not show want of paint.\n\nI estimate the value of the land, buildings and contents of the school building to be $102,648.00 and the implements and live-stock $6,100.00 making a total valuation of $110,748.00.\nI found the implements to be in good repair and nearly all practically as good as new. The live-stock is also in good condition, and, in fact, everything about the place reflects credit on those in charge of it, and the estimates that I have given have been conservative throughout.\n\nThere is appended hereto a detained list of the contents of the school building, also detailed list of implements and live-stock.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Arrangements for the purchase of the property, which includes land, buildings, other improvements, live stock, chattels and effects, have been completed by the Department of Justice whose local agents have found satisfactory title to the land in question, which may be described as follows:\n\nAll those parcels of land situate in the Pine Creek Settlement, Province of Manitoba, Dominion of Canada and being composed of Lots numbers, one, two, three and four, excepting thereout and therefrom a parcel of land situate in Lot one, containing two acres and ninety-four hundredths of an acre, more or less. The parcels to be transferred contain together six hundred and thirty-two acres and six hundredths of an acre, more or less. The said lots are shown on a plan of the Pine Creek Settlement, approved and confirmed by E. Deville, Surveyor General, 6th May, 1910.\n\nThis action is in pursuance with the Department's policy of acquiring from the various religious denominations modern Indian residential schools. The Pine Creek Indian Residential School is modern, well equipped and adequate for the purposes of Indian Education. An independent appraiser has fixed the value of the property which is to be transferred at $104,248.00.\n\nThe Honourable\n\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nThe Department of Indian Affairs has arranged with the Church authorities that the consideration for the entire school property be $39,000.00.

The description in question excepts out of lot one (1) that part where the church property stands, and which description was forwarded me, dated the 14th of August 1924.\n\nThis will be signed by the Reverend Fathers Oblats and by the President and Secretary and on the 3rd page one of their officers will make the affidavit that the Corporation is the registered owner of the lands. The affidavit immediately below that will be taken by an authorized agent of the Indian Department who will set out the value of the property conveyed, which is, I presume, $81,000.00.\n\nI took up the matter with the Registrar of the Dauphin Land Titles Office, and he said he would allow the five Certificates of Title which cover the land in question, to be put in one transfer. I have therefore just prepared the one, and have attached the schedule showing the land. He suggested as a description lots 2, 3 & 4 of the Pine Creek Settlement in Manitoba, as shown on the Dominion Government survey of the said Settlement, excepting the part of the land covered by the surveyed road crossing the same and excepting further from the said lot 4, that part thereof taken for public road, covered by plan entered and filed in the Dauphin Land Titles Office under No. 501. This plan #501 referred to he states, was entered and filed in that Land Titles Office on March 4, 1924 and purports to be under the Expropriation Act, namely R.S.M. 1913 Chapter 69. There would also have to be excepted the church property. I have preferred to copy the exact description of the Certificates of Title.\n\nI have a letter from the Oblate Fathers in which they state that all the taxes on this land are paid and that the claim of the School District of Birdview, re Section 34, township 34, range 20, does not affect in any way the sale of the School property to the Department, as this Section is not comprised in the property intended to be conveyed. I would therefore refer you to your letter to me dated November 18th last, in which you state that it will be deducted.\n\nA further question arises, and I wish your instructions on same. What about the taxes which will fall due on this property to the end of this year? The taxes of 1923 were paid, but the 1924 taxes are not.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJAMES D.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Justice,\nOttawa.\nRe Sale of Pine Creek Settlement property\nto Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to our conversation with you yesterday, the position of this matter is, according to our information, as follows:\n\nThe Reclamation Branch of the Department of Public Works of the Province of Manitoba, sought to close the road lying to the North of Lot One in the Pine Creek Settlement and to open a new road along the South of Lot Four, and they arranged with your Organization to receive from you title to a strip of land along the South of Lot Four for the new road in exchange for which they were to give you title to the old road to the North of Lot One. A sale of the property was then arranged by you to the Department of Indian Affairs, but inasmuch as you had already given title to the roadway to the South of Lot Four you were unable to give them title to that part so transferred which was excepted from your transfer and you conveyed to them Lots One, Two, Three and Four, excepting from Four the new roadway, and you also conveyed to them by Quit Claim Deed your right to receive from the Province of Manitoba a conveyance of the roadway to the North of Lot One.\n\nThe solicitor for the Department of Indian Affairs at Portage la Prairie, raised some objections to your title to the roadway and the best arrangement that could be made with him was that he should release the money, retaining $1000.00 until the roadway title was made satisfactory. There have been several objections raised to the title, but we believe that all are satisfied save only that the title lacks a root. The Dominion Government roadways in this Province were vested in the Province under The Manitoba Supplementary Provisions Act, but in conveying these roadways the statute defined the roads as those shown on township surveys. The present road is shown on a survey of the Settlement of Pine Creek and not of a township so the officials here take the attitude that the title to the roadway sought to be closed is still vested in the Dominion Government and that the Provincial Government has not jurisdiction to close it. Provision is made in the\n\nRev. J.P. Magnan. #1\nbefore mentioned statute for the Dominion Government to transfer roadways to the Manitoba Government by Order of the Governor-General-in-Council and we understand that the Department of Public Works here has written to Ottawa for an Order-in-Council from the Dominion Government vesting the roadway in question in the Province of Manitoba, whose jurisdiction to close the same will then be completed. It may be some little time until this Order-in-Council comes through and meantime, the solicitor for the Department of Indian Affairs, is holding up payment to you of $1,000.00. We believe that the Department of Indian Affairs were fully acquainted with the situation that they might be prepared to release the money and await completion of their title until such time as the Order-in-Council is passed. The amount of land involved is only a strip of land including in all some ten acres and is of little value. If the Department is not prepared to ask its solicitor to release the money perhaps it could exert some influence on the Department of the Interior to have the necessary Order-in-Council passed at an early meeting of the Council. The failure to give title is really that of the Department of Public Works of the Province of Manitoba, and is not the fault of any of the Departments at Ottawa, but no doubt they would be ready to co-operate to expedite the closing out of the transaction.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMUNSON ALLAN LOADER PATTON MACINNES & MILNE,\n\nRev. J. P. Magnan,\n222 Provencher Ave.,\nST. BONIFACE, Man.\nWinnipeg, Man., July 11th, 1925.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI take the liberty of sending to you a letter sent to Rev. Fr. J.P. Magnan O.M.I. by his solicitors treating about a difficulty which has crept up in connection with the purchase by the Government of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School.\n\nThe enclosed letter is self-explaining and in my estimation should materially help to sustain Rev. Fr. Magnan's claim, viz: the release of the balance of the money intended for the above property.\n\nKindly give your attention to this matter as the failure to give title is not our own and we should not be held responsible for same.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6270, file 582-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nRe Lots 1/4 Pine Creek Settlement,\nManitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAbout a year ago your Department agreed to purchase the above land together with the Indian School on it from our clients, The Oblate Fathers. About the same time the Provincial Department of Public Works (Reclamation Branch) decided to close a road lying to the North of Lot One and in place thereof opened a road along the South of Lot Four. The ordinary steps were taken to close up the road to the North of Lot One and a Transfer was given to this Province for the road to the South of Lot Four. The Oblates then delivered title to the land (excepting the road from Lot Four) to your Department and assigned to your Department its right to receive from the Manitoba Government title to the road to the North of Lot One. Following this a Deed was given from this province to your Department of the road to the North of Lot One.\n\nThe District Registrar raised an objection to the Provincial Government's title to the closed road, his view apparently being that under Section 7 of the Manitoba Supplementary Provisions Act, Cap.99, R.S.C., the roadway sought to be closed was not the property of the Manitoba Government, the same being shown on a plan of a Settlement and not on a Township plan. The Department of Public Works has, we understand, been trying to have this situation corrected or made more plain by asking for an Order-in-Council from the Department of the Interior, but although the request was made some months ago apparently little progress has been accomplished. Meantime, the transaction is being delayed and we now write to ask whether you would be good enough to speak to the official of the Department of the Interior who has charge of this matter and see whether nothing can be done to expedite the necessary Order-in-Council so that this transaction can be closed out.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMUNSON ALLAN LOADER PATTON MACINNES & MILNE,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, 22nd July 1925\n\nThis Department is acquiring from the Oblate Fathers certain lands in the Pine Creek Settlement and included in these lands is a portion of the road which lies to the North of Lot 1 in the said settlement. This road, the Reclamation Branch of the Department of Public Works, Man., arranged with the Oblate Fathers to close and transfer to the Order upon receipt from the Order, in exchange, a strip of land along the South of Lot 4 for a new road and it is understood that the title has so been passed to the provincial Department of Public Works for the roadway South of Lot 4.\n\nTitle to the roadway lying to the North of Lot 1 has been held up, on account of the fact that it is maintained that while the Dominion Government roadways in the Province of Manitoba are vested in the Province under the Manitoba Supplementary Provisions Act, but in conveying these roadways the Statute defined the roads as shown on township surveys. Whereas this roadway is shown on survey of the Settlement and is held to be not yet transferred to the Province. It is understood that the provincial Department of Public Works has made application for an Order in Council transferring the roadway in question to the Province and as this point is holding up the completion of the payment of the transaction the Department has with the Oblate Fathers, and delaying the issue of title, it would be appreciated if you could expedite the above mentioned Order in Council.\n\nThe Controller,\nLand Patents Branch,\nDepartment of Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.F.

This school was built by the Church authorities in 1900 but has recently been purchased by our Department. It is built of granite stone; the size of the building is 50 x 115 x 40, having a basement and three storeys. It is fully modern.\n\nThe number of pupils present was 61, 45 girls and 36 boys. There are two classrooms in the school.\n\nThe staff consists of the Principal, Assistant Principal, Blacksmith, Engineer and 7 Sisters.\n\nThere are also a number of outbuildings such as a stable, implement shed, granaries, pig-sty, carpenter shop, blacksmith shop, chicken house, ice house, store houses, etc. The buildings are all in good shape and were painted about 5 years ago.\n\nThe only defect I saw in the building was the shingles on the roof of the school, they have never been painted and are beginning to rot away.\n\nThey also have all the necessary implements as well as a Tractor and Threshing Machine. They farmed considerable land some years ago but this venture has not been a success as the land is very stony. They, however, raise an excellent garden here and had abundance of potatoes and garden truck.\n\nThey have 38 head of cattle, 12 cows which milk, so the children get lots of milk. They also keep pigs and chickens.\n\nEverything was in good order around the school and the children looked healthy and seemed to be well cared for. The work in the classroom seemed to be satisfactory.\n\nCOMMISSIONER GRAHAM'S COMMENTS ON INSPECTOR CHRISTIANSON'S REPORT ON THE PINE CREEK IMPROVED RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL,\n\nComm. Graham's letter dated Feb. 23rd, #208-9.\n\nAs the boarding school on this reserve is the property of the Department, the matter of re-shingling the roof should receive attention. You will notice that the farming venture at this school has not been a success in the past and I am of the opinion that it never will amount to anything. Stock-raising is the industry that should be encouraged at Pine Creek. The Principal, Father Brachet, is to be commended for the interest he takes in the Indians after they leave his school.\nPRIVY COUNCIL\n\nCANADA\n\nAT THE GOVERNMENT HOUSE AT OTTAWA.\n\nMonday, the 22nd day of February, 1926.\n\nPRESENT\n\nHIS EXCELLENCY\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL --\n\nWHEREAS the Department of Indian Affairs has represented to the Department of the Interior that it requires the strip of land included in the surveyed roadway lying between Lot 1, Pine Creek Settlement and Indian Reserve No. 66A, in the Province of Manitoba;\n\nAND WHEREAS the Minister of the Interior reports that the said strip of land has not been transferred to the Province of Manitoba for roadway purposes, and that it has been intimated by the Provincial Department of Public Works that such land is not required by the Province for a roadway;\n\nAND WHEREAS the Minister of the Interior is of the opinion that the requirements of the Department of Indian Affairs in this instance should be given favourable consideration;\n\nTHEREFORE His Excellency the Governor General in Council, under the provisions of section 76 of the Dominion Lands Act, is pleased to order that the said strip of land, excepting all mines and minerals, whether solid, liquid or gaseous, be and it is hereby vested in the Department of Indian Affairs; the land in question may be more particularly described as follows:\n\nBeing in Pine Creek Settlement, in the Province of Manitoba, and composed of that certain parcel of land lying between the southern boundary of Indian Reserve No. 66A and the northern boundary of lot numbered one in the said settlement and shown as a road upon a plan of survey of the said settlement approved and confirmed at Ottawa on the 6th day of May, A.D. 1910, by Edouard Deville, Surveyor General of Dominion Lands, and of record in the Department of the Interior, saving and excepting thereout the land covered by the waters of Pine River at the time of the survey of the said river as shown upon said plan of survey of the said settlement, the land hereby described containing by admeasurement fifteen and seven-hundredths acres more or less.\n\n(Sgd) E.

Father Brachet, as Principal, who is assisted by a staff of some fifteen. There is a large farm and garden in connection with this school, and the Rev. Father Brachet has a large herd of cattle consisting among them some 20 head of young milch cows which allows the pupils plenty of good milk. The pupils of this school have always enjoyed good health and during the past year have not received any report of a serious nature. This school is situated in an open place between the bush and Lake Winnipegosis which helps to contribute to the health of the children. There is not any doubt but that the constant good health of these pupils is on account of the supply of fresh milk they are served three times a day. Most of these pupils look healthy and bright and appear to have a good time at the school, they are somewhat slow in speaking the English language, they want to speak their native language all the time if they were allowed. Dr. A.E.

The P.O. address of the school being Winnipegosis, Manitoba.\n\nAgency: It is in the Manitowapah Agency, Treaty No. 11.\n\nReligion: It is a Roman Catholic school conducted under the auspices of two Franciscan Nuns, with a nun and priest as assistants. Rev. Father A. Chaumont is Principal.\n\nLand: The land in connection with the school consists of 160 acres and is the property of the Roman Catholic mission.\n\nBuildings: There consist of a new stone building 114 x 94 ft., 3 stories high built during the summer of 1899 at a cost of $2,000, of which the Dept. contributed the sum of $500. It was first occupied in the fall of 1899. The other buildings consist of stables, carpenter shop, and implement shed.\n\nAccommodation: Accommodation can be divided for 100 pupils. The new school building...\nis heated by a steam furnace. The water supply is obtained from the river by means of a pump.\n\nHistory of School\n\nThe establishment of a reserve at Pine Creek was after much correspondence finally confirmed by order in Council dated Feb 8th 1894. The Indians moved from Duck Bay and settled on the new Reserve.\n\nOn the 5th January 1887 Rev J. A Dupont wrote the Deptt. asking that a Day school be built by the Govt. on the Pine Creek Reserve. In the annual report of the Deptt. for 1887 (Page 63-64) Agent Martineau says that a school was opened that year on the Pine Creek Reserve with one Herman Chartland as teacher who taught the school under the supervision of the Rev Father Dupont.\n\nThe first grant given by the Govt. towards this Day school was in 1888 when the sum of \u00a325.5s. was paid to the teacher that year.\n\nThe Deptt. made a yearly grant of \u00a3300 towards the support of the day school and also a sum of \u00a312.0s. per annum for each pupil in attendance over the number of 25. The grant to the Day school continued at this rate till the end of the year of 1897 when the Day school was run in connection with the Boarding...\nSchool. The Estimates for 1897-98, 1898-99, provided a grant to the Day School for 100 pupils @ $2.00 per capita; and in the Estimates for 1899-1900, this grant was increased to 15 pupils @ $2.00 per capita and has been paid at that rate since then.\n\nOn the 21st June, the Dept. paid the sum of $6.03 for articles supplied to complete the school house at Pine Creek.\n\nThe Boarding School at Pine Creek was first opened during the year 1890 and was run in connection with the Day School. It was open during that year and the following year (1891) and seems to have been conducted during these two years & have been conducted in the old day school building.\n\nDuring the years 1892, 93 and 94 the Boarding School was closed temporarily in order to put it on a better footing.\n\nEarly in the spring of 1893 it was decided by the Dept. to assist in the completion of a building which was partly erected by the Indians so as to afford suitable accommodation for a Boarding School. The cost provided for the work in 1893 was $500.00 and the Estimate in 1893-94 provided for $316.00 a total of $816.00.\n\nTenders were called for the work, two tenders were submitted, but both were considered.\nto high.\n\nOn the 31st May, 1893, Inspector McColl was instructed by A.M. Burgess, Dept. of Interior, to proceed with the work of finishing and enlarging the school building at Pine Creek, the whole cost of which was not to exceed the sum appropriated viz.: $566.00.\n\nThe work was done by day labour under the supervision of a foreman and on the same specifications as were used for the Water Sheen River Bdg school.\n\nOn Dec. 6th/93, Inspector McColl informed the Dept. that the work had been completed according to instructions and forwarded vouchers for the work amounting to $598.52.\n\nOn the 8th January 1894, cheques were sent to Mr. McColl to cover the cost of the work amounting to $598.52.\n\nThe building when completed consisted of a log building 32 x 24 ft. with ceiling 9 ft. high.\n\nThe Boarding School re-opened Oct 1st/94 and has been conducted regularly since that date.\n\nOn the 19th Sept./98 the Indian Comm. (Mr. Forget) forwarded to the Dept. a copy of a letter of the Rev. A. Chauvin, Principal of the Pine Creek Boarding School and endorsed by the Archbishop of T.T. and stated that the school buildings were getting old and a\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mission authorities had erected a magnificent stone building 49 x 114 ft., 3 stories high with basement, capable of accommodating 100 pupils and forwarded a statement showing the total expenditure in constructing the new building to have been $12,193.00. He also asked if the Dept. had made any grant toward the cost of this work and was informed by the Dept. that the sum of $2,500.00 was available for building purposes. This sum was voted in the Supplementary Estimates for 1899-1900. A cheque for this amount ($2,500.00) was sent the Father Chamoux on 21st Nov. 1899, this being the total grant contributed by the Govt. towards the cost of erecting the new school building, the church authorities themselves providing the balance.\n\nPer Capita Grant\n\nOn the re-opening of the Boarding School Oct. 1898, and run in connection with the Day School with the Rev. A. Chamoux as...\nAs principal of both, a grant of $300.00 was given by the Court to the teacher of the Day School and $60.00 per capita for each of 10 pupils at the Boarding School.\n\nThe Estimates for 1896-97 provided for:\n10 pupils @ $60.00 per capita = $600.00\nSalary of Day School Teacher = $300.00\nTotal = $900.00\n\nThe Estimates for this year provided for:\n15 pupils @ $72.00 per capita = $1080.00\n10 day pupils @ $12.00 = $120.00\nTotal = $1200.00\n\nThe Estimates for this year were the same as that valid in 1897-98.\n\nThe Estimates for this year were valid as follows. The main Estimates provided for:\n15 pupils @ $72.00 per capita = $1080.00\n10 day pupils @ $12.00 = $120.00\nTotal = $1200.00\n\nThe supplementary Estimates provided for:\n5 pupils @ $72.00 = $360.00\nTotal = $1560.00\n\nThe vote for this year was for:\n40 pupils @ $72.00 = $2880.00\n15 day pupils @ $12.00 = $180.00\nTotal = $3060.00\n\nThe increase in the grant for 1900-01 was owing to the fact of the new Boarding School building being able to accommodate 100 pupils, and as the Indian population was strong enough in the vicinity of the school to furnish an attendance of 40, provision was made for that number.\n\nThe number of day pupils provided for in the past was inadequate as the attendance.\ninvariably exceeded it; therefore the\nno provided for was increased to 15 pupils.\n\nThe Estimates for the year provide\nfor:\n- Boarders: $72.00 per cap. = $960.00\n- Day Pupils: $12.00 \" = $180.00\n\nTotal: $1,140.00\n\nAmalgamation of Pine Creek and Water\nRiver Boarding Schools.\n\nSee Memo of Mr.\nBenson, Dalhousie\nDec. 1st/99 on\nFile No. 98.150\n\nMr. Joseph Marlett in his report on the\nBoarding School at Water River\nConducted under the auspices of the\nR.C. Church authorities gives it as his\nopinion that the school should be closed.\nHis reasons being that the attendance\nis irregular and that the school is not\nnecessary on account of the proximity\nof the Pine Creek Boarding School and\nthat better results could be obtained\nfrom one large, well conducted school\nthan from two small ones.\n\nHe advocated the amalgamation of\nthe two schools of Water River and\nPine Creek, and that the grant to the\nlatter school be increased and the\npupils at Water River be transferred\nto Pine Creek, thus leaving only a\nday school at Water River which\nwould be sufficient for the need of the\nIndians at that place.\n\nThe Archbishop of St. Boniface, the Rev. A.\nChamoux Principal of Pine Creek and\nthe Indians themselves were favourable\nto the scheme.\n\nThe grant to Pine Creek being\nincreased to 140 Boarders & 15 Day Pupils in the Estimate for 1900-1901\n\nThe Water Hen River Boarding School was closed Sept. 30th, 1900 and the pupils thereafter transferred to Pine Creek Boarding School.\n\nA Day school will be maintained at Water Hen River as long as sufficient pupils attend to warrant its being kept open. It will receive the usual Day School grant.\n\nThe Reserves which are benefited by this school are: Sandy Bay (Res. No. 1), Pine Creek (Res. No. 4), Lake Manitoba, Elbow and Floe Lake, Fairfield Little Saskatchewan, Lake St. Martin Crane River and Water Hen River Reserves in Treaty No. 2. It is estimated that there are 285 children of school age on the above reserves. There are Day schools on all the Reserves.\n\nFor all correspondence please refer to see File 16551, 98150-1, 98150-2 and 98150-6 also 118340-2\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume

THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Pine Creek School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1941.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 1, 1941.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Portage la Prairie Agency this 10\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' attendance of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Pine Creek School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated June 30, 1942.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Portage la Prairie Agency this July 3, 1942.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Pine Creek School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated September 30, 1942.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Portage la Prairie Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Pine Creek School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: December 31, 1942.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Fort Peck Agency, January 4, 1943.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

**AVERAGE attendance of pupils during Quarter:** 117\n- **AMOUNT of per capita grant due for Quarter:** $476.25\n\n**NOTE\u2014Additions to be correctly made and entered at the foot of column.**\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Pine Creek School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated October 2, 1943.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Fort Macleod, October 12, 1943.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Pine Creek School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1973.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: December 31, 1973\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Fortage La Prairie, this January 4, 1943.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFile No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Pine Creek School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: March 31, 1944.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Stamp]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Pine Creek School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 22, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.408\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Prince Creek School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: O. Russell, O.M.S.\n\nDated: September 30, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Portage la Prairie Agency this 30th day of September, 1944.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Pine Creek School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated April 2, 1945.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly-per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...Rline Creek...School for the Quarter ended...March 31,...1946\n\nPrincipal...[Signature]\n\nDated...April 11,...1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent...[Signature]\n\nDated at...Fort La Prairie...Agency...this...APR 4 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Pine Creek School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 31, 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Portage la Prairie this JAN 2 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Pine Creek School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated September 30, 1947.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this AGENCY.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Manitowah Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Pine Creek School at Camperville on Pine Creek Reserve for Quarter ended September 20, 1947.**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 0368            | Delia Clearsky  | 11  | 1   |      | Lizart Pt.     | 1                 |                          | Oct. 1/46                   | 92         |\n| 0369            | Marcelline Shingoose | 8  | 1   |      |                | 1                 |                          | Nov. 1/46                   | 92         |\n| 0370            | Joan Cook       | 9   | 1   |      |                | 1                 |                          | Aug. 29/45                  | 92         |\n| 0371            | Evelyn Nepinak  | 7   | 1   |      | Pine Creek     | 1                 |                          | Oct. 20/46                  | 92         |\n| 0372            | Mary R.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days residences of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Pine Creek School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nG.R. Russell\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date, 1948.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended.\n\nPrincipal.\n\nDated.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE:\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..................................................

Fr G. Leonard and his successor, Rev. Fr Brachet, have tried unsuccessfully to bore artesian wells at eight different places, but without satisfactory results.\n\nYour letter of August 11th, 1916, mentioned that the Department was ready to pay the necessary railway charges in connection with the moving to and from the school of well boring machinery and in the event of the well not proving satisfactory the amount could be expended in the construction of a concrete reservoir for water supply.\n\nI herewith join freight receipt for bringing well boring outfit to Winnepegosis.\n\nNow to return the said outfit charges will be quite higher, as railway charges have increased and the destination is different.\n\nRev. Fr Brachet is presently digging a canal for water supply of the above mentioned school and states that this canal will cost around $1500.00. He has requested me to ask from the Department if he could not receive any substantial help in the matter.\n\nHoping to receive a favourable answer, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph [signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Brachet proposes, and we will have our Departmental Engineer and Mr. Agent Ogletree look into the matter.\n\nIf we find that such a project as the Principal suggests is favourable, when preparing the estimates for the coming fiscal year, the matter will be kept in mind.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Father J. Guy, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nA request is being made to this Department by Rev. Father Brachet for some assistance towards the cost of building a water supply system at the Pine Creek Boarding School, Manitoba.\n\nBefore I can give his request any consideration, I would like to be furnished with a sketch plan and description of the work now being performed by Rev. Father Brachet, and also, if possible, an approximate estimate of the cost.\n\nThis is required in order to enable the Department to satisfy itself that the above mentioned project is being executed in a satisfactory manner and that the work will be of a permanent character. As soon as this is received, I will immediately communicate with the Principal of the school and advise whether the work as now proposed would be satisfactory and entitled to a grant from the Department in case it should be found possible to do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Ogletree, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nFather Guy brought the accounts in connection with the water works and repairs to barns at the Pine Creek Boarding School. The repairs to barns were voted in the Main Estimates - 1922-23 ($1758). The Agent received authority, with the Minister's permission, to carry out the repairs to the barns and to incur an expense not more than $1893.\n\nI have directed Father Guy to return the accounts to the Principal so that he can send them to Mr. Agent Ogletree in the regular way. The Agent, in his letter of the 29th of July, states that the lumber was supplied by the school, sawn by their own mill and the work was done by their own men. The lumber and labour may not be a fair charge against the vote for Indian education, and the matter should be enquired into.\n\nFather Guy was also instructed to send the account for the water works to the Principal for the Agent's attention. Our Agent was directed on May 23rd to certify to these vouchers and forward them to the Department.\n\nOctober 4, 1922\n### EXPENDITURE AUTHORIZATION\n\nFor general repairing of BARN & STABLES at Pine Creek Boarding School-Camperville, Man.\n\n#### 1921\n\n| Date | Description | Amount |\n|------|-------------|--------|\n| Sept. 30 | No. 1-J.

It is noted from his letter that there is seating accommodation in excess of the number of pupils for which per capita grant is allowed at the present time, and we cannot, therefore, understand why more school desks are required.\n\nWe are today placing an order with the Singer Sewing Machine Company here to supply two Singer sewing machines, of the style described in their catalogue as follows:\n\nNo. 2 - 5 Drawer Machine, 127 - 3 G.O.\n\nThe above firm have been requested to notify you from their nearest branch office as to who will furnish these machines, and when they will be available.

(RG 10, Volume 6270, file 582-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, October 29th, 1923.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nMr. F. Burton, Acting Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, has forwarded your communication of the 15th instant regarding the school desks required for the use of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School. In this connection I beg to say that it would appear from your letter that there is seating accommodation for the full number of pupils for which per capita grant is allowed, viz: 81 pupils. This is the full number for which accommodation can be provided in the dormitories and classrooms of the school, in compliance with the Department's requirements as to air space, etc., for each pupil. Until we have further information as to the need of more desks, and the condition of the desks at present in use, we are not prepared to supply a further number. Please give further information as to the reason for the request for 24 single desks.\n\nWe are placing an order with the Singer Sewing Machine Company to supply two sewing machines.\n\nWe are not prepared to furnish the Auto Knitter asked for. It is considered that equipment of this nature should be purchased by the school from the per capita grant.\n\nThe 2 teachers' desks and the 2 chairs will be ordered when we have further particulars from you regarding the school desks.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Brachet, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal, Indian Residential School,\nCamperville, Man.\nSir,\n\nIn answer to your inquiry of the 29th ult. No. 126-1-5 I beg to submit the following information.\n\nWe have 65 double school desks and 8 single, which gives a seating capacity of 136. Now as I have said in my letter of the 15th ult. 7 double desks are damaged (broken), 12 double desks are unfit (in bad condition); I have to add that 10 double desks are too small for our elder boys and girls. The proper seating accommodation is thus reduced to 80. Now the pupilage for boarders is 81; we also have an average of day pupils from 12 to 20. The seating accommodation should then be about 100.\n\nSuch is the reason why we ask for 24 big size school desks. The teachers say that they would be really useful. It is not hygienical to set elder pupils in desks too low for them; any way there is hardly place for two to set together and study properly. We therefore hope that we shall be favored with the granting of our request. We are very thankful for the two sewing machines.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo, No. I26-I-5, re: Desks for the Pine Creek Indian Residential School.\n\nI herewith beg to enclose a letter received from the Rev.

If the desks could be delivered to the school from any railway station during the winter months, we would order the desks to be sent to the station named by the Principal. It is considered that it would be advisable to let the matter of supplying the desks stand until next spring, when the Principal should renew his request to your office, and, when you forward the same, you should refer to the File No. and date of this letter. Kindly advise the Principal accordingly. We have noted from the Principal's letter the need for the 24 single desks, large size.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Size 42 x 26 inches.\n\nNo. 123 Table\n\nNo. 123 is the same as No. 120 but without the panelled sides and back.\n\nTeachers' Chairs\n\nNo. 1562\n\nThe styles shown on this page are the best chairs we have ever shown for Teachers' use. They are regularly made of selected Elm and finished golden color to match our three styles of Teachers' Desks shown on pages 15, 16 and 17.\n\nEvery detail of the construction of these chairs has been very carefully watched, and they will be found to be comfortable, durable and pleasing in appearance.\nSanitary Desk\n\nNo. 121\n\nA STYLE especially suitable for Teachers' use. Has four large drawers, the lowest one being of extra depth. Each drawer fitted with lock. The sliding leaf at the right will be found a convenient feature. Made with solid top and full panelled sides and back. Carried in stock in golden ash. Size 42 x 26 inches.\n\nSOLE AGENTS\nWESTERN SEATING COMPANY\n179 GANNATYNE AVE. EAST\nWINNIPEG, MAN.\n\nPrincipals' Desk\n\nNo. 122\n\nA COMPACTLY built desk of simple but massive design particularly desirable for principals' use. Has seven drawers, (two of extra depth) with extra heavy pulls and with locks. Equipped with sliding leaf on both sides\u2014an excellent feature. The top is solid with panelled sides and back. Special features of construction to secure greatest possible strength and avoid checking and splitting of the top. Carried in stock in golden ash. Size 56 x 26 inches.\nWhat is Globe Triangular Steel?\n\nThe steel we offer differs from cast, wrought and \"M\" iron or steel, due to the amount of carbon and other ingredients used in its composition, thus securing the requisite toughness, tenacity, hardness and elasticity. In forming our TRIANGULAR STEEL STANDARD nothing is left but the best American Sheet Steel, pickled and cold rolled and formed into triangular shape under tremendous pressure by special machines designed for the purpose.\n\nThe TRIANGULAR form of construction was adopted after most exhaustive tests, it being a well-known scientific fact that the Triangle is the most important figure in geometry, and may be considered the element of all other figures. The method of steel fabrication used in the construction of the Steel Sanitary Desks offered by us is original, and by the use of special machinery, precision dies, insures lightness, strength and rigidity. The completed product, welded together electrically into one solid, indestructible finished article. It eliminates all sharp edges and bacteria pockets. It is SELF-EVIDENT that the construction of the GLOBE STEEL SANITARY DESK is not accomplished by merely buying the rough steel and assembling it by bolts and rivets. The steel has been subjected to every well known scientific test to determine its tensile, breaking and abrasive or friction qualities, and will withstand extraordinary conditions of usage.\n\nWhy Our Desks Are Sanitary\n\nHygienic, sanitary desks are demanded today, and our TRIANGULAR form of steel construction affords no lodgment for dust or dirt. All filigree work, so necessary in cast iron construction has been abandoned, and book boxes with the exception of the top and bottoms, being made of one solid piece of steel, giving more room and security for school utensils. The feet of the desks are stamped and cold drawn from the solid steel standards and occupy the minimum amount of floor space, and, having turned flanges, afford a close, tight-fitting, substantial joint and support on the floor. This permits no opportunity for the accumulation of dirt and bacteria. The same dust cloth used on the tops will cleanse the metal work from every particle of dust.\n\nTABLE OF SIZES\nof Desks Shown on Page 8\nAll dimensions are in inches\n\n| DESK NUMBERS | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |\n|--------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Length of Single Desk | 24  | 24  | 21  | 21  | 18  | 18  |\n| Length of Double Desk | 40  | 40  | 38  | 38  | 36  | 36  |\n| Height of Seat from floor at highest point | 17\u00bc | 16  | 14\u00bd | 13\u00bd | 12\u00bd | 11  |\n| Width of Top of Desk | 16  | 16  | 14  | 14  | 12  | 12  |\n| Height of Top from floor at highest point | 60  | 28\u00bc | 26\u00bd | 24\u00be | 23  | 21\u00bc |\n| Floor Space | 28 to 30 | 27 to 29 | 25 to 27 | 24 to 26 | 22 to 25 | 21 to 33 |\n| Age of Pupil Accommodated | Adults | 16-20 | 12-18 | 10-15 | 8-12 | 5-8 |\nGun Metal Finish\n\nThe Steel Metal Work, owing to its close grain and initial treatment of being pickled and cold rolled, after passing through the various processes of construction, is free from all pits, pockets, etc., and is then given a hard GUN METAL enamel finish. The special enameling process operated by steam heat at a temperature of 350\u00b0 Fahrenheit, produces a smooth, satiny finish which is most attractive. The GUN METAL finish avoids all reflected light so often noticeable in the ordinary high lustre black japan, cast iron desk. The woods, which include the tops, backs and seats are made of hardwood, selected for its closeness of grain and wearing qualities, the different widths of lumber necessary to secure the required width for the tops, backs and seats being jointed together edgewise by the celebrated Linderman Dovetail Glue Jointer.\n\nThe woods are regularly finished a rich CHERRY COLOR, but where necessary they may be finished with the natural color for the back and seat and cherry top.\n\nGuarantee\n\nIt has been customary to guarantee the ordinary cast iron desk from five to twenty-five years, but this does not protect the purchaser from the expense and annoyance of replacing breakage or paying cost in transportation and labor in setting up, or defective and noisy hinges. We have eliminated by the use of the Steel construction all weaknesses such as breakage, noisy hinges, etc., and we give all purchasers of Steel Sanitary Desks, an additional guarantee against breakage for a lifetime.\n\nTABLE OF SIZES\n\nAdjustable Desk and Chair Shown on Page II\n\nAll dimensions are in inches\n\n| DESK NUMBERS | 1 or A | 3 or B | 5 or C |\n|--------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Size of Top  | 23\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)x16 | 20\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)x14 | 17\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)x12 |\n| Size of Book Box Inside | 22 x11 | 19 x 9\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 16 x 8 |\n| Range of Desk Adjustment | 26\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) to 32\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 22\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) to 27\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 19\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) to 24\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) |\n| Range of Seat Adjustment | 15 to 18\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 12\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) to 16 | 10 to 13\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) |\n| Floor Space | 24 to 30 | 21 to 27 | 18 to 26 |\n| Ages Accommodated | 10 up | 6 to 11 | 4 to 7 |\n\nIndian Affairs.

This school was built by the Church authorities in 1900 but has recently been purchased by our Department. It is built of granite stone\u2014the size of the building is 50 x 115 x 40, having a basement and three storeys. It is fully modern.\n\nThere are also a number of outbuildings such as a stable, implement shed, granaries, pig-sty, carpenter shop, blacksmith shop, chicken house, ice house, store houses, etc. The buildings are all in good shape and were painted about 5 years ago.\n\nThe only defect I saw in the building was the shingles on the roof of the school, they have never been painted and are beginning to rot away.\n\nThey also have all the necessary implements as well as a Tractor and Threshing Machine. They farmed considerable land some years ago but this venture has not been a success as the land is very stony. They, however, raise an excellent garden here and had abundance of potatoes and garden truck.\n\nCOMMISSIONER GRAHAM'S COMMENTS ON INSPECTOR CHRISTIANSON'S REPORT ON THE PINE CREEK INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL,\n\nComm. Graham's letter dated Feb. 23, 1926. (#208-9)\n\nAs the boarding school on this reserve is the property of the Department, the matter of re-shingling the roof should receive attention.\nOttawa, March 8th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nRelative to that portion of Inspector Christianson's report on his inspection of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, forwarded under cover of your No. 205-9 of the 15th ultimo, regarding the buildings, it is noted that you recommend that the matter of reshingling the roof should receive attention. I have to request that you will obtain an estimate of the cost of having this work done. Please ascertain whether, if the material is supplied, the school authorities will be responsible for the labour in having the work done.\n\nWhen we have full information as to the cost involved in having the roof of the school building reshingled, consideration will be given to authorizing you to incur the necessary expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In the same time I have to say that\nthe eave trough is in bad order and too narrow; in big\nrains some part of the house become wet. It would be well\nto have it renewed, while the scaffold is put up for the\nroof.\n\nAs to the labour, it could be done partly\nby two employees of the school; but we would have to hire two\nmen from the vicinity, so that the work is not protracted\ntoo long, as rain is very frequent in this part.\n\nTrusting that this information is sufficient\nand thanking you for your interest in our school, I am, sir,\n\nYours truly\n\n(Sgd.) J.Brachet O.M.I\nReferring to your letter of the 8th March, relative to the matter of re-shingling the roof of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, I may say that I have made inquiries, through the Principal, as to the cost of this work, and I am herewith attaching a copy of his letter, together with an estimate of material and cost of labour. You will note that this estimate does not refer to shingling alone, but takes in a lot of painting which was not mentioned by the Inspector. I do not think we should stain the shingles, and the amount of $100.00 for this work could be eliminated. I fear, however, that in figuring out the area to be shingled, the Principal has made a mistake, as you will note that the number of square feet in the first three items should be doubled, and, therefore, the number of shingles required would be 924 instead of 57.\n\nIt seems to me that the labour in connection with the re-shingling should be performed by the school, and the Department should supply the material only. There is no necessity for taking off all the shingles at one time; a certain area could be stripped and re-shingled each day, so that the school would not be exposed to the weather in case of rain while the work was in progress.\n\nYou will note the Principal's reference to the condition of the eave-troughing. Would the Department consider making the necessary repairs?\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, April 19, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 208-11A of the 14th instant, concerning the shingling and other repairs that are required at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School. I regret to inform you that there are no funds for this rather comprehensive improvement and the matter has been noted for the 1927-28 Estimates.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Cost of flooring $435.00.\n\nThis floor is in very bad shape and should be renewed at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 2, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to flooring for the Pine Creek Indian Residential School. I regret to inform you that there are no funds for the purpose at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. Ogletree, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your telegram, also of your letter of the 17th inst. relatively to the renewing of the roof of the Pine Creek School.\n\nIn answer I beg to say that I am in touch with the Cusson Lumber Co., St. Boniface, Man., also with the Standard Lumber Co. of Man., Winnipegosis, and J. J. Crowe Co., Winnipegosis, Man., so as to find out the lowest quotations for the same class of good material.\n\nAs far as I can see The Standard Lumber Co., on account of their mill and extended business, are going to give the most suitable prices. They would not be able, however, to take up the work of renewing the roof. Still I can obtain good carpenters from the locality and have the work done more satisfactorily yet than with men hired by a contractor. We desire ourselves that the roof be put in perfect shape, that it may last 50 years.\n\nTo have the work properly done, it is necessary that it should be finished not later than the first week of October. Therefore time is very limited, for it will take over two weeks from now before we have all the material; we are so far away from communications. For this reason it shall\nbe required that orders be given not later than a week from now. Therefore it is impossible that I wait for the answer from the Department before placing the orders.\n\nHere is what I propose to do.\n\nI will place the orders for all the required good material wherever I will find the best prices. I will hire reliable men and see that they do the work conscientiously, so that the roof is renewed strongly and with an attractive appearance. I will follow the work myself, and with estimates already received, I pledge myself to have all the work done for the sum of twelve hundred dollars.\n\nAs much as I can see, the shingles shall be bought from the Standard Lumber Co., the scaffolding from Jim Wright, who is running a mill just now 16 miles from here on the Winnipegosiss Lake, the stain, eave troughs with accessories from The J. H. Ashdown Hardware, Winnipeg.\n\nThe Cusson Lumber Co. for the sum of twelve hundred dollars would not be able to hire men from the city; they would have to hire them from the locality, at lower wages, and they do not seem over anxious to take the work. They would be glad, however, to sell the material.\n\nI hope my proposition will be found satisfactory by the Department. Should it not be thought satisfactory, I would be thankful to receive a wire immediately.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. Maclean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nPine Creek Indian Residential School,\nCamperville, Man.,\nOctober 17th 1927.\n\nA. Ogletree, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nOn August 1926 I have forwarded to the Indian Department through you a request to have some floors of the school renewed. The estimates amounted to $435.00. I have heard that the work was included in the estimates 1927-1928; but I have not received any authorization whatever this summer to proceed with the work.\n\nOn August 22nd, 1927 I have written you that you may find out from the Indian Department how matters are; but I have failed to receive any reply since.\n\nNow I beg to state that it is impossible for us to wait another year to have the floors renewed, as they are too worn out altogether and in the same time too unhealthy, for dust gathers considerably in the enlarged cracks. I wish you would insist that the Indian Department be kind enough to have the work authorized at once. You have seen these defective floors yourself and you must have formed your opinion about them.\n\nHoping that it shall not be necessary for me to write any more about the subject, I am, Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nO.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nSir,-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd ultimo, No. I26-1-5.\n\nI am enclosing you a letter received from the Rev. Father Brachet, Principal of the Pine Creek Residential School.\n\nI would recommend this flooring be purchased at once, so we can get the lumber out before it freezes up.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Asst.

This will use up the appropriation provided for this school during the present fiscal year. We are noting for the estimates for next year an amount sufficient to cover the cost of the renewing of the floors, and the work will, therefore, have to stand over until the necessary funds are provided.

Brackett\nPrincipal\nAnother fire escape could be set to give access directly on the girls' dormitory on the third story, also on the girls' infirmary, sewing-room and Sisters' quarters on the second story.\n\n2- New Fire Escape-Hose\n\nI would recommend buying durable and effective fire hoses, which could be rolled on fitted racks, so that in case of need the hose could unwind quickly in pulling it, and that, when left, it would have no crease. The rubber, being occasionally moistened, could then last for years.\n\n3- Cement Engine Room in stables.\n\nI would recommend cementing all around the room in which the pump and engine are located in the stables. Thus no propagation of fire by engine could take place.\n\nThese changes, to my estimation, together with the necessary care and watch, cleanliness on premises and regular drills, would lessen considerably any danger of fire.\n\nI enclose estimates for these changes, asking the Indian Department to be benevolent enough to authorize them and to grant subsidy for them. They may be found to raise to a fairly high amount; still they would help to save the buildings and, particularly, the lives of pupils.\n\nI have sent to Mr. Graham, Indian Commissioner, estimates of new fire escapes and of new hoses. However, I put in these estimates only 25 ft., as lengths of fire hoses; this, after keener consideration has not been found to give adequate results; 50 ft. would be the right length. Again in the estimate included for Mr. Graham I did not speak of the engine room. I would, therefore, submit the enclosed estimates as the more accurate ones.\n\nThanking you, Sir, for your interest in the betterment of Indians, specially of pupils, I remain,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nO.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nPine Creek Indian Residential School,\nCamperville, Man.,\nOctober 17th 1927.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Deputy Supt. Gen.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th inst., relatively to precautions against fire and to say that we will do our best to follow your wise directions. In the same time I am sorry to state that the present fire escape facilities are not adequate, also that the fire hoses are rather in a poor condition, and finally that the engine room in the stable is dangerous.\n\n1- Fire escape facilities.\n\nThere has been up to now only one fire escape. Access may be had on it on the third story only from a room situated between the boys' and the girls' dormitories; this room has to be kept locked on both sides so as to cut out all possible communications between boys and girls. On the second story access may be had only from the girls' infirmary. Furthermore this fire escape consists of an iron staircase, which in winter may be slippery with ice and therefore not completely safe.\n\n2- Fire Hoses.\n\nAt my last inspection of the fire hoses I found out that they are no longer very effective for the reason that they have been kept folded from the beginning, instead of being rolled over a rack; the creases, through heat and time, have had the rubber inside to split.\n\n3- Engine room in stable.\n\nOur pumping plant is situated in the stables, where we can easily draw the necessary water for the school and stables. Still an engine remains dangerous, especially in stables, where hay is kept on the loft and around. We have an isolated room with a cement floor, but fire may catch on the partitions, which consists of boards.\n\nI would suggest, for more security, the following changes, which I ask the Indian Department to kindly consider, and if found proper and opportune, to have them ordered as soon as possible with the required assistance.\n\n1- New Fire Escapes.\n\nI would recommend doing away with the present Fire Escape and building 2 new ones of pipe with platforms. I have found the pipe escape giving easy and prompt evacuation in other schools. One pipe fire escape could be set to give directly access on the boys' dormitory on the third story, and on the upper class-room on the second story.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I should be grateful if you would let me have an immediate recommendation as to what should be supplied.

Writing.\"\n\nI may say that the Principal of this school, and Principals of all other residential schools, were circularized from this office and asked for reports on the fire protection facilities at the schools, and also for lists of what was considered necessary to put the equipment in good condition.\n\nI received a reply from Father Brachet giving me a list of his requirements, which included new fire escapes and hose. I at once wrote to him authorizing the purchase of material to the extent of $160.00 for the purpose of providing the necessary fire escapes. These are to be in the nature of polished iron poles with a platform at each dormitory on the third floor, and another platform on the second floor. In addition to this he made a request for six lengths of 25-ft hose at 80\u00a2 per foot, and two hose nozzles at $3.00 each. The price which the Rev. Father submitted was for rubber-lined hose, which I do not think it advisable to buy, and I have authorized him to purchase linen hose at 16\u00bd\u00a2 per foot. I do not think there is anything further the Department need do in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Gen.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to make reference to your welcome letter of August 17, 1927, No. 126-1-5, in which we are authorized to renew the roof and gutters of the school for the sum of $1200.00, and to say that the work is now completely finished.\n\nHere is what we have done. We have torn off the old shingles and the mortar on which they were laid; we have laid No. 1 Shingles on first class roofing paper; the shingles we have painted with two coats of black Valdura Asphalt Paint; we have put new and larger eave-troughs and gutters. We have also profited by the fact that we had the scaffolding to paint in white the garret windows (3 coats of white lead) and the other windows of the school (2 coats). Seeing again that the outside window sills were rotten, we had them replaced by cement sills.\n\nWe have done a first class job, which could not have been obtained by contractors, seeing that every shingle was put properly. The work has changed the appearance of the school one hundred per cent.\n\nAlthough we have obtained more than reasonable wages, the total amount of expenses went over the sum of $1200.00 to reach the total cost of $1,678.97. When we have made the estimates for $1200.00, we had in mind to use for stain Lamp black with Linseed Oil. It would have cost only $48.70. Since we have met with a very good product used by the best store of Winnipeg, the Hudson's Bay Co., to wit, the black Valdura Asphalt Paint, which cannot be surpassed for painting shingles, for the fact that it gives a lasting color of great preserving qualities and that it spreads under the covered shingles. We were told that one barrel would extend for two coats, but we found out that two barrels were needed and ordered another barrel and express in order to finish the work before frost. I had borrowed Linseed Oil from local stores and I gave them back from the ordered barrel. The two barrels of Valdura Paint and barrel of Linseed Oil came to $286.90 and the work, to be thoroughly done, was considerably longer than for application of stain. The fact of painting the windows extended also the expenses, but we thought it could not be left out since the scaffolding was up.\n\nOne thing I can say is that no better material could be bought and that it could not be found under cheaper rates, also that no other men would consent to work for such low wages, a part being given gratis, lastly that the work could not be done any better by anybody.\n\nTherefore I feel that the Indian Department should be over satisfied and will make no objection to pay the expended amount. I have promised to settle before the end of the month.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am sorry I am unable just now to give very accurate estimates.

I permit myself to include a small leaflet which concerns it.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Acting Deputy Supt. Gen.,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6270, file 582-5, part 2)\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nDecember 3, 1927.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nYou will remember that the Rev. Principal of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School proposed to renew the roof and the eaves of the main building for the sum of $1200 - the Cusson Lumber Company, of St. Boniface, Man., were to cooperate in this undertaking, which was approved by the Honourable the Superintendent General. While you were in Western Canada, the Rev. Principal wrote to the effect that he could secure better prices by dealing with firms other than the Cusson Lumber Co. who he stated, did not seem anxious to take the work. As the building season was well advanced, he stated that he was proceeding with the work, following the lines of his second proposal. As somewhat different authority had been given him, I could not approve of his action, but I did not care to cancel all authority, for two reasons - the improvement was urgent and it was evidently being effected in as economical a manner as possible.\n\nThe accounts are now to hand and are as follows:\n\n| Description                                      | Amount   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Ashdown Hardware, Winnipeg - Materials           | $590.07  |\n| Standard Lumber Co., Winnipegososis, Materials   | $407.20  |\n| James Wright, Winnipegososis, - Materials        | $186.50  |\n| Rev.

Principal reports that the old shingles and mortar have been torn off, No. 1 shingles laid on first grade roofing paper and the shingles painted with two coats of Asphalt paint. New eave troughs and gutters have been put on. Certain additional work was done, as the school management wished to profit by the presence of the scaffolding. All windows were painted and the outside window sills, which had rotted, were replaced by cement sills. The Principal further states that first class materials only have been used, that suitable labour was engaged at the best possible rates and that the school's appearance is now improved 100%.\n\n$1500 was provided for improvements at this school - reshingling and new eaves $1000; painting $500. If you are satisfied with the manner in which the work was done, I recommend the payment of the accounts.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSir,-\n\nI beg to inform the Indian Department that a member of my staff, Orig\u00e8ne Bourbonni\u00e8re, wanting to make in a hurry the new fire escapes allowed by the Department, and being short of acetylene, condensed some himself for soldering, but the second time he put too much pressure and the tank burst, a piece of which struck him above the eye. We had to bring him hurriedly to the Dauphin hospital, where an operation took place in which his left eye was taken out and the fractured forehead put back in place. The poor man may lose the other eye; his case just now is considered desperate; but we will do our best to save him. Unfortunately my funds are now completely exhausted, and I wish the Department would help me a little to pay the hospital and doctor's bills.\n\nHoping to receive a favorable answer, I am, Sir,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nO.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department is very sympathetic to your request for financial assistance in connection with the medical care of this officer. Before any grant can be made, however, it will be necessary to secure special authority as the appropriation of Parliament for our work was not intended to cover such expenditures.

H. Ashdown Hardware Co. of Winnipeg to find out the\ncost of asbestoslate and asbestos paper and to know\nthe best material which, at lowest costs, could be used\nfor safely lining the engine room in a permanent way.\nI was advised that on account of water in the engine\nroom, where the pumping of water is done, and on account\nof lower cost and better service, Galvanized Iron should\nbe used. 40 Sheets of Asbestos Mill Board would have\nbeen required, the cost of which, at 1/8 in. thick came\nto $29.00 - which thickness was hardly satisfactory -\nat 3/16 in. thick, the cost would have been $44.00.\nTherefore I have ordered and used Galv. Iron.\nThe work has been all completed, and the engine room\nis now completely safe against any possible fire\nthrough gasoline or sparking.\n\nEnclosed please find triplicate bill of\naccount of $26.06 owed to The J.

Brackett\nO.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to my letters of August 2nd, 1926, August 22nd, 1927 & October 17th, 1927 written to the Indian Department through Mr. A. Ogletree, Indian Agent of Portage la Prairie, Man., in order to have some of the floors of the school renewed. I have to state that these floors have become very bad and that I am now ashamed to bring in visitors to see the school. Furthermore other floors are wearing out, such as the floor in the junior recreation room on the girls side. The amount I had asked was $435.00 nearly two years ago (on August 2nd, 1926). This amount would hardly be enough now, except I can purchase birch flooring at special prices at the Standard Lumber Co. - Winnipegosis- Man. This birch flooring would last nearly as long as maple. I was trying to deal last year with the said Co. and they were ready to give me very good bargains for the fact that few people are asking for it just now.\n\nI would be very thankful to know if the Department has included in the estimates of 1928-1929 the sum of $435.00 for the renewal of our floors and to be allowed to proceed with the work shortly.\n\nIn the same time I beg to remind the Department that I had asked for the inside painting of the school which has not taken place for the last 15 years. I understand that this item was also to be included in the estimates for the amount of $500.00.\n\nAwaiting an early reply, I remain,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nO.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, May 10, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, with reference to flooring and interior painting that is required at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School. I am pleased to inform you that the Deputy Superintendent General has approved of carrying out these improvements this year. Funds were provided in our Estimates for the purpose. You may purchase the necessary quantity of flooring from the best source of supply. It is understood that you will buy as reasonably as possible and that the expenditure for the flooring and for the labour will not exceed $475. I will forward to you, under separate cover, labour returns, which should be kept in duplicate, showing the time and the receipts of the men employed. The members of the staff and any of the older boys at the school that assist should give their labour without payment. The account for flooring, in duplicate, should be certified by yourself and forwarded to the Department for payment, with an explanation concerning any other tenders that were received. When we are in receipt of the labour returns, showing payments that you have made to whatever men are engaged, a cheque will be directed to you in reimbursement.\n\nWith reference to the interior painting that is required, I have to request that you will prepare a list of the materials needed and will call for prices from the best sources of supply. You should forward them with your recommendation concerning the purchase, and indicate if school labour could do the painting. The Department suggests that one competent painter be engaged to oversee the work. You might let me know if you can secure the services of such a worker.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

F. McKenzie, Acting Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: No. 126-1-5 May 10/28.\n\nI beg to refer to the second part of your letter of May 10th, 1928, relatively to the interior painting of our school, and I am glad to give you the following information.\n\n1- PAINT NEEDED. I am advised by experts that we would need the following material for a double coat of paint of our school.\n\n| Item                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|-----------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| Boiled Linseed Oil    | 90 gall. | $90.00     |       |\n| Decorators White Lead | 14. 100-lb. | $126.00   |       |\n| White Zinc            | 19 lb.   | $38.00     |       |\n| Turpentine            | 11 gal.  | $2.00      |       |\n| Lamp Black (in oil)   | .40      | $4.00      |       |\n| Dry Colors            |          | $16.00     |       |\n| Paint Brushes         |          | $8.00      |       |\n\nFREIGHT $16.00\n\nTotal $300.00\n\nWhite Zinc. I am told that White Zinc mixed with White Lead will make a strong and permanent paint. This is needed in a school where the pupils are far from being delicate with the furniture.\n\nLamp Black. Lamp Black in oil is 15 c. dearer per lb., but it mixes better to make any kind a grey shade.\n\nDry colors. They will be needed where a different shade is required.\n\n2- QUOTATIONS. Herewith enclosed you will find quotations from three companies of Winnipeg, to wit:\n\n| Item                  | Ashd. | Western | Northern |\n|-----------------------|-------|---------|----------|\n| Linseed Oil           | .90   | .88     | .95      |\n| White Lead            | 14.00 | 13.50   | 15.00    |\n| Turpentine            | 1.00  | 1.05    | 1.50     |\n| Lamp Black            | .25   | .25     | .30      |\n| Brushes               | 10.45 | 48.00   | 42.00    |\n\nThe Western Paint Co. and The J. H. Ashdown Hardware Co. have close prices. Ashdown is known to us as giving very good quality; I would recommend the Co. for this purchase. They are ready to prepay the freight to Winnipegosis.\n\n3- PAINTING. We have delayed answering your letter of the 10th of May on account of the difficulty of finding a PAINTER. Painters are earning from $.65 to $.75 per hour in Winnipeg. Through the help of The J. H. Ashdown Hardware Co. we have secured the services of Victor Marmounier of 114 Jefferson Ave. -Winnipeg-.\nwho is recommended as a capable and diligent worker. He is ready to work either by contract or by the day or hour. He would want $5.00 per day, all expenses of traveling and board paid.\n\nWe could give the board to this man and pay his trip and expenses from Winnipeg to Camperville and return, and give him the necessary help in washing the walls ahead of him, if the Indian Department would let him do all the painting, either by contract, or by the day. The work would be done better and quicker than if he had to oversee unskilled workers. If the Dept. leaves it to me, after all the work is shown to the painter, I could choose the most advantageous way of giving him the work.\n\nI should think that the painter should be able to do all the work satisfactorily for the sum of $200.00; this, with the $300.00 of paint, would come to $500.00, sum which I had put in my estimates.\n\nWe are starting the renewal of the floors with good and hard birch flooring which I have secured at very advantageous prices. We do all the labour at our expense and buy the nails ourselves. I could not go over the sum of $475.00 and I prefered obtaining all the flooring necessary.\n\nI would wish to be able to start the painting as soon as the floors are finished, so as to paint the parts most frequented by the pupils, while they are out for holidays. Therefore I would appreciate very much an immediate answer and ask you to be kind enough to forward it to the JUNIORATE - ST. BONIFACE, Man., from where I could make instant arrangements about the shipping of material and about the coming of the painter.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\ndear Sir,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6270, file 582-5, part 2)\nOttawa, July 18, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, relative to the interior painting at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, giving a list of the paint, oil, etc., required together with an estimate of the cost and submitting the quotations received.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of the paint, as mentioned in your letter. You should see that a good grade of paint, oils, etc., is obtained and you may place the order with the J. H. Ashdown Hardware Company, Limited, who have quoted you the lowest price.\n\nRelative to a competent painter to oversee the work, I beg to say that you may engage the services of Victor Marmoulier as foreman, and the Department will allow him payment at the rate mentioned in your letter, viz., $5 per day. It is noted that the school will be responsible for his board and for the payment of his transportation expenses from Winnipeg to Camperville and return. The school management should furnish the painter with the necessary help in carrying out the work, which is to be performed under your direction.\n\nIt is noted that you estimate the cost of the labour to not exceed $200 and that the total cost of the work, including the paint, will not exceed the sum of $500. You should obtain itemized accounts, in duplicate, covering the cost of the paint and other materials. These, you should certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department for payment. You should also prepare and forward a voucher, in duplicate, for the amount due for the services of the painter engaged. This account should state definitely the number of days the man was employed and the rate per day. It should be certified by you as to its correctness and forwarded to the Department for payment.\n\nIt is noted that you have started the work of the renewal of the floors and that the school will perform all the labour and supply the nails required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. Brachet, O.M.I.,\nThe Juniorate,\nSt. Boniface,\nMan.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the various schools in the Manitowapah Agency, which shows that the work is being carried on satisfactorily. There are several matters, however, that require the attention of the Department.\n\nThe tanks in the Pine Creek School should be replaced, either by a pressure tank, or by new elevated tanks. I would recommend the pressure tank. I would strongly recommend that the lighting plant be changed at once. It is most dangerous to have acetylene gas around a place.\n\nThe fire hose at the Sandy Bay School should be replaced.\n\nI am not in favour of having the van system put into effect at the Dog Creek School. It would only end in failure. The residence at this school should be condemned and a new one built as soon as possible.\n\nA small lean-to building should be added to the Lake St. Martin School. The cost will be about $400.00\u2014not more than $500.00, and perhaps a lot less.\n\nI do not know what salary Mr. Wheadon and Mr. Garwood get, but apparently their work is as important as that of other teachers in this agency, and if the Department could see its way clear to give them a living salary I should be glad. You will note what the Inspector says regarding the matter of remuneration for Miss Billy Gorman, who stays with her sister at the Ebb & Flow School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nPINE CREEK\n\nI reported fully on this school two years ago. The Principal is the Rev. Father J. Brachet. There are eighty children attending the school. The school-building-\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina.\nbuilding is of stone, and is in a very fair state of repair, with the exception of the storage for water, and the lighting. The water is pumped from the river by a gasoline engine into six storage tanks, three of which are situated in the centre of the building up near the roof. Two are in the girls' dormitory and one in the boys' dormitory. These tanks filled with water in the centre of the building are, naturally, quite a strain on it, but this is not all, they are now practically useless, and a change will have to be made, as they are continually springing a leak and the water coming through the ceiling and down through the plaster does a lot of damage, and the sooner these tanks are replaced the better. The question is whether the tanks should be replaced by others of the same type, or a pressure tank placed in the basement. There is a place in the basement which could be utilized for this purpose if we decide to install a pressure tank.\n\nI also wish to bring to your attention the matter of the lighting system. This school is lighted with acetylene gas, and in the past two years there have been two explosions. Last winter an explosion took place which very nearly killed the Engineer, and it is a miracle that it did not. One eye was completely knocked out, and his face was badly burned. There are still open wounds on his face from the effect of this, although he spent three months in the hospital. In my opinion the school should be wired for electric lighting, and a plant installed. If the Department should decide to do this, the installation of a pressure tank and lighting plant could be carried out at the same time. A new engine would have to be supplied, as the one in use now would not be large enough. The engine that pumps the water is in the stable, which is\nsituated about half way between the school and the river. It draws the water from the river to the barn, and then by pressure from the pump, from there to the tanks in the school, and is distributed throughout the school from the tanks by gravity. I was three days on this reserve, but as it was during the weekend when the school was not in session I did not have a chance to examine the classrooms, but I had a good opportunity of meeting the Indians and seeing what was going on around the school and on the reserve. I must say that I was very favorably impressed with the Principal, the Rev. Father Brachet; he is highly respected by the Indians, and has a great influence on the reserve. What pleased me more than anything was the fact that I could see the influence of the school wherever I went on the reserve. This, no doubt, is what the Department expects on every reserve, but you are aware in how few cases it can be seen. In this place, however, it is very noticeable, and it is largely due to the Principal. There are numerous outbuildings at the school, all in a fair state of repair, but very little has been done in the way of repairs for the last few years, and an item should be placed in the Estimates for general repairs; it need not be large, as, if the material, etc., is purchased, the school authorities will do the necessary work. As regards fire protection I may say that the fire apparatus is in good shape, as everything has been renewed and there are sufficient fire extinguishers and hose to meet the requirements. A door opens from the two dormitories out onto a platform, and from there a sliding pole leads to the ground. Fire drill -is held-\nis held regularly once a week, and, in my opinion, everything possible is being done to guard against loss by fire.\nAugust 10, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your SOS-11 of the 31st ultimo, enclosing Mr. Inspector Christianson's report on the schools in the Manitowah Agency. It is gratifying to learn that, in the main, satisfactory work is being done. You will receive separate communications with reference to improvements at the various schools.\n\nI note that a pressure tank or new elevated tanks should be supplied for the Pine Creek Indian Residential School and that the lighting plant should be changed to electricity. I regret that there are no funds available for these purposes at the present time; but I have made a note for next year's estimates. In the meantime, I will arrange for the visit of a Public Works engineer, so that we will have an expert's report concerning just what should be done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D.

Ferrier, Supt. of Indian Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn answer to your letter written at Winnipegosis I have to say that I am very sorry that you have been unable through uncontrollable circumstances to come and visit our school and staff. I hope that during the next holidays we will have the pleasure of meeting you and of discoursing about Indian education.\n\nIn your letter you suggest that I should write you this month letting you know what we need most. After due thought the Rev. Sisters and I have decided that the most urgent need to fill is a BREAD OVEN. We have presently a huge brick oven, the top of which is unsafe on account of bits of bricks falling down regularly, and which let a thick smoke escape throughout the kitchen and the whole school during the baking operation, thus making the stay in the kitchen most unbearable, and exposing us to fire, should the top fall in a mass while fire is on. The gift from the Department of a good oven would be a great change for our school and would be deeply appreciated by the girls who have to keep crying while making bread, on account of the dense smoke. I am sure that, if you wish to use your influence, you would be able to obtain one good oven for us from the Department.\n\nThe Dacust \"Economy\" Oven gives constant satisfaction. I have seen one at work and the town baker who uses it says he would never part with it or consent to have a brick oven in its place. We would need the Size 4 Wood burning Oven $400.00.\n\nHoping you will be able to encourage us with this gift, I am, Sir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

F. McKenzie.\n\nSir,\n\nI am glad to let the Department know that we have performed the work of painting the inside of the school with two coats, using the services of Victor Marmounier, of 114 Jefferson Ave., Winnipeg, as foreman to oversee the work. We have furnished him with the necessary help; we have also boarded him and we have paid his transportation expenses from and to Winnipeg.\n\nMr. Marmounier had to do long hours in order to keep out soon from being in the pupils' way.\n\nThe whole school has been painted, except in a few places where alterations are needed and are to be asked from the Department.\n\nThe painter has asked subsequently $92.75 worth of paint, in order to do the work satisfactorily. As the inside of the school had not been painted for the last 16 years, in places it needed three coats; thus the work has been prolonged. We have expended $209.24 more than we expected, on account of more paint accessories having been required and the work having lasted longer. However, I do not think that the Department will have any objection, knowing that we have spent ourselves $350.00 in labour and accessories for the renewal of the floors of the school, and that we have also made the expense of $300.00 for a good and reliable root cellar, in order to store all our vegetables and 40 tons of turnips and mangels, which shall be fed to our milching cows, in order to obtain abundant and good milk for the pupils.\n\nThus $397.24 are due to The J. H. Ashdown Hardware Co. - Winnipeg;\n\n$312.00 are due to Victor Marmounier, 114 Jefferson Ave., Winnipeg.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nO.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Vies Marmounier, a painter by trade, came into my office and spoke about payment for some painting work he performed on the interior of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School.\n\nAccording to the certificate enclosed herewith Mr. Marmounier has worked 52 days of 12 hours each day at .50\u00a2 per hour, earning $312.00.\n\nIn addition this man Mr. Marmounier was to receive his board and his fare going and returning to Winnipeg, for this amounting to $30.25 has been paid to Mr. Marmounier by the Rev'd Principal, and a receipt is shown on the accompanying certificate.\n\nMr. Marmounier took a helper with him, the work has been completed, and he has paid to his helper some $60.00 on account, but he cannot pay the balance until he receives his payment of $312.00. He seems to be a very decent kind of a man, and he was sent to me, but as I told him, I have no information about this matter more than a statement that the Department had intimated to the Rev'd Principal that a certain amount was allowed for material and work to complete this work done. I told Mr. Marmounier that I would write to the Department and to the Rev'd Principal for him.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the above to the Rev'd Principal.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nJno.

As far as the water is concerned, all that is needed is the renewing of the present tanks. This would eliminate any charges in changing the pipe system, and the cost would only be $250.00. The installing of a lighting system which would be ample for their requirements would cost $1943.00, plus the board of men while installing, which would be a small matter. Mr. Sharpe, the Manager of the Delco Company here, who is an authority on lighting, made a trip to Pine Creek under difficult conditions in order to give this matter careful consideration, and I am satisfied that if the authority is given, the situation will be cleared up at this school and everything can be put in good shape before winter sets in. I should be glad if the money could be made available so that we could take advantage of the investigations that have been made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nREPAIRS & IMPROVEMENTS\n\nneeded\n\nat the PINE CREEK INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL - CAMPERVILLE P.O., Man.\n\n- II - IMPROVEMENTS -\n\n1- Water Tanks (compressed air)\nThe present water tanks, made of galvanized iron, are worn out through rust, and expose us often to inundations, thus spoiling the new floors just obtained from the Indian Dept.\n\nElectric Plant.\nWe have now acetylene light; the machine is old; the system is defective and dangerous.\n\n2- Bakery.\na) Oven (Size 4 D'Acoust \"Economy\" Wood Oven.\nb) Bread Mixer.\n\nWe have no bakery. The oven we use now is situated in the kitchen, thus giving fearful heat in a place already too hot. It consists of a brick oven, which falls in pieces, thus being dangerous for fire, as it close to the ceiling, and it let escape a terrible and annoying smoke all throughout the school.\n\nWe have no bread mixer.\n\n3- Laundry.\na) Power Washing Machine. (Beaver)\nb) Steam Boiler.\nc) Extractor.\n\nWe have no laundry accommodations whatever. There is an old washing machine, which is worn out and does not clean the linen properly. We have no drying machine for the clothes.\n\nH.B.- There is no room in the school for all these apparatuses. A new building would be necessary, to have all the machines together, working, as much as possible, with the same power.\n\nThis building could be big enough to leave space for:\n\n1- A Dairy Room. We have none.\n\n2- Employees' dining room and bed room. We have only a small room for them, and we intend to extend the boys' recreation room in it.\n\n3- Drying Tumbler, which we could ask from the Dept. later, and which could be installed near the laundry.\n\n4- Frigidaire, which could be asked from the Dept. later.\n\nThus anything that would be installed could be set for good, without need of alteration in the near future.\n\nSept. 30, 1928.\nREPAIRS & IMPROVEMENTS\n\nneeded\n\nat the PINE CREEK INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL - CAMPERVILLE P.O., Man.\n\n1. Renewal of all inside Sewer Pipes & Water Closets.\n   The Sewer Pipes are clogged up with alkali deposits; they have been pierced in several places in order to free them temporarily; these openings are not hygienic.\n   The closet working apparatus is worn out with rust and use in every place.\n\n2. Installation of Bath Rooms, with water closets, in the middle room between the boys' and girls' dormitories. Three bath-tubs are required for the boys and as many for the girls.\n   The present bathing accommodations are downstairs in the open and are not adequate.\n\n3. Installation of a large recreation room for the boys. It could be put in the basement, where presently we have a shoe repairing shop, and comprise in the same time the employees' dining-room and a part of the refectory.\n   The present recreation room is on the ground floor with too many exits to facilitate supervising, and specially it is altogether too small for the number of boys who can hardly move around to play, and have no place therein to be taught manual work.\n\n4. Installation of a common recreation room for the girls. It could be put in the basement, where presently we have a little laundry, and could be extended to comprise the pantry.\n   The girls have now two recreation rooms, one for the big girls, another for the small ones. These recreation rooms are small and necessitate uselessly the attendance of two Sisters.\n\n5. Installation of one dining room for the Fathers, and of another one for the Sisters. It could be put in the refectory, which instead could comprise the small girls' recreation room.\n   The pantry would be found very convenient quite near the kitchen, where the Sisters' dining room is now. As we have competent Sisters to take charge of the pupils during their meals, they can teach them better how to eat and behave at table, if Fathers have a private dining room outside of the refectory.\n\n6. Installation of one parlour for Indian parents. It could be put where actually we have the boys' recreation room and comprise a part of the senior class room, which instead could take the big girls' recreation room.\n\nN.B. - These changes would mean removing of partitions and installation of others. It would also be necessary to have the stairs going from the basement to the ground floor built in a different way, so as to pass along the recreation rooms on both sides of the building without disturbing the pupils.\n\nThese changes are necessitated in view of accommodating the pupils and facilitating a proper and constant care of every one of them.\n\nII - IMPROVEMENTS\n\n(See page 2)\nOttawa, November 15, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Very Rev. Father Provincial has handed to the Department, today, your list of the improvements that are required at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School. The Department intends to place an amount in the Estimates for this purpose; but, in the meantime, it is considered desirable to have a definite proposal from you concerning the best method of having two of the improvements effected. I refer to the alterations in the basement - Nos. 3 to 6, on page 1 of your list. Please let me have an estimate of the cost of the materials in this connection and indicate what expert labour, if any, it will be necessary to engage.\n\nI should be glad if you would let me have a rough sketch of the proposed laundry addition - such laundry to house a power washing machine, a steam boiler, an extractor and later, a drying tumbler. I do not believe it advisable to have a dairy placed in the same building as the laundry, and I wish you would seriously consider the suitability of such an addition for employees' living quarters, before making a recommendation. Please let me know whether this building should be of stone or of frame and if you could supervise its construction on a day labour basis. You might also give me an estimate of the cost.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to favourably consider the supplying of a frigidaire, as this requires considerable electric power. It is not our practice to supply water softeners either. I may say that Mr. Commissioner Graham, next spring, will be given authority to complete arrangements in connection with the electric plant and lighting and the renewing of the water tanks. When you are considering the alterations in the basement, you should keep in mind the advisability of allowing room there for the electric plant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Father Magman, Provincial Superior of the Oblate Order, and also of Rev. Jos. Guy, O.M.I., the Department is placing an order with the Fletcher Mfg. Co., Ltd., Toronto, to supply, for the use of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School\n\n1 Fig 1727 - P 1\u00bd Bbl. single arm dough mixer, equipped with tight and loose pulleys and belt shifter and provided with a canopy top.\n\nThe above firm have been requested to ship the dough mixer addressed to you, Winnipegosis, Man.

Upon receipt of the mixer, you should certify on the account as follows: \"Goods received.

We understand the shipping weight of the machine is 11,000 pounds and that it will occupy floor space of 32\" x 72\". It is hoped that when this machine arrives it will be satisfactory and that you will have ample room in which to operate same.

MAGNAN, O.M.I.,\nDATED DECEMBER 17, 1926, REGARDING KENORA\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\n---\n\nI am glad Mr. Graham did not install a Delco at Pine Creek School this fall. A Delco is not sufficient at St. Philip's; it would be still less at Pine Creek. A year ago we have installed a double plant, Lister-Bronston at our ecclesiastical College at Lebret, but as they are now served by the provincial plant we could dispose of the bigger one, just the thing that would suit Father Brachet. The engine is a 20 H.P. and the generator develops 6 K, 120V. The cost was $2600.\n\nThe Department may prefer to buy a new one, but it is important to install a good one that will give satisfaction.\nDear Sir:\n\nReverend Brother Eugene Gauthier has been working for nearly a month at Pine Creek Indian Res. School, inspecting the building and drawing sketches for the proposed alterations and improvements. I beg to submit to you his report in full.\n\nAfter a thorough inspection of building and equipment my remarks are that the conditions of the building itself are good, except for the sagging of the center part, on account of the weight of the water tanks for the school supply. As can be seen on the second floor plan, one tank only is in that center part; but there are also two other tanks immediately above in the attic to supply the dormitories.\n\nThe capacity of the tanks in the attic is 1200 gallons and the one shown in the center of the dormitory is 500 gal., making a total of 1700 gal., a weight of nearly two tons\u2014exactly 17850 pounds. These tanks should be removed as soon as possible for the safety of the building.\n\nIn 1912, the longitudinal center partition, shown on the Basement plan, has been raised, and a new concrete foundation built under it. There is too much on it besides the floors above and the roof. Provision therefore should be made for pneumatic tanks in the proposed addition.\n\nI have also noticed that the complete sewer system are clogged with sediment and alkali contained in the water. The cast iron sewer pipes, in the building, have been bored in a great many places to insert cleaning rods, and these openings are simply stopped with wooden plugs, which endanger the sanitary condition of the school. This system need to be done over entirely.\n\nThe Basement floor plan shows the present condition of the laundry, which in itself is altogether too small, where, in addition to laundry equipment, several other machines have been installed for want of proper place. The present washer, which is the only mechanical laundry apparatus is a homemade machine built eighteen years ago, consequently worn out and entirely inadequate. A complete set of modern machines in a proper place are an urgent necessity.\n\nOwing to the present system of sewer disposal which leaves the building at 24\" above the basement floor, it is impossible to drain same and impossible also to have lavatories on that floor. It would be advisable to have the septic tank and other sewer disposed of towards the River, to West, for the following reasons:\n\n1. The grade towards East is not sufficient to permit drain below basement floor;\n\n2. The building of an addition on the east side, which is the only available place, is possible only if it can be dug to the present basement floor line. Otherwise it would mask the windows in the class room consequently only drain towards the River, west, can permit this;\n\n3. Since the River water is not used any more by the inhabitants even for watering stock, and since we will eventually have to bring the water from the Lake for the School, it is not advisable to continue to dispose of the sewer in that direction;\n\n4. The present cesspool and septic tank are in the way for the\nproposed addition, and the cost of making this change would not be very great because there is actually a good drain that was laid for this event some years ago when renewing the water line to stable. Only the septi tank and inside drain are the necessary extras.\n\nIt might not be out of place here to say a word about the River water used at present in the school. I was told at Pine Creek that this water is so bad as to cause death to animals, which have no other place to water. Everybody drive their stock to the Lake for watering. I have brought samples of said River water and also sample of Lake Winnipegosis water (in sterilized bottles) to the Provincial Board of Health for analysis, which brought the following report: River water, hard, Colon Bacilli present; Bacterial count 4000, not fit for domestic purposes. Lake water, soft, Colon Bacilli, non-bacterial count 3000; good drinking water. Signed: Dr F. Cadham.\n\nOf course this River water is used only for sanitary purposes (Kitchen and other domestic use is ice water), but since the River water is the only kind in the house taps I have seen some pupils using it for drinking against the warning. The only remedy to this condition is to bring the water from the Lake. In the long run it will be less expensive. A profile of both grades West, in the front of the School towards River, and East behind the School towards the Lake will give a clear idea of this possibility.\n\nThe boys and girls play rooms are inadequate. The girls rooms are large enough, but are too far apart. The boys room is too small altogether. The changes shown on the respective plans would improve this situation.\n\nThe removal of the water tanks in the dormitories (which need to be renewed) while relieving the building of their weight, will also provide the necessary bath accommodation.\n\nA hot water tank is also necessary. At present, for bathing and laundry purposes they are using steam to heat one of the tanks in the attic, which is very objectionable on account of the steam escaping from open tank.\n\nThe present lighting gas plant is old and a constant danger. The same machine has caused an explosion some years ago and has been remodelled and installed in another place, but the danger is always there because it is impossible to have the Calcium Carbide of a uniform size to avoid over-generating at times. A good electric plant should replace the present system. With reference to an electric plant it is very important to use a system where the generator itself carries the load, because the current used is drawn from the battery alone there is a loss of at least 30% in best condition (and more as the battery wears away) from storing and drawing from the battery.\n\nOn the next page you will find the approximate cost of addition, improvements and alterations. The Pine Creek School is in pressing need, and I ask you to give kindly to this matter a most favourable consideration. Rev Brother Gauthier will supervise the whole work and see that it is properly done.\n\nYours devotedly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr Russell T.

R.C. 1, of October 24th, last, concerning electric light for the Pine Creek Indian Residential School. The Oblate Provincial has written, recommending a larger outfit than a Delco, and he wishes to know if the Department would consider purchasing from them a Lister-Brunton outfit, which is now surplus to the requirements of the Oblate Order at their college at Lebrat. It is stated the engine is a 20 horse power and that the generator develops 6 kilowatts (120 V.) Please let me have your recommendation concerning this proposal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, January 23, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with enclosures, with reference to improvements at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School. The blue prints prepared by Brother Gauthier have also been received. The laundry addition appears to be much more costly than first estimated. There will be approximately $9,000 available for improvements at this school this year, if Parliament allows our present estimates. The question to be decided now is - how should it be expended. I should be grateful if you would have Brother Gauthier and the Rev. Principal comment on the most urgent improvements you have listed and let me have a recommendation without delay. I fail to understand the estimate of $1,700 for a steam boiler for the laundry. Is it proposed to supply the power for all the laundry machinery with this equipment?\n\nI am asking Mr. Commissioner Graham for a recommendation regarding the Lister-Brunston electric plant, which is now surplus to the requirements of your Order at Lebret. When you next write, you might let me know what price you place on this second hand equipment if the Department purchases it for the Pine Creek Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6270, file 582-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your No. 126-1-5 of the 23rd instant regarding the lighting plant for the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, and reply to say that so far as the Delco Light is concerned it was the intention to put in two units. It was on this basis that the report was made to me and, of course, this would have provided amply for the lighting requirements and I have no doubt would give excellent satisfaction.\n\nI note that the Oblate Order have a surplus Lister-Bruston outfit at Lebret which they would sell. If this outfit could be purchased at a reasonable figure, and the cost of installation were not going to be too great compared with the price given us for the Delco I would recommend that it be bought, for I know the outfit cannot have been in use more than a year and no doubt has been well taken care of during that time. The reason for selling this plant is that the Montreal Engineering Company, Limited are running a power line close to the school and it is the intention to use this method of lighting. I would advise the Department if they have any intention of buying this machine to secure a price for it installed in the school. This organization has proper mechanics who could do this work. I should be glad to know what action it is intended to take in the matter. I could send an expert from here to look over the plant and see that everything is all right, but I strongly recommend that if the purchase is made it be on the understanding that they will install the plant.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, February 2, 1929.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 23rd ultimo, concerning the Lister-Brunston electric plant, surplus to the requirements of your Order at Lebret, I have to inform you that the Department would consider its purchase for the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, provided that the price is satisfactory and that your Order would arrange for the installation - the Department to pay the exact costs. I should be glad if you would let the Department have an offer in this connection. We could then send an expert from Regina to examine it and to comment on your proposal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nVery Rev. J. Magan, O. M. I.,\n340 Provencher Ave.,\nSt. Boniface,\nMan.\nDear Sir:\n\nOn my return from the West I find Mr McLean's letter of the 23rd ult. with reference to improvements at the Pine Creek Res. School. I regret to say it gives no consolation to all concerned.\n\nIf you look over your records, you will notice that Pine Creek School has received less than any other school under our charge. Allow me to say, with all due respect, that these improvements should be done without delay as the situation, at Pine Creek School, seems to be almost intolerable, particularly for the good Sisters. Do you remember I have mentioned to you that the Oblate Sisters is the 3rd Community to take charge of the pupils, and that the material conditions had much to do with the departure of the Benedictine Sisters last August.\n\nAccording to Mr McLean's letter, only a sum of about $9,000.00 is available for Pine Creek, and the question to be decided is\u2014how should it be expended. The improvements contemplated are so linked together it is a difficult task to make a choice. The requirements of Pine Creek School are all so pressing that it would be perhaps advisable to reduce the appropriation granted to other schools of our Province, unless you get a special allowance in the supplementary estimates.\n\nIf absolutely impossible to have all the work done this year, I would suggest the following as more urgent:\n\n1. New addition for Laundry,\n2. Laundry equipment,\n3. Change of septic tank,\n4. Alterations inside the Building.\n\nFor these only a sum of about $13,000.00 would be necessary, and no soft water supply. Brother E. Gauthier had drawn a sketch for a larger Laundry Addition, but, on my advice, he has reduced its size. I am very doubtful it could be smaller. I understand the steam boiler mentioned is to supply the power for all the laundry machinery.\n\nHoping you will give this matter a favourable attention, I remain,\n\nYours devotedly,\n\nJ. Magnan, O.M.I.\nProvincial.\n\nMr Russell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFebruary 6, 1929.\n\nDominion Government,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nOn January 22, we received from you a cheque in the amount of $156.26, your No. 6394 covering repairs to boiler for Pine Creek Residential School.\n\nWill you kindly quote invoice numbers and amounts in this instance.\n\nThanking you, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE J.H. ASHDOWN HARDWARE CO.\nLimited.\n\nPer: [Signature]\n\nH.M.P.\nDept. No. 47\n\nOttawa, February 12th., 1929.\n\nDear Sirs,-\n\nReferring to your letter of the 6th instant, relative to Department's cheque No. 6394 amounting to $156.26 covering repairs to boiler for the Pine Creek Residential School, I beg to enclose herewith a copy of your memorandum quoting the invoices which this amount represents.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H. Paget\nChief Accountant and Purchasing Agent.\n\nThe J.H. Ashdown Hardware Co. Ltd.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your favour of the 2nd inst. As you had informed me that only a sum of about $9,000.00 was available for Pine Creek School, I thought it was useless to mention a price on our Lister-Brunston electric plant at Lebret, other improvements being more urgent than a new lighting system. Nevertheless if the Department would consider the purchase of that electric plant for Pine Creek School I believe $2,000.00, f.o.b. Lebret, would be a fair price. Expenses for installation would be paid by the Oblate Fathers.\n\nIn my last letter to Mr Ferrier\u2014February the 4th\u2014I have given wrong information regarding the steam boiler to be installed at Pine Creek. The boiler will be used for heating the addition and supply hot water for the laundry. The power would be furnished by the gas engine of the electric plant.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. Magnan, O.M.I.,\nProvincial.\n\nMr J.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 15, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to your 208-114 of the 29th ultimo, concerning the Lister-Brunston electric plant, which is surplus to the Oblate Fathers' requirements at Lebret. The church authorities have offered to install this plant in the Pine Creek School, if the Department will allow them $2,000 for it and will pay the freight from Lebret to the Indian School. I take it that there will be, in addition, the cost of wiring and electric fixtures. I should be grateful if you would have this plant examined and let me have your recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, February 15, 1929.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letters of the 4th and 9th instant, concerning the most urgent improvements at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School. Consideration will be given to your representations when the Department is preparing its programme for the summer. I have written to Mr. Commissioner Graham, of Regina, regarding your offer in connection with the electric plant at Lebret, and you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nVery Rev. J. Magan, O. M. I.,\n340 Provencher Ave.,\nSt. Boniface,\nMan.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant No. 126-1-5, concerning the Lister-Bruston electric plant which is surplus at the Oblate Mission in Lebret. I understand that this plant consists of two generators, four and six K.W., working in parallel, and as the price of these new in Regina after taking off the discount would be $5000.00 it would be an excellent buy at $2000.00, but it has just occurred to me that the Department have probably not had an offer of the two units at this figure, and it is just possible that the price submitted is on the six K.W. generator alone. If you have any further information on this subject I should be glad to have it by return mail, as this makes a great deal of difference. It would not be an extra good buy if we were only getting the six k.w. plant, because this could be bought for around $2000.00 new at Regina, and possibly cheaper at Portage la Prairie. However, if it is the complete plant consisting of the two units that they are quoting on it is a splendid buy, provided the plant has been well cared for during the time it has been in operation. I am sending an expert down tomorrow morning, who will examine the plant thoroughly, and I shall be able to make a recommendation after I receive your letter giving me this additional information.\n\nI may inform you that the price I had from the Delco Light people for wiring the building was $643.00. I do not know whether they would undertake to do the wiring now that they are not selling the engine. They offered to wire the building and install a double unit Delco Light Plant for $1943.00, plus the board of men while installing.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Father Magnan, Provincial of the Oblate Order of St. Boniface, in which he states that the offer of $2000.00 is for one generator only, the larger one of the two, with switchboard and batteries. In making a comparison of the capacity I find that the combined units of the Delco Plant will generate 2500 watts, whereas the single Lister-Bruston will generate 6000 watts, over double the capacity, and while this capacity is really not needed at present, there might come a time when it would be used, and in view of this it might be just as well to take over the Lister-Bruston single unit. You will note that Father Magnan offers to install this plant for $2000.00. Of course he does not mean to include the wiring of the building, and it seems to me that it might be well to have them undertake the wiring, but before doing so I think you should be guided by the price quoted by the Delco people who offer to do the wiring if they sell their plant to the Government.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

The Department will pay the freight costs from Lebret to the school. It is understood that the 6 kilowatt generator, 20 horse power engine, switch board and batteries will be installed.\n\nWhen the installation is satisfactorily made, you should prepare a voucher, in duplicate, in favour of the Oblate Order, and have it certified by the Reverend Principal.

R.,\nCamperville P.O., Man.,\nMay 13th, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nIt has always been my aim to give the pupils plenty of milk daily, and cream and butter occasionally; the results are very gratifying, for the children become very healthy, although some are not over strong when they enter the school.\n\nOur cream Separator has thus ran regularly for years and now it is found incapable of further service. We have to replace it with a new machine. After due consideration and inspection of different Cream Separators, I find that the De Laval are the best, with the further advantage that we can always obtain the necessary repairs locally, that is in Winnipeg. We need a No. 17 - Capacity 1000 lbs - Price $137.50.\n\nAs the Indian Department is always ready to encourage the school sanitation, I take the liberty of asking the Department to pay the machine for us at the De Laval Co. - Winnipeg - Man. We shall all be very grateful for such help.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nAgent of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6270, file 582-5, part 2)\nOttawa, May 21st, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, requesting authority to purchase a De Laval cream separator for the use of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, and stating the cost of same.\n\nOwing to the many demands on our appropriation and also to the fact that the Department has already authorized considerable expenditure in the installation of electric lighting equipment at your school, I regret that there are no further funds available to provide for the purchase of a separator. You should arrange for the payment of this equipment from per capita grant or other school receipts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Brachet, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nPine Creek Indian Res. School,\nCamperville, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nReverend Fr Chagnon, Principal of Sandy Bay School, has willingly accepted to wait till next year for the construction of a barn, and consequently, the appropriation of $4,500.00 that has been made for that purpose could be transferred to Pine Creek School.\n\nUnfortunately, things are not going so smoothly with Lebret. According to the information I have received from Reverend Fr L\u00e9onard, work on the Laundry could not be delayed. The boiler is in a very bad shape and all the flues must be replaced as soon as possible, one or two going out of order every week. Mr Graham has refused to renew the flues this spring.\n\nThe Sisters would not consider my proposition. Three years ago they have asked Mr Scott to have an addition built to the Laundry, because the boiler, the engine and the coal bin being located close to the machinery, proper work could not be done and the linen was often soiled.\n\nThe Reverend Principal would be satisfied with an addition and some new laundry equipment, at the cost of about $5,000.00, but this is not Mr Graham's plan.\n\nWhat will be the fate of Pine Creek School? I still hope the Department of Indian Affairs will make a special appropriation for this school as its requirements are the most pressing.\n\nThank you again for your kind and friendly visit, I remain,\n\nYours devotedly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr Russell T.

Fuller, Provincial Boiler Inspector, who, in the same time is Inspector for the Manitoba Bureau of Labor and Fire Prevention Branch, in his visit of the School on the 29th ult., has found unsafety in the laundry machinery. I beg to enclose herewith in duplicate his report of the inspection.\n\nAs the report states, the lack of safety is due to the fact that the belts are unguarded and leaving a very limited room to the help for circulation, but mainly to the fact that the washing machine, being of a very old type, has no stationary outer cover.\n\nThe Inspector urges that the washing machine be discarded as soon as possible. I would, therefore, earnestly ask the Department to see into the matter in the very near future, as the help cannot rashly be exposed to constant danger, neither specially the pupils, and to supply us with safe and adequate washing machinery and facilities, so as to encourage the help and children in this rather tedious work.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev.

Mr. J. L. Fuller, Provincial Boiler Inspector, of Dauphin, has come to inspect the school boilers. I beg to enclose his report in duplicate.\n\nBOILER No. 1 - This boiler has been found in good condition, if properly repaired. The main repair is to set again properly in brick work; this shall be fairly costly.\n\nBOILER No. 2 - This boiler has been utterly condemned. Here is what the Inspector says:\n\"This boiler was placed in the school 30 years ago and has now become so thin around the back head that it sprung a leak last winter.\nIn examining the back head I found that all the back head above the tubes was so thin that it would sink under the hammer at any point.\"\n\nTherefore a new boiler is necessary. As I understand that Bro. Eugene Gaither, O.M.I., is coming in a fortnight to direct some repair work in our school, and as he has full experience in boiler repairing, opportune it would be, I think, to have the new boiler shipped as soon as possible, that he may install it fittingly. Consequently I would respectfully ask the Department to give orders in the near future for a new boiler to be sent to WINNIPEGOSIS - C.N.R.\n\nHere is the type of boiler we need.\n\n1 36\" x 14' 0\" Steel Tubular Steam Boiler,\nwith\n2 6\" flange openings for mains,\n1 4\" flange opening for return,\n1 2\u00bd\" Pop Safety Valve,\n1 0-100-lb. Steam Gauge Water Column complete with fittings.\n\nI hope, in the same time, that the Department will be kind enough to accept and assume the cost of the work of setting the new boiler and of resetting the old boiler (the one found in good condition).\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev.

I would appreciate very much if you would use your influence towards the Department of Public Works to have the dredge at Winnipegosisis to assist us in digging the channel in the Lake for the intake pipe. The Lake is quite shallow and we will have to go 400 ft, probably more, to get a sufficient depth of water to prevent freezing.\n\nIt will be a hard proposition for hand work, for the shore is coarse sand and gravel.\n\nI have seen Mr Goodspeed, District Engineer, Dominion Public Works, in Winnipeg, to that effect, and I hope it will be possible, especially if this is recommended by some Official at Ottawa.\n\nWill you also be kind enough to see that some money for wages be sent to me, together with some labor return forms.\n\nThe work is progressing satisfactorily at Kenora. The Addition to the School and the boat-house will be finished in about six weeks time.\n\nWith anticipated thanks,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBro. Eug\u00e9 Gauthier\n\nCamperville, Man.\n\nMr Gurney Orr, Architect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAugust 19th, 1929.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThis Department is about to undertake the reconstruction of a water supply system at one of its boarding schools at Pine Creek, Man. This work is being carried out under the direction of Brother Eugene Gauthier, who has just advised me that your Department has a dredge at Winnipogosis.\n\nAs it would be necessary to excavate a channel in the lake on a distance of about 400 ft. for the installing of an intake pipe, your Department would render a great service in giving the necessary authorization to Mr. Goodspeed, your District Engineer of Winnipeg to have the above mentioned dredging performed in co-operation with Brother Gauthier who is already on the site of the work with a number of workmen.\n\nI might say that the reason for going such a distance into the lake is due to the shallow condition of the shore and the necessity of preventing the intake pipe from freezing in the winter time. The nature of the soil where the work is to be carried out is coarse sand and gravel. I should appreciate very much if you would advise me at an early date of your Department's decision concerning this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nChief Engineer,\nDepartment of Public Works,\nOttawa.\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 2nd inst. relatively to a new boiler which you authorize us to purchase and to the other boiler which we are allowed to reset and repair. We feel very thankful to the Department for this favour.\n\nWith reference to the size of washing machine we require in replacement of the old type washing machine which is worn out and dangerous, we beg to say that we are going to make the necessary inquiries in order to find out a satisfactory and lasting machine and we will let you know the result of our investigation in the near future.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev.

When the dredge arrived there dredging was requested for a distance of something like 1500 feet and to a depth of 10 feet. This occasionally happens.

Letter, Sept. 10, 1929.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt on the 15th ult. of a cheque of $2,000.00 from the Department to pay labour in connection with the improvements of the Pine Creek School.\n\nI am herewith forwarding to day in duplicate the labour pay sheets from August 14th to October 5th for digging and filling a trench from the school to the lake for the water pipe, also for the digging and filling of a new septic tank and trench for the outlet pipe from the school to the river. The total amount is $2,494.30, to wit:\n\n| Date   | Amount |\n|--------|--------|\n| Aug. 17 | 76.75  |\n|        | 148.60 |\n|        | 229.40 |\n|        | 272.85 |\n|        | 85.50  |\n| Sept. 7 | 212.00 |\n|        | 61.15  |\n|        | 265.10 |\n|        | 196.50 |\n|        | 70.25  |\n|        | 65.85  |\n|        | 92.50  |\n|        | 88.50  |\n|        | 144.50 |\n|        | 198.75 |\n| Oct. 5  | 216.75 |\n|        | 16.00  |\n\n$2,494.30\n\nI beg you to note that we began the work just when the fall fishing season started on Lake Winnipegosis. The men at that very time were rather scarce, some others had gone for harvesting, and it was impossible to obtain then lower wages. Immediately after the end of the fishing, that is from September 19th, we dropped the wages $1.00 lower.\n\nYou will notice also that I have signed myself the pay sheets for the Indian Agent, who is situated too far from here: Portage la Prairie is 200 miles away. I had asked him to come and inspect the work, but I suppose he was too busy overlooking the threshing on reserves around the town.\n\nI forward in the same time receipts in duplicate for disbursements regarding the improvements, to wit to:\n\nA. Pelletier $8.00 for lumber,\nJ.N.O. Bourbonni\u00e8re 68.40 for hauling material etc.,\nC. Chartrand 210.00 for hauling gravel,\nJ. Pangman 6.90 for filling lime kiln,\nC. Chartrand 59.00 for hauling wood to lime kiln,\nE. Guiboch\u00e9 24.50 for firing lime kiln,\nJ. Desrochers 40.00 for driving Bro. Gauthier to Winnipegosis relatively to\n$411.60 lumber, other material and freight.\nThe gravel and lime are for the addition which we start to build. Some gravel has been used for the septic tank.\n\nThe total expenditure up to now is then\n\n$2,906.10\n\nPay sheets $2,494.30\nReceipts $411.80\n\n$2,906.10\n\nYou then see that we have advanced the sum of $906.10. I would, therefore, be thankful if you would send me immediately a cheque of $1,500.00, to have the amount of $906.10 reimbursed and also to pay the few labourers we are still keeping for the construction of the addition for laundry, bakery and electric plant.\n\nI remain, dear Sir,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev.

J. Brackett\nO.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nNotes on improvements made at the Big Creek Residential School.\n\nDredge work. It has been insufficient. The dredge has stopped at 150 ft. from the shore, the digging being there only 4 ft. The digging has started at about 1000 ft., where 7 ft. of water have been found over the hard pan, which rises gradually towards the shore. The machine, not being strong enough to penetrate the hard pan, has dug only the soft ground, which covers the hard pan, so that the work after all is not very useful, and we shall have to dig by hand to complete it, if we are not able to dynamite it.\n\nSewer Pipe. The Sewer Pipe, which was supposed to be used for the septic tank and which we believed to be low enough, had to be abandoned, first from the fact that it is only 5' 4\" under the ground level and thus does not permit the draining of the wash room, furthermore from the fact that it is only 4\" dia. and at the point where it has been uncovered, the sloping level did not show enough.\n\nFrom this the necessity of another canal of a length of 650 ft., down to the river. This canal, near the septic tank, is 8' 2\" deep; at the road, in front the school, where the ground is higher, it is 9' 3\" deep; from there it lowers gradually down to the river with a declivity of 6\" per 100 ft.\n\nWe have needed for this canal 650 ft. of clay pipe, 6 in. dia.\n\nStones. All the work of digging, towards the lake for the inlet pipe, as much as towards the river, as outlet for the septic tank, has been rendered more difficult on account of the great quantity of stones contained in the ground. In places these stones were so big that we had to break them in order to pull them out or sink them to the bottom in digging a deeper hole.\n\nHard pan. This digging was also made harder on account of the hard pan which is found everywhere at a depth of 3\u00bd or 4 ft. The pick had to be used everywhere, penetrating \u00be in. only at a time.\n\nWater Pipe. The inlet water pipe is 1800 ft. long and is laid at 9 ft. deep for 50 ft. from the shore up to a manhole cemented with a wide wooden cover and put at the back of a gravel bank near the lake shore. The pipe then raises to the level of the lake, to wit at 4' 6\" deep all throughout the muskeg with a gradation of 2 in. per hundred ft. up to the school, thus reaching a depth of 10 ft. near the addition; it rises to the surface in the machine room.\n\nSewer system in the school. The sewer system having been condemned by a sanitary expert has to be renewed entirely. It is then more economical to do the work in the same time while the new sewer pipes are set in the laundry, thus cutting out the traveling expenses of pipe fitters.\n\nSteam Boilers. The only steam boiler left from the old installation had to be reset according to the report of the boiler inspector, and it was necessary to move it closer to the new boiler, asked by the said Inspector. Happily, in a way, it was discovered thus in time that one of the two side supports was corroded by rust, which menaced to corrode the boiler itself. This support was replaced by one of the supports of the condemned boiler.\n\nNew chimney. An expert found out that the inadequacy of the heating system proceeded from the small diameter of the chimney flue.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6270, file 582-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNotes on improvements made at the Pine Creek Residential School.\n\nNew chimney. (continued)\n\nThe chimney flue is only 12 x 14; thus far too small to give a good draught. The expert advised as only solution the building of a new chimney with a flue of 24\" x 24\". The old boiler chimney will be used from now on for the kitchen range, as the range chimney was also of a too small diameter and will be used now as adequate ventilator for the kitchen.\n\nFreight. The freight of the sundry material required for the improvements has been made by boat over a distance of 45 miles.\n\nGravel.

Please forward a certified account, in duplicate, to the Department for payment, quoting this letter and file number as your authority.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nVery Rev. J. Magnus, O. M. I.,\n340 Provencher Ave.,\nSt. Boniface,\nMan.\nSir,\n\nRe. improvements - Pine Creek School -\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of recent date, in which you state that you had not received an adequate answer to your favour of June 4th, also that, on consulting the Department files, you had not found any authorization for the work which was carried on at the Pine Creek School.\n\nRegarding the answer to your letter of the 4th of June, I stated then, on the 12th of August, just before leaving Kenora, that I was coming to the Pine Creek School with some men to proceed with the work of digging a canal to have water from the lake, and I thought that this mentioned sufficiently which work was most pressing. Such was the information you wanted.\n\nRegarding the authorization of the improvements at the Pine Creek School, which authorization you did not find on the files, this startled me very much. However, I had received orders from Rev. J. Magnan, O.M.I., Provincial of the Oblates of Manitoba, to proceed with the different works, and as we expected his visit any time, I waited to answer you on the point until I would speak to Rev. Father Magnan about it. At his visit he informed us that he had received directly from Ottawa a telegram, letting him know that he had full authorization to carry on the works. He went away lately, and I am pleased now to be able to let you know these facts, and in the same time to assure you that I always appreciate fully your help and co-operation with our different undertakings.\n\nI hope that you will be pleased to know that the work is carried on very satisfactorily and we enjoy exceptional weather for it.\n\nR. Gurney Orr, Architect,\nDept. of Ind. A.- Ottawa.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This will be sent to you under separate cover. Rev. Father Guy has left the notes on the improvements that are being made at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School. There is now available for this work $12,800, and, at the present time, the Department has had no estimate as to what the improvements now being undertaken will cost. Counting the cheque that is now going forward, there will have been directed $6,000 for labour. The account for lumber is approximately $4,000. Under cover of the 21st ultimo, you forwarded accounts for pneumatic tanks, etc., amounting to approximately $1,700.\n\nThis is your authority to expend up to $12,800 on these improvements; but, before any further work is authorized, the Department must have an estimate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Bracht, O. M. I.,\nPrincipal,\nPine Creek Residential School,\nCamperville, Man.\nREPORT OF LABOUR ON IMPROVEMENTS at Pine Creek School\nsince week ending August 17th, 1929 up to date.\n\nDIGGING FOR WATER PIPE LINE (special 3 in. galv.)\nfrom new building to lake.\n\nTrench 3 ft. wide x 1975 ft. long, excavated to a depth of 10 ft. at the building and continue with a down grade of 2 in. per 100 ft., across the ridge, and through the marsh.\nThe latter is dug at an average of 4\u00bd ft.\n\nAt the bank of the lake there is built a concrete box 6'x4'x4' deep, with a 24 in. man-hole to provide room and access to two 3 in. gate valves and 3 in. check valve between the two gates. The top of man-hole has been kept 24 in. below top of bank and is covered with marsh loam level with the bank.\nSand concrete box and man-hole are provided with double covers (with 10 cm between).\n\nPast the concrete box there is a drop with 45\u00b0 angles to 6 ft. below actual water level.\nFrom lake shore to where the dredge dug (approx. 180 ft.), we have made a coffer-dam with clay and we have excavated said distance and laid the pipe on same level and filled over.\n\nThis concludes, for the present, the extent of laying the pipe. When the lake will be frozen sufficiently, we intend to build a wooden coffer-dam to cut the clay bank between trench and excavation by the dredge, and continue the digging, from the top of the ice, at the same level, as far as necessary to complete the work which was supposed to have been done by the dredge.\n\nLAYING OF PIPE AND FILLING OVER.\n\nThe water pipe is laid in a wooden box, made out of 2 in. stock, 4 x 4 in. inside, all the distance from machinery room to concrete man-hole at the lake shore, to protect the pipe from frost and briefly to protect it from contact with clay, which contains a large percentage of alkali, considered by experts as injurious to even galv. pipe.\nPast the concrete box as far as the water, the pipe is coated with asphalt paint for the same reason.\n\nFrom machinery room and for a distance approx. 400 ft., where the trench is not more than 8' 6\" deep, the filling is clay only. From that point to the marsh and through the marsh to the concrete box, the pipe is covered with at least 1 ft. of marsh loam, then levelled with clay and finally banked over with marsh loam 2 ft. thick and 20 ft. wide all along.\n\nThe remaining part of the trench, from the concrete box to free water in the lake, is filled entirely with marsh loam.\n\nIn the whole course of the suction pipe from the pump to intake in the lake, sharp angles have been eliminated. Only four 45\u00b0 elbows have been used and three ball joints supplied to be installed, if necessary, in the course to be laid in the lake.\n\n(continued on page 2)\nHEATING AND PLUMBING.\n\nSewer and drain pipes are all laid in under floors in old as well as in the new building, and plumbing fixtures in old building taken down and re-erected. A new heating boiler for the school has been erected in place of the old one taken out and the other one repaired and re-set according to requirements of boiler inspector, and heating system repaired. A new boiler 36 in. x 10 ft. (high pressure) has been set in the new building.\n\nA new chimney with a 24 in. flue was necessary for the efficient working of the boilers in the school and has been built accordingly. The old chimney was only 12 in x 14 in. and is to be used for the kitchen stove, which has not the proper size flue in the present chimney. Same is to be used as ventilator for the kitchen.\n\nMATERIAL PURCHASED.\n\nLumber, including doors, windows and cement, has been provided, as per list forwarded to the department, and is practically complete with the exception of a little extra, which will be required.\n\nLaundry machinery, comprising 2 washers, 1 extractor, and 1 tumbler dryer, have been purchased from the Beaver Machinery Co., of Toronto for the sum of $2,550.00, F.O.B. Toronto.\n\nFrom experience gathered from the staffs in other schools, it is found that one large washer, usually installed, is more costly to operate than two small ones, for the reason that small batches require the same large amount of water and soda as large ones, and with two machines, one can be left for coarse washing and the other for white articles, and the original cost is the same.\n\nTwo pneumatic water tanks 5' x 12' and one hot water tank 36\" x 12' with coil has also been purchased from Manitoba Bridge and Iron Works, Winnipeg, for the sum of $1,070.00, F.O.B. Winnipegosis.\n\nOne \"Curtis\" Air Compressor 3\" x 3\u00bd\" purchased from Canadian Fairbanks-Morse, Winnipeg, F.O.B. Winnipegosis, $64.68.\n\nAMOUNT EXPENDED.\n\n| Item Description                                      | Amount   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Lumber, including doors, windows, cement              | $4,090.00|\n| Nails                                                 | 95.42    |\n| Laundry Machinery                                     | 2,250.00 |\n| Hot & Cold Water Tanks                                | 1,070.00 |\n| Air Compressor                                        | 64.38    |\n| Freight of lumber, cement, etc., from Wpegosis by boat| 540.63   |\n| Draying from cars at Wpegosis to dock                 | 67.50    |\n| Freight on Laundry Machinery from Toronto to Wpegosis | 246.09   |\n| Wages to date, approx                                 | 5,000.00 |\n\nLaundry Boiler & fixtures, including water pump, & Hot Water Heater, approx. $3,500.00\n\nLathing metal lath & plastering, including labour, approx. $1,300.00\n\nPlumbing fixtures and pipes                            $4,500.00\n\nHardware                                               $125.00\n\nLighting fixtures and labour                           $1,000.00\n\nPaint                                                  $800.00\n\nWages for work to be performed                          $5,000.00\n\nTotal                                                   $29,639.02\nSEPTIC TANK AND TRENCH TO RIVER.\n\nThe septic tank is built according to the plan prepared by C. H. Attwood, Dist. Chief Engineer, Dom. Water Power & Reclamation Service, Winnipeg, for McIntosh Indian School, and is of exactly same dimensions, with the exception that instead of double 12 in. plank covers, specified for the latter, we have made a steel reinforced concrete cover 10 in. thick for the reason that owing to the depth we had enough earth covering to protect from frost.\n\nTwo 20 in. concrete man-holes, with one wooden cover below and cast iron frame and cover for the top, and proper vent pipe are also provided.\n\nThe sewer trench to the river has taken a different course and it reaches the river about 200 ft. south of the point indicated on profile submitted to Dept. The total length is 850 ft. It starts at the tank with a depth of 6' 4\" and continues with a grade of 6 in. per 100 ft. The deepest point is 9' 3\", where it crosses the grade of the public road.\n\nAlong the sewer pipe (6 in. vitrified tile) there is a 1\u00bd galv. pipe as far as the horse and cattle stables to supply same from new system. The trench is filled and levelled all along, with the addition of some banking over the last 200 ft.\n\nThe reason for digging a new trench and installing new drain is that the drain intended to be used was found to be only 5' 4\" below ground level at the school; consequently not deep enough to drain the laundry in the new building.\n\nTrenches across the old building and to the various fixtures in the old and new buildings had to be dug. In the old building it necessitated cutting of wooden and concrete floors.\n\nIn the whole course of digging, inside as well as outside, with the exception of about one foot of loam, hard pan and stones have been found all along; not a shovelful could be lifted without loosening the ground with the pick.\n\nERECTION OF NEW BUILDING.\n\nThe new building has been excavated to finish floor at the same level as the old one. A 10 in. concrete wall foundation on a 22 in. wide footing, 7' 6\" in all from foundation to 3\" above ground level, has been built for main building and passage. The passage is 16 ft. x 5 ft. (inside) and main building is 66 x 36 ft. (inside).\n\nThe original plan has been reduced by 4 ft. on the length and the location moved 9 ft. towards the south in order to eliminate the passage through the kitchen as shown on plan.\n\nThe frame on new building, including passage (excepting roof on the two story part), is erected, the inside sheeting is on and window and outside door frames are in place.\n\nThe flat roof is temporarily finished with 1 ply of roofing paper, as it is too cold to set the intended asphalt roof.\n\nThe carpenters have started working overtime at night on alterations in the basement of old building.\n\nConcrete foundations 12 in. above floor level are provided for all partitions in the new building.\n\n(Continued on page 3).\nNovember 29, 1929.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHONOURABLE CHARLES STEWART,\n\nIt has been found necessary to make improvements to the heating, water supply and sewage disposal and to provide a laundry building with modern equipment at the government-owned Pine Creek Indian Residential School, on Lake Winnipegosis. The original estimate was $25,600; but, when our Estimates for the current year were prepared, it was thought that less would be needed this fiscal year, and an item of $12,800 was included. The Oblate Order has undertaken the work, under the supervision of Brother Gauthier, who is one of their best mechanics. The repairs and improvements were found very urgent and have been undertaken in a businesslike manner. It is now necessary to give a little more assistance. Fortunately, the Appropriation for Indian Education can stand an additional charge of $5,000, and I propose, with your approval, to so inform the Oblate Order. I am informed that it would be very inconvenient to take the lay Brothers and others off the job at the present time. An item in next year's Main Estimates will provide funds for the completion of the work. The main building will then be thoroughly modern.\n\nDuncan C.

(RG 10, Volume 6270, file 582-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDecember 5, 1929.\n\nDear Father Magnan:\n\nOn the 20th instant, Father Brachet and Brother Gauthier forwarded reports on the improvements that are being made at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School. It appears that the authority of $12,800 is being greatly exceeded, and I am uncertain as to how the work will be financed. I have just had an interview with the Reverend Father Guy, and I understand that the programme should be completed if at all possible. Department officers inform me that there would be serious inconvenience if the rest of the improvement was postponed until next year and have assured me that the main building itself is worth the proposed expenditure.\n\nI have decided to allow an additional grant of $5,000 this year. This should be used to pay for materials. As in the past, certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded to Ottawa for payment. The expenditure for materials over and above the Department's grant and all labour costs should be paid by the Oblate Fathers. An effort will be made to secure an item in our Main Estimates so that reimbursement can be made next spring. Father Brachet is being informed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

You will note that all the Department can allow, this year, towards the improvements at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, is the sum of $17,800. The last accounts which you forwarded on the 24th and 26th ultimo make a total of approximately this amount. In addition, the Department has paid for the installation of a new boiler, which was specially authorized.\n\nNo further accounts should be forwarded for general improvements at Pine Creek, until after April first, next. Materials and labour should be paid for by the church authorities, and receipts and time sheets, in duplicate, kept. If Parliament allows the item, reimbursement can be made when the new appropriation is available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J.

I had to pay the amount of $246.09 for freight charges from Toronto to Winnipegosis for washers ordered by Bro. Gauthier for the new Laundry.\n\nImperial Oil Co. This item represents gasoline which was used for the operation of the Cement Mixer, also for the Gasoline Torch which the pipe-fitter keeps burning for the installation of new sewer pipes in the addition, also in the school.\n\nIn fact nearly two barrels have been used.\n\nAshdown.\n\nCement Mixer, $38.50. This Mixer was bought by Bro. Gauthier in order to make the new septic tank, to put in the foundations of the addition, its floor, also for the cement required for three steam boilers and two chimneys.\n\nShovels, Scrapers. These were bought for the canals we dug to obtain water from the lake, and the canal we dug as outlet to the river for the settling tanks. The scrapers were used to level the ground near the addition, also to grade over the inlet pipe in the muskeg near the lake. The shovels and picks are nearly worn out, so hard was the ground.\n\nBarbed wire. This was used to tie the forms together for the cement foundations of the addition.\n\nOxy-Acetylene Cutting Blow Pipe. This purchase was necessitated from the fact that the Water Heater had holes too small for adequate use, also that these holes were in the wrong place, and finally that we needed also to bore one of the steam boilers.\n\nBlack Iron. This is to make new and bigger steam pipes to the chimney. The other ones were worn out and too small.\n\nMarshall-Wells. Shovels and picks were bought for digging our canals.

The deepest point is 9' 3\", where it crosses the grade of the public road.\n\nAlong the sewer pipe (6 in. vitrified tile) there is a 1\u00bd galv. pipe as far as the horse and cattle stables to supply same from new system. The trench is filled and levelled all along, with the addition of some banking over the last 200 ft.\n\nThe reason for digging a new trench and installing new drain is that the drain intended to be used was found to be only 5' 4\" below ground level at the school; consequently not deep enough to drain the laundry in the new building.\n\nTrenches across the old building and to the various fixtures in the old and new buildings had to be dug. In the old building it necessitated cutting of wooden and concrete floors.\n\nIn the whole course of digging, inside as well as outside, with the exception of about one foot of loam, hard pan and stones have been found all along; not a shelfful could be lifted without loosening the ground with the pick.\n\nERECTION OF NEW BUILDING.\n\nThe new building has been excavated to finish floor at the same level as the old one. A 10 in. concrete wall foundation on a 22 in. wide footing, 7' 6\" in all from foundation to 5\" above ground level, has been built for main building and passage. The passage is 16 ft. x 5 ft., (inside) and main building is 65 x 36 ft., (inside).\n\nThe original plan has been reduced by 4 ft. on the length and the location moved 9 ft. towards the south in order to eliminate the passage through the kitchen as shown on plan.\n\nThe frame on new building, including passage (excepting roof on the two story part), is erected, the inside sheeting is on and window and outside door frames are in place.\n\nThe flat roof is temporarily finished with 1 ply of roofing paper, as it is too cold to set the intended asphalt roof.\n\nThe carpenters have started working overtime at night on alterations in the basement of old building.\n\nConcrete foundations 12 in. above floor level are provided for all partitions in the new building.\n\n(Continued on page 3).\nREPORT OF LABOUR ON IMPROVEMENTS at Pine Creek School\nsince week ending August 17th, 1929 up to date.\n\nDIGGING FOR WATER PIPE LINE (special 3 in. galv.)\nfrom new building to lake.\n\nTrench 3 ft. wide x 1975 ft. long, excavated to a depth of 10 ft. at the building and continue with a down grade of 2 in. per 100 ft., across the ridge, and through the marsh.\nThe latter is dug at an average of 4 ft.\n\nAt the bank of the lake there is built a concrete box 6'x4'x4' deep, with a 24 in. man-hole to provide road and access to two 3 in. gate valves and 3 in. check valve between the two gates. The top of man-hole has been kept 24 in. below top of bank and is covered with marsh loam level with the bank. Said concrete and man-hole are provided with double covers (with loam between).\n\nPast the concrete box there is a drop with 45\u00b0 angles to 5 ft. below actual water level.\n\nFrom lake shore to where the dredge dug (approx. 180 ft.), we have made a coffer-dam with clay and we have excavated said distance and laid the pipe on same level and filled over.\n\nThis concludes, for the present, the extent of laying the pipe. When the lake will be frozen sufficiently, we intend to build a wooden coffer-dam to cut the clay bank between trench and excavation by the dredge, and continue the digging, from the top of the ice, at the same level, as far as necessary to complete the work which was supposed to have been done by the dredge.\n\nLAYING OF PIPE AND FILLING OVER.\n\nThe water pipe is laid in a wooden box, made out of 2 in. stock, 4 x 4 in. inside, all the distance from machinery room to concrete man-hole at the lake shore, to protect the pipe from frost and chiefly to protect it from contact with clay, which contains a large percentage of alkali, considered by experts as injurious to even galv. pipe.\n\nPast the concrete box as far as the water, the pipe is coated with asphalt paint for the same reason.\n\nFrom machinery room and for a distance approx. 400 ft., where the trench is not more than 8' 6\" deep, the filling is clay only. From that point to the marsh and through the marsh to the concrete box, the pipe is covered with at least 1 ft. of marsh loam, then levelled with clay and finally banked over with marsh loam 2 ft. thick and 20 ft. wide all along.\n\nThe remaining part of the trench, from the concrete box to free water in the lake, is filled entirely with marsh loam.\n\nIn the whole course of the suction pipe from the pump to intake in the lake, sharp angles have been eliminated. Only four 45\u00b0 elbows have been used and three ball joints supplied to be installed, if necessary, in the course to be laid in the lake.\n\n(continued on page 2)\nTo installing & Bricking in new 36 x 14 Tubular Boiler\nand moving and rebricking old 36x14 Tubular Boiler,\nchanging flues & Heating connections on Boilers and\nGeneral repairs to Heating.\n\n| Item Description | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| 12 ft 3\" Pipe    |          |            |       |\n| 2. 3\" Coup Galv Recesn |      |            |       |\n| 5. 3\" Flange Unions |        |            |       |\n| 3. 4\" Nipples 5\" Blk |      |            |       |\n| 26. 3\" Asstd     |          |            |       |\n| 5. 3x2t Bushings  |          |            |       |\n| 2. 2x2t           |          |            |       |\n| 2. 1x2x1 T        |          |            |       |\n| 1. 1\" Plug        |          |            |       |\n| 1. 1x3 Bushing    |          |            |       |\n| 12. 1\" Nips       |          |            |       |\n| 2. 1\" Elia        |          |            |       |\n| 1. 1\" Brass Blow Off Valve | |            |       |\n| 12. 2+ Nips       |          |            |       |\n| 4. 2x2t T Blk     |          |            |       |\n| 6. 2x2x1x1 T      |          |            |       |\n| 2. 2\" Bls         |          |            |       |\n| 2. 2\" 45          |          |            |       |\n| 3 yds Packing C.R.S. | 29 lbs |            |       |\n| 2. 2x1x1 Bushing  |          |            |       |\n| 2. 2x2t           |          |            |       |\n| 1. 1x2x1          |          |            |       |\n| 2. 3\" Trane Flat Vents |      |            |       |\n| 2. 3\" Gate Valves Gen Jenkins | 2.37 |            |       |\n| 1. 3\" Nipple, Galv |          |            |       |\n| 2. 3\" Check Valve, Gen Jenkins | 2.47 |            |       |\n| 1. 4\" Wil Blk     |          |            |       |\n| 1. 4x3 Bushing    |          |            |       |\n| 1. 3\" Wil 45 Blk  |          |            |       |\n| 28/6 4\" Pipe      |          |            |       |\n| 7.

I am pleased to say that the new boiler has been set in, also that boiler No. 1 has been reset according to the instructions given by the Boiler Inspector. Yates, Neale & Co., of Brandon, Man., have seen to the purchase of the boiler, fittings and other material required, and to the setting of the boilers by experienced men.

I have forwarded to the Department a report signed by Bro. Gauthier, O.M.I., of the labour and improvements performed at the Pine Creek School since the week ending August 17th, 1929, up to the 20th of November, together with the estimates of the complete work, amounting to $29,639.02.\n\nIt has already been represented to the Department that the work is so linked together that it is impossible to do one part without the other. Again Rev. Fathers Guy and Plourde, O.M.I., have brought to the attention of the Department the fact that the work is very pressing for the river water which we are using up to now is unsanitary, the old washing machine is unsafe, as well as unsatisfactory, the water tanks in the attic are worn out with rust, the old acetylene generator cannot last any longer. Therefore it is very necessary that, as soon as possible, the addition be finished in which are to be installed the new water tanks, the electrical plant and the new washing machines. Of course it is understood that the estimates of about $30,000.00 are in the same time for the years 1929 and 1930.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. J. Bracken, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\n\nA. F.

Brother E. Gauthier. I note that the total Department's grant available this year for these improvements is $17,800.00, and that the Oblate Fathers are requested to provide for all expenditure over this amount, but with the understanding that the Department will try to secure an item for reimbursement next spring. I beg to say that this arrangement is satisfactory to us, the Banque Canadienne Nationale having accepted to advance the necessary credit.\n\nThe Building itself is surely worth the proposed expenditure. In fact, Pine Creek School is one of the best schools under my jurisdiction and is giving the best results.\n\nI wish to assure you that I greatly appreciate your efforts in this matter, and I feel indebted to you for having avoided the great inconvenience of postponing the work until next spring. I wish also to thank you most cordially for the splendid allowance you have made for Muscowequan School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nProvincial\n\nMr. Duncan C.

If there had been a fire extinguisher in the house, the fire would probably have been checked in time, whereas we had to content ourselves with the few we had in the school, and during that time the fire was out of control thus causing a loss of $1,500.00. The house was sold to the Department together with the school and other buildings, but since it had been greatly improved at our expense.\n\nConsidering that the Cross Lake School has burned the same day, and that we cannot have too much fire protection, I think it advisable to ask the Department to furnish us soon with\n\n14 FIRE EXTINGUISHERS,\n4 of which with unfreezable liquid.\n\n5 Fire Axes,\n12 Fire Pails.\n\nWe have 5 Success Fire Extinguishers and 3 Pyrene, but we should have 2 for each main corridor of the school, which makes 6; 2 for each of the stories of the addition which we are building, that is, 4; 1 for the men's quarters, 2 for the stables, 1 for the hen coop, 1 for the Butcher Shop, and 2 for the building which shall have to be erected for our hired man.\n\nI would like to have also\n\nREFILLS for our 5 Success Extinguishers,\nto wit: 10 lbs.

The house belonged to the Department since the sale of the school and dependent buildings, and with the betterments given it lately, its value was over $1,500.00.\n\nNow, as the Department must know, we are far away from communications and a good general man, such as we need here constantly, cannot accept to live away from civilization centres without having at least some compensating advantages, the main one of which is a good house.\n\nPresently we are fortunate enough in having a good man, who knows well engines, blacksmithing, general repairing and even acetylene welding, and who is heartily devoted to the interest of the school and pupils, whom he teaches in his trades, and if the Department does not give him a house, he cannot accept, on account of his family, to stay any longer in our midst.\n\nJust now we have able carpenters who, under the direction of Rev. Bro. Gauthier, O.M.I., could build a good and substantial house, when they are through with the improvements carried on at the school. As you are aware, a good house cannot be erected for less than $2,500.00.\n\nRev. Father J. Magan, O.M.I., Provincial, St. Boniface, Man., came to see us about this sad event, and he is earnestly in favour of this request; in fact he intends to see the officials of the Department about the matter.\n\nI wish, therefore, that the Department would have pity on us and grant the sum of at least $2,500.00 towards the erection of a simple, but comfortable house for our general man, Mr. O. Bourbonniere.\n\nI have, Sir, the honour to be\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. [Signature], O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6270, file 582-5, part 3)\nOttawa, March 31, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant and I note, with regret, that the employee's house at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School has been destroyed by fire. There are no funds available at the present time to make replacement of this building, and I do not know when an appropriation could be secured. The Department is hopeful that funds will soon be available for the completion of the improvements that are now in hand; but I regret I cannot authorize any additional expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I have already sent to the Department your accounts amounting to $2,637.59, and it is likely that you are about to receive a cheque for same.\n\nAs there is a credit balance in favour of the Department of $698.04, after you have deducted the amount of $38.05 for the three bills, I wish you have the kindness of sending back to the Department the sum of $698.04.\n\nI am herewith sending you a cheque of $10.44 for the electric sets, which amount concerns our school chapel.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

Hired Man's house.\n\nRev. Father J. Magnan, O.M.I., Provincial, St. Boniface, Man., writes me that at his visit at Ottawa, he has been assured that the sum of $3,000 would be included in the estimates for building a house for our hired man. I beg to say that we have presently working at the improvements of the school a very able and reliable carpenter, who has worked at the trade all his life after a thorough apprenticeship. He does quick and neat work. We do not know a better man in Manitoba or Saskatchewan. He is to go away as soon as the improvements of the school are finished.\n\nOwing to this fact and also to the fact that our main man wants to leave, if he is not given a house soon - it would be very hard to replace him - I would ask you to use your influence that I may obtain from the Department the authorization to start the building, after we are through with the other works.\n\nHoping to receive a prompt reply, I remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev. [Signature], O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe. No. 126-1-5.\n\nI beg to refer to the last part of your letter of November 15, 1928, in which you state that the Department is not prepared to favourably consider the supplying of a frigidaire, as this requires considerable electric power.\n\nOwing to the fact that we cannot have a frigidaire, I wish the Department would make the small expense of supplying us with a KITCHEN REFRIGERATOR. We experience considerable trouble at this time of the year in keeping food from one meal to the other. A medium size refrigerator would be of a great use for us all the year round.\n\nDuring summer we have a lot of visitors, who come and look with interest at all our work regarding the Indian wards. Some time it is proper that we serve a little dish to some visitor of mark; but owing to the lack of refrigerator, we cannot treat immediately our honourable visitors as we would wish to.\n\nI hope, therefore, you will consider favourably this request, and buy one refrigerator for us or authorize us to buy one.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev. J. Bracken O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 20, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, relative to the erection of a house at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School for the hired man. In this connection I have to inform you that it is regretted the item to provide the funds required for this purpose was disallowed in our Estimates, and we will, therefore, be unable to authorize the erection of this house this year. An item will, however, be noted for our Estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nI have also your letter of the same date relative to supplying a kitchen refrigerator. In this connection I have to say that the Department will provide an amount not exceeding the sum of $100 towards the cost of a medium sized refrigerator. After you have made the purchase of this equipment, you should forward an account, in duplicate, certified by yourself, in the usual manner covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

However, as these prices are below the union wages, which now are $1.40, and as these plasterers are union workmen, it would be advisable that these special prices are kept secret.\n\nIn the same time I beg to let the Department know that the number of workmen is to be greatly reduced from now on. Most of the time they will be only two Carpenters, but they have work for two or three months yet.\n\nWe do our best to put the school on a good standing, without any extravagance, and we feel very grateful towards the Department for their good will on our behalf.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev.

No. 126-1-5.\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 2nd inst. regarding the Laundry Stove, I beg to say that arrangements had been made last year verbally between the Indian Department and Rev. Father Guy, O.M.I., in the name of Rev. J. Magan, O.M.I., Provincial, St. Boniface, Man., to the effect that a complete Laundry Equipment would be set at the Pine Creek School, owing to the fact that we were very miserably equipped with only a worn out washer. Consequently Laundry Machines were bought by Rev. Bro. Gauthier, O.M.I., Supervisor of the works here, and the accounts were sent to the Department on November 24th, 1929, to the amount of $2,250.00. At the same time Rev. Bro. Gauthier had ordered from the same Company a Laundry Stove, but on account of different misunderstandings and inexplicable delays it came only lately.\n\nThis stove is indeed singularly high in price, likely from the fact that only a few of this make are sold. It is destined to heat the irons which the girls are to use for ironing. It is very unsatisfactory to have a tiny stove for such a purpose, as then there is no end to the work. With this stove we shall be able to finish the ironing quickly, for from 10 to 15 girls will be able to iron in the same time, as it contains up to 30 irons.\n\nOwing to all these facts, I am hereby returning for acceptance the duplicate bill of BEAVER SOAP & CHEMICALS, LTD. - WINNIPEG - MAN., amounting to $280.00, which I will be very thankful if you would have the kindness to pay to the Co.\n\nI will also be grateful if you can reimburse me the amount of $8.00, which I have paid for freight, to wit:\n\nFrom Winnipeg to Winnipegosis $5.96\nFrom Winnipegosis to Campbellville 2.18\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nRev.

I am herewith enclosing today the accounts which concern the main school buildings, to wit:\n\nFor plumbing $4,084.68\n\" heating system $775.74\n\nTotal $4,860.42\n\nWe had authorization to renew all the inside school sewerage. The work has been done very satisfactorily and lasting. Mr. Jas. E. Yates deserves commendation for honest, serious and adequate work, done always very intelligently.\n\nI would be thankful if the Department would immediately send to YATES, NEALE & CO., 231 Tenth St., BRANDON, MAN., a cheque of $4,860.42.\n\nOther items from the same Co. will follow soon.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

Sisters. Personally I cannot be too thankful towards the Department, and I will do my best, as ever, to co-operate steadily with all the officials of the Department for the welfare of our dear Indian pupils.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

These means were the high pressure watering system that the Department granted us last winter and the numerous extinguishers.\n\nIf now we have to deplore only the loss for the Church Authorities of the substantial building that belonged to them, we have to think for the future.\n\nIn consideration of the distance from all civilization and of the danger always imminent, I have taken the liberty of reordering REFILLS for all our extinguishers that were exhausted and of a certain number of canvas hose that proved too short.\n\nI have no idea of the approximate of price for same, but I expect that the Department would not blame the initiative taken by one who don't wish to see our work destroyed in a trice as well as the beautiful and well equipped school trusted to our care. Moreover I would appreciate to be authorized for this purchase.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev. J. Brackett\nPrincipal\n\nThe SECRETARY\nDepartment of INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOTTAWA\nOttawa, October 28, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant and, in reply, I beg to say that your action in ordering refills for the fire extinguishers and purchasing an additional quantity of canvas hose is approved. Payment of the above will be made on receipt of a certified account, in duplicate, which should be forwarded to the Department through the office of your local Indian Agent.\n\nI note, with great regret, the severe loss that the Church authorities have sustained in the destruction of your church by fire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. Brachet, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal, Pine Creek Indian Res. School,\nCamperville, Man.\nSaint-Boniface, Man. October 27th 1930\n\nMr Duncan C. Scott, D.Litt.\nDeputy Supt. General.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr Scott,\n\nThe sad occurrence that has happened lately at the Pine Creek Indian Res. School impels me to look for a greater safety of the Indian Res. Schools under our management. A vicious boy named Francis McKay, only 15 years old, has thrice attempted to set the School on fire and has confessed his crime. He was foiled in his criminal design by the vigilance of the watchman who had been appointed immediately after the burning of our church, the 27th of September. The fire was set, very likely, by the same boy.\n\nHe has been expelled from the School, but it occurs to me that a more adequate punishment would be in order. He could be apprehended by the police and sent, at least, to a correction school.\n\nI am pleased to inform you that the new improvements, especially the new water-works, have given a good service during the fire. It was an easy task to save the School. With the old system it might have been impossible.\n\nSo many accidents having taken place in different Indian Schools, it is no wonder that the principals and sisters are living in constant alarm, and I feel it is my duty to bring them relief as much as possible. It is a known fact that some Indian children will not hesitate to set a fire in the hope of going home. The best way to protect lives and buildings would be to have a watchman in every school. The new schools will all be fire-proof, but a watchman would give the old ones the protection they need. As the financial burden of our Indian Schools is already heavy, too heavy, I respectfully suggest that the Department of Indian Affairs grant a special allowance for this purpose.\n\nHoping you will receive favourably my request, I remain,\n\nYours devotedly,\n\n[Signature]\nProvincial.\nOttawa, Oct 30, 1923.\n\nMr. [signature]\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nNovember 3, 1930.\n\nDear Father Magnan:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the recent fire which destroyed the fine church at Pine Creek. I am very glad that the new water supply system gave the protection the school building needed. The Department will allow a grant of $40 a month for a night watchman at this school. It is understood that he must constantly patrol the building, from bedtime to rising bell. This grant will be payable to you, upon receipt of a voucher, say, twice yearly.\n\nWith reference to Francis McKay, the 15 year old boy who has been setting fires, I am writing to Mr. Indian Agent Waite, asking him to discuss the matter with the local detachment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. I dislike sending an Indian boy to a reformatory, but it appears that, in his case, some corrective measures are necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nVery Rev. J. Magnan, O.M.I.,\n340 Provencher Ave.,\nSt. Boniface,\nMan.\nOttawa, November 4, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Very Reverend Provincial of the Oblate Order, when writing to the Department regarding the recent loss by fire of the church at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, refers to one of the pupils in the following terms: \"A vicious boy, named Francis McKay, only 15 years old, has thrice attempted to set the School on fire and has confessed his crime. He was foiled in his criminal design by the vigilance of the watchman who had been appointed immediately after the burning of our church, the 27th of September. The fire was set, very likely, by the same boy. He has been expelled from the school, but it occurs to me that a more adequate punishment would be in order. He could be apprehended by the police and sent, at least, to a correction school.\"\n\nWill you please discuss this case with the local R. C. M. P. and, if you believe that the boy should be apprehended and placed on trial, you should so advise the officer commanding the local detachment. If the facts are as represented, I believe that a term in a reformatory would have a good effect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nS. J. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMAN.\nNovember 24th, 1930.\n\nReport Re Fire at Camperville, Manitoba.\n\nThe fire occurred at about 5:00 a.m. on September 29th, 1930, in the church building owned by Les Reverends Peres Oblats.\n\nThe building was 150' x 50' and was built of stone and roof of sheet metal, being heated from central heating plant outside the building, and lighted by electricity.\n\nThe building and contents are insured as follows:-\nPolicy No. 621028, in the Ocean, $4,000 on building, and Policy No. 458173, the Royal Insurance Company, $8,000 and $2,000 on contents, total insurance on building and contents of $14,000.\n\nThe contents were valued at about $7,000 and are a total loss, the building being valued at $28,000 with a loss of $21,205. The total loss sustained by this fire being in the vicinity of $28,000.\n\nOn making inquiries in regard to the fire it was learned that O. Bourbennier who is the engineer on the property was awakened by his wife who informed him that there was a light in the church. Bourbennier's residence being about one hundred yards distance. On looking out of his house he observed it was a fire and he ran to the school building and sent in the fire alarm in the school and then rang the church bell.\n\nOn entering the church he could see no fire but the church was full of smoke.\n\nOn being advised of the fire Sister St. John, who was residing in the school building, rushed into the church with two fire extinguishers, entering by the side door into the vestry room at the back of the altar. On arriving there she found the cupboard holding the vestments on fire and a fire burning on the south side of the cupboard. There was also a flame on the floor. She operated the extinguisher and extinguished all the fire at the bottom of the cupboard. The top of the cupboard was about a foot from the ceiling and it was still burning. She could see no fire on the inside of the church with the exception of this fire in the cupboard.\n\nThe Rev. C. Comeau, Assistant Principal, was sleeping in the school building on the morning of the fire and was awakened by the alarm. He rushed over to the church and observed a fire behind the altar. He immediately gave orders and superintended the operation of the fire extinguishing apparatus and an endeavor was made to check the fire, but it appears that one of the couplings on the hose was defective and it was pulled apart and by the time\nthe men got the hose repaired and in working order the fire was beyond control.\n\nIt might be said that the Mission at Camperville consists of a large three story stone school building, containing a large number of pupils all being Indian children, a number of farm buildings and the church destroyed, and being under the charge of the Rev. M. O. Bretagne, C.M.I., Vice Principal. The Rev. Father Bretagne was absent in Winnipeg at the time of the fire.\n\nThis fire was investigated by Inspector Fuller, Resident Inspector of the Fire Commissioner's Branch at Dauphin and no cause could be found for the fire and there was a suspicion that the fire was not of accidental origin and inquiries were being continued.\n\nOn the 15th of November Inspector Fuller received a communication from the Rev. Father Bretagne, dated the 11th of November, requesting him to come to Camperville as there had been a new object of fire which might have some connection with the church fire.\n\nOn receipt of this communication, the writer accompanied Inspector Fuller to Camperville on Thursday the 20th of November and commenced an investigation.\n\nOn our arrival Father Bretagne informed us that a fire had been discovered in the furnace room of the school on the evening of Monday the 10th November and that on smelling smoke he had made a search for the fire and found it in the furnace room burning on partition between two studs. He extinguished this fire with a fire extinguisher.\n\nOn making an inspection of this fire it was found that the fire had its origin between the cordwood pile and the partition and had travelled up towards the studs and from the nature of the burning it would appear that it had got a good start before being discovered and that it was only through the prompt action of Father Bretagne that the building was saved from destruction.\n\nThe fire, it might be stated, was discovered just about 6.00 p.m. as the pupils were commencing supper.\n\nFrom the conditions existing and the time the fire occurred we had a suspicion that this fire had been caused by someone in the building, and on the following day ten of the pupils were questioned by the writer, no one being present in the room but the pupil under interrogation.\n\nAt about 3.30 in the afternoon the writer was able to obtain from Roger Napakisit or Flatfoot, an Indian boy, fifteen years of age, a confession that he was responsible for the fire. The boy states that he had been painting part of the building that day with a number of other boys and when the bell rang at a quarter to six...\nthey all proceeded to the wash room and discarded their overalls and washed their hands. This boy states that after he washed his hands he left the building by the side door in the wash room and ran around the building and on his way he picked up some small pieces of wood, carried them in his hands and went to the furnace room. He found the furnace room door open and he entered and placed the wood that he had picked up in about the center of the cord wood pile against the partition. He then opened the door of the furnace and took a thin piece of wood and lit it by the flame and placed it in the chips which he had placed in the cord wood pile against the partition. It started to burn and he ran away leaving the door of the furnace open.\n\nHe then entered through the door leading from the recreation room and entered the recreation room. There were no boys there when he entered this room and he then ran along the corridor to the refactory where dinner was being served and was the last boy in the refactory for dinner. He states he set this fire because he did not like the school and wanted out to work.\n\nFather Bretagne also informed the inspectors that about three weeks ago a fire had been discovered in the closet of the school building and on making inquiries they suspected a boy named Francis McCoy, an Indian boy aged about fifteen.\n\nOn being closely questioned by the Rev. Fathers the boy at first denied all knowledge of the fires but on the Fathers making a promise to him that he would not be punished but that he would be dismissed from the school, the boy admitted setting three separate fires in the building, two being under the stairways and one in the closet. However, on the position of these fires being pointed out to the inspector it was found that they had done no damage and had apparently died out of their own accord.\n\nIn a statement to Father Bretagne, the boy told him that the first fire he had set in the school was two days after the fire in the church.\n\nIn view of the promise made to the boy, the Fathers feel that it was their duty to keep this promise and the boy was sent home to his Father at Duck Bay. However, before leaving for Duck Bay, Constable Bayfield of the Provincial Police happened to be at the Mission and was informed of what had occurred and the Constable then took McCoy before all the pupils and gave them a warning against setting fires in the school.\n\nAfter a confession was obtained from Roger Napakisit Inspector Fuller and the writer accompanied by Father Comeau proceeded to Duck Bay in order to have an interview with Francis McCoy, who had been responsible for the three previous fires in the school, and it might be said at this time he had denied all knowledge of the fires in the church to the Fathers. However, feeling that this boy might be responsible for the fire in the church it was thought\nnecessary to have an interview with him.\n\nOn arriving at Duck Bay, the boy was closely questioned by the writer in the presence of Inspector Fuller when he finally admitted setting the fires in the church.\n\nHe stated that he found the matches in a box in the cupboard behind the altar in the school chapel and that he started a fire in the dust box which was lying in the cupboard where the boy's cassocks were kept and some of the priests' vestments and that when he dropped the match into this box he closed the door of the cupboard. On being questioned as to why he had set fire to the church he said that he was lonely and that he did not want to go to school but wanted out to work and that he thought if there was a big fire in the church that it would catch on to the school and burn the school.\n\nAs regards the two boys who are responsible for these fires, it might be said that they are both about the same mentality and the impression gained by the writer is that they are not bright boys and that they are the big boys of the school and feel it having to associate with the smaller boys and would rather be out working.\n\nIt is difficult to determine just what punishment should be meted out to these boys responsible for the fires, and on discussing the matter with Rev. Father Bretagne, the conclusion arrived at was that no good purpose could be gained by laying a charge of arson against them, and having them brought before the courts and probably sentenced to a term in a detention home. The boys, in this event, would be out of their natural element and a continual watch would have to be kept over them as there is a probability they would make an attempt to destroy their place of detention.\n\nIn view of these conditions I would, therefore, recommend that the matter be left in the hands of the church authorities to deal with the boys as they may see fit. Father Bretagne assures me that these two boys will not be allowed to return to the school.\n\nIt might be stated that the school building is the property of the Dominion Government, and under the charge of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nInvestigator.\nDecember 1st, 1930.\n\nSuperintendent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRe Fires in Camperville Church and Mission School, Camperville, Man.\n\nPlease find enclosed copy of letter and report sent to Ottawa in connection with the above fires.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Fire Commissioner.\nDecember 1st, 1930.\n\nMr. J.

The matter was investigated at the time by Insp. J.L. Fuller of the Manitoba Fire Commissioner's Department and it was found that the origin was incendiary. Investigation revealed the fact that one, Francis McKay, an Indian boy, aged 14 years, an inmate of the Pine Creek Reserve Indian Residential School, which adjoins the church, had deliberately set the fire for the express purpose of being expelled from the school. He made a written confession to Insp. Fuller. No action was taken by the authorities at this time.\n\nRegarding this matter I recently received a letter from Mr. J. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Man., enclosing a letter addressed to him from the Dept. of Indian Affairs relative to the advisability of prosecuting Francis McKay and having him committed to a reformatory. Apparently the Catholic Church authorities wished this action taken.\n\nIn order to acquaint myself with the facts I endeavoured to gain the privilege of looking over Mr. Fuller's file in conjunction with the Manitoba Provincial Police who were interested in the matter, but in due course was advised by Sergt. G.A. Renton of the Manitoba Provincial Police, Dauphin, Man., that the matter was in the hands of the Attorney General who was in communication with Ottawa respecting the prosecution of Francis McKay under the Juvenile Offenders Act. Mr. Waite was so advised.\n\nNothing further has been heard of the matter up to this time, but presume the prosecution will be proceeded with in due course.\n\nThe Church in question is the property of the Oblate Fathers of Mary Immaculate and stood on property belonging to the Church on the outskirts of the scattered village of Camperville.\n\nFurther report to follow.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nSergt. #4608.\n\n(H.U.

L. Fuller, Inspector of the Manitoba Bureau of Labor & Prevention Branch, of Dauphin, Man., in his visit to the school on August 11th, 1930, recommended some guards to be put in different places around belts and machines for safety's sake. We have done this work, for which he was very pleased, and which amounted to $45.70, thus:\n\n- 12 bars Band Iron Ga. 10\" 16 ft. $13.72\n- 12 yds. 3x3 Sand Screen 1.04 $12.48\n- 200 Rd. H.

Valdura Paint, Black .90\n- Freight 2.\n- 4 days of Labour at $4.00 $16.\n\n$45.70\n\nNow Mr. Fuller came again on March 17th last and on a close inspection found some more guards necessary for protection against accidents in the drying room, the laundry room and the bakery and in a letter dated the 2nd inst., has enjoined, he required that the work should be done. We reckon that the improvements recommended would necessitate the following expenses:\n\n- 23 bars Band Iron Ga. 10\", 16 ft. $27.36\n- 24 yds. 3x3 Sand Screen 1.04 $24.96\n- 400 Rd. H.

Valdura Paint, Black .90\n- Freight of material 4.\n- 6 days of Labour at $4.00 $24.\n\n$82.42\n\nConsidering that we have done the first work at our expense, we would ask the Department to be kind enough to help us to do this second work, so that perfect safety may be had with all the machines used at the school.\n\nHoping to receive very soon the authorization,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nO.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 28, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, regarding the installing of safety appliances as a protection against accidents in the laundry and bakery at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School and giving an estimate of the cost. In reply I have to say that our funds this year are extremely limited and it is regretted that it will not be possible to provide the cost of carrying out the improvements recommended by the Inspector of the Manitoba Bureau of Labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. Brachet, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nPine Creek Res. School,\nCamperville, Man.\nThe classroom work is carried on in two classrooms under the supervision of Sister Pierre Celestin, who has charge of the children in Grade I & II, and Sister Marie des Anges, who has charge of Grades III, IV, V & VI.\n\nThe junior room has an enrolment of 39, and the senior room 49. The classrooms were well aired, tidy, and clean. Neither of the Sisters have Normal training, but the senior teacher has taught for some years.\n\nThe children were all well clothed, very clean, and exceptionally tidy. I was delighted with their appearance. They were bright and cheerful, and replied freely when questioned.\n\nThe school throughout was in excellent condition, and scarcely a particle of dust could be found. The dormitories were well aired, and the bedding was clean. Each child is supplied with a toothbrush, glass, and towel, all of which are undoubtedly used. A number of the beds have no springs, and the mattresses are placed on boards. Springs should be provided.\n\nThe laundry\nThe laundry is in the new wing of the school, and is one of the best equipped I have visited. The laundry work seen had all been well done, and the girls are receiving an excellent training in this work.\n\nThe kitchen was tidy and, as usual, I found it a busy place. The range has burned out on one side, and I would judge is past repairing. At present only one oven can be used, consequently the Sister is greatly handicapped in her work. This is a heavy department, and I believe a larger range would make the work less difficult. The present range has only one fire box, and with about 100 to cook for, the stove is continually loaded down, and it is a difficult matter to properly serve the meals.\n\nThe sewing room is well equipped, and the children learn to do all kinds of plain sewing, mending and darning. The work seen in this department was all well done, and the training should be of wonderful value to the girls.\n\nThe fire equipment is in excellent condition. Extinguishers are placed in prominent places throughout the building, and axes and pails are hung at various places. Fire drill was observed during my visit, and I believe is carried out regularly as the children appeared to know what was expected of them. The water pressure is good, and is well looked after by a good mechanic. A night watchman is kept, and a punch clock is used with stations throughout the building.\n\nThe children were all fat, and in good physical condition. They receive porridge, bread, lard and tea for breakfast. Potatoes are also served at times. Dinner consists of\nPINE CREEK INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nconsists of potatoes, carrots or turnips, meat or fish, bread, and rice or tapioca pudding. At supper time they again receive potatoes, or a stew made from meat and potatoes, all the bread they want, and milk or tea. Butter or lard is also served.\n\nA large stock of cattle are kept, and six cows had already freshened. The cattle are well cared for, and plenty of feed remained. A trench silo is in use, and a quantity of ensilage remained. A number of brood sows are kept, but the younger pigs had been butchered. Chickens are also kept, and were receiving excellent care, with the result that plenty of eggs were being obtained.\n\nThe Rev. Father Brachet was absent during my visit, so I did not meet him. I was delighted with the condition of the school and the management, and I believe it is one of the best I have visited. The school was spotless, the children were healthy and fat, and I believe excellent work is being accomplished.\nRegina, Sask., April 28, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the various schools in the Portage la Prairie and Manitowapah Agencies. This report was made by Mr. Inspector Hamilton, who was occupied from the 25th February to the 11th April in making an inspection of these two agencies.\n\nThe Pine Creek Residential School is giving splendid satisfaction, and the children are well cared for.\n\nOn the whole I would say that the report on these schools is very satisfactory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, May 5, 1931.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nIn March, 1930, you supplied six Thermene fire extinguishers for the use of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School. It will now be necessary to have these extinguishers recharged, and I have to request that you will arrange to forward, charges prepaid, addressed to Rev. J.

However, among the estimates for repair which we placed in your hands last fall, there is an item, which we consider as very important, that is the painting of the buildings situated close to the residential school, to wit: the ice house, hen house and shop. The exterior appearance of these buildings is really poor and is a shameful contrast to the look of the school itself. We had asked for a grant of $191.32 for the painting of these buildings. However, we are ready to do the work at our own expense, rather than to let the buildings deteriorate too much, provided the Department would supply the paint. I think that we could do only with the sum of $100.00. We would try to do a good job with this amount only.\n\nHoping to receive an immediate reply, I remain,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have been thus cut off from communications, which at times were speedily necessary. Now I have a letter dated the 25th ult. from H. Coddington, General Commercial Superintendent, Manitoba Telephone System, which states that, in answer to my past requests, the Manitoba Telephone System is ready to have a long distance Telephone Line terminate at the Pine Creek Residential School with the installation of a telephone, with only a rental charge of $20.00 per annum for telephone service.\n\nI am sure the Department will be glad to assure this necessity to the institution in accepting to sustain this charge, for I know that in some instances the Department has been heavier expenditures, as in the case of the McIntosh School, where the Department has established the line itself, although the school was not far from the Station.\n\nI would appreciate an early answer so that Mr. Coddington may have soon the directions which he wanted at an early date.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\nOttawa, July 22, 1931.\n\nRev.

An addition to the school was built for the electrical apparatus, the water system and the laundry. As no radiators had been set and it was becoming cold in the addition, cement work having been done recently and hot being dried up yet, Rev. Bro. Gauthier ordered from you Camp stove. The accounts should have been then forwarded to me to certify them in the usual manner and forward them to the Department. They would have been paid as the other accounts which were then forwarded. However, I am confident that with this information you may still obtain payment from the Department, for it seems that it is no fault of yours or of mine that the accounts were delayed.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nO.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nMarch 4, 1932.\n\nMr. Taget,\nChief Accountant,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe are enclosing copies of two invoices outstanding in the account of the Department of Indian Affairs. They are as follows:\n\nAugust 30, 1929 $38.00\nNovember 22 \" 28.93.\n\nWe have experienced a great deal of trouble with these two charges. Our records show that copies of these invoices were forwarded to the Department of Indian Affairs at Winnipeg many times, with request for payment. As the matter grew quite old and we heard nothing, the writer visited Mr. Bunn at his office last August and was instructed to send copies of invoices to the Schools for which the goods were purchased. This we did, and received the one back from the Indian School, Winnipegosis almost immediately. However, it was not until February that we were able to get any satisfactory statement from Mr. Bunn, and this was through your letter to him of February 11.\n\nFor your information, we enclose a copy of a letter received from Reverend J. Brachet, O.M.I., Winnipegosis, which is dated February 27. A letter with this information was sent to Mr. Bunn last year, but he did not send same along to you.\n\nYou will notice in the last paragraph of the Reverend's letter, he states that we should forward invoices to him for certification. We do this where the invoices are charged direct to the school, but in this case goods were charged to the Department of Indian Affairs, and we received instructions from Mr. Bunn to forward invoices to him first for distribution. Whether or no the invoices should be charged to the Department is another matter entirely, we being under the impression that the Principals of the\nOttawa, March 7th, 1932.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to your invoices of August 30th, 1929 - $38.00; and November 22nd, 1929 - $28.93. Mr. Inspector Bunn has recently written the Department in regard to the latter account and he has been informed that this account should be paid by the school management.\n\nThe account of $38.00 for paint supplied to the Cross Lake School in August, 1929, is being forwarded to the Principal and, when his reply is received, you will be further advised.\n\nI may add that, when a Principal of a residential school places an order with you, the account covering the cost of the supplies should be forwarded, in duplicate, to him.

As this is the time of Easter festivities I take the opportunity to express my case. We have here in the house some old beds without any springs but having boards instead, then very old mattresses and pillows. These have been in the house since the Oblate Fathers bought them when they first opened the house. Do you not think the Department would give us say 10 or 6 ft. beds and furnishings and besides another 3 or 4 ft. mattresses and pillows and white spreads for 6 ft. beds also? I know the year is hard but I am sure if you saw how our situation you would give them to us at once.\n\nWe have children now who like to be clean and who have learnt how to take care of things.

We have just found good sewing machines of which one is a tailor's that is for heavy sewing; the others are worth almost nothing and will last very little. You are interested in the work of the children and you quite realize the amount of sewing which is done here yearly would it not be the right time then to ask you the favor of having another couple good sewing machines. Mr. Murray I think could tell you himself that we took good care of our machines only so he says some have been better kept. We would greatly appreciate the favor of having this help.\n\nRemaining confident in a favorable reply from you I thank you in anticipation.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSister Superior\n\n321-39\nSir,-\n\nI beg to enclose letter received from the Sister Superior, of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, asking that the school be supplied with two new sewing machines.

Waite\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 23, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, enclosing a communication which you received from the Sister Superior of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School requesting that two sewing machines be supplied. It is noted from the Rev. Sister's letter that they have four good machines on hand, one of which is a tailoring machine.\n\nI may say that in August, 1929, the Department supplied two Singer machines and again in April, 1931, two machines were supplied. These machines were of the ordinary household type. You should ascertain from the Rev. Sister if these four machines are still in good condition and also when the tailor's machine was supplied, and inform the Department. Our funds this year are extremely limited and, unless it is absolutely necessary that the two machines asked for be supplied, the Department would not be prepared to incur the expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nPine Creek Indian Res. School,\nCamperville, Man.\nAugust 1st 1932.\n\nMr. J. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\n\nDear Mr. Waite,\n\nYour letter of the 25th has just arrived. I thank you most sincerely for the same. The machines furnished by the Department in 1929 and 1931 are still good. These are the machines we use from morning till night year in year out. Reverend Father Breault wished the children to make all their clothes as much as possible so the girls will learn and I am with him for that but there is just where the machines are not sufficient. You can imagine the amount of sewing we have in keeping the house and clothes for the number of children we always have.\n\nIf we could have another couple machines it would give work to two other girls so we could get the work done. When the children come back we will have sheets and pillow cases for the two dormitories, blouses for all the boys, overalls and pants then for the girls underwear, dresses, aprons, nightgowns, etc., etc. We are\nwondering how we will get it all done. Do you not think then that two more machines would be welcomed?\n\nHoping you will be able to favor us I thank you in anticipation and remain,\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

When I went to see Mr. Thos. Marr at Minnitonas, before engaging his services at the school, I asked him which wages he would consent to work for, and he said: 75 cents per hour, as he had been assured by Geo. Renef, his member, that such was the rate of pay accepted by the Indian Department. I stated that I could not consent to give these high wages in the present crisis, but that I would willingly make the vouchers for 50 cents per hour.\n\nMr. Marr has given regularly a big sum of work, either personally or in the conduct of the school pupils, whom he had to assist him constantly, and I would consider it quite unfair, after I had deducted already 33% from his wages that he should lose again 10%.\n\nI trust, therefore, that, owing to this explanation, you will kindly see that the Department sends to Mr. Thos. Marr, of Minnitonas, Man., the sum of $35.05, which is due to him in justice.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Sgd.) J. Brachet, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\n\nA. F.

It now appears from the attached Letter from the Reverend Principal of the Pine Creek School that the rate charged by Mr. Marr was considerably below the regular rate and, therefore, 10% should not have been deducted.

D. Sutherland,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nEducation Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland;\n\nI am enclosing three estimates received yesterday from Father J. Brachet, Principal of the Pine Creek School. These estimates cover all materials necessary for the construction of the house for the school engineer and all-around man.\n\nYou will remember no doubt that the dwelling formerly occupied as a residence by the engineer was destroyed by fire some two years ago and never rebuilt. Father Brachet is willing to furnish all labor in connection with the erection of this residence provided the Department will supply all the materials needed.\n\nHe has secured estimates from the following firms: 1. Herman Hardware Company, $1702., 2. R. T. White General Hardware, $1472., 3. Geo. W. Russeholt General Hardware, $1361.60. These firms were each supplied with the same list of specifications so that all had an equal chance.\n\nIt is understood that Father Brachet will supply at his own expense all the labor necessary in connection with this building.\nOttawa, March 27, 1933.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant addressed to Mr. Sutherland, of this Department, enclosing quotations covering the cost of materials required in the construction of a residence for the engineer and all-round man at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, and requesting that payment be made for materials as per the quotation of Geo. W. Russenholt to the amount of $1361.60.\n\nIn reply I regret to inform you that the Department has no funds available in the Appropriation for the current fiscal year for this purpose. As our Appropriation for the coming fiscal year has been further reduced, there will be no funds next year to provide the expenditure required in supplying materials for the erection of the house. The quotations which you forwarded are returned herewith. If it is urgent that the house be erected, the school authorities will have to provide the cost from their own funds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. O.

I was in hopes when I wrote the above that a sum sufficient to buy all materials needed for the erection of such a house would be taken out of the 1932 Vote. Unfortunately, you were unable to do that.\n\nThe need for an employees' house is as great now, if not greater, and Father Brachet, the Principal of the school, is willing to contribute all labour for the erection of this house provided the Department will supply all materials.\n\nThe tenders from the following firms are still available:\n\n(1) Herman Hardware Company - $1,702.00\n(2) R. T. White General Hardware - $1,472.00\n(3) Geo. W. Russenholt General Hardware - $1,361.60\n\nThe above firms were supplied with the same list of specifications and all had an equal chance. The lowest price, therefore, should be acceptable.\n\nFather Brachet could start erecting this house immediately and provide considerable relief for unemployed Indians on the reserve.\n\nHoping that you will give this matter your immediate attention, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have not been able to obtain from the Department any help for this expenditure, although we have asked for it year after year, and our general man & engineer is to leave us this spring.\n\nSince the 25th of February, 1930, date at which the engineer's house was destroyed by a chimney fire, our engineer has been living with his father-in-law. The house has cost $200.00; it consists of one main room with a loft and is warm. Our engineer, as he has to go away, would sell this house for the sum of $120.00 only. I would respectfully urge that you would kindly ask the Department to buy this house for the price mentioned, and if the Department could add the sum of $500.00 during the year for a necessary addition and improvements, the question of a house for our engineer would be solved.\n\nOur engineer would like to have the sum of $130.00 as soon as possible in order to make payments for the new site he is to acquire in a town away from here. As you know, his name is Orig\u00e8ne Bourbonni\u00e8re.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nO.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, February 16, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nFor some time past, the church authorities have been urging on the Department the necessity for providing a house for the engineer at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School. The engineer's house was destroyed by fire on February 25, 1930.\n\nThe Rev. Principal states that he can purchase a house for approximately $130 and have same moved to the school. With additional repairs, he states that the house could be made very suitable for a residence for the engineer of the school. The total cost of purchasing the house and the repairs required are estimated at $750.\n\nFunds are available for this purpose in the current year's Appropriation. It is presumed that you are aware of the necessity for this building, but, before giving definite authority to proceed, the Department would appreciate having an immediate reply, as any work done will have to be authorized in the immediate future, in order that the accounts may reach the Department before the end of March.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

MEDD, following his visit to PINE CREEK RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, report dated February 12, 1934.\n\nI would suggest that I believe there should be better light in the dormitories. The windows give some light but they are small and of such a construction that the beneficial rays of the sun do not reach the sleeping room as I believe they should. One other factor of health has come to my notice and I would suggest that as the Indian child has the obstacle of tuberculosis to fight and no matter how well we may check these cases coming into our schools, we will have the cases that will not do so well and for these cases a sun balcony or solarium is one way .. that might help such cases. These items are of some expense but as conditions improve I believe and monies become easier to get that some consideration could be given to the ... correction of the dormitories and in providing a small solarium for the children, especially the ones that show poor health progress at school. At present we have no sun room. I humbly submit these suggestions, hoping as circumstances improve that we will have your further consideration in respect to any correction you may deem necessary.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\nFebruary 27th, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nRe: 126-1-5, Ottawa, February 19th, 1934.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of the above noted letter, in reference to the repairs for the Pine Creek Indian Residential School in an amount of $275.

The house was originally built by Mr. J.N.O. Bourbonniere for his father and mother-in-law at his expense. The school authorities have taken possession of said house and built an addition and doing all necessary repairs, the labour of same is being done by the school employee's.\n\nThe Rev. Principal mentions his letter dated March 23rd which was attached to voucher No D565 in which he advises that they had purchased lumber nails and fixtures amounting to approximately $100.00 and would be pleased if the Department would kindly accept this account as they were bought for repairing the house. The Rev. Principal considers this request very reasonable, owing to the fact that all labour was done at the expense of the school, and that two years ago the school built a house for the farmer at their expense at a cost of $660.00.

J. Crowe - Winnipegosis - $49.80.\n\nOn account of impassable roads between Winnipegosis and Camperville we have been delayed quite a time for the delivery and use of these materials. The house is now thoroughly completed outside and inside, and shall be a credit to the Department. All the labour has been done at the expense of the school. Besides a good house that we have erected last year for our farmer entirely at our expense, this year we have made, also entirely at our expense, a cement cistern for rain water, with a capacity of 3,500 gallons.\n\nMy first vouchers amounted to $500.00, and counting the sum of $120.00 paid to J.N.O. Bourbonni\u00e8re by the Department, the amount of $750.00 is not exceeded with the enclosed vouchers.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nO.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\n\nJ. Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la P., Man.\nOffice of the MANITOWAPAH Indian Agency,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nJuly 24th 1934\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 149, amounting to $68.69 in favour of The J.H. Ashdown Hardware Co., Limited, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nHardware Paint etc., supplied the Pine Creek Indian Residential School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 125-7-5 dated February 16th, 1934.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Automatic Plant Batteries.\n\nOur Lister Automatic Electric Plant has worked very satisfactorily since March, 1930. I had thought of waiting to put on the Estimates 1934-1935 the item of the renewal of our Batteries. But after keeping up for the last 4\u00bd years, they are failing and giving away, and I am obliged to ask for the help of the Department sooner than I expected.\n\nThe Exide Batteries of Canada Ltd., Winnipeg, charged the sum of $256.85 for putting the Batteries in order when they were bought by the Department from the Seminary of Lebret. It would be rather hard for a Company to tell exactly beforehand the total cost of renewing batteries, without seeing them. I believe, however, that the cost should be likely similar. To avoid any fear of high cost to the Department, I would be willing to pay any expenditure in excess of $250.00; I would also take care of all the transportation charges.\n\nThe time of vacation, the summer, is the propitious period when batteries are needed at their minimum, and when they can be most easily replaced. Later it is very hard to do without them. I hope, therefore, that you would kindly obtain for us the necessary authorization to proceed with the renewal of our batteries immediately.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nO.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, August 1st, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nEnclosed is copy of a letter received from the Rev. Principal of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, with reference to the electric plant. You will note, from this letter, that he considers the batteries should be recharged.\n\nAs it is likely that you have visited this school recently, I would appreciate your advising me at once whether or not you consider it absolutely necessary to have these batteries given attention this year. As you are aware, our funds are quite limited.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nOttawa, August 1st, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th instant, I beg to say that you should have directed the attention of Mr. Agent Waite to the condition of the batteries at the Pine Creek Residential School. I am writing to him for a report, and, on receipt of his reply, a decision will be made. I may say that there are so many demands on our Appropriation this year, that it is doubtful if we can find the funds necessary for repairing the batteries. However, the matter will be given further consideration when Mr. Waite's report is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J.

Our attention was not drawn to the condition of the batteries which appeared to functioning alright.\n\nThe Reverend Principal is well aware that funds are extremely limited again this year and I would judge that the batteries have run down during the course of the past few weeks.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAugust 14, 1934.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nIn March, 1930, a Lister automatic electric plant was transferred from the Qu'Appelle Residential School to the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, Camperville, Man., (Electoral District of Nelson), and, at that time, the batteries were put in good order by the Exide Batteries of Canada, Limited, Winnipeg.\n\nThe Principal of the Pine Creek Residential School now advises that the batteries require renewing, which would involve an expenditure not exceeding $250. He requests permission to have the necessary work done by the Exide Batteries of Canada, Limited, Winnipeg, which, you will note, is the same firm that was previously employed.\n\nPlease let me know if it will be in order to give the business to the firm mentioned.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nBANK RECEIPT No. 950\n\nAmt. $49.60\n\nDate.

It has not been the general policy to supply trucks to residential schools, except in one or two cases.

It is extremely difficult to find funds for expenditures of this nature. However, it has been decided to reimburse the Principal to the extent of $408.81, in payment of accounts as follows:\n\nJoseph Wery & Sons - $134.60\nWestern Paint Co., Limited - 101.56\nT. Eaton Company, Limited - 167.65\n\nThere were no receipts for freight charges on the account of Joseph Wery & Sons, to the amount of $8.02, and on the account of the Western Paint Company, to the amount of $2.60, and reimbursement is not being made for these amounts.\n\nOn the account of the T. Eaton Company, reimbursement is not being made covering the cost of blankets, ticking, covering for comforters and mattresses or for the bedroom furnishings, as this equipment is considered to be replacements and should be paid for by the school authorities, from their per capita allowance or other receipts.

Apparently these vents were never installed and as a consequence the closets often overflow causing considerable damage to the ceilings and walls below.\n\nReverend Father Brachet has secured estimates for the above repairs from Yates, Neale & Co. of Brandon of $74. and $147.00 respectively.\n\nThe Gas Engine used up to the present for the dough mixer and churn is completely worn out and he requests permission to purchase a new one. The price submitted for this engine is $80.00\n\nPlease let me know if you will authorize these repairs and the purchase of this engine.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJOP-LR\n\nIndian Affairs.

O. Plourde, O.M.I., Winnipeg, that the hot water tank be repaired; that a new gasoline engine be supplied, to operate the dough mixer and churn, to replace the present engine, which is worn out, and also that vents be installed in the roof, at each end of the school, to ventilate the water closets in both the boys' and girls' departments. It is stated that the Principal secured an estimate of the cost of repairs to the hot water tank, amounting to $74.00, and for the supplying of the gas engine, $80.00.\n\nThe Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of a gas engine, of the type that would be satisfactory to operate the dough mixer and churn. The cost should not exceed the estimate submitted by the Principal, viz.: $80. You should arrange, also, to have the necessary repairs made to the hot water tank. The cost of this work should not exceed the estimate submitted by the Principal, viz.: $74.\n\nPlease obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the above authorized repairs and purchase. These accounts, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. I would request that you take up the matter with the Principal, ascertain what he requires and have the repairs made to the tank and the engine supplied, at an early date.\n\nThe Department will have no funds to install vents in the roof in order to ventilate the toilets of the school.

McGill,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter the Minister has received from the Rev. J. Brachet, of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School. Will you please suggest to the Minister what reply might be sent to this letter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.M. Jackson,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nEnclosure (1)\nPine Creek Indian Residential School,\nCamperville, P.O., Man.,\n\nJanuary 25th, 1936.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nKindly permit me to take two minutes of your precious time to ask you for a special favor.\n\nWe need a light truck to bring at times supplies from our distant stations, Winnipegosis and Pine River, also to go and get pupils from several remote reserves. Our communications are not so very good; still they are such that allow us most of the time to pass through.\n\nAs you know, more than any one else, our conditions, and as you are ready to help us, I would sincerely appreciate if you would kindly approve the expenditure.\n\nDetails of the expenditure are being sent to the Department of Indian Affairs by Rev. Father Plourde, O.M.I., our representative.\n\nThanking you in advance for this favour, I am glad to remain, Honorable Sir,\n\nSincerely and respectfully yours,\n\nRev. J. Brachet, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\n\nHon. T.A. Crerar,\nMinister of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDecember 26, 1935.\n\nDear Father Plourde,-\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, addressed to the Honourable the Minister, in which you request that a truck be supplied for use at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, Camperville, Man.\n\nIn this connection I would say that, while there is no doubt this equipment would be of service in the transporting of freight from the nearest railway station to the school, it has not been the general policy of the Department, except in one or two cases, to supply trucks to residential schools. However, I should be pleased if you would advise the Department regarding the capacity of truck required and the approximate cost, in Winnipeg. It will, no doubt, be possible to provide the funds to purchase the truck from the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year. When we have your reply, stating the capacity and cost of the truck required, consideration will be given as to whether the purchase can be made.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nH. W.

This includes upholstered passenger seats.\n\nWe have delivered one of these jobs to the Royal Canadian Air Force at Winnipeg, and it is a finished unit.\n\nTrusting you will favor us with your order.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDOMINION MOTORS LIMITED,\n\nManager.\n\nW.S.

He examined in the same time the different machines that he had installed in 1929-1930, and specially our pump and the engine that works it. He remarked that he was not believed when he told several companies that with the 3\u00bd\"x4\" Gardner Pump we were raising water from 5,120 ft. away; but he had us also notice that very little defect would impede the pump from operating, and he found that the following pieces, marked in a separate sheet, would be needed immediately. He advised us to see to it at once for the regular water supply and consequently for fire protection.\n\nWould you have the kindness of finding from the companies, from where the pump and engine were purchased, the total cost of repair parts, and benevolently ask the Department for the due authorization to purchase the parts?\n\nThanking you in advance, dear Sir, I remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJ. Brachet, O.M.I., Principal.\nSir:\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter received from the Rev. Father Brachet, Principal, Pine Creek Indian Residential School, Camperville, Man.\n\nThe repair parts from Mumford Medland Ltd. will cost approximately $106.00 F.O.B. Winnipeg. The other repairs will cost $44. F.O.B. Winnipeg. Kipp-Kelly Ltd. submitted this price, but point out that it is more satisfactory to have the cylinder liners pressed in rather than driven in. They state it will be necessary to send the pump to Winnipeg unless facilities are available at the school for this class of work. To make a satisfactory job, I think it will be necessary for the Department to figure the complete cost at approximately $200.\n\nIt is certainly necessary to keep this pump in good repair and I would appreciate having authority to carry out the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G.

I enclose here-with account showing number of hours the workmen were engaged, also the rate per hour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nEngineer a good idea as to where and how the drains run.\n\nYou're sincerely,\n\nYates, Neale & Co.\n\n(signed) per Jas. E. Yates.\nRev. Father Brachet. O.M.L.\nIndian Boarding School.\nCamperville, Man.\n\nDear Father,\n\nPlease pardon the delay, but I overlooked the fact, that the estimate should be in your hands so early.\n\nThe price to repair the Hot Water Tank may seem to you to be high, but we have to bring a Welder from Brandon to insure the welding being properly done. It is one thing to weld for strength and another to weld for tightness.\n\nTo take the Tank down and weld it properly, making the necessary changes to pipes and cleanout Tank, Pipes and Heater is worth approximately..................$74.00\n\nTo Vent both stacks, one at the South and one at the North of Building is worth approximately........$147.00\n\nThis provides for bringing Vents from the second floor through the roof.\n\nYou will note that at the time the alterations were made at the School, there was no Law governing the Plumbing except for large Cities, since then Laws have been enacted whereby every Fixture must have a separate trap and be Vented.\n\nThe Basins in the Girls & Boys Dormitories were in before the alterations were made, and are really not according to the present Law, but as they were part of the original system, we left them as they were. I am just mentioning this because at sometime some one may say that they were not properly Vented.\n\nIf all these Basins were properly Vented according to the New By-Law, it would cost approximately....$280.00\n\nHowever unless some one complains they should be all right.\n\nWe have made a rough Print showing the underground Drains, which while not absolutely accurate, will give your\nCamperville, Man.\nMay 4th 1936\n\nYates, Neale & Co.\n231-10th St.\nBrandon, Man.\n\nDear Sirs;-\n\nI am glad to let you know that I have received from the Indian Department the due authorization to have the Venting done.\n\nThe roads are very passable from Pine River to Camperville.\n\nYou could come any time now, the sooner the better, for we have been pressing the Department for the work on the Hot Water Tank and on the Closets, stating that the repairs were very, and now we have the order from the Indian Agent to proceed with the repairs at once.\n\nI suppose you will not be able to come before the 16th inst. The Agent should come on the 18th for payment of Treaty annuities. There will be room for all of you.\n\nNeedless to say that you will be quite welcome.\n\nAwaiting the pleasure to see you again,\n\nI remain, dear sir,\n\nSincerely yours.\n\n(signed) J, Brachet, O.M.I.\n\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nRe 126-1-5, Feb 4th 1936.\n\nI am in receipt of an account in an amount of $147.00 from Yates, Neale & Co., for venting stacks at the Pine Creek Residential School. The account has been returned to the Company for further information.\n\nThe attached letter is a report received from Yates, Neal & Co., and attached thereto is the letter from Father Brachet to the Company, advising the authorization to have the venting done.\n\nDepartment letter above noted, states definitely that there are no funds in which to install vents in the roof, and it appears evident that Father Brachet has had further authorization from the Department.\n\nThere is no doubt that this work was very necessary, as sewer gases formed in the soil pipes, causing a bubbling in toilets and wash basins, often to the extent of flooding floors, and the only way this could be remedied was by carrying a vent pipe from the system to the smoke stack.\n\nMessrs Yates, Neale & Co.'s letter regarding provincial regulations, is self explanatory. Accounts will be forwarded as soon as received from the said Company, in proper form.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo: Yates, Heale & Co., Brandon, Manitoba.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| May 1956 | To Venting two stacks at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, as per account attached.

The roof and the lining put inside, being entirely rotten, gave in under the weight. And the hay barn, built on the top of the root cellar, being also 35 years old, is to collapse also before long.\n\nOur root cellar is a square of 50 feet, - 8 feet high. To build another one 14,000 ft. of lumber will be required. So material and labor will cost about $900.00.\n\nBe kind enough, dear sir, to grant us the necessary money to build a new root cellar, and oblige me.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP.

There is not the same need for a night watchman at this school during the period the furnace is in operation as at the first two named schools. Our funds for the purpose are extremely limited and are assigned between the different residential schools in Canada. It is, therefore, difficult to increase the period for which this service is provided.

(RG 10, Volume 6271, file 582-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDuring my recent visit to the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, the Sister Superior requested that certain changes be made in the layout of the rooms used as infirmary's for the pupils. At present two rooms are available for hospitals with a toilet adjoining. There is no room for the nurse. I beg to enclose a sketch of the rooms with the suggested improvements. At present the girls infirmary and the nurses room are the only rooms used, and the suggestion is that the toilet room be partitioned for an infirmary for the boys, leaving a room for the nurse between the two infirmaries. The toilet would have to be changed, a door cut in the wall, and the washbasin placed on the proposed partition. The bath would also have to be moved closer to the proposed door. I was not able to get prices for this work as the school is more or less isolated, and it would be expensive to get a plumber in to make an estimate of the cost. The placing of the partition and cutting a place through the wall would not be expensive, but a first class carpenter would have to be employed.\n\nI beg to suggest that this improvement be allowed to stand for the present. In the course of time repairs will have to be made to the plumbing system and then would be the time to have an estimate made on this improvement.\n\nI believe the suggestion is excellent, and is approved by the Doctor. The pencil marks shows the position of the door and partition.\n\nWill you please advise in this matter.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 3, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, relative to the request of the Sister Superior of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, to have certain changes made in the layout of the rooms used as infirmaries for the pupils and enclosing a sketch of the proposed changes.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will have no funds during the balance of the present fiscal year to carry out the work as requested by the Reverend Sister. These improvements will have to stand for the present.\n\nI would suggest that you bring this matter to the attention of the Department after our appropriation for the coming fiscal year is available, next spring. Consideration will then be given. At the same time, you should state in detail what work is required to the plumbing system and give an estimate of the cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

Bousquet, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith, letter received from the Reverend Principal of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, also list of paint requirements.\n\nWill you please advise.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nEncls.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, May 22nd, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, enclosing a request from the Principal of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School for paint.\n\nIn forwarding such requests, you should give a definite recommendation, stating whether or not you consider this paint is required. Apparently, some of the paint is intended for use in re-painting an automobile. The Department does not supply paint for such purposes.\n\nWe have a limited amount available for repairs and improvements at this school this year and the cost of any paint that is purchased will have to be deducted from this amount. Please review the Principal's request and advise definitely what sum you consider should be expended for paint at the Pine Creek Residential School this year. Only the necessary painting should be considered.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd ultimo, file above noted, I beg to advise that the matter of the Department supplying paint for the Pine Creek Indian Residential School has been gone into with the Principal and I beg to recommend that the list as asked for, be authorized.\n\nThe prices were obtained from the Western Paint Company, Winnipeg.\n\nThe material asked for is for renovating the inside of the School. The coach stripping gold is for gilding of pictures and not for use on an automobile. The paint is required immediately as renovating will be done during the summer vacation, and I would request that as I am away paying treaty, Mr. Inspector Hamilton be telegraphed the authority to purchase.\n\nA copy of the listed requirements has been forwarded to him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, June 26th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department has been in communication with Indian Agent Waite, with reference to supplying paint for interior painting at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School.\n\nIn our current year's appropriation, the sum of $350 was provided for repairs and improvements at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School. The Principal understands that the cost of the paint will be deducted from this amount.\n\nIn a recent letter, Mr. Waite states that he has forwarded to you a list showing the quantities and kinds of paint required. You may arrange for its purchase from firms on the approved list, provided the cost does not exceed the amount mentioned above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. G.

Crerar,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nHonourable Sir:\n\nWhen I was appointed last June, Principal of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, I found the large school barn in such a precarious condition that I had to repair it immediately. The roof threatened to collapse as some of the pillars and rafters were out of line and the floors had sagged more than 6 inches in some places. As the older School Boys had to perform their daily chores under these dangerous conditions, I really felt that I had to proceed immediately with the necessary repairs rather than have my boys run the risk daily of being killed or injured for life. So I had these repairs made without waiting for authority from the Department.\n\nI have since been told that this method can hardly be approved and that I should not have acted without the consent of the agent. However, when it is realized that Pine Creek is 40 miles from the nearest railroad station and that our agent lives at Portage-la-Prairie, my manner of acting becomes, I believe, much less objectionable.\n\nThe total amount of the enclosed invoices for these repairs is not very large and I hope that you will be kind enough to authorize payment in full.\n\nMay I be permitted, before closing this letter, to call your attention to the rather sad state of the Indians and Half-breeds of this district in the matter of hospital accommodation? It is true that there is a small hospital at Winnipegosis, but it is 40 miles distant from Pine Creek and in spring, fall and winter, it is difficult of access. It is only in the summer time, when the roads are dry, that we can easily take sick people to this hospital. If your department would approve the building of a small addition to our school, similar to the one that was erected this past summer at Fort Alexander, it would help very materially in solving the problems of this poor district as far as sickness is concerned. After all, you are\n\n(our representatives)\nour representative in Ottawa and as such, are expected to do for your constituents at least as much as you have done for others.\n\nI submit this case to you in all confidence and hope that you will give it your early and favorable attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) L.

Reports we have received indicate that the barn at this school was in bad condition and no doubt required repairs.\n\nThe accounts submitted by Reverend Father Gauthier total $564.85. While funds are available in the current year's appropriation for Indian education to pay these accounts, the amount involved exceeds $500, and therefore the approval of the Honourable the Minister is required. Until we are advised of his decision in this regard, it is not possible to prepare a draft reply.\n\nA separate memorandum will be forwarded to you regarding Father Gauthier's request for hospital accommodation at Fort Alexander.\n\nDirector\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Minister\n\nI am in receipt of Mr. Jackson's memorandum of December 6th, with which he enclosed the attached letter received from the Reverend Principal of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School.

W. Jackson,\nSecretary.\nDecember 11, 1937.\n\nDear Father Gauthier:\n\nIn reply to that part of your letter of December 2 which asks that a hospital addition be built at the Pine Creek Indian Residential School I must say first of all that it would be difficult, if not almost impossible, to include funds for this purpose in the estimates for the fiscal year which will begin next spring. I really thought when assistance was given in the establishment of a hospital at Winnipegosisis that the Federal Government's contribution for hospital purposes in that district might be regarded as complete but I do not want to close the matter with what might be regarded as a refusal to consider your project. As you have in mind the welfare both of Indian wards of the Federal Government and of half-breeds I think your position would be stronger if you could secure some assurance that the Provincial Government would participate. With this assurance it might be possible to consider, or at least discuss, the matter next summer in anticipation of the estimates for the fiscal year 1939-40.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. L. Gauthier, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nPine Creek Indian Residential School,\nCamperville, Man.\nDr. McCall\n\nReplacing letter of Dec. 11/37, which is returned herewith.\n\nC.W. Jackson\n\nOttawa, December 17th, 1937.\n\nMy dear Father Gauthier,\n\nPressure of other matters has prevented me from acknowledging before this your letter of the 2nd instant, in which, among other things, you refer to the repairs you made to the large school barn. I have discussed the matter with the Director of the Branch; this expenditure has now been approved and payment will be made in due course.\n\nI have noted your remarks regarding the question of hospital accommodation at Camerville. The Branch hoped when assistance was given to the hospital at Winnipegosis it would, to a large extent, relieve the situation in that district. However, in view of the representations you have made, I am asking that the whole situation should be reviewed.\n\nWishing you the Compliments of the Season,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nReverend L.
