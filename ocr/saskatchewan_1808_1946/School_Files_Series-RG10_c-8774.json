The Rev. Father Coecke O.M.I., gave him some outdoor work, excavating for the basement of the New Mission Church at St. Eugene's. When the contract for the Church was let, I saw the foreman talk to Ignatius and asked him to give \"Ignatius\" employment as a carpenter at the Church, thus the foreman consented to do so and the lad had steady employment during the summer which gave him an opportunity of improving his knowledge of the trade. His wages at first were $1.50 per day and with board and afterwards $2.00. When there was some difficulty about getting dry lumber to complete the work, the foreman had to dispense with his services, and he went to Tobacco Plains to assist with the harvest.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6452, file 884-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFort Steele, Oct. 1st 1897\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that \"Tawtis\" one of the pupils at the Industrial School has applied to the Rt.

This piece has, I presume, been sold, but if so, the purchaser has not registered his title to it. If this is so, and the purchaser can be persuaded to register his title now, the present would be the best time to do so, as all the necessary title deeds are here in connection with your applications. If this cannot be managed, it will be necessary for you to attach a plan or append such a description to your deed which will show accurately the position and dimensions of the excepted portion.

On turning to the file containing the correspondence in this matter, I find that on the 25th September, 1889, the document in question was sent to your Department with the request that a new deed be prepared to take the place of the one then enclosed, the latter having been found to be irregular in some respects. Along with the deed was transmitted a description of the land intended to be conveyed, as the instrument was incomplete in the matter of description of the property, a sketch being substituted therefor.\n\nAs the authorities of the Roman Catholic church, from whom the land referred to was obtained, are now pressing for the registration of this deed, to avoid difficulty in the registration of adjacent land, I should be glad if you would give instructions for the preparation of a new deed as requested in the letter from this Department above referred to.\n\nWill you be so kind as to acknowledge the receipt of this letter in order that the Department may be able to advise the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church that the matter is\n\nH.L.

I first wish to thank you for a copy of the plan of the Kootenay Ind. School property which you were so kind as to send to me. Now, as to the amount of land contained, Father Cocoola when going over the measurements, last Spring realized that the ground ceded contained more than 24 1/2 acres. He estimated that it was a little over 30 acres. Mr. Green's platting must be correct. By saying that the parcel contains 33 1/3 acres, more or less, the parcel is, I should think, sufficiently described as to its area and\nand nobody will ever make any difficulty on our side, if the Government shall offer none, should it be discovered afterwards that the area is not up to 33 1/3 acres.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nDear Mr. Vowell\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) X Aug.

I therefore enclose herewith a new sketch of the dam, and an estimate of the cost of the work and piping, in connection with the same.\n\nI may mention that I spoke to the Revd. Principal Coccola about the farm instructor and his assistant and the older pupils doing the work of excavating, laying the pipe (if wooden pipe was used) and he told me that they would do all they could to assist with the work, when not engaged at farm work which required a good deal of their time, and he was willing himself to superintend and direct the work, so anxious was he to see it go ahead, but he reminded me that a skilled workman would be necessary for the dam, to build it properly and make it secure.\n\nI may mention that I recently went over the line with a practical man who has had experience in such work, and we measured the distance between the dam and the Industrial School, taking a more direct course than the one adopted by the Revd. Principal.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.W.

The two wells about thirty feet deep are completely dry, and large boulders prevent us from sinking farther.\n\nThe only way to secure water would be by gravitation. In building a dam six feet high in Joseph Creek at a point, two thousand feet above the houses and sinking four inches pipe five feet below surface, we could rise the water up to the roof; thus protecting ourselves against fire.\n\nThe said pipes having to be laid through the Indian Village, we could supply both School and Village by means of taps. I enclose a sketch of the dam to give you an idea of the possibility of success.\n\nMaterial and workmanship according to my estimation would amount to $1500, but to reduce expenses the boys under the direction of a practical man could do the work.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN. Coccola,\nPrincipal.\n\nR.L.T. Galbraith Esqr.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Steele.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI have the honor to inform you that for some time past the supply of water at the Industrial School from the wells has been very unsatisfactory and when visiting the institution recently, I carefully looked into the matter with the Revd. Principal Coccolia, and found that during the cold weather the water got very low, just at a time when it was most required for domestic and other purposes.\n\nTo give a better system, we agreed that the supply should be taken from Joseph Creek, a short distance above the Perry Creek trail, with a dam put at that point, so as to raise the water, a good and sufficient supply could be given both to the Industrial School and Indian Village.\n\nI herewith enclose a report from the Revd. Principal and a sketch of the proposed dam, together with an estimate of the probable cost.\n\nShould the Department agree to do the work or assist, I would suggest wooden pipes for the purpose, they are now being generally used through the country, and I understand, have proved equally as good as iron, and are much cheaper and will last for years.\n\nI might say that the pupils at the School could assist with the work, thus reducing the cost.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.W.

This second letter from the Agent was rendered necessary for the reason that in his first particulars as to cost (estimated) were not supplied nor was more than a vague allusion made to the part the pupils and staff would take in the project if authorized by the Department. The total estimate made seems rather\n\nin\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, Ont.\nin excess of what it should be, the figures quoted being $1500.00 whereas I consider that $1000.00 at most should suffice, with the aid of the boys and instructors at the institution, to install the needed service. I would therefore recommend that an outlay in the last mentioned sum be authorized to be expended in the direction indicated.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B. C.\nOTTAWA, 29th April, 1904:\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nMr. Supt. Vowell forwards under date of the 20th instant an application from the Principal of the Kootenay Industrial school for a grant for the purpose of installing a permanent water supply in the institution. Mr. Agent Galbraith endorses the application and says that the present source of supply is most unsatisfactory.\n\nThe scheme proposed by the Principal and Agent would entail an expenditure of $1500.00 as shown by the estimate submitted, but this amount could be considerably reduced by utilizing the labor of the staff and pupils of the school. Mr. Vowell considers that $1000.00 would be sufficient.\n\nIn addition to supplying the school, the work contemplated would afford a water supply for the Indian village through which the pipe line would pass. The intention is to dam a creek and lay a pipe line to the school. An eight-foot dam would give sufficient head to reach all parts of the building by reavitation.\n\nIn the present water supply is uncertain, as stated, another plan should be adopted, and the one of drawing water from a reservoir with sufficient fall would be the best and most economical in the end. If funds can be found I do not see that the money could\nbe better spent than in overcoming this difficulty.\n\nThe scheme proposed is similar to the one adopted for the McDougall Orphanage at Morley for which the Department has agreed to pay, although the buildings are the property of the Methodist Church, while in this instance the school is owned by the Government.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6452, file 884-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOTTAWA, 6th May, 1904:\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo, forwarding an application from the Principal of Kootenay Industrial school for a grant for the purpose of installing a permanent water supply in the institution; and in reply I beg to say that this application cannot be considered until the estimates have been finally dealt with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEELER\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nA.W.

On the afternoon of August 26th, the Sisters informed me that the cattle had been let loose and that they had returned as quickly as possible. The cattle had been heard barking and in some way managed to take his shepherd. He had not returned within a reasonable time so the Sisters concluded that something might be wrong, so they sent out Indians and others employed at the Institution to make a search. When his body was found, he was lying on the bank of the river, where the boy had gone skating, and dropped through. When the body was recovered every effort was made to resuscitate him, but without success.\n\nI investigated the case carefully and found that no blame could be attached to those in charge of the School.\n\nThe boy was a promising pupil and the only son of an Indian named James Joseph of this district.\n\nA.

As the loss of the applicant's property is, to him, quite considerable and as he is quite useful to the Indians of the band by his expert knowledge of carpentry and as he has not the means wherewith to replace the tools lost, I would recommend that an expenditure in the sum named ($25.00) be incurred in providing him with a new set.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6452, file 884-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nset of carpenter's tools.

In view of the fact that he not only lost his tools, but the results of his earnings when his house was burnt, the Department approves of an expenditure of $35.00 being incurred in the purchase of a set of tools, with which he may be enabled to continue the practice of his trade.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

C., the Department's salaried medical officer in that locality, in regard to the subject of the dental care and treatment necessary in the case of some of the pupils of the Kootenay Industrial School now and from time to time in future. The doctor's suggestion, in so far as the advisability of having some provision made on behalf of the children for the care of their teeth is concerned, appears to be a good one and were it acted on much suffering would at times be relieved by the timely intervention of a competent and trustworthy dentist. The matter of cost would, however, doubtless, be considerable in the aggregate were the pupils of all the Department's industrial and boarding schools in the superintendency whose\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6452, file 884-1, part 1)\nwhose teeth required attention afforded the requisite oversight on the part of a reliable dentist though, as it happens at present, some of these institutions are far removed from the headquarters of any such professional men. As a rule Indians, probably because of the expense involved in filling, prefer to have their teeth extracted than saved to them. If the Department does not see its way clear to giving effect to Dr. Watt's suggestion as to its assuming the cost of such work it would seem only reasonable that the parents of the children, when able to bear the expense, be advised to have the necessary care in this respect bestowed on their offspring. If the Agents missionaries and medical men were to impress on the minds of the parents and children from time to time as occasion offers the advisability of giving the teeth the needed attention it might be that in the course of time the parents would be brought to see the reasonableness of the proffered counsel and act on it without unnecessary delay, at least in localities where the services of a dentist were within comparatively easy reach.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Galbraith, Esq.,\nIndian Agent, Fort Steele.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nQuite recently, as you will remember, I was required to pull teeth for four of the Indian boys attending the Mission School, who had been suffering from toothache. In some of these cases the teeth might have been saved by the services of a good dentist; & you will recollect I mentioned this fact to you; but you were unable, under the regulations to do anything in that direction, but you suggested that I might bring the matter to the notice of the Department by letter.\n\nI accordingly do so now, & would strongly recommend that in the case of children attending the Mission School, whose teeth require attention, the Department should allow them to be sent to a Dentist,\u2014of course always after examination by me & on my recommendation.

Our supply of flour for one year, ran from $50.00 to $60.00 and this year our supply costs over $100.00. Moreover wages for Trade-Instructor etc., were $40.00 a month, they now pay $70.00 a month.\nCRANBROOK, B.C.,\n\nFor our trade instructor, and it is the same for everything as you are aware of Mr. Scott, so that you will not be surprised to hear that the per capita grant which was considered only reasonable some years ago, is altogether insufficient to keep up the school at the present time.\n\nI therefore respectfully ask that an increase should be given in order to keep up the school until such time as prices will again become normal.\n\nI trust this request which the present condition compels me to make will be considered and granted.\n\nDear Mr. Scott, we missed your visit last year but we hope to be more privileged this year.\n\nWith the confidence,\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nMost Gratefully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPete Hutchison, Principal.\nJuly 11th, 1917.\n\nRev. and dear Sister Justinian,\n\nI have your letter of July 6th, and am very sorry to hear you have such difficulty in financing the institution. The prices of everything are extremely high and wages are correspondingly increased. Some weeks before your letter arrived, I had given consideration to the needs of the schools and had prevailed upon the Minister to increase the per capita grant by $10.00 per capita for the current fiscal year. You will have received notice to that effect. This will give you some relief, but you may find it inadequate. Just now, however, it is impossible for us to do better. I am supposed to provide this increase from the existing funds voted by Parliament, and even this moderate increase will add to the expenditure nearly $40,000.00 for the current fiscal\n\nRev. Sister Justinian,\nPrincipal, Industrial School,\nSt. Eugene Mission,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nyear.

As an ex-pupil I would like to draw your attention to a few facts of the conditions of this (footnoted) Reserve. Which I hope you will not turn a deaf ear. When the Agency was first established did the Government make some agreements with the Indians or did they not.\n\nTo begin with we shall start with the school and its surroundings. As I have stated before I am an ex-pupil. I shall dwell on a subject that myself had hundreds during the period of my school days, and which I might state nothing was done to better the conditions of the pupils since.\n\nIt has been known, and it has come to be publicly known, and it is a matter of general\ntalk of the conditions of the pupils. That they are taken out in the fields and in the woods a whole day or half a day as the case may be and there be telling doing work that a grown up person would be paid for doing. And the third man who is paid a salary for doing the work standing right behind them if one stops a moment to rest he is made to work of course I refer to the smaller boys six and seven years old it make me think of the days of slavery.\n\nAnd here I might state that the Indians have come to hinder it. And for the reason it has been more of a task to induce the people to give up their children to the principal of the school. And which I have reason to think will be the case till something is done to better the conditions of the pupils.\n\nIn 1913 when the school was completed the biggest school that was ever built.\nIn the interest of B.C. for the Indians by\nthe Government.\n\nNo doubt the Indians were very grateful\nto those who undertook such a great\ntask at such an expense. They all\nlooked at that building as a place\nwhere the Indian would be ignorant\nof the world beyond, and after a few\nyears of education come out of there\nwith a knowledge mental and spiritual\nwhich he would be willing to impart\nto his less fortunate brothers. And which\nwould also put the Indian on the same\nstanding as the white man. This was their\nthought and expression.\n\nBut after they saw that nothing\nwas done for the welfare of the people\nthey stepped back and waited for the day\nwhen a change for the better would\ncome over the landscape, which to my\nopinion has not claimed yet.\n\nThe next thing I will draw your\nattention to is the condition of the pupils after they are graduated. And this I think will appeal to the Indian Agent in charge of these four Reserves. Did the Department of Indian Affairs during the time of its existence ever state or promised that after a pupil graduated they would give such a pupil a start in the new way that he became acquainted during the course of his school career. Which would be accomplished by giving them a small loan also implements with which to start with. If they did I fail to see where such an agreement was ever put into operation.\n\nAnd furthermore I hope you will also give this matter your consideration. The pupils are being misled they are convinced that there is a missing link somewhere who is the responsible party they do not know.\nThe party that the people regard as the instrument through which their pleas could be heard by the Government seems to be the barrier which obstructs their desperate calls from being heard by the Government.\n\nThe people are tired of promises made to them by the Agent. It would have been better that these promises were never made. Did the Government ever send any money for the relief of the poor and aged? If they did, they fail to see where it was ever distributed among them. The wants of the people that the compensation made by the Government to the people were known almost after they were made. Did the Government make these promises or was it someone that just said it, pretending that he was acting in the name of the Government?\n\nThe people are thoroughly convinced that they are misled by someone who\nis beyond their power to detect. They know that someone is taking the advantage of the ignorance of the people to lead them astray and therefore reap the benefit which was intended for them.\n\nWhat they want is some responsible person that is willing to play square with the people, a responsible party whom they would have no cause to distrust, whom they can look upon as their benefactor in the hour of need and feel that they are being led on the road success and modern civilization. To be convinced that the Government is doing all in their power to live up to the agreements that it made with the people and that their pleas would receive every consideration in the future, and that there would be no cause of dissatisfaction. The people also demand that something be done to remedy the cause which\nprevents their pleas from reaching\nthe Government.\n\nThe people also want to know if there\nis any \"Laws and Regulations\" in printed\nmatter on these matters, if there is, they\nwould like to know what they are, and\nwhy they are kept in the darkness for\nfearing you will give these matters your\nfull consideration and to reply at\nan early date as possible.\n\nI have Dear Sir\n\nThe Honour to be your\nObedient servant\nEd. A. Stanley\nOttawa, February 23, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI am sending you herewith a copy of a letter received from Edward A. Stanley, who claims to be an ex-pupil of the Kootenay Industrial School.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to furnish the Department with a report on the statements made by Stanley regarding the management of the school and the condition of the ex-pupils, and also with reference to the remarks concerning the failure to carry out the promises which he alleges were made to the Indians. You should also state when Stanley attended this school, and furnish the Department with some information in regard to him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. L. T. Galbraith, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Steele, B.C.\nOttawa, February 23, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant in regard to the management of the Kootenay Industrial School and the condition of the ex-pupils and the failure to carry out promises which you state were made to the Indians.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that inquiries will be made into these matters and you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. Ed. A. Stanley,\nWindermere, B.C.\nFORT STEELE, B.C.\nMAR 13 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have acknowledged your letter of February 25th, No. 16564/1, history, and from E.J. Stanley dated the 27th, and requesting a report on the state of the school and the condition of the pupils, etc.\n\nFor your information I may explain that Edward A. Stanley was a pupil at the school about the year 1896, and left in 1902, and whilst he was at the institution he was considered by all as being a boy of a most erratic character, with a lack of balance, who required careful looking after.\n\nDuring his term the farm and garden consisted of about 22 acres, a chimney built upon the latter, and the farm was in charge of the former instructor, and it was found that there was not enough work on the place to keep the pupils employed, and to give them sufficient exercise to keep their healths. The farm was afterwards added to by the Metlakatla, and land purchased from the Indians.\n\nThe only time that Edward Stanley could be seen in the vicinity of the public road was a young boy, and returning from church, which is about 1\u00bd of a mile from the school, but he was seen doing nothing on the road, as does not occur after by the Metlakatla.\n\nAs to the farm and other students' duties, the pupils assisting and directing them, it is stated to do so, as they cannot be left alone, whether at work or play, and as with them or out of the school.\n\nThe Indians did they are doing more work than a grown person is not asked as the prescribed time for work is about thirty hours daily, and only those students who have to work after the horses and cattle in the stable in the evening.\nWe do not longer.\n\nThe most prominent feature of Mr. Smith is out of the world. He was at the school, and still lives in that house. He is kind and considerate, and wants all who pass by to know him as he was.\n\nHe has assisted many people, this was a great merit to the late Mr. Smith, and myself so as to gain their favor. He has been in a situation where he could get his carpenter tools and other farming implements, and they are still being assisted from time to time, but they are not getting everything they think they should have.\n\nA few years ago Smith applied for a loan, but as he had been out of school for a number of years, it was considered by the Dept. that he must be fairly paid, and he did not apply. This was correct, as his father-in-law had a good farm, little and hasty. He got the loan he was from the Department, and was not paid for it yet. He afterwards purchased a sheep, and it was only by repeated requests, that he paid, leaving a balance still due. He also borrowed from the Department upon my recommendation, for which he was to pay off by two installments, this he has failed to do, making all sorts of excuses.\n\nHe is the owner of several acres of land, and has a house, and has on several occasions expressed his desire to move to the Provincial Road near while looking on the road this, the nearest.\n\nWe must conclude, that he is prospering as he states to the Sales before a few months ago, that he had a contract to purchase an estate, and that he was going to Calgary for the purpose.\n\nI may state for the information of the Department, that he is living on one of the best farms in the area, and on the death of his father-in-law inherited a good farm, and if he will get down and work it properly he will be out of\nThe most prosperous young men in the Society, but I fear he\ndeserves not and wants to farm simply by schemes.\n\nThis complaint, that the old and obsolete are not being\nused for the monthly accounts show how they treat his stake\nwhat is? What are our duties who really are in want, and who\nfrom theft or other cause do cheats have assistance.\n\nI say this, that if the Department expects the School to be\na success it must have the utmost confidence in what is taught\nand anything that helps in every way so that they carry\non the good work without deviation from the outset by leaving\nas they would take their children out with most kindness and\nthereby destroy the cooperation and the aim which the Department\nhas in view, it is our belief that having the assistance will be\na help and a assistance to the people on the different reserve,\nhaving a quiet and fair treatment of affairs. Whether the\nAgency you can see how valuable it is to pupils etc., and\nwhile some fail others have made good.\n\nAs to my own work, the Department and its\naffairs in June 95.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.T.

He states that, upon the strong recommendation of the doctor, he authorized the principal to allow an extra month's holidays.\n\nIn connection with this matter, I beg to say, in view of the Superintendent's telegram, the Department will approve of the pupils of this school being granted two months' summer holidays. In preparing the quarterly returns for the September quarter, the principal should count the days the pupils are absent on such leave as \"Days present\", in order that the full amount of the per capita grant can be paid for the two months' holidays.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform the principal accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. F. Helmsing, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Steele, B. C.\nI found splendid work being done at this school at the time of my visit. The classroom teachers had excellent English at their command and their pupils showed evidences of careful training. There was considerable danger of typhoid, due to the temporary supply of water, and I arranged for the closing of the school for an extra long holiday for this summer. The necessary repairs in connection with the water intake, the barn floor and the chapel ceiling have all been arranged for.\n\nThe Sisters are making an effort to improve the grounds in front of the building, and when W. B. Anderson, Supervisor of Indian Orchards, requisitions for trees for a lane, the Department should deal favourably. The cement curbing will be done by the school authorities.\nSir,\n\nI have learned today with regret that the Rev. Sister Justinian has been transferred from the Kootenay Industrial School to the Superiorship of some Hospital in North Battleford.\n\nSister Justinian, as no doubt the Department will agree with me, is a very valuable woman to have in charge of an Institution such as we have here and her services will be very much appreciated by myself and I think I am correct in adding the Department, if we can only persuade the Mother General in Montreal to re-appoint her to the Principalship.\n\nThe new Principal appointed to take her place speaks very little English and has not the managers experience that Sister Justinian has.\n\nI wondered if it would be possible to have the Department write to the Rev Mother Superior General and ask if the Rev Sister could not be allowed to remain as Principal. The position of Superior I know must be passed on according to the order's rules, but Sister Justinian would be quite willing to remain as Principal under the new Superior, and it would be to the School's advancement I am positive, if this end could be accomplished.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.F.

It is earnestly requested, therefore, that the question of her transference will be reconsidered, and that she will be allowed to remain.

Scott, Esq.\nDeputy Superintendent Genl.\nof Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nFrom the name and address upon a circular letter, I infer that I have been recognized as Principal of the St. Eugene Industrial School, and will endeavor as far as it lies within my power to comply with the regulations of the Department of Indian Affairs respecting Industrial Schools.\n\nI am pleased to find that I have a Staff to assist me, that has been well trained to manage Indian Children, for I recognize that the psychology of the Indian Child differs very much from the psychology of the white-race Child. There are certain matters which bring me, as Principal, into business relationship with certain government officials, such as the Indian Agent, the local Police and so forth. With these matters I am not fully conversant, and would esteem it a favor Sir, if you would please forward to me the regulation dealing with such matters or the rules and regulations drawn up by the Department guiding such affairs. I trust that I am not causing you any unnecessary trouble.\n\nNow Mr. Scott, if I remember rightly, I have heard it said that you were to come out West in the course of the winter months, you will be very welcome to our School, I would appreciate very highly the pleasure of making your valued acquaintance.\n\nHoping that our business relations will be as cordial as they have been under Sister Justinian's administration, I beg to remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal of St. Eugene Industrial School.\nOttawa, Nov. 14, 1922.\n\nDear Sister Mary Napoleon:\n\nI have received your letter of the 6th instant, referring to your appointment to the principalship of the Kootenay Industrial School, and expressing your willingness to comply with the regulations of this Department. I am indeed pleased to have this communication from you, and I feel that it augurs well for your success in your new work.\n\nThere are certain government officials with whom you will come in contact: Mr. R. H. Cairns, Room 42 Post Office Building, Vancouver, B. C., is the Inspector of all Indian schools in British Columbia. At the time of his next visit you might draw from his store of experience in the work, details, discipline and your relations with local officials are fully understood by Mr. Agent Helmsing, who is quite ready to advise you in any way he can.\n\nWhen I am next in British Columbia, I trust that I will have an opportunity of accepting your kind invitation to visit the school. May I wish you as useful a career as that of your esteemed predecessor, Sister Justinian.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan G. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Napoleon,\nPrincipal,\nKootenay Industrial School,\nCranbrook, B. C.\nOttawa, Jan. 12, 1923.\n\nReverend Sister:\n\nThis Department, as you are aware, has authorized heavy expenditure during the past few months in connection with repairs necessary to the water system and other equipment at the Kootenay Industrial School. It is our practice to insist that a competent engineer-caretaker be employed at modern Indian residential schools owned by the Dominion Government.\n\nI know that the engaging of a man qualified to look after all mechanical equipment may cause you some inconvenience, and I regret the necessity of this communication. However, to safeguard against the possibility that the heating, lighting and water systems prove a constant source of heavy expense, I have to request that you will arrange for the services, on your staff, of a competent engineer-caretaker. Kindly inform the Department when such appointment is made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Napoleon,\nPrincipal,\nKootenay Indus.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFebruary 28, 1923.\n\nReverend Sister,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, in which you state that you are planning to come to Ottawa the first week in March.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that I expect to be here at that date, and shall be glad to see you. I think it would be well for you to telephone for an appointment before coming up to my office, so that I will be here. My office is situated in the Booth Building, Sparks street, 7th Floor, and the Telephone Number is: Q.3000, Local 526.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

She was absent in Montreal at the time of my visit and Sister Augusta was Acting-Principal. From what I was told I would infer that there is a lack of harmony between the principal and her staff, however, I did not go into the details of the question.\n\nIf there is to be a change of Principal in this school, I would strongly recommend that the Reverend C.E. Evans, a graduate of Oxford University, be appointed to this position. I am quite confident he would stimulate the effort of all the staff and would bring about co-operation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.H.

Hanna I proceeded to Cranbrook by train on the morning of the 15th inst., in connection with the above matter. On my arrival there I reported as directed to Mr. Helmsing, the Indian Agent, who requested me to go to the Indian Mission School, six miles east, as there had been some discontent amongst the Indians with regard to school affairs and the sisters were afraid of trouble.\n\nFrom my conversation with Mr. Helmsing and from other sources I found that there had been some discontent amongst the Indians on the reserve over the refusal of the Indian agent to let certain children, pupils at the school, attend the ceremony of the opening of the Banff-Windermere road at Invermere on June 30th. This coupled with the fact that there is a new staff in charge at the school appears to have caused some friction amongst the Indians, so much so that the Indian Chief, Francis Francois, warned the sisters on the 12th inst. that they had better leave Cranbrook on the next train to avoid trouble.\n\nI passed the night of the 15th on guard at the school during which I made frequent patrols in the vicinity, but everything passed off quietly and I saw no signs of any Indians. On the 14th I visited the Indian village some distance from the school but saw only two or three Indian men and women, the rest being on their farms on the reserve. The school and village are both on the reserve, being about a hundred yards apart.\n\nAs there appeared to be no further signs of trouble I returned to Fernie by train on the night of the 14th.\n\n[Signature]\nConst.\nReg.

I have noted that you found it necessary to telegraph the local officer of the R. C. M. P. at Fernie, B. C. I should be pleased to have a full report from you in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. F. Helmsing, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI most respectfully beg to submit for your approval a suggestion regarding the Kootenay Industrial School.\n\nAt the beginning of the School year which has just closed I promised the girls and boys prizes for the two boys and the two girls who, during the school year, received the least number of bad marks against their respective names.\n\nThe competition was well received among the pupils themselves, and they have looked forward to the decision of the Staff, whom I left as judges, they being better able to judge who had been the best.\n\nMy suggestion which I have to make is that the Department will authorise me to offer prizes as follows each School year, to be awarded at the commencement of the summer vacation:\n\n- 1st Prize for best girl: $5.00\n- 2nd Prize for best girl: $2.50\n- 1st Prize for best boy: $5.00\n- 2nd Prize for best boy: $2.50\n\nWhen I say best girl and boy, I mean general all round proficiency and good behaviour. This year I have awarded the prizes, and I am sure the competition has been responsible for making the children try to win the prize and consequently made better girls and boys. After all the white schools give prizes and the children have something to look forward to, while the Indian children get no acknowledgement for any signs of improvement, the bad or careless pupils being treated the same as the ambitious.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.F. Helminger\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6452, file 884-1, part 2)\nOttawa, August 9, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 2104-23 of the 26th ultimo, relative to prizes for good conduct at the Kootenay Industrial School.\n\nYour suggestion is most commendable and is in harmony with the practice at many Indian residential schools. I regret, however, that the Department cannot authorize you to present accounts for the prizes given, as it is our policy to ask school finances to meet this expense. If you have made a promise to the Sister Superior, an exception will be made this year, and an account not exceeding $15 will be given favourable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. F. Helmeing, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B. C.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 28th ultimo regarding the recent trouble at the Kootenay Industrial School, I beg to refer you to my letter No.: 2096423, July 14th, 1923, regarding the same and my actions in the matter.\n\nI most respectfully submit to you that at present everything is very quiet and orderly.\n\nThe trouble we expected I blame the following facts for:\n\na) The celebrations recently held at Windermere\n\nb) The fact that the pupils were not permitted to leave school for two months vacation this year, as was the case last year, owing to the fact that there was no fresh water in the school\n\nc) The death of the Rev. Father Lambot, late parish priest and the fact that the Rev. Father Evans, who is at present at the Mission and is not used to handling Indians, is a little too excitable and extreme for the Indian nature.\n\nd) A new staff at the School and the Indians were going to try them out so-to-speak.\n\ne) I would not permit school to close on June 28th, as requested by the Indians in order to permit their children to go to the celebrations at Windermere.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6452, file 884-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, August 14, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, reporting on the recent trouble at the Kootenay Industrial School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the action taken by you, to overcome the trouble with the Indians as regards the school, is approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Sister Marie du Cennacle, who is now the new Principal.\n\nIt is very regrettable that so many changes keep taking place in the staff of the school and it is not for the making of efficiency. Since the Rev. Sister Justinian was removed from the Principalship a year ago this makes the third new Superior and Principal at the Kootenay Industrial School and I am sure the Department will realise what that means to a school, especially as we have also lost through death, the Rev.

The chief complaint of the Indians is that the boys, particularly the younger ones, are far too heavily worked at such work as logging for the school supply of fuel in the winter, and that the boys are quite insufficiently dressed to be exposed to the cold weather in such work. The fact that so many boys died there this Spring of pneumonia, also aggravated and lent colour to their complaints. They also complain of insufficient food. Of course they have taken their complaints as largely exaggerated. However, there it is, and even under close questioning they persist in it.\n\nMr. Helminger also informed me of the strong prejudice and the consequent trouble involved in getting the children back to school. I cannot, therefore, believe that there is nothing in it. That is, however, a new Principal, the Rev. Mother Mary de Sena, and I went into the matter very fully with her, warning her that it is entirely up to her to overcome this prejudice, if the school is to be a success. I fully explained to her the Indians' complaints, without disguising any of them. She seems to be fully alive to the seriousness of it, and I should think, is a most sensible, practicable and kindhearted lady, with previous extensive experience of Indian nature. I feel sure that she will make a great improvement, and extend sympathy and a bit of \"Blarney\" to the Indian parents, which after all is only what all parents require, whether red or white. I can only think in the past few years there, that this has been missing and is at the bottom of the matter. Perhaps, too, the fact that the outdoor work has to be left in the hands of hired help has not helped matters, particularly over the logging business. I have informed Mother Superior, and she quite sees the point. The school has also been warned against taking timber off the Reserve for firewood, that is merchantable.\n\nIn connection with school matters, I would like to point out that in this agency, as in others, there is a great difficulty in getting the children from distant points to school. One of the principal reasons being that the average Indian finds great difficulty in finding money for fees. I think it would be of great assistance if in all cases of distant travelling advantage was taken of Sec. 9, sub 4, of the Indian act.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) G. S. Pragnell.\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6452, file 884-1, part 2)\nOttawa, Sept. 26, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to a portion of your report on the Kootenay Agency, dated the 15th instant, which is relative to the antipathy of certain Indians for the Kootenay Residential School. I have noted, with approval and satisfaction, your action in discussing this matter carefully with the new Sister Superior, and I trust that the institution will, in future, enjoy more popularity.\n\nWith reference to the second paragraph, relative to this school, I have noted your recommendation that the Department meet the expenses of transporting pupils from a distance. I am pleased to inform you that, when we are convinced of the inability of parents to pay railroad fares, favourable consideration is given to the accounts submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nG. S. Pragnell, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n39 Clerk St.,\nKamloops, B. C.\nSir:-\n\nI am in receipt of your 116656-1 of the 26th of September, and note your remarks therein.\n\nWith reference to the second paragraph regarding the expenses of transportation of pupils from a distance, your explanation regarding the payment of transportation of pupils from a distance is understood.\n\nI, however, wish to point out to you that one of the main objections many of the Indians have is their inability to pay the railroad fares, and their objections to paying show that they would prefer to have day schools nearer to the Reserves. This leads, as you can readily see, to a great deal of trouble and extra work for the Agent in trying to find out when pupils do not arrive in time, as to whether the Indian family in question has not sent the children because of inability to pay the fare, or whether there was some other reason. It means just so many cases of investigation every time school starts, whereas if fares were authorized for all, there would be no excuse.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(G.S. Pragnell)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nMarch 25, 1924.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns, in his report on the Kootenay Indian Residential School, dated the 6th instant, draws attention to the fact that the discipline on the boys' side has been bad. Five boys are in reformatory for misdeeds and others are on suspended sentence. The Rev. Principal, Sister Mary Du Genacle, appears to be very capable, but a large Indian residential school really needs a male principal to handle the larger boys. Constant change in staff has also contributed to the unrest in the school. The girls' work is excellent. Two boys - accidentally, I believe - burned a warehouse and blacksmith shop. The farm instructor gets along well with the boys, but he should be supervised and supported by a male principal to get the best results.\n\nInsufficient milk at this school also...\nOttawa, March 25, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. Inspector Cairns has reported that there is insufficient milk supplied for the use of the pupils at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. The Department considers that an institution with a pupilage of 80 should have 7 cows milking all the year round. Please discuss this matter with the Sister Superior and explain to her that the Department expects remedial measures without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. F. Helmsing, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGranbrook, B. C.\nMarch 26, 1924.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nThere have been several changes in the staff at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. This has resulted in some unrest, on the part of the older pupils particularly. The Sister Superior in charge last summer had some difficulty with the Indian parents and Mr. Indian Agent Helmsing felt it necessary to call in the Mounted Police to assist.\n\nThe work, among the older boys particularly, is suffering because of improper supervision. The blacksmith shop was burned down - quite accidentally, I believe - by two of the pupils. During the past year 7 boys got into difficulties in the neighborhood and 5 of them have been sent to reformatory - 2 being on suspended sentence. Mr. Inspector Cairns strongly recommends, and I concur, that the Department make arrangements for the incumbency of a male principal.\n\nThe present Principal, Sister Mary De Cenacle, is French speaking but is doing as good work as can be expected considering the difficulties. The Mother General of the Order is Sister Amarine, Providence Mother House, 1271 St. Catherine St., Montreal.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, March 27, 1924.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI regret to inform you that during the past few months the usefulness of the Kootenay Indian Residential School at Cranbrook, B.C., has suffered because of a spirit of unrest among the older boys of the school. The present responsible incumbent, Sister Mary Du Cenacle, has done splendid work; but I believe the difficulties inherent in the situation would be relieved by the appointment of a Rev. Father as principal. It is this Department's experience that boys in the adolescent period need the supervision of a Christian gentleman, and, if you concur, I should be pleased to correspond with His Grace Archbishop Casey, of Vancouver, with a view to securing a Rev. Father for the post. If such an appointment were made, the school would have not only the benefit of a resident spiritual adviser but would have a principal who could supervise boys' activity and the interests of the institution generally.\n\nPlease inform me if this proposal commends itself to you and intimate whether or not the appointment of a Rev. Father would be satisfactory to the Sisters who are responsible for the management.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nVery Rev. Sister Amarine,\nMother General,\nProvidence Mother House,\n1271 St. Catherine St.,\nMontreal, Que.\nSir,\n\nI regret very much having to report that 6 more boys, pupils of the Kootenay Industrial School have been arrested by the Provincial Police Department for burglaries which have happened around here recently, on more than one occasion. The Police suspected Indian boys, but I could not believe this knowing that the boys were all in school at the time the theft they mentioned to me took place.\n\nHowever, upon being advised of their suspicions by Chief Constable Mortimer, I visited the school in his company with a view to making full inquiries.\n\nFrom the boys themselves, who made no pretence to hide the fact, rather glorying in their adventures, we ascertained that several of the boys of late had been getting up at about midnight, dressing, going out by way of the dormitory window, taking horses from the school barn and going to Fort Steele, a distance of some 7 miles from the school. Here they broke into the general store of the Fort Steele Trading Co. and stole food, tobacco, cigarettes, chewing gum, pocket knives, shoes, clothes etc., some of which Chief Mortimer and I recovered from caches in the school basement. They then returned to the school, climbed up the walls by the help of a rope they had smuggled into the dormitory, went to bed and claimed nothing had happened. The two brothers Schelle, the two hired men at the school, seem also to be quite aware, in a little room between the two boys' dormitories, having an opening on each side of their room into the respective dormitories. How the boys could get up, dress, set out of the windows, and a few hours later, return by the same way, and not wake either of these two men, is beyond my comprehension altogether, yet they claim they never heard any sound.\n\nI might mention here that on more than one previous occasion, Mr. Schelle has told me that he heard footsteps on the school corridors, and he said he thought that someone had broken in from the outside and was in the building. Yet, he apparently never got up to investigate, whether he was afraid or not I cannot say. Evidently as it turns out now, it was some of the school boys themselves walking around the building. When these matters were reported to me, investigations were made which gave us no clues to anybody having broken into the building, and now the whole matter stands out as clear as daylight. It was the boys in the building who would not leave any trace of having broken in from the outside.\n\nOn Saturday last, the 22nd inst., Sister Superior reported to me that on one occasion, Mr. Schelle caught some of the boys getting up in the middle of the night and he made them get back into bed again. The matter was not however, reported to me until the 22nd inst., although it happened some few weeks ago.\nThe Sister Superior was away from here on her annual Lenten \"retreat\" and Sister Francis was in charge of the boys. Not knowing at that time that the boys had been away by the same process previously, and as they had caught them and prevented them from leaving the school, the matter was not reported to me as it should have been, the school staff thinking they could prevent the repetition of the affair.\n\nNow as it happens, it turns out the boys have done this before and the Superior regrets very much not having reported it to me at the time mentioned.\n\nI spoke very seriously to the Superior on the matter and asked her if she considered the Messrs Scholle to be competent to care for the boys, as I had my doubts about it. She assured me they are, although I must admit there must have been slackness somewhere.\n\nThe 6 boys in question, Jimmy Isaac aged 15 years, and Louie Paul, Skookum Joe, John George, Joe Mission and Joseph Dominic are all around 12-13 years of age.\n\nSkookum Joe is the bad one and leader of the gang, and this is his 4th offence of running away and entering and stealing from houses and stores, and I am strongly of the opinion that it was he that lead the other boys off on these occasions. Only a couple of weeks ago he ran away with John George, and stole horses, going to Canoe Flats and Fairmont Springs, some 91 mile away, breaking into stores en route and taking articles. At this time, on the plea of the Rev Father Tedrow, the Judge allowed them both off on 5 years suspended sentence.\n\nWhether this is all being done to test out my stand regarding the Administration of Justice among Indians, which has been very much to the fore of late, vide my letter No.: 2298-25 under date December 29th, 1923, or not I cannot say, but my personal impression is that this has something to do with it, because, when Skookum Joe and John George were brought before the Courts some two weeks ago, the Indians demanded that they be handed over to them to be punished, as the white man's court had no right to do so. Having previously warned the Judge of this idea of the Indians, I got him to give them a good straight talk on the matter, and told them to understand that once and for all, the Indians came under the laws just the same as their white brothers, and that this would never be changed.\n\nThe 6 boys in question come before His Hon Judge Thompson, in Cranbrook on Monday the 31st inst., and I will report at that time, as to the decision of the Court in the matter.\n\nMost respectfully submitted,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6452, file 884-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nCrime Report.\n\nRpt.- Skeehum Joe.- Joseph Tecinio.- Lucy Paul, alias Pere Martin.- Indian boys ran from School, and suspected theft of horses.\n\nOn the 13th inst., at 12-30 p.m., the following telegram was received at this Detachment:\n\nSergeant Tomlinson,\nB.C.M.P.,\nRegate R.G.\n\n\"HIGHWAY.\"\n\nThree Indian boys ran from School Monday.

After the Crown Counsel had addressed the Judge, I spoke on behalf of the boys, stating that in the case of Skookum Joe I was not going to ask for any favour as this was Joe's fourth offence and he deserved all he got. Regarding the four boys, Jimmy Isaac, Louie Paul, John George and Joe Mission, I asked His Hon: to give these four boys another chance as they were not bad boys and I felt that another chance might be given them to show that they were not bad boys. I asked for suspended sentence in these cases.\n\nHis Hon: in reply to me said that he was sick and tired of these kind of cases and that the boys must be taught, as well as the older Indians, that such things must not be allowed to go on. He thought that suspended sentence was no good at all and that apparently the boys took notice of it. He said he had let Skookum Joe and John George out on 5 years suspended sentence only a few weeks ago at Wilmer and he had hoped that that would be a warning to all the boys, but apparently they took no notice of it, but went right ahead and did the same thing a few days afterwards.\n\nAs John George had not committed any offence since he had warned him at Wilmer, and as Joe Mission's offence was committed before the warning to the two boys at Wilmer he was going to let these two boys go on 5 years suspended sentence. Regarding Skookum Joe he sentenced him to 5 years in the reformatory. Louie Paul had gone with Skookum Joe only a few days after Joe had been warned, so that there\nthat there) was absolutely no excuse for him at all that he could see and he sent him to the reformatory for 4 years. Jimmy Isaac, he said was old enough to know better and in his opinion, should have tried to persuade the younger boys not to commit these offences; on the other hand he believed that Jimmy Isaac was to blame for persuading the boys to commit the offences and also took part in the crimes, so he sent him to Oakalla Farm for 2 years. Joseph Dominic has not been before His Honor yet.\n\nIt has made my heart very sad to think of all these boys having done this, especially after the other boys were punished only a few months ago, and I could not get the Judge to allow them out on suspended sentence at all, and he further said that if any more boys do the same kind of things again he is going to send them away too.\n\nYour friend,\n\nH.F. Helmung,\nIndian Agent.\nApril 3rd, 1924\n\nSir,\n\nRe: File No.: I55-0-10\nMarch 27th, 1924.\n\nReplying to your question regarding the names of the 6 boys who recently ran away from the Kootenay Industrial School and got into trouble, I beg to respectfully submit that full report was made in my letter No.: 2414-4 under date March 25th, 1924, covering the main facts of the cases.\n\nI now beg to submit to you the numbers of the boys on the school roll as requested:\n\nJoe Mission 154\nSkookum Joe 153\nJohn George 150\nLouie Paul 142\nJoe Dominic 140\nJimmy Isaac 129.\n\nWith the exception of Joseph Dominic, who is still in hospital suffering from the burns he sustained, as reported, the other five boys came before His Hon Judge Thompson in Cranbrook, yesterday, and pleaded guilty to all the charges against them, which included stealing goods to the total value of some $250.00 or thereabouts.\n\nThe following sentences were imposed by His Hon:\n\nSkookum Joe 5 years in the Reformatory\nLouie Paul 4 \" \" \"\nJimmy Isaac 2 \" \" in Oakalla Farm\nJoe Mission &\nJohn George Suspended sentence for 5 years.\n\nPlease authorise the discharge of the three first mentioned boys.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.F.

It is this: I am working in the interests of the Department for which I ask the department to give me a salary independent of the grant for School as the Sisters find it expensive to meet this new position. If my request is favorably considered will it be too much to ask for the same salary I had when a labourer here some years ago, one hundred dollars a month ($100).\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6452, file 884-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThere is another matter I wish to treat of viz. those pupils who are serving a jail term down at New Westminster.

F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. H. Small, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your favor of the 7th instant, re release of Indian Boys from the Reformatory.\n\nI am taking the matter up with Mr. Helmsing, and also the Reverend Principal as requested in your Official letter of the 5th inst., and will advise you forthwith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. H. Small,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 13th inst., regarding the application made by Rev. Father Smith, Principal of the Kootenay Residential School, for the release of several boys at present serving various terms of imprisonment at Okanagan Prison Farm and at the Provincial Reformatory.\n\nWith respect to these boys, I beg to make the following recommendations or suggestions, and knowing the circumstances of all these cases, you will perhaps permit me to assume that I am in a good position to recommend, or otherwise.\n\nLast spring there was an organized gang of male pupils at the school above mentioned, who, according to their own statements, and in spite of repeated warnings from Rev. Sister M. du Closse, who at that time was Principal, from myself as Indian Agent for the Kootenay at that time, and in some cases from the parents, also in spite of flagrants given the boys by the Indian Chief in the presence of the remaining pupils at that time attending school, were bound to commit some crime or crimes in order that they might be sent to the Reformatory, as, in their opinion, they thought that they would have a much better time there than in school, and would, perhaps, only be kept there for a short while and then paroled. Their idea was that when this happened, the Department would not consent to their re-admittance to the School after having served said terms, and they would consequently be free to go as they pleased.\n\nThese statements were made in open Court to His Honour Judge Thompson, who tried and sentenced these boys. The boys made no secret of their plans and intentions when they were caught, and one or two of them made the boast that they were going to do these things, although neither the school authorities nor myself ever considered that they would carry their threats into operation.\n\nTwo or three of the boys had appeared before Mr. John Leask, Stipendiary Magistrate for the City of Cranbrook, and also His Honour Judge Thompson, and were warned and allowed out on suspended sentence, but these warnings had no effect at all. When they were taken back to school they launched out again in a day or so in the same kind of mischief.\n\nThere was at that time considerable unrest in the school among the boys, due, I am positive, to the agitation of the older members of this gang, Basil Andrew, Carimer Joseph, Jim Isaac, Pierre Andrew, and Damian Isaac, together with two younger and incorrigible boys, Alban Mike and Skookum Joe.\n\nThat this combination was responsible for these depredations there is no doubt, and this is corroborated by the fact that since they have been removed from the School, there has been perfect harmony and peace among the male pupils attending the school.\n\nW.H.Small, Esq.\nI am in no way wishing to penalize any of these boys, or their parents without justification, but, to my mind, it would be regrettable and unwise to permit these boys to be released from their respective punishments at the present time, as that would be belittling the law in the eyes of the Indians, and it would be defeating the ends of justice to return these boys to the School or the Reserve, as it would have tendency to create unrest among the boy pupils present in the School, who, as I said above, have behaved down, and appear to be perfectly happy and satisfied at the present time.\n\nThere are, perhaps, two cases which might be given some consideration. I refer to Joseph Dominic and Louis Paul. These two boys have always been good boys and they have never caused any trouble prior to this time, and I am convinced that they were led astray by the other boys implicated. Joseph has suffered considerably from injuries sustained while truant from the school, and I am sure has learned his lesson, which after all, is all that is required. I would suggest or recomment that these two cases be given consideration, but I will never agree in the cases of the other boys.\n\nThe Rev. Sister Superior, Sister Mary du Censicle, might also be able to enlighten the Department in these cases referred to, as the circumstances are well known to her, and I am convinced that if she were still Principal, she would never agree to take the leaders of the gang back into the School again.\n\nThe boys are being instructed where they are, and are being well cared for, and Mr. Brunkin, the Superintendent of the Reformatory is an excellent man to train and control boys of this calibre, so that the boys are in no way suffering as far as education is concerned, and they undoubtedly require correction before they get too old, otherwise they may become confirmed criminals.\n\nYours obediently,\n(sgd) H.F. Helmsing,\nIndian Agent.\nI have the honour to enclose herewith Mr. H.F. Helmsing's, the late Agent's report on the Indian boys now serving terms in Okhalla Prison Farm and Reformatory at New Westminster.\n\nIn the last two weeks I have visited the different reservations and at each Council I held with the Indians their one complaint was \"these boys\", unnecessarily, or as they put it unjustly detained.\n\nThe Bands being small, they are nearly all related in one way or another, and this being the case it creates a general feeling of sympathy among them, and I also find that it is having a very bad effect on getting the other boys back to school, the parents fearing that if their boys go back, we are liable to send them away to prison, and in this state of mind it is no easy task for Mr. F.S. Ryckman and myself to persuade them that under the Reverend Father Smith, they will be well cared for.\n\nUnder separate cover I am mailing you today two bills from the Vancouver General Hospital. Both boys seems to be affected with Tuberculosis, and would be much better at home.\n\nWhile we are anxious that the ends of Justice be met, we must take into consideration the undeveloped and uneducated mind of the older Indians, remembering that they are human, but still in a state of semi-civilization.\n\nNow, my one object with them is to bring about harmony in this disturbed Agency. If you cannot see your way clear to bring them back and place them in Father Smith's care I sincerely hope\nyou may be able to consider Jim Isaac and Damian Isaac, the two boys in the Hospital, for I truly fear the result, should either of these boys die while there.\n\nJoe Dominic and Louis Paul have not been bad boys, and I also trust you will consider their release.\n\nI had a conversation this morning with His Honour Judge Thompson this morning, re Basil Andrew, eighteen years of age, now serving in Okhalla. The Judge seemed to think that the boy had not been sufficiently punished at the present time, but that he would be willing a little later on to consider his release. I spoke to him of the younger boys in the Reformatory, and he told me that he would be very pleased to see them taken out and put under the Reverend Father Smith's care.\n\nI sincerely hope, Sir, that you will consider this letter in the spirit that it is meant. While its meaning and intent differs from that of the late Agent, the Reverend Father Smith is in accordance and feels sure that he could bring about a better result in the School.\n\nI might say that I am paying special attention to the School, and will endeavor to make the older boys more contented, and do not anticipate any trouble with them this term.\n\nThis is respectfully submitted, Sir.\n\nE.H.Small,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa, Sept. 9, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Small:\n\nYour letter of the first instant, with reference to the boys of the Kootenay Indian Residential School who are now serving terms at New Westminster, has been brought to my attention. The records of Bagil Andrew, Pierre Jacob, Casimir Joseph, Alvin Mike and Skookum Joe are such that I consider they should be kept in the reform school. Further, Daniel Isaac and Jimmie Isaac, who are now in the Vancouver Hospital, are no doubt receiving the best possible care.\n\nThe cases of Louis Paul and Joe Dominic are somewhat different. They are young boys and are not altogether incorrigible. I will await your further report, however, before taking steps leading towards their parole.\n\nIf you and the Rev. Principal concur in this action, please let me know without delay. I should like to have also a report on the health of the two boys in hospital.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

F. Gallagher, Esq.,\nActing Chief of Remission Branch,\nDepartment of Justice,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nThe Reverend Father Smith, the Departmental Principal, as I understand it, of the St. Eugene Mission Industrial School called on me this morning, complaining that he has not got the power that is invested in other Principals in schools at Kamloops and different places in the Province.\n\nHe complains that he is not in a position to post the rules and teaching hours of the school that I have asked the teachers to carry out. Heretofore teaching hours in the school excepting junior classes have only been in the morning, no afternoon classes. The Indians complain that there is too much work and not enough study in the school, and the children are not being taught as they should be.\n\nI have tried to reason this matter out with the different teachers, but find that there is an undercurrent working in the school, and there is no harmony between teachers and Principal. This is working a hardship on all concerned. I find it a very hard task to get the children back to the school after the holidays. We have at present only about fifty-six, in the school where we should have at least one hundred.\n\nConstable Ryckman has been working almost continuously since the first of September to try and get the children in, but the Indians block him on pretty nearly every occasion. It seems that they have been in the habit of keeping the children out of the School until they were from nine to ten years of age, and no person has objected, but I have instructed Constable Ryckman that he is to have all children physically fit between the ages of seven and fifteen years brought into the school.\n\nI visited Creston, and the Lower Kootenay\nSecretary,\n\nReservation last week and found that some eight or nine children had been taken with their parents across the line to Bonners Ferry, and I was unable of course to get them for School.\n\nI would be glad if you would send me rules and regulations governing this school, as to teaching hours, recreation hours and hours for industrial work.\n\nIt only seems reasonable to me that these children should be taught in the afternoons, instead of having all afternoon for recreation, work and play.\n\nI am sorry to trouble you with this, but there seems no way that I can amicably settle the matter unless Butten Smith is given full charge of the school, and the rules laid down by him must be followed up.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. H. Small,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa, Sept. 24, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to general conditions at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. Please assure the Rev. Father Smith, the Principal, that he is responsible for every phase of the activity at this institution. The duties of the Sisters and other members of the staff are under his supervision. His Grace the Archbishop of Vancouver appointed Rev. Father Smith, at our request, and the Mother General of the Providence Mother House, Montreal, concurred in the action. It was understood that the Principal would have the general supervision of the activity of the school. I should be pleased to have a report at a later date, if the staff fail to cooperate with the Principal.\n\nPlease instruct the Rev. Principal and Sisters that the Department expects the pupils to have an academic and vocational training. The general scheme is one half day in the classroom and one half day in one of the departments with, of course, recreational periods. In practice, it is found advisable to have the junior pupils in the classroom both morning and afternoon. Half of the older pupils should be in the classroom in the morning and the other half in one of the departments. In the afternoon the exercises for the older pupils should be reversed. Saturday morning the pupils should have vocational training - the afternoon to be devoted to supervised recreation. This programme has been followed with success at other Indian residential schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. H.

The Reverend Principal Smith and myself held a meeting with the Indians Sunday at St. Eugene School.\n\nThe enclosed Petition was signed by all the Indians present, some thirty-four. All seem to be in very good spirits, and wish us success in obtaining the release of all the boys if possible.\n\nBoth Father Smith and myself feel that there should be no delay in the release of Louis Paul and Joseph Dominac, as they are young boys and would certainly be better under the care of the present Principal. In the cases of Damien Isaac and Jim Isaac, who are at present in the Vancouver General Hospital, I am unable to give you the Doctor's report as to their condition at the present time, although their last account was that they were not progressing very favorably, and both remaining in Hospital.\n\nAs I pointed out to you in my letter of recent date that I fear very much the effect that it would have upon the Indians if either of these two boys should die while there, and would strongly advise that they be released and brought back. In their present condition they cannot be bad boys, and Father Smith will see that their parole is carefully protected.\n\nI may say that at the meeting held in the School yesterday the Indians agreed, to a man, to help us in every way possible to see that these boys obey the rules of the school, and Father Smith as Principal. This will no doubt assist greatly if you will take up the parole of all the boys.\nIn order to save correspondence in connection with this matter, and to show you that the Reverend Principal concurs in this action I will have Father Smith sign this Petition along with myself.\n\nThanking you kindly for your attention in this matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

To meet their requests Mr. Small and I made out a programme, (a copy of which is enclosed), which was read to the Indians at a meeting held yesterday at the Mission. The Indians were more than pleased when they realized that Mr. Small and myself intend doing our best for the advancement of their children.\n\nNow, Mr. Scott, under present arrangements I am unable to carry out my intentions. For example, our programme mentions that no punishment is to be given without the approval of the Principal, this was told to the Indians yesterday, but this morning this rule was entirely ignored. Now I am sorry to be obliged to say that one of the staff told me that my place was in my office.\n\nI don't seek for my own personal satisfaction the control of the grant and the entire supervision of the school, but I maintain that the above supervision must reside in the lawful authority if we are to have harmony.\n\nTo me, it seems that I am not recognized as Principal in full charge. As long as this condition exists it will be impossible to conduct this school according to our policy enclosed.\n\nNow, Mr. Scott, if you think well to have me replaced by another or if you wish to give the Principalship back to the Sisters, I shall be only too willing to resign, but if you insist on me retaining the position, then I shall ask you to arrange to have the school conducted on the same lines as the one in Kamloops, i.e., the Principal to have full charge.\n\nIf the above is adhered to, then the Principal will be in a position to dismiss any whom he thinks not suitable.\n\nI may add that if I had my choice English teachers would be engaged in conducting this school.\n\nIn conclusion, if you think it better for the sake of peace and for all concerned for me to hand in my resignation I shall willingly do so.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nDuncan Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6452, file 884-1, part 2)\nOttawa, Sept. 29, 1924.\n\nReverend and dear Sir:\n\nI have received your letter of the 21st instant and I note, with regret, that there is difficulty in the management of the Kootenay Indian Residential School. A few days ago, Mr. Indian Agent Small informed the Department that there existed certain friction and he was assured that the responsibility for every phase of the activity of the school rested in you, as principal. The duties of the Sisters and other members of the staff are under your supervision. His Grace the Archbishop of Vancouver appointed you, at our request, and the Mother General of the Providence Mother House, Montreal, concurred in the action.\n\nThe Department suggested to Mr. Small that the half-day system be followed; but I have examined the daily time table that you enclosed and it will prove equally as satisfactory.\n\nThe per capita grant is being paid to you and the funds may be administered as you consider in the best interests of the institution. You may engage or dismiss members of the staff and you are quite within your rights if you wish to supervise all punishment of pupils.\n\nIf you are not satisfied with the language qualifications of the Sisters in the classrooms, please communicate with His Grace the Archbishop of Vancouver and secure his active assistance in the matter of making a change. I advise cooperation with His Grace if the incumbency of any member of a religious community is in question.\n\nThe Department will assist you in any action which will make the Kootenay Indian Residential School a more useful factor in the lives of the Indian children of the community.\n\nA copy of this letter is being directed to Mr. Indian Agent Small.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

These two Indian boys are 16 and 18 years of age and were committed to the Oakalla Prison Farm in April and October last, respectively. They were formerly pupils at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, Cranbrook, B.C. I have learned that they are at present in the Vancouver General Hospital, suffering with tuberculosis and that it might have a serious effect upon the Indian community if they should die while serving sentences. I should be grateful if you would take steps leading towards the parole of Jim and Damien Isaac to their homes.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nM.F. Gallagher, Esq.,\nActing Chief of Remission Branch,\nDepartment of Justice,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 2, 1924.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to the case of two 13 year old Indian boys, formerly pupils of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, who were in April last sentenced to the British Columbia Provincial Reformatory. Louis Paul received a sentence of 4 years and Joe Dominac was committed for 2 years. These lads were not the ring-leaders of the group that caused trouble at the Indian school in question at that time and should, I believe, be paroled to the care of the Rev. Principal. They are of tender years and can, no doubt, be managed without further difficulty. The Indian Agent at Cranbrook, the Rev. Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School and Indians of the locality have petitioned that Louis Paul and Joe Dominac be released from the Provincial Reformatory and returned to school. The Indian parents have agreed to assist our representative and the school management with the preservation of discipline at the institution. I should be grateful if you would take the necessary steps to have the two boys returned to the Indian school at Cranbrook.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nM. F. Gallagher, Esq.,\nActing Chief of Remission Branch,\nDepartment of Justice,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 2, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Small:\n\nI have the letter of the 22nd ultimo, which was signed by the Rev. Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School and yourself and which referred to the parole of certain former pupils of the school who are now serving sentences. I have noted your recommendation and the petition signed by certain Indians of the agency and I have to inform you that I am taking steps leading towards the parole to their homes of Damien and Jim Isaac, who were sentenced to the Oakalla Prison Farm, but who are now in Vancouver General Hospital. Because of the age of these two lads, I believe they should not be returned to the Kootenay Indian Residential School.

He was sent to the Vancouver General Hospital on the 30th of June for treatment for diseased glands of the neck known as cervical adenitis of tubercular origin. He is not progressing satisfactorily.\n\nJim Isaac, aged 16 years, was sentenced to Oakalla for two years less one day as from April 15th, 1923. He was sent to the Vancouver General Hospital June 15th, 1924, for treatment for diseased glands of the neck, secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis. He is not doing well.\n\nThe low altitude, dampness, confinement and discipline with the prison food make their tubercular condition much worse. The longer they are kept here the worse their condition will become. I would therefore recommend their return to their homes as soon as it can be arranged.\n\nThe Indian boys, nominally prisoners, are really free. When the weather is fine they go out on the hospital grounds alone. There is no police surveillance at all. They are quiet and well behaved here and I feel confident they would conduct themselves properly if allowed to go home.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd) T.A. Wilson, M.D.\nM.O.

Wilson, of the Department at Vancouver, and also to advise that I have a letter from the Superintendent of Oakalla dated October 10th, in which he tells me that Jim Isaac has been released under ticket of leave licence.\n\nI have wired Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn and asked him to arrange for transportation for this boy back here, as you will see by Dr. Wilson's letter that we should lose no time in getting them both back home.\n\nI have the honour to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

In reply I should say that His Excellency the Governor General was, on the 10th of this month pleased to order that the said Jim Isaac be released under the restraint of a Ticket of Leave and allowed to return to his home.

Emond, Esq.,\nDept. of the Secretary of State,\nOttawa, Ont.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the Kootenay Residential School, October 10th and 11, 1924.\n\nClass-room Work.\n\nAll the teachers on the staff have English. Those in the classrooms speak good English. The standard of education is low. The pronunciation of words is not clear and distinct by the pupils. The teacher of the senior pupils is not familiar with the text books. There is a lack of thoroughness. I held a conference with the acting principal and the school teachers. There should be at least one Normal trained teacher on the staff. The standard cannot be raised in any other way.\n\nGeneral Remarks.\n\nFor two years there has been more or less discord among the staff. However following the appointment of the Rev. Father J. M. Smith the bickering increased. There was an entire lack of harmony. Mr Agent Small did what he could to bring about a reconciliation, but had little success. Father Smith was recalled by the Bishop.\n\nAt the time of my visit the Sisters seemed to be working together and the pupils were contented. Conditions will not be normal till a strong efficient man is found who can bring about harmony.\n\nR. H. Cairns, Insp.\nI beg to report that Jim Isaac and Damien Isaac have both arrived home from Okanagan Prison Farm.\n\nJim Isaac is in very poor health, but I have Dr. Coy's report today saying that he is improving. On arrival, I immediately sent him to the Shuswap Reservation where his mother will take care of him, but I fear his chances for recovery are very small.\n\nDamien Isaac is in much better health, and he called today at the Office, and I can see a decided change in him.\n\nI had a conversation a couple days ago with His Honour Judge Thompson with regard to Leslie Paul and Dominique, the two younger boys in the Reformatory. The Judge told me he would make a favorable report for the return to the school here of these boys. It seems their terms were forced upon His Honor by him threatening the Indians that he would not allow any more boys out on suspended sentence, unfortunately these two boys were the first to come before him, and the Judge after making the declaration had no other alternative except to carry out his threat. He, however, will be pleased to see these two boys put into the school again.\n\nI have the honour to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.H. Small,\nIndian Agent.\n\nHonour C. Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa, November 12, 1924.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to refer to my letters of the 2nd and 7th ultimo, relative to Louis Paul and Joe Dominac, two 13-year old Indian boys, formerly pupils of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, who are confined in the New Westminster Reformatory. I have now to inform you that Mr. Indian Agent Small, of Cranbrook, had a chat with Judge Thompson, who sentenced the boys and who promised to recommend their return to the Indian school. It appears that the Judge, previous to the conviction, had informed Indian parents he would not allow suspended sentence in future; and when Louis Paul and Joe Dominac came before him, he had no alternative but to send them to reformatory. I shall be grateful if you can arrange to have them returned to the Kootenay Indian Residential School, at Cranbrook, B. C.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

I have again made representations to the Department of Justice and I trust that these lads will be returned to the Kootenay Indian Residential School in the near future. When I learn what action is being taken, I shall have a further communication for you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nE. H. Small, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B. C.\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBritish Columbia,\nKamloops, B.C., Oct. 29, 1924.\n\nContinuation of Report, Kootenay Agency,\nof September 13, 1923.\n\nThere seems to have been considerable trouble at the School, owing to the action of the Bishop in placing a Principal unsuited to the position over the sisters. It seems he was the hired man there before ordination, and it does not seem to have been a very diplomatic move. However, he has been removed and I hope the new appointment will be more suitable.\n\nI am glad to say that there is less complaint than there used to be over the question of food, but Mr. Small, the agent, tells me that there is still considerable difficulty in getting children back from their holidays.\n\nIn connection with this matter, I have to draw your attention to the fact that the shortness of the summer holidays is a very general complaint amongst all the Indians in my Inspectorate. I, myself, in company with some of the Principals think that they should be lengthened to six weeks, but I will write you further in this matter.\n\nI am very pleased to report that the manual training classes for the boys are being very successful at this school, and I can only further urge their adoption at other schools. I myself think that these should be insisted upon by the Department.\n\nGeo. S.

Ditchburn, Esq.,\nCommissioner, Indian Affairs,\n1220 Government St.,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn April 2nd, 1924, an Indian boy named Louis Paul, age 14, was committed by Judge G.H. Thompson, Cranbrook, to the Industrial School for a term of 4 years on a charge of theft. At the same time another Indian boy named Joe Dominic, age 14, was committed here on a similar charge for two years. Both these boys belonged at that time to St. Eugene Mission near Cranbrook, and it appears that certain influences have been working on their behalf with the result that yesterday I received from the Under-secretary of State instructions to release these boys on condition that they return to the Kootenay Indian Residential School and should they show insubordination again, to return to finish their sentence.\n\nYou will readily understand that such things happening is not good for the discipline of a school of this kind as it looks as if an Indian boy has greater privileges than the white boy and it appears to me as if those that laid the complaint in the first place either did it with a view to scoring the boys or in order that they get free of a responsibility for the time being.\n\nWe have at present the following boys from the same school:\n\n- Joe Skockum, Age 12, committed Apr. 2, 1924\n- Joseph Casimir #15, Oct. 26, 1923,\n- Pierre Jacob #15\n- Alban Mike #12,\n\nThese boys are naturally resentful that the first named should be granted parole and they compelled to remain here.\n\nI would respectfully suggest that the attention of the authorities be drawn to such a condition and ask them to be good enough to treat all alike and in future for no Indian boy to be sent here if they are of the opinion that all they require is about 6 months' attention, as the usual procedure in committing boys to this Institution is for a term of not less than two years.\n\nI would also respectfully draw your attention to the fact that in every case we expect the parent or guardian to provide clothing and transportation back for their boys upon their discharge and would be glad if you would notify the St. Eugene authorities to arrange for clothing for Louis Paul and Joe Dominic and give instructions regarding how these boys are to be returned. Upon receipt of this information I shall carry out the instructions of the Under-secretary of State.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(SGD) David B. Brankin,\nSupt.

Father Welch, O.M.I., with reference to the unsatisfactory state of affairs there, etc., already reported in full by me to you. He informs me that he has been down there and gone fully into the matter, with the result that he is fully in agreement with me, and has undertaken and started the necessary reforms.\n\nHe tells me that the present principal, the Rev. Father Tedrow, is being shifted, and that he is appointing an experienced principal with many years' experience of Indian schools, in his place. He is to have complete control. He is also appointing a father and missionary amongst the Indians, who will do the outside work and cooperate with the Principal in spreading propaganda amongst the parents and procuring the children for the school. They are also going to get a good man to run the farm, which Father Welch distinctly tells me is to be run for the benefit of the school, first and foremost.\n\nHaving in view the neglect of the said farm, he informs me that he will tell the Sisters that they will probably have to lose money until they have got the farm on a productive basis, and understand thoroughly what the children must be properly fed, even though there is a loss for some months. I think, therefore, that every endeavour will be made to put things right, and that it is understood that the Department of Indian Affairs expects cooperation on the part of the schools by their being beyond suspicion in matters of feeding, clothing, etc.\n\nFather Welch informed me that they are trying to carry out the wishes of the doctors and ourselves in supplying plenty of milk, but that it had been found that the school cows were very poor scrub stock, and not worth their feed. I know that and have already pointed it out. He informs me that he has appealed to you for assistance in replacing this stock with good cows and begged me to solicit the sympathy and aid of the Department.\n\nI am, therefore, writing in accordance with his request, and think that, as apparently, an endeavour is being made to straighten things out that the request is worthy of consideration.

Father Welsh is more or less self-explanatory.\n\nPrivately I might say that things are even worse than they appear in the letter, and undoubtedly the children are not properly fed. I am also of the opinion that Father Tedrow has no authority over the Indians, who frankly stated to me that he is no man. The only way I could see out of the difficulty was to lay the matter openly before the head of the Fathers, and ask him to solve it, making a few suggestions. The Department has, through Mr. Small, Helmsing and myself, done everything to persuade the Indians that all was well at the school, even going so far in the past as to use force. However, it seems to have been useless, and the Indians have apparently reached the \"flat refusal and take the consequences\" stage, and as they seem to have some grounds for complaint, I am of the opinion that it is up to the Missionaries to get out for themselves, and eradicate the idea, we of course, helping all we can.\n\nI hope my actions in this matter meet with your approval, and shall be much obliged if you could give me instructions and advice for future guidance. I beg to enclose a copy of Mr. Small's last letter to me, and in connection with same, beg to say that, in my opinion, he had done all he could, to assist and is now greatly in want of advice, as I am, as to what move to make over these runaway boys.\n\nYou will note I have already pointed out to the Department in 1923, the poor food and unsatisfactory state of the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Geo. S. Pragnell)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nW.E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVICTORIA, B.C.\nDear Father Welsh:\n\nAfter having had a long talk with Father Tedrow, of St. Eugene Mission School, and receiving his assurance that you would not consider that I am interfering in private matters by writing you, I felt that it was only fair and right to let you have all the information available to me upon matters in connection with the School. I know that perhaps, some of my suggestions and remarks may not be exactly the business of the Department, except insofar as I interpret the duties of the Department officials to assist the Missionaries in their endeavours to educate the young Indian children. Strictly speaking, perhaps you might consider that I ought to simply report when things are unsatisfactory, and leave it at that, but this course of procedure does not seem very helpful to either side.\n\nI was making my usual inspection visit of that Agency, coming in via Golden, and when attending a meeting of the Indians at the Columbia-Kootenay Reserve, I found that there were six runaway boys there. I enquired of the Agent, Mr. Small, and he informed me that this made twelve boys who had run away since the holidays, and that he was receiving endless complaints from the Indian parents, and was having endless difficulty in getting the children to school. In other words, there seemed to be a strong antipathy against the school throughout the Agency.\n\nAs you doubtless know, this is no new matter, nor is the fact of the runaways, and in 1923, I had to report the state of affairs to the Department, and go fully and frankly into the matter with the Mother Superior, informing her of exactly what the Indians had complained to me about. The complaints then, in general, were as follows:\n\n1. The smaller boys too heavily worked;\n2. Insufficient winter clothing;\n3. Insufficient variable food;\n4. The fact of much sickness in the school;\n5. Abuse of their position by the hired help. Some of these things were rectified, and some, apparently were unfounded, and I believe, from what I hear that for a time there was not so much trouble.\n\nHowever, on my visit this time, the complaints seem to have all returned even much more strongly expressed than before, accompanied with flat refusals to send the children, and statements that they, the Indians, would sooner go to prison than send their children to that school. This, as you can see, puts the Indian Department in a difficult position, as if force is used, and there is any ground for the complaints, it would, as you see, be readily taken up by those not well disposed towards the Missionaries. The only thing that I could see to do was to have the boys up in front of all the Indians and question them one by one as to their reasons for running away. This proposal met with the wishes of the Indians as well. In company with Mr. Small and an Indian interpreter, I therefore proceeded to do this. Their complaints when sifted down, were as follows:\n\n1. Father Tedrow whipped them too much, various boys stated, from once during the term to once a day.\n2. That he carried a revolver about in his pocket when whipping them, this was unanimously stated. One boy said it had been pointed at him.\n\nVery Rev. John Welsh, O.M.I.,\nProvincial of the Oblates,\nNEW WESTMINSTER, B.C.\n3. That they did not get sufficient food. In answer to my question they stated that they got very little milk, only in their tea or coffee, never alone; no eggs except at Easter; little meat and that sometimes bad; no oatmeal porridge; no jam; little fruit with the exception of crabapples; little butter; few fresh vegetables, and far too many potatoes. This was unanimous by all the boys.\n\n4. That the hired men, particularly one, threatened them.\n\n5. That they had to get up at 5:00 A.M. winter and summer.\n\n6. The parents stated that they were insufficiently clothed and got sick at the school.\n\n7. That the children learned nothing practical in the farming line.\n\nThe above was the gist of their complaints without mentioning names, etc., which I reported fully to Father Tedrow.\n\nI then questioned one of the girls whom Mr. Small said was a good girl. She had no complaints at all and was happy, with the exception of not sufficient food.\n\nAs soon as I reached Cranbrook, I went straight to the School and telegraphed for Father Tedrow who was away.\n\nIn company with Mr. Small, I informed the Mother Superior of the complaints that pertained to the food, etc., but, of course, did not tell her what the boys had said of Father Tedrow, because I did not believe it, and it was his own private business. I questioned her and the sister who was cook. I found that the children were right when they stated that they had insufficient milk, also regarding the non-feeding of eggs. I found that they had only had green corn ten times throughout the season, and few green vegetables. I found that they were going to have for supper principally potatoes and a little stew for gravy left over from midday, with crabapple stew for dessert. From the taste made on the table, I found that in the larder was most distinctly bad and smell horribly, and I should judge not fit for human consumption, though the Sisters informed me that they ate it. I also found the winter supply of bottled fruits very small, not enough I should estimate, for a month's consumption. The Sister Superior informed me that they had in all 15 cows, this is to my mind, not enough, and I suggested that they get more, and more chickens.\n\nLater, I had two long talks with Father Tedrow and with regard to the accusation of whipping and revolver work, he satisfied me that these accusations were false, as he readily believed them to be from the start. I was perfectly open with him. We then went into other matters, and Father Tedrow himself said that the hired help was not satisfactory, and that he had already written you stating that the children should have, at least, a pint of milk per diem each. He, however pointed out, that he was in somewhat of an ambiguous position at the school, which fact I had already, from observation, gathered. He informed me that the school was $800.00 behind last year.\n\nAfter talking matters over with him, I could only come to one conclusion, and that was that the feeding of the children was the crux of the whole matter, and that, if that was rectified, the boys would be more contented, and there would be less sickness.\nI then suggested to Father Tedrow that Mr. Small take him up to the Columbia-Kootenay reserve as soon as possible, and he could thresh matters out at a meeting which Mr. Small need not attend unless he was asked in by Father Tedrow. I wanted him to have it out with the children in the presence of the parents, without any outside influence or interference. This, the Father agreed, was the most sensible course, and he said he would go. We then talked over how we were to get round the food question without the school getting into debt. My opinions to him, which he mostly agreed with, were as follows:\n\n1. The dual running of the school was with the best intentions between parties, not all satisfactory or workable.\n\n2. That the school would never be a success until the farm was part and parcel of it, either from the financial, feeding or training point of view. It was absolutely necessary that a farm of about 100 acres be run entirely for the benefit of the said school, and not be a separate affair, as in that case food had to be bought at too great a cost, or dangerous cutting down of quantity and quality would result.\n\n3. That a Missionary help outside was required as the Principal would require all his time to be devoted to the school.\n\n4. That each boy be given a small plot of land to cultivate, and that I would recommend to the Department that a small annual prize be given, and a children's fair held in which the exhibits could be judged.\n\n5. That the outside help could be better supervised if the farm and school were one, both under the control of the Principal.\n\nI had in the meanwhile suggested to the Mother Superior, that in order to combat the Indian prejudice about the food, that she supply Mr. Small occasionally with a list of the meals they had given during certain weeks, and that he should often inspect the kitchen. To this she was quite agreeable.\n\nI also pointed out to both herself and Father Tedrow that we had somehow to overcome the prejudice of the Indians in the matter, even though they might be unfounded in most cases, as there is no getting away from the fact that this antipathy is there very strongly, and that something must be wrong, as I did not meet with the same trouble elsewhere.\n\nSince my return here, I have heard from Mr. Small that Father Tedrow had a very lengthy meeting with the Indians on the Reserve. Mr. Small understands that the boys admitted they lied about the revolver and whippings. He informs me, however, that neither he nor Father Tedrow were successful in getting the parents to allow the return of their children, though two promised to do so, by the last November. If we force them, they will only run away again, and spread the prejudice and tales.\n\nI should like your advice on the matter. We can, of course, force them, if you think it necessary, but I myself, am inclined to think that we should move carefully, and that persuasion and a betterment of conditions should take place first.\n\nI daresay, by this time, you have heard from Father Tedrow. I can only assure you as before that this letter is meant, not as a criticism, but as a guide, and that if you should wish to consult me or have more particulars, I am at your service.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Geo.

That I shall succeed I have every confidence. It may take a few weeks, and in the meantime I must ask the Department to be patient with us.\n\nAs you have truly remarked the food questions and the dual control are at the root of the present unrest.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Sgd) J. Welch, O.M.I.\nDear Sir:\n\nActing under instructions from you I accompanied the Reverend Father Tedrow to the Columbia Kootenay Reservation, re the boys who ran away from School.\n\nFather Tedrow spent the night with the Indians on the Reserve, and although I did not attend I understand he held a very lengthy meeting with them.\n\nWhen I called for him the next morning, the Father or myself was unable to get any of the boys to return with us to the school. Dominac and Eneas Fisher, however promised me that their two boys would return on the 1st November.\n\nI am sorry to say that they all seem to have a dislike for the Reverend Father Tedrow. Little Jim and his wife told me that they would not allow their boy to go back to the school while Father Tedrow was the Principal. This demand is unreasonable, as the boys acknowledged I understand, to Father Tedrow that they had lied both about the whipping and the revolver.\n\nThe food in the school is undoubtedly poor, and as you instructed I will in future check it up very closely. I do not know what move to make in connection with getting these boys back. I am afraid under the present conditions that if we force them to come, they will only run away again, as you understand it would be impossible for the teachers to keep them if they make up their minds to run away. I will appreciate very much your advice in the matter, and assure you that I will carry out any instructions you give me re their return.\n\nI would advise consulting the Reverend Father Welsh in the matter, and see if he can make any suggestions, whereby we can satisfy the Indians.\n\nI am sorry to tell you that we have a great deal of sickness in the Agency. I find this morning some ten Indians in the St. Eugene Hospital, all apparently suffering from a form of Flu or Pneumonia.\n\nI will write you further in connection with this matter in a few days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(E.H.

The report referred to by me in my communication upon the matter, of the 18th ultimo, was a full report on affairs as found by me on my last visit to the Kootenay, and reported by me in full to Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn, in accordance with your expressed wishes, that all reports and recommendations should go through Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn. I concluded, therefore, that if Mr. Ditchburn saw fit, my report, or an epitome of the same would, in the natural course of events, be forwarded to you.\n\nMr. Ditchburn did not write to me upon receipt of my report, but later on, I met him at Victoria, and he approved of my actions. I naturally, therefore, never thought of asking him whether the matter had been reported to you or not.\n\nAt the moment, I do not know whether Mr. Ditchburn is at his office or not, as we heard up here, a rumor that he had been very ill. I wrote to him five or six days ago, asking after his health, and have received no answer yet.\n\nI therefor thought that it would clear matters up if I send you a full copy of my letters to Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn and reports upon the subject, which I beg to enclose herewith. I hope from these letters and reports that you will be able to gather what has taken place, and as you will see in mine of December 18th, already referred to, it looks as though an attempt is being made to straighten matters out.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Geo.

Scott\n\n(Chge. Dept. of Indian Affairs)\nDear Sir,\n\nJoseph Dominic and Louis Paul, pupils of the Kootenay Residential School after having been sent back to school from Coquitlam Reformatory, on parole, have not done very well. Joseph Dominic ran away twice; he and Louis Paul have shown insubordination right along and been cause of trouble among the boys.\n\nSeveral times I have called you to lecture them. Brought before Judge Thompson, they were warned and given one month to change their ways and I have to report on them by the first of April, they will have to behave or go back to Coquitlam. Louis Paul has just been sent home on sick leave having been found physically unfit for school at the present.\n\nJoseph Dominic seems to have better disposition, if he gets unruly again, I will suggest his transfer to the Kamloops R.C. School; I heard that Rev. Fr. McGuire has a farm for the older boys; I will prefer see the boy going there for a few months than to go back to the Reformatory.\n\nI am willing to keep him as long as he behaves, he has such a bad influence on the younger boys.\n\nI remain, Dear Sir,\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) Rev. M. Lepine,\nPrincipal.\nKootenay Residential School,\nMarch 4 1926.\n\nH. H. Small,\nIndian Agent,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI want you to come to the School with the Police to arrest Joseph Dominic and Louis Paul and send them back to Coquitlan.\n\nLouis Paul has been getting worse and worse and has a bad influence on the other boys but Joseph Dominic has also a bad influence, though he is showing a good front. I know, as leader he is doing much harm, and he is the instigator of this running away.\n\nI had heard that Joseph was telling everybody that he was to leave the school on the 4th April, and I had told the girls only that everyone, even of age will have to stay until the 1st July, so I called Joseph to my room, and told him kindly and quietly what I had heard him saying, and to make his own stay till the 1st July, and not do anything rash because he knew the consequence. This was Monday afternoon, and the sneak he is, the worst I have ever met yet did not run away himself, but push the smaller boys.\n\nI have suffered since I am here from these two boys, and they have done lots of harm to the others, and on the sly, but I have been watching them and I have enough now.\n\nIf you do not bring the police, I do not want you to see them or talk to them, it will do more harm, they are past that stage of talking to them. We have done that times and times again.\n\nAs I was saying to the Sister Superior, it is either them or myself who will leave the school, I have been more than patient. As long as these two boys are in school there will be trouble.\n\nSo please kindly have this done today. They think they are safe keeping in the limits, but they cannot hide everything and all the time, I know them now. They must go for the good of the others, we have been too good to them, they must not have any communication whatever with the other boys after they are arrested.\n\nThe last news last night about the runaways were they were heading for Windermere, they are the same leaders who were arrested at Canal Flat last Fall, and let go. I do want any fooling this time, and I want them to be caught before they disband. Here are their names. Benjamin Frances, and\nPatrick Abel, St. Mary's, Gabriel Alb\u00e1n, Phillip Pierre, Isador Michel, Moses Jim of Columbia Lake.\n\nPlease kindly notify the Police and have the thing done quickly.\n\nI remain, dear Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) The Rev. M. Lepine,\nPrincipal.\nAttention of Hon. Duncan Scott.\n\nRe-- Joseph Dominic & Louis Paul\nmy telegram to Col. Pragnell\nMarch 4th, your telegram to me\nMarch 5th.\n\nSeveral times since the Rev. Father Lepine has taken charge of the school, he has phoned me that the above boys were making trouble in the School. On each occasion I have gone to the School, and talked to them, each time they have promised me that they would behave.\n\nOn March the 3rd, the Rev. Principal reported that six small boys had run away. I had Constable Ryckman and several of the Indians go in search of them. They were located and returned to the School on March 4th.\n\nThat evening the Principal sent a messenger to me with the enclosed copy letter of that date, hence my wire to Col. Pragnell.\n\nOn morning of March 5th the Reverend Principal brought the boys before His Honor Judge Thompson. The Judge gave them a very impressive talking to, and allowed them until April 1st at the School. If that time the Principal reports insubordination on their part, he will have them again committed to the Reformatory.\n\nOn Sunday, March the 7th Chief Adrian of the St. Mary's Band called a meeting at the School. I met him, with the principal, the Sister Superior, and about fifty Indians of the Band. The Indians did not have any complaint, except that the Rev. Father would not allow the boys brought into the meeting. This, may or may not have been good policy.\n\nComplaint was made to me that Louis Paul was sick, I had him brought into the room, and decided to have him examined by Dr. Green. This I did on Monday morning the 8th instant. The Dr. told me that he found him Tubular, and unfit to attend school. I accordingly sent him to his home on the Columbia Kootenay Reserve, with instructions to report to Dr. Coy on the 1st of each month.\nThe Secretary\n\nNow that the boys are parted, and the Reverend Principal has only Joseph Dominic to look after I would recommend that he be allowed to remain in the School, and that the Reverend Principal be asked by the Department to see that he maintains discipline.\n\nI have the honor, to be,\n\nSir.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, March 19, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Small:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, concerning discipline at the Kootenay Indian Residential School and with particular reference to Joe Dominic and Louis Paul. I note that the last named boy has been sent home because of ill health and that the Rev. Principal and yourself are hopeful that there will be no special difficulty in handling Joe Dominic. I have already spoken to the church authorities with reference to better conditions at this institution.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nE. H. Small, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B. C.\nmy dear Mr. Scott,-\n\nI have just received your kind letter and appreciate the fact that you have taken into consideration the statement I presented to you.\n\nI realize that you are handicapped, and that to adjust matters you would have to consult with the Principals of the Schools or with Rev. Father Welch.\n\nMy experience with Father Welch is that he is a very, good, kind man but he always follows the lines of least resistance. He would not help out in any way to settle our difficulties for he has more problems of his own than he can well handle, besides he leaves for Europe Sept. 4th and will be away for some months.\n\nMy suggestion would be to write you a letter along general lines, pointing out our situation without mentioning any particular school and asking for a definite settlement and an agreement which would be signed by the Provincial or Rev. Father Welch and the Provincial of the Marist Fathers, and then by the Provincial\u2014which in this case would be myself,\u2014of the houses in British Columbia.\n\nI will be in office here until 1929 and would like to have something down in a business-like way that would be the standard for them to accept or reject.\n\nI will send you this within a few days and you may approve or revise it as you think fit. This letter which I will write to you will be at your disposal to send copies to any or all of the foregoing men we have mentioned, as there will be nothing compromising or likely to cause ill-feeling.\n\nThanking you for your kindness and consideration,\n\nI am, dear Mr. Scott,\n\nYours very cordially,\n\nSister Mary Gabriel\nProvincial Superior\n\nMr. D.C.

Lepine, O.M.I. wishes to resign his position at St Eugene Residential School, Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nHe was overseas during the war and appears to suffer from shell-shock, and requests to be allowed to come to the Coast for the benefit of his health.\n\nTo succeed him as Principal, I would respectfully suggest Rev. A. Michels, O.M.I., a Father from France. He is strong and energetic. He knows the Kootenay well, and I consider him qualified to fill the position.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYours most faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6452, file 884-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDecember 6, 1927.\n\nDear Father Welch:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo and I note with regret Rev. Father Lepine's health is such that it is necessary to relieve him of his duties at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. With reference to a successor for this post, I should be grateful if you would make a further nomination. I realise it is difficult to secure principals for Indian residential schools, but I am satisfied that you can nominate a reverend gentleman whose services will be acceptable to the Department. I regret that the appointment of Rev. A. Michels, O.M.I., cannot be given favourable consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nVery Rev.

Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRoom 602, Holden Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Mr Scott:\n\nYou will be pleased to hear that St Eugene Residential School is giving in many ways the fullest satisfaction. Father Choinel makes an excellent Principal and is succeeding in a gratifying manner.\n\nRecently, I believe, he has drawn the attention of the Department to the need of better fire protection which, no doubt, will be attended to in due time.\n\nThere is one matter, however, to which the Principal has urgently pressed me to bring to your notice, namely the annual Government Grant. He regrets to have to say that it is insufficient to meet the needs of the School. When I saw him last he had not the returns for 1927, but here is a simple financial statement for the two previous years, including the Government Grant and revenue from the Farm:\n\n|       | RECEIPTS | EXPENSES |\n|-------|----------|----------|\n| 1925  | $17,238  | $14,397  |\n| 1926  | $17,859  | $15,128  |\n\nThese figures speak for themselves, and show that in spite of the greatest economy the expenses exceeded the receipts.\n\nI need not say more, but would respectfully request you to give this excellent and most deserving School, the same per capita Grant as you give to Kamloops and Mission.\n\nTrusting you will see your way to confer this favor,\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6452, file 884-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMarch 22, 1928.\n\nDear Father Welch:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to the financial condition of the Kootenay Indian Residential School. I regret to learn that there is a small deficit and I hope that, under Father Choinel's guidance, it may be wiped out.\n\nWith reference to the per capita grant, I wish to point out that, at the Kootenay School it is $170, which is the same as for the institutions at Kamloops and Mission.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Father Choisnel, the new principal for the first time. He was unfortunately in hospital having broken arm cranking his car. However, luckily, he was able to accompany me down to the school. I thoroughly inspected the building and found things greatly improved. Agriculture has been better attended to and improved. The children seem much happier and I think that under the new Principal and new Mother Superior further improvements will take place.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell.\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, August 23, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your report on the Kootenay agency, dated June 21st, which has reference to the provision of training in the care of young mothers and babies at the Kootenay and other Indian residential schools. I doubt the advisability of giving lessons to school girls in this connection, and I believe such training can best be given by field matrons and field nurses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

L. Choinel, O.M.I., asks to be relieved of the principalship of St. Eugene Residential School, Cranbrook, B.C. For the past few months he has been suffering from an accident and considers that a change of duties is advisable.\n\nTo replace him I beg to recommend Rev. Walter Cullinan, O.M.I., thirty years of age, and a Canadian citizen. Father Cullinan has been laboring among the Indians in this district for two years, and has done excellent work. He is strong and energetic, and I am satisfied that he will make a very reliable principal.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

C.\nKootenay Residential School  \nNovember 20th 1928\n\nDoctor Duncan Scott,  \nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg leave to submit that yesterday I was advised by Very Reverend Father J.W. Welch O.M.I., who presently deals with the Department of Indian Affairs in matters concerning Indian Schools, that I was to give my place as Principal of the Kootenay Residential School to some other man, and that he was to take up the question of a successor with yourself.\n\nWhat the real reasons of that change may be I do not know, unless it be the evident lack of cooperation with the Principal on the part of those who are imposed on him to do the work of the school.\n\nNow, Sir, I have always felt that the one who is responsible to the Department, ought to have the final say in matters of authority over the school, and that it is up to him to give at least general directions in matters of general welfare of the school; and that it will never work successfully to the advantage of the school to have someone responsible for another one who assumes all the authority.\n\nI have worked my very best to have an understanding on those matters, but my removal would tend to prove that my conduct is not approved of.\n\nI have not given my resignation as Principal, neither do I beg to tender it, and I will remain here until such time as another man comes in, unless you wire me to stay. (I say wire, because a letter might come too late)\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6452, file 834-1, part 2)\nHowever a wire from you to Mr. Indian Agent F Small, appointing another as Principal will be sufficient notice to me.\n\nWhat grieves me in that matter is that I do not know the real reason of the change which is demanded; I have been at the head of the Cariboo school for over two years, I have been also for a couple of years acting as Chaplain at the New-Westminster Penitentiary, and in every instance upon my leaving office I have received letters of regret from those immediately over me, and in the present instance I have not even a word of thanks.\n\nSo may I ask you, Sir, as a personal favor to let me know what reason was advanced for my removal. I am quite able to bear with it, even if untrue reasons have been given; knowing the real truth would hurt me less than no reason at all.\n\nI send the above in all confidence, craving for an answer from you, and allowing you to make use of this communication as you see fit.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYours respectfully\n\nMy address,\nCatholic Rectory\nCranbrook, B.C.\nNovember 28, 1928.\n\nDear Father Choinei:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to your supersession by the Reverend Walter Gullinan, O. M. I. You ask me to state the reasons for this change. In reply I wish to say that when the Provincial of an Order requests a new appointment, the Department generally concurs. If you wish to know the reasons which led to the Rev. Father Welsh's request that the Department approve of a change, you should write to him.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. L. Choinei, O. M. I.,\nKootenay Indian Residential School,\nCranbrook, B. C.\nHonorable Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent Gen.,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYou may have noticed by our Quarterly Returns that since September last five new pupils have enlisted on our School Register. Admission forms have been forwarded to the Department, but no payment has been done for them, since we have the \"grant\" for only 80 pupils.\n\nHaving appealed to your generosity for help, today any petition is a \"grant\" for those five pupils\u2014which would help greatly in the meeting of our numerous expenses.\n\nSometime ago I had the opportunity of meeting Sister Justina.\nShe assured me not to fear to call on your kindness, for she clasped it \"boundless.\" Such a counsel gives me every chance to believe that any request will receive a favorable answer.\n\nWe have heard of your visit to some Indian Schools in the North of Alberta, we sincerely hope that the pleasure will be ours during the year.\n\nI remain,\n\nVery respectfully & gratefully yours,\n\nSister Alphonsus,\nSuperior\n\nKootenay Residential School,\nCranbrook, March 25th, 1927.\nOttawa, April 5, 1929.\n\nReverend Sister:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 25th ultimo, which has reference to the pupilage at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. Parliament provides a grant for 80 pupils, and, before an increase can be given, it is necessary that the Department has an opportunity of arranging for the larger appropriation. Our Estimates for the fiscal year that began on the first instant were closed in December, and it will not be possible to secure an added grant for your school until a year from this month. If you find that you are in a position to maintain an average attendance in excess of 80, you might ask the Rev. Principal to write the Department in October or November, urging an increased appropriation for the new fiscal year. In this letter, the exact dimensions of the dormitories used by the pupils of the school should be indicated, as I am unable to find any record of the actual air space in these rooms at your school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It is not without regret for our sisters have worked so hard, made so many sacrifices at the beginning of the mission and have continued to devote themselves during thirty-nine years.\n\nWe will never forget the cordial relations we had with the Indian Department and we will specially remember your kindness towards us. So I wish to thank you very sincerely for all you have done to help us in our work. I profit of the occasion to express my deep appreciation for your kind interest in all our Indian Schools where the sisters are so happy to devote themselves.\n\nThere will be a few financial questions to be submitted to you.

The Very Reverend Sister Amarine, Mother General of the Sisters of Providence, left this with the Department and expressed the hope that something could be done to reimburse them for equipment they had purchased. Little encouragement was given.\n\nThe Mother General also referred to the sale of some of their land to the Department and there is a special memorandum on the -9 of the file in this connection.\nThe tubercular condition of the children at the School and some who are now in the villages appears admittedly as a serious indictment of past administration at this School. A deplorable condition exists here, in fact, a worse condition than I have seen in my twenty-three years' experience with the Indians. I found the school a veritable tubercular institution.\n\nMy information from Reverend Principal Patterson, Constable Ryckman and Agent Small is to the effect that up to November, 1929, the school was conducted by about eleven Reverend Sisters of Charity. These all left at that time. Now Reverend Principal Patterson, O.M.I., has been in charge with other workers; that during the regime of these Sisters it was their practice to sell most of the milk and eggs and other produce in order to augment maintenance funds, disposing of these products at a rate of about $350.00 a month; that the children were given skim milk and were poorly fed; that parents were forced to put their children in the School against the protests of parents, some of whom appealed to Dr. Coy, of Invermere, to give certificates of health to support their contention that their healthy children should not be sent to the Kootenay School to be contaminated by tubercular pupils known to be in the School; that children were kept in school in an overcrowded condition until they were pronounced near to die; that 50% of the pupils now in the School are in varying stages of tuberculosis; that with the exception of about two or three children the remainder are in a predisposed condition and easy contacts; that Dr. Green, medical officer, at Cranbrook, has averred and has told Dr. Stone, of the Department, that if the physically unfit were eliminated from the School on medical examination, the school would have to be closed; that the enrolment of pupils was 74, five of whom died in one year, eight were sent back to their reserves on sick leave with tuberculosis in too advanced condition to remain in school; that there are about 25 children in the villages of whom the majority are tubercular; that there are at present 64 children in the School, and that the maximum pupilage for this School is 94.\n\nI interviewed both Dr. Green, of Cranbrook, and Dr. Coy, of Invermere, both of whom stated the conditions to be serious at this School. Perhaps the medical reports of these doctors on file may give some details of conditions. If such reports are not on file, something...\nmust be wrong. For if the children are admitted as pupils in tubercular condition or are allowed to mingle with other healthy pupils in such a condition contrarily to the regulations of the Department, these responsible should be questioned regarding the matter.\n\nI have no reason to question the veracity of the representations made to me regarding the adverse conditions at this institution, both by the local Church representatives as well as by the Department's officials in the locality of the School and medical officers having to do with the pupils. But I would advise very strongly that if the conditions are as bad as I am led to believe they are, a medical survey should be made independently of the local medical officers without delay, in order that such facts may be given the Department as may not lead to any arguments. As a layman, I do not feel competent to qualify, as a result of a brief visit to the School, statements of men who have been there for years and have watched the problem more closely, but I do feel that a medical survey would be a safe and proper course to take. This recommendation is not based upon hearsay regarding the School, but upon conditions I saw for myself whilst at the institution. On the date of my visit, May 20th, 1930, there were 61 pupils, male and female, present as resident scholars. The Principal was distressed about the condition of the children who, he alleged, had undoubtedly been neglected in the past at the School. (No doubt the reports of the late Inspector R. H. Cairns (Indian schools for B.C.) would show to what extent the farm produce was disposed of here).\n\nThe children were being given cod liver oil with their meals. A nurse was in charge of them. One long table set apart from the others accommodated pupils whose tubercular condition had been pronounced more advanced than others; and the dishes of these pupils were gathered up after each meal and washed separately from the others to avoid contagion. The other accommodations at the School were open to the children collectively. The Principal told me that everything is being done that is now possible for these children and all efforts were being concentrated upon the health of the pupils, the institution being regarded as an educational sanatorium rather than strictly a residential School.\n\nIt is recommended that action be taken in the matter of a medical survey as soon as possible as it is possible that medical officers might recommend other suitable accommodations which may be found to be essential if this School is to be put into efficient use as an establishment for the proper treatment of tubercular Indian children.\n\nThe several matters reported on herein have been fully discussed with the School authorities and with our local officials, all of whom have endorsed verbally the representations made.\nThe observations of Reverend Provincial Grant, O.M.I., under this head must, regretfully, be read in the light of the preceding paragraphs of this report which qualify the assertions made in regard to the alleged malnutrition of the children of the Reserves.\n\nThe children must necessarily suffer to some extent on account of such conditions, added to the proverbial lack of the instinct of self-preservation which marks the progress of some Indian families. But this suffering does not appear to have been ameliorated to any great extent by the admitted lack of sustenance and attention given the pupils within the School, from a health standpoint, and it is therefore thought that the source of malnutrition may not be wholly traced to the Reserves.\nOttawa, July 8, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer further to your 15/5/17999 of the 16th ultimo, enclosing Mr. Assistant Commissioner Perry's report on the Kootenay Indian Residential School. The Director of Medical Services will arrange for a tuberculosis survey at this school and, at a later date, a decision regarding its future functions will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nEXTRACTS FROM DR. STORE'S REPORT\n\non\nKOOTENAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nPUPILS:\n\nThe children look particularly well nourished. Independent observers told me that the change in this respect in the last year is phenomenal. They appear really fond of the principal and staff. The absence of restraint and fear is most gratifying. There is practically no truancy now. They are well dressed, but I have seen cleaner looking clothes. Perhaps better laundry facilities would remedy this apparent defect. The oldest pupil, with one exception, is under 17 years old. I was told that there are no mental deficient among them and no chronic bed-wetters.\n\nThere ought to be 100 children of school age in the agency. There are 69 in the school and not more than 4 or 5 not in.\n\nTuberculosis:\n\nWhile present conditions are not as bad as anticipated, they are bad enough. Five pupils died of tuberculosis between Nov. 1929, and June, 1930 - none since - and none died after discharge and not accounted for above. Dr. A. S. Lamb, Provincial Travelling Diagnostician, has just completed a survey of the pupils - 10 - 12 have active tuberculosis and are potential dangers to the well. A further 10 or 12 are suspects but are not considered active at present nor dangerous to others. I should say that this latter group are more likely to improve than otherwise and may be left out of the calculation, unless they show fever or loss of weight.\n\nAfter looking over conditions from all angles and after exhaustive discussion with Dr. Lamb, the Principal and Matron, the Indian Agent (Hyckman) and the local Dr., (Green), I came to the following conclusions, which are concurred in by Dr. Lamb:\n\n1. That it would not be advisable to discharge these tuberculous pupils to their homes, from the standpoint of the pupils or the families.\n\n2. That there are facilities at the school and that the staff may be relied upon to provide reasonable effective measures for taking care of them at the school without turning it into a sanatorium or seriously disturbing its present arrangement.\n\n3. That it will require more effective medical oversight than has been furnished in the past. Dr. Lamb makes semi-annual visits to Cranbrook.\nPUPILS:\n\nTuberculosis (continued)\n\nand has undertaken to check up the pupils on each visit, to the extent of going over the ones known to be tuberculous, and any new suspects. I had a serious talk with Dr. Green. He is known given to understatement, but is known to be very competent. I think he will give the necessary attention, both general and detailed. Dr. Lamb has undertaken to prescribe rules for separation of the tuberculous from the well. I went so far as to say to Dr. Green that the Dept. was very serious about this matter and was willing to pay for the amount of attention required for success but in any event wanted service. I think that the most likely source of defect is the danger of the Principal and Matron, who are pretty self-confident, undertaking measures without adequate direction. This will bear a little watching.\n\n4. That some of the 12 or 12 known cases may be expected to fail and die. I expressed the view that these should not be sent home, particularly if there are younger children in the families. The school ought not to have, nor to try, to care for them after they break down, and I recommended that they be put in the Cranbrook hospital, unless the parents positively demanded their return home.\n\n5. I directed that, until further orders, no child be admitted to the school, unless certified free from serious suspicion of active tuberculosis after the most careful examination available.\n\n6. That, as a minimum measure of special assistance, the Department should pay the salary of a graduate nurse - $960 - ($1200). So long as the present nurse-matron remains and proves satisfactory, this will serve to pay her salary. Should a change be made, we should put in our own nurse.\nEXTRACTS FROM DR. STONE'S REPORT ON KOOTENAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nKOOTENAY RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nRev. Father Patterson has a secular staff which is, I think, of rather more than average quality. He and the matron, a graduate nurse, are energetic and intelligent. I was particularly impressed with the good relations which appeared to exist between the staff and pupils.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6452, file 884-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, November 17, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Director of Medical Services has submitted his report upon his return from the Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to the water supply, the Department has already written the Dominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau, asking for their latest report, and, upon receipt of this, immediate action will be taken.\n\nDr. Stone intends to discuss health conditions at the school with the Deputy Superintendent General and the Superintendent of Indian Education.\n\nWith reference to the general management of the institution, I am pleased to state that our officer was favourably impressed with the present management and staff. He also commented on the good relations existing between yourself, your officers and the children. He was particularly pleased with the energetic and intelligent management of yourself as principal and the matron of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. M. Patterson,\nPrincipal,\nKootenay Indian Res. School,\nGranbrook, B. C.\nIn August 1930 I was removed from my position as engineer at the Kootenay Indian School, Cranbrook B.C. by the principal Mr. Patterson. At that time the school had just supplied new parts to the value of about $400 for the repair of the engine and they also contemplated supplying new batteries to cost about $300.\n\nMr. Patterson produced a letter from the Indian Dept stating that on account of the expense they incurred in overhauling the lighting plant they found it necessary to insist on a qualified engineer being\nemployed. Having read the letter he dealt at length on the necessity of having a responsible person in charge, particularly on account of the new batteries. He also stated that the Dept intended to pay a special grant for a qualified engineer. He asked me if I had the required qualification. I replied that I had sufficient qualifications to satisfy the requirements, but when I attempted to produce evidence of them he prevented me from doing so.\n\nHe had employed Mr. Miles as carpenter a short time previously. This man represented himself as a qualified engineer from the University of Saskatchewan and he was given the position from that date.\n\nLater I had an interview with the Secretary Dept of Indian Affairs at Victoria in connection with this matter. He denied that any such letter was ever issued, neither did they ever raise any question about the engineer's qualifications nor did they make any statement about a grant towards the engineer's salary. The evidence of qualification which I produced was perfectly satisfactory. I also had a letter from the Registrar Univ of Saskatchewan, showing that this Mr. Miles was unknown to them and that he had never been a student, or taken work at any time at the University. The secretary at Victoria said there was a possibility that this letter came from Ottawa, or from the Indian agent. I think the Indian agent is out of the question, he would hardly assume responsibility for such statements, and I think also that the matters dealt with in the \"letter\" would be outside his duties.\n\nI have taken up this matter with Mr. Patterson, but he is unable to give any satisfactory\nexplanation or to account for the \"letter.\"\n\nTherefore I am writing to ask if the letter originated at Ottawa and if so I would like to have a copy at your convenience.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours Truly,\n\nP. Byrne.\nOttawa, January 9, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. F. Byrne, 1116 Burrard St., Vancouver, in which he complains concerning the circumstances of his discharge from the staff of the Kootenay Indian Residential School in August, 1930. He refers to some letter which you showed him from the Department, concerning the necessity for a qualified engineer. I am unable to find any correspondence in connection with this matter, and, before replying to Mr. Byrne, I thought it advisable to have a report from you. The Department would be grateful for an immediate reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. M. Patterson,\nPrincipal,\nKootenay Indian Res.

Ferrier,\nSupt of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter File No.155-6-1 of the 9th instant regarding the discharge of Mr Byrne, and I wish to state that the letter referred to was a communication File No.113556-5, Jan. 12th 1923 from J.D. McLean addressed to the Superior of the School at that time. It referred to the necessity of employing a competent man to take care of school mechanical equipment, and was shown to Mr Byrne in order to show him the nature of the position which he was applying for.\n\nMr Byrne was employed by the school for a few months as farm laborer and not as mechanic and was not summarily dismissed. On the opening of this position in August, 1930, Mr Byrne applied but I did not think him capable of giving us satisfaction, and consequently another man was appointed to fill the position.\n\nIn providing a suitable staff for the school during the last two years we have had to try out several employees and to reject some who did not fit; consequently there will be some when employment is scarce, who will try to secure reinstatement on any plausible reason.\n\nI can assure you however that the above-mentioned party is not suitable for Indian School work, nor our institution.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6452, file 884-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, January 19, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, regarding your discharge from the staff of the Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nUpon enquiry being made, the Department understands that you were employed by the school for a few months as farm labourer and that you were not summarily dismissed. The appointment of the staff at this school is in the hands of the Principal, who is responsible to see that the various members are efficient and carry out their duties satisfactorily.

This school is now a very different one to what it was a few years ago, and the credit is undoubtedly due to the able handling of same by the Rev. Principal, Father Paterson. At the time of my visit, the school had 80 on the roll, 77 being present on that date.\n\nG. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir,\n\nRe report of G.S. Pragnell, on his inspection (No. 7) of the Kootenay Indian Agency.\n\nIn regard to this Indian Residential School, I beg to say that the Principal was recently commended on instructions of the Department for the many improvements noticed in the school management.\n\nG. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner, B.C.\nKootenay Indian Residential School,\nCranbrook, B.C. July 3rd, 1933.\n\nMr F.S. Hycman,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn Inspector Pragnell's last visit I discussed with him and yourself the advisability of increasing the attendance quota of pupils for our school.\n\nAs we have applications for approximately fifteen children for admission in September and very few of age for discharge we will find ourselves with ninety or more children in attendance this autumn. We have ample dormitory space and classroom accommodation for this number. However I think it only fair that the maintenance expense of the full attendance should be borne by the Department.\n\nThe enforcing of attendance at this school has been particularly difficult in the past and it is only by painstaking effort and care on the part of Departmental officials and myself that our Kootenay Indians have learned to appreciate the value of the education the Department is furnishing them until at present applications for admission are voluntary on the part of the parents. It would therefore have a very bad effect among the Indians if applications cannot be accepted because of lack of maintenance funds.\n\nI would be glad if you would forward this application to the Department asking them to increase the quota so that the per capita grant may be given for an attendance up to ninety children.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRev. J.M. Patterson, O.M.I.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from the Reverend J. M. Patterson, Principal of Kootenay Indian Residential School, in which he makes application to have the school quota raised to ninety.\n\nI beg to submit that before the Reverend Patterson took charge of this school there were numerous cases of truancy and of crimes and misdemeanors committed by these truants. Nearly every child had to be forced to attend school, and at the close of vacation and also at other times there was a great deal of expense bringing the pupils from their Reserves to school. In the past three years there has been no truancy whatever and the parents and relatives have brought their children to school at little or no expense to the Department, and in all cases they have been brought of their own free will.\n\nIn addition to bringing about a most decided change for the better at the school, the Reverend Principal has been of the greatest assistance in promoting order and decency on the Reserves, and I appreciate this assistance more than I can say. We now have the confidence of the Indians and are, for the first time in many years, in a position to work out plans for the improvement of the Reserves, and while it must of necessity take time to work out our plans, I feel quite confident that if we are permitted to continue as at present there will be a very decided change for the better on all the Reserves in this Agency in a few years.\n\nIt is for the above reasons that I beg to strongly recommend to the consideration of the Department the enclosed letter from the Reverend Principal. I sincerely trust that as a real aid in furthering our plans for the betterment of the Reserves his application for an increase in the school quota may be looked upon with favour.\n\nThe above is respectfully submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. S. Rockman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n11/2538.\n\nOttawa, July 15, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, enclosing a communication which you received from the Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, in which he requests that a per capita grant be provided for an increase of ten pupils.\n\nIn reply I regret to inform you that, as our Appropriation for the present fiscal year has been so greatly reduced, it will not be possible to provide for increased pupilage at this school. At the present time, grant is allowed for 80 pupils, and this is the full number for which provision can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. S. Ryckman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook,\nB. C.\nMarch 1st, 1934.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nThis is a claim by the Nelson Studio of forty-two Dollars against Father Paterson for a camera.\n\nFather Paterson is at the Indian Mission near Cranbrook, and I suppose comes under your jurisdiction. I have written to him three times, and he ignores my letters. I had a similar experience with him before and I understand there are other outstanding accounts.\n\nI would be much obliged if you would call Father Paterson's attention to the necessity of his paying his debts.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nGJS/II\nMarch 6, 1934.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, in reference to the claim of the Nelson Studio against Father Patterson of Cranbrook.\n\nFather Patterson is not an employee of this Department. I am therefore sorry that we have no jurisdiction in the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. J. Spreull, Esq., M.A. LL.B.,\nBarrister,\nCranbrook, B. C.\nKootenay Indian Residential School,\nCranbrook, B.C. March 31st, 1934\n\nMr F.S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn July 3rd last, I wrote a letter through yourself to the Department requesting an increase in the attendance quota of our school. At that time the Department replied that no funds were on hand for that purpose. I wish to make the same request again trusting that the Department may now be in a position to grant my request.\n\nAt the present writing we have an attendance of 82 children and there are fifteen children who will be of school age this year on our reserves, and who should be attending school. There will be only three children of age for discharge this year.\n\nWe have ample dormitory space and classroom accommodation for a hundred pupils at least. However I think it only just that the Department defray their maintenance expense.\n\nI am therefore asking the Department to increase our quota for which the per capita grant may be given to ninety five children.\n\nTrusting that you will take this matter up with the Department for their favorable consideration, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRev. J.M. Patterson, O.M.I.\nKootenay Agency,\nCranbrook, B.C.,\nApril 7, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from\nthe Reverend J. M. Patterson, Principal of Kootenay Indian\nResidential School, in which he makes application for an\nincrease in the School Grant from eighty to ninety-five.\n\nIn recommending this application for the serious\nconsideration of the Department, I beg to call attention\nto the last paragraph of my annual report of March 29, 1934,\nfile 10/3122, in which mention is made of the necessity of\nincreasing the Grant in order that the Reverend Principal\nmay be permitted to remain in this Agency. I beg to submit\nthat I have been informed that plans are now being made to\nmove the Reverend Patterson to another field and send another\nwith less experience to take over Kootenay Residential School.\nIt has taken more than four years to properly organise the\nschool and Reserves and prepare to make progress, and should\nthe Reverend Patterson be moved it will be almost impossible\nto work out the plans we now have under way for the advance-\nment of the Indians.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 14, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, enclosing communication received from the Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, with reference to an increase in the pupilage.\n\nProvision has been made in our Appropriation for the year 1934-35 for a pupilage of 90 at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. Grant for the number stated will be allowed from April first of this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary\n\nF. S. Ryekman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B. C.\nKootenay Agency, Cranbrook, B.C.,\nSeptember 3, 1934.\n\nI beg to submit the following report as to conditions in this agency during the month of August 1934.\n\nThe end of the month saw nearly the full quota of pupils in Kootenay Indian Residential school and we look forward with confidence to another successful term. That the attitude of the Indians has undergone a decided change with regard to the school is clearly shown by the fact that of the eighty odd pupils now in school every one has come in voluntarily and while I have not visited the school recently, the Reverend Principal reports that all are in excellent physical condition.\n\nPractically all the hay and grain on the school farm has been harvested and the yield is heavier than it has been for many years. There will also be good crops of potatoes, roots and vegetables, more than enough for the needs of the school.\n\nF. S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent.\n| CENTRAL REGISTRY | REFERRED TO | DATE REC'D | INITIALS | CENTRAL REGISTRY | REFERRED TO | DATE REC'D | INITIALS |\n|-----------------|-------------|------------|----------|-----------------|-------------|------------|----------|\n|                 |             |            |          |                 |             |            |          |\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6452, file 834-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6452)\n\nFile 884-1, part 1\nKootenay Agency - Kootenay Industrial School -\nGeneral Administration\n1898 - 1906\n\nFile 884-1, part 2\nKootenay Agency - Kootenay Residential School -\nGeneral Administration\n1910 - 1934\n\nFile 884-1, part 3\nKootenay Agency - Kootenay Residential School -\nGeneral Administration\n1935 - 1950\n\nFile 884-2, part 1\nKootenay Agency - Kootenay Residential School -\nQuarterly Returns\n1941 - 1952\n\nFile 884-3, part 1\nKootenay Agency - Kootenay Residential School -\nPayments of Grants\n1931 - 1951\n| Central Registry | P.A.

AUG 7TH\n\nTHE SECRETARY\n\nDEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS, OTTAWA ONT.\n\nHAVE LEARNED THAT REVEREND PATTERSON TO BE TRANSFERRED AND NEW PRINCIPAL APPOINTED HIS PLACE IMMEDIATELY STOP BELIEVE IT OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO DEPARTMENT THAT NO CHANGE BE MADE AT PRESENT STOP WILL DEPARTMENT PLEASE TAKE MATTER UP WITH HEAD OF OBLATE ORDER AND HAVE ACTION POSTPONED UNTIL LETTER REACHES OTTAWA.\n\nF.S.RYCKMAN\n\n552AM8TH\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that when I visited Kootenay Residential School yesterday evening, on my way to Cherry Creek to attend to the automatic water gauge, I learned that arrangements had already been made to transfer the Reverend J. M. Patterson and that another member of the Oblate Order was expected to reach here in a very few days to take his place as Principal of the school. I accordingly sent the following night lettergram to the Department on my return to Cranbrook shortly after midnight:\n\n\"I have learned that Reverend Patterson to be transferred and new Principal appointed his place immediately STOP Believe it of vital importance to Department that no change be made at present STOP Will Department please take matter up with head of Oblate Order and have action postponed until letter reaches Ottawa.\"\n\nI beg to submit that I am convinced that this proposed change is of the greatest importance to this Agency, and I feel it is only fair to all concerned that I explain to the Department the conditions at the school as fully as possible.\n\nAs the Department is aware, I have been in fairly close touch with Kootenay Residential School for nearly twenty-three years. For some eighteen years it was my duty to act as Truant Officer, which necessitated almost constant contact with the pupils, the teachers, and those in charge. I do not wish to speak disparagingly of anyone, but I saw conditions at the school during those years and I am quite sure that of the numerous complaints made the majority were not without foundation. There were a number of Principals, some of them very able ones, who tried to bring about an improvement at the school during that time but none met with success, and complaints from Indians and whites of poor food, too much work, tuberculosis and other sickness among the pupils, etc., continued to be heard on every hand.\n\nWhen the Reverend J. M. Patterson took over the school late in 1929 conditions generally were so bad that it was doubtful if it could be kept running much longer. Of the fifty odd pupils in the building practically all were tubercular, and when Dr. F. W. Green examined them he stated that there were only a few of the total number who did not show unmistakable signs of the disease, and that he would not say that any were entirely free from it. Both the Doctor, the Nurses and the new Principal stated that the children were all under nourished and in very poor physical condition.\n\nOne of the first acts of the Reverend Patterson was to engage a Trained Nurse and turn the school into what was actually a tubercular sanitarium, as he realized that the health of the pupils must be restored, at least in part, and their bodies built up before progress in their various studies would be possible. Since that time all food used in the school has been prescribed by a Trained\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\na Trained Nurse, a very close watch has been kept over the pupils and those showing the least sign of illness have received prompt attention. Machines have been installed to do the heavy work formerly done by the boys, such as sawing and splitting wood, etc., and the heavier farm and house work is all done by hired help, either adult Indians or whites. The food regularly placed on the tables is much better than in the average home of white people, and the result is that the pupils are much better nourished than they have been in the history of the school and are making better progress with their studies. Formerly children had to be forced to attend school and truancy was common among them, but in nearly six years not one child has been forced to attend and there has been but one case of truancy, that of a sub-normal boy.\n\nThe effect on the school has been great, but the effect on the Indians of the various Reserves has been even greater. Due to causes too numerous to mention at this time the Indians, with but few exceptions, had almost entirely lost faith in the school, the Church, and practically everything pertaining to law and order, and both the Reverend Principal and myself realized that until that faith was restored little or no progress could be made. That has now been accomplished, and I believe a larger share of the credit is certainly due to the Reverend Father Patterson. I am quite convinced that since the first Principal of the school left this district no Priest has had such control over the Indians as the Reverend Principal now has, and to move him from this Agency before our plans have been properly worked out would mean, without doubt, a return to their former state within a very few years.\n\nI realize that the financial condition of the School has not been at all good during the past few years, and in fairness to the Reverend Principal and the Department I feel that I should now report on this matter exactly as I see it, for it is my belief that finances, or rather lack of finances, is the real cause of the proposed change.\n\nWhen the Reverend Patterson took charge of the school he also took over debts left by the former Principals amounting to some five thousand dollars. In 1930 the average number of pupils was only 59, in 1931 it was 67, the following year 70, in 1933 the average increased to 73, in 1934 to 80, and the present year to approximately 90 pupils. The school can not pay its way with less than about 85 pupils and maintain the present standard. I understand that prior to 1930 certain sums of money were owed in to the Oblate Order by the Principals each year, but because of the small number of pupils and the fact that so many were ill, it has been impossible to put this end, at the same time, keep out of debt and build up the school. The Department has done everything possible to assist, and the Reverend Principal has certainly done heroic work; but under the circumstances I think it very unfair of the Oblate Order to expect the Reverend Principal to pay debts contracted by his predecessors. As already mentioned, I have been in very close touch with the school and I am perfectly certain there has been no mismanagement and no extravagance. The Reverend Principal has not had, during his term of office, any proper assistance from the Oblate Order, but has had to run the school, the farm, the Missions, and the financial end of it alone. I am quite sure that if he had an experienced Priest to keep the books and look after office matters generally, and also make visits to the Reserves when necessary it would be of the greatest assistance.\nUntil about three years ago the large farm owned by the Oblate Order was leased to Chinese, and as very little feed can be raised on the school farm the Reverend Principal was forced to buy some fifteen hundred dollars worth of feed each year, but since the farm has been taken over by him and properly cared for there has been no shortage of feed or garden truck. The school has been on a paying basis since the first of this year, but it is impossible to discharge the old debts.\n\nThe Reverend Principal has carried on the Missionary work on all Reserves in the Agency, and has also controlled the social work, which is, I believe, an entirely new departure in Roman Catholic schools in this Province, for in other Agencies the Missionaries are separate from the Principals. The present arrangement keeps the Indians in closer contact with the school, which is absolutely necessary in this Agency.\n\nFor confirmation of the above I would respectfully refer the Department to the Archbishop of the Oblate Order in B.C. at Vancouver.\n\nIn closing, Sir, may I respectfully request that this matter be placed before the Deputy Superintendent General for his consideration. It is my belief that it is of vital importance to this Agency and to the Department that the Reverend Father Patterson continue as Principal of Kootenay Residential School for at least a few years more, and I sincerely trust that the Department will use their influence with the head of the Oblate Order to have this brought about. I am quite sure that they are not at all familiar with the true situation here or the move would not even be considered.\n\nThe above is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.

It was quite evident that a great deal of thoughtful effort had been expended both by the teachers and pupils to produce the better type of acting, singing, and reciting that was so much in evidence that night. The children showed readiness to take their parts and were exceedingly pleasant to listen to. A steady improvement is noticeable at this school and the children have registered worthwhile progress during the past 12 months.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nCranbrook, B.C.,\nSept. 2, 1938.\n\nReport for Kootenay Agency for August.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nProbably due to wonderful weather there has been very little sickness on the Reserves. Old people are enjoying the warm sunshine and keeping well. Despite this fact, however, several cases of measles have broken out among the children of St. Mary's reserve and, while the form is mild and not considered a serious epidemic, Dr. Green believes, and I am in full accord with his ruling, that the School must not be opened until October 1st and I may say that Reverend Father Collins and his able teaching staff are quite convinced of the wisdom of keeping the School closed until the epidemic has entirely disappeared.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON KOOTENAY AGENCY FOR MONTH OF SEPTEMBER 1938.\n\nHealth:\nAt the beginning of the school year a slight outbreak of measles necessitated the children of St Mary's reserve remaining out of school for a period of 3 weeks in compliance with Provincial Regulations governing Public Health. Owing to this misfortune the school could not be opened until about the 20th. Since then, however, with the exception of Lower Kootenay where there are still several cases of measles, the children from all other reserves have returned to school together with 10 boys and 9 girls from the Okanagan Agency. In all other respects the various Bands are enjoying the best of health.\n\nAndrew Irwin.\nIndian Agent.\nInspector talks with Indian Parents.\n\nAfter the completion of classroom work at 10 A.M. November 10th, a number of Indians, possibly 40 in number, gathered at the school to discuss certain phases of school management with the Inspector. Complaints were made regarding special privileges being accorded to children from the Okanagan Agency. They also wanted to know if it was right for the Sisters to pull the girls around by the hair and for the Oblate Brother to rough handle the boys. Further complaints were made about too much religion being taught and too much vocational training. The charges of either rough or unkindly treatment on the part of any of the Sisters or the Oblate Brother are, in my opinion, only imaginary and were dealt with in common with all other complaints raised in a most careful and convincing manner by the Inspector who tried and, I believe, succeeded in leaving the impression with them that the Kootenay Indian Residential School is a good school in every way and takes no second place to any similar Institution in the Province.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nCranbrook, B.C., Nov. 30, 1938.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON KOOTENAY AGENCY FOR NOVEMBER 1938.\n\nKootenay Indian Residential School\n\nIt was indeed a pleasure to welcome Captain Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools, who, in response to a somewhat urgent request from a number of St Mary's Indians, kindly consented to make his annual inspection a few days earlier than he had otherwise planned. He arrived at Cranbrook on the 9th instant and started almost immediately for the school in company with myself. The following day, November 10th, it was my privilege to hear many favourable comments from the Inspector regarding the system of teaching employed at the school, the efficient and effective manner in which the different subjects were being presented to the classes and the marked progress so much in evidence over the previous year. In addition to classroom achievements other phases of school life were carefully looked into by the Inspector such as food supplies, laundry, clothing, sleeping accommodation for girls and boys, T.B. Children's separate dormitories, sewing room, dining room, weekly diet sheets, general sanitary conditions, heating, fire protection all of which, with the exception of fire protection, proved the system employed to be one of untiring effort on the part of those in charge to furnish the maximum of cleanliness, good care and comfort to each and every boy and girl attending the school.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nGranbrook, B.C., July 4, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON KOOTENAY AGENCY FOR JUNE 1940.\n\nAfter a careful inspection of agency office files, the Kootenay Indian Residential school was visited and later a visit was made to each reserve, thus affording an excellent opportunity to become more closely acquainted with our problems here and to assist by their kindly and useful suggestions in the solution of certain unusual problems which may from time to time arise. The visits, I need hardly say were highly appreciated and have been productive of good results.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Mr. Nelson,\n\nA few days ago, I wrote to you to thank you for having part of the grant forwarded before the regular time. After having the Manual Trainers' salary increased to $50.00. However, the quarterly reports and visits with the agent to two reserves made me forget to post the letter. So, I thank you once again.\n\nI have just received another report from the Hop Growers' Association. As you may have seen by the reports, we have quite a number of absenteeees - they are still a little under our quota. Several just stayed at home on pretext or another. Others left to find work in the U.S., a few days before we opened. I expect the report will make a report on the unsanitary conditions or immoral atmosphere of these yards. The Department or one of its officials will likely get a copy of the report if it is ever made. It won't make pleasant reading. The remedy, so far as the B.C. hopyards are concerned, is not difficult. Cultivation should be applied as the Dept. has been given some adverse criticism on the subject. The question of the U.S. yards will be more difficult to remedy.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6452, file 884-1, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nKOOTENAY INDIAN SCHOOL\nCRANBROOK, B.C.\n\nSept. 4/42\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nWould you please send Mr. Indian Agent Drivin or myself a supply of \"Application for Admission\" forms (Form #1-A 406) as I have only a few on hand & he has none. I would ask Miss Hargrave him but he has just left and will be absent a few days on business at the Columbia Falls & Blue Lake Reserves & as I may need these forms soon.\n\nWhile I have a circular letter from the Department & one from Dollis Hauron stating that the length of the holidays is 60 days, I would appreciate a short letter from you saying that the Department has generously allowed 60 days & that no Principal has the right to extend this time \u2014 except, of course, when the doctor certifies that a pupil should be kept out of school.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S.

Principals are expected to re-open the schools on September 1 of each year. No Principal has the right, except in the case of an outbreak of disease and then only with Departmental sanction, to extend this holiday period.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. G. Forbes, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nKootenay Indian Residential School,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nKootenay Indian School\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nOct. 22/42\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nAs the local Indian Agent will tell you, the Doctor recently examined all the children here. He found many with bad or enlarged tonsils and strongly urged me to have their tonsils taken out immediately. I need not say that he is not just making work for himself, but only in very conscientious and he expects to join the army within two weeks so that he would not benefit by his operations.\n\nVery rarely has anyone been properly made out the Quarterly Returns. Someone else made out the June returns and signed them after checking the totals. While making out the Sept. returns, I noticed that pupil 0317, Celina Capilo, had been entered as present during the June quarter. She was in the Provincial Hospital during that quarter. Financially, that error made no difference as our quota is 85 & the average attendance was 85.9.\n\nI again request that the dental work be brought up to date. In the last 18 months, the services of a dentist were twice authorized but on neither occasion did the dentist finish his work. I do not wish to suggest that he was not within his rights in sticking to specified hours. In the Cariboo School & at the Christie School, Mrs. English & Miss worked longer hours and finished their work.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6452, file 884-1, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIf it is possible, I would suggest that the district be paid so much per felling or extraction (not by the day). I am asking the local Indian Agent to apply for a refund of about $70. I know that we have been very difficultly told that we have no right to house work done without authority from the Department and, then, we expect the Department to meet the bill. The case was argued about a week before school opened. I was informed that many toilets and some buildings were completely out of order or working only because of makeshift arrange- ments. There was nothing to get permission to have the work done before school opened. So, I had the work done. From a sanitary point of view, it was very urgent.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Irwin has likely submitted the case of Teresa Pierre to you. Technically, this girl is not a Canadian Indian because her Canadian mother married an American Indian. He abandoned his family who have always lived in Canada (Wabasso Plains Reserve). The mother works hard one or two dollars helps her a little to feed and clothe her children but she is poor. Technically, she may have the rights, but to all practical purposes she is a Canadian Indian.\n\nAnd what can he done in this case? Mr. Irwin would quite naturally refuse to consider it on account of the very definite rulings of the Department. He has no right to disobey the Department. Has the Department the right to stretch a point? Two sisters were admitted to this school several years ago & they are still here. In the meantime, their Indian parents appear to have left the Wabasso Plains Reserve and house, I believe, thereby forfeited their Indian rights. They have purchased two younger children who are now here whom they do not wish to have separated from the others two who were admitted some years ago. These admitted by the Department are Edna Margaret child. The others two,\nKootenay Indian School\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nWhose names do not appear on the returns are Rose and Lillian Auld. They are Canadian Indians but technically they are not. While I would like to have Teresa Pierre and the two Aulds admitted to the School Department, I do not wish to exaggerate. At any rate Department, I do not wish to exaggerate. At any rate I think that the moulds would find it difficult. I think that the moulds could feed and take care of their children. I do not think that Teresa Pierre's mother could look after her daughter as she should. The little girl was thin when she came here and I think that it will be found that she will soon be able to care for her own child after her. I would very strongly recommend that Teresa be admitted. There are good reasons for keeping the Aulds here. The case is not so urgent.\n\nThe Department kindly increased the grant for the manual trainer from $40.00 to $50.00 per month and agreed to pay him for 12 months instead of 6. He has been the agent & written to the Commissioner perhaps to your asking for an increase in wages as he is steadily employed for 5\u00bd days per week from about 8:30 until about 5:30. I realize that the grant is only for an instructor in manual training & that the Department expects the School to pay for his services. However, he is employed as carpenter. I do not believe, however, that, especially in a school with so small a population, the Department would expect me to pay him more than the remainder of his salary and to employ an additional carpenter also. On account of the urgent repairs needed, I have to keep a carpenter.\nand also to have the manual trainer on the job also.\nI would ask either that the department have all necessary repair made to the School building, the barn (where there have been 2 large holes some small ones missing for years in the hay loft, where replacing is necessary, reshingling, repainting, etc.) and other buildings or to pay the manual trainer a living wage, let him and the other carpenter do as much as they can.\nI feel that you hold me responsible for the maintenance of these buildings \u2014 I can't maintain them. I would suggest that you have an Indian agent or anyone else go over the buildings and submit a report. Part of the trouble seems to be that whoever built this school or trussless beams to be that whatever built this school or made the alterations shipped on material. Thus Indians who were here as pupils when the school opened, tell me that wooden floors had to be laid over the cement floors in the basement because the boys made holes in the cement floor. I will see, with their nails, etc., a man, who had to renew part of a wall, told me that he found two nails in about 8 boards (O-joint). I can show you boards in the floor which never had a nail in them.\n\nThe Oblates have done and are doing their share. About 10 years ago, we paid off an $1,000 debt, just after my arrival, the Oblates warned me $450 & 10 days off outstanding bills. Except for $450 (which are put into our outstanding bills), except for $450 (which are put into outstanding bills). We have 6 weeks from the Doctor, the doctor, freights, etc., we have just been polarized back into the school as a \"loan\" as there is no accommodation for the school as a \"loan\" as there is no accommodation for the school as a \"loan\". As there is no accommodation for the school as a \"loan\", as there is no accommodation for the school as a \"loan\".\n\n\u2014 Kindly release the enclosures which will indicate that the children are well treated.

For health reasons the pupils have only a half school-day in classes, while the other half is devoted to practical outdoor education. In addition, sanitation is given including treatment for trachoma and sound training in tuberculosis prevention. The school has a small preventorium.\n\nPractical education includes farming, manual training, carpentry, animal husbandry, cooking, sewing, dairy work and beadwork. A music course is also popular.\n\nThe children help in the maintenance of their own residential buildings and the Department of Indian Affairs pays a daily grant on the basis of each child.\n\nPractically self-sustaining, the school and the nearby farm run by the Oblate Fathers raise their own vegetables, beef, supply their own milk, cream and butter.\n\nFather G. Forbes, B.A., M.A., principal, and Rev. F. Sheppard, disciplinarian for boys, with three male instructors for the boys' practical courses, while seven Sisters of Charity of Halifax are assigned the school as teachers, nurses and housekeepers. A first aid course given by the nurse was started this year.\n\nPrincipal aim of the school is to prepare the young ones for becoming self-supporting citizens in the case of the boys, and the care of homes for the girls, with maintenance of sound health a dominant factor.\nREPORT ON KOOTENAY INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OCTOBER, 1943.\n\nSchool:\n\nThe Kootenay Indian Residential School has again settled down to its regular routine. On the occasion of my recent visit the Dormitories, Preventorium, Class rooms, dining room, kitchen, pantry etc. were all spotlessly clean and the excellent spreads on the Dining room tables was proof conclusive that the children are not being stinted for food, on the contrary they are being well supplied with the necessary varieties of healthy, nourishing and appetizing things to eat.\n\nThe three run-away girls mentioned in my last report have since returned to school. They were picked up at McLeod, Alta. by a R.C.M. Police, and escorted back to Cranbrook by a priest.\n\nThe three young boys who were mentioned in my last report as having run away from school tried it again this month. The weather, however, was uncomfortably cold so much so that one little lad returned to the school of his own accord before completing his first night out. The other two were located and brought back the following day.\n\nMain Roof repair work undertaken at the School by the Firm of Patmore Bros., in which only Tremco products were used has been in as far as one can tell at the present time satisfactorily completed. The job appears to have been well done, and it is not thought possible that further trouble in this connection will be experienced for many years to come.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON KOOTENAY INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH NOVEMBER, 1943.\n\nResidential School.\n\nInability to use the Agency Car owing to the tires having been sent to Calgary for retreading, my one and only visit to the School found all class and work rooms, the Dining room, dormitories and kitchen spotlessly clean, also the pupils.

On each occasion a visit was paid to the dining room, once with Mr. Inspector Coleman, who presented prizes to two of the senior girls who had excelled in culinary achievements. And twice unexpected visits, on each occasion the tables were well stocked with nicely prepared nutritive and appetizing foods to which the pupils and two members of the staff, sitting at a side table and eating the same food, appeared to be doing full justice.\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON KOOTENAY INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL, 1944.\n\nSchool:\n\nThe usual activity prevails at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, perhaps a little more so now when seeding operations are in full swing. On the occasion of my last visit, the children under the direction of the Rev. Principal Forbes were busy planting a large number of raspberry and a few currant bushes, about 700 in all. These operations will be followed shortly by the planting of a school garden which will consist of illustration plots of vegetables and grasses. The seeding and developing of this garden is made possible by the action of the Department in supplying the necessary seeds, fertilizers etc. The seeding and developing of the plots will be carried on by the children under the supervision of the Agricultural Representative Mr. James Allan.

No. 1 (St. Mary's) 1735 acres. Population 161.\n\nNo routine inspection was made of this Reserve as it was in the midst of winter and time did not permit more than a cursory examination of it. The following are notes of those details discussed with the Agent.\n\nHEALTH:\n\nThe incidence of T.B. appears to have been high and accounted for most of the high death rate in the past and probably a large contributing factor to the altogether unnecessarily high infant mortality. I suspect that the maternal affection of this group is below that of Indians elsewhere in the Province.\n\nAt one time good work was done by the Rev. Sisters - Nurse at the Residential School, but the small monthly grant of $20.00 for her services as dispenser was discontinued in March or April 1941. Sister Marion Clair, a graduate of Massachusetts General appears to be a very intelligent and devoted woman, and I am of the opinion that we are overlooking a good opportunity in not employing her on a part time basis at a salary of $25.00 per month, plus a limited car mileage, to visit Indian homes on this Reserve and carry out an active anti-tuberculosis programme in addition to the work usually devolving upon a field matron, particularly on such subjects as pre-natal and postnatal care and child welfare. She has, of course, visited cases of urgency when called or became aware of the need, but what is required is regular visitation with encouragement of providing better homes and cultivation of gardens from a health point of view. The Rev. Principal understands that the nurse was included in the school staff at the request of Doctor Stone who agreed to pay the cost of her salary and that the Department's files will show this. However, the suggestion here is not in respect to her services in the school with the children, although undoubtedly they result in a considerable saving of hospitalization to the Department, but to her part time employment among the Indians of St. Mary's Reserve.\n\nJ.

For some time past his health has not been at all strong. During the many years he has been associated with Indian work he has certainly devoted himself whole heartedly to those under his care.\n\nActing on the suggestion of the Inspector of the School I have looked around in order to find a Principal who who would have a thorough practical knowledge of farming. I am, therefore, submitting to the Department the name of Reverend Father Gerald Kelly to succeed Father Forbes as Principal.

Forbes, O.M.I.,\nKootenay Residential School,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nYour File 155-0-1\n\nI have your letter of August 20th advising that Reverend Father Forbes is giving up his duties as Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School and will shortly be succeeded by Reverend Gerald Kelly, O.M.I.\n\nReverend Father Forbes is held in the highest esteem by the officials of the Department here, and it is with genuine regret that we learn that he contemplates giving up the work at Cranbrook.\n\nI may say that I have known Father Forbes for many years, having first come in contact with him when he was Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School. His kindly and sympathetic interest in the Indian people has won for him a lasting place in their affections. No one could have worked harder or more devotedly on their behalf and I am sure that many of them will learn with real sadness of his withdrawal from the work in which he was so active on their behalf. As is unavoidable in an administration such as ours, differences of opinion regarding certain matters arose from time to time, but these have not lessened in any way the great regard in which he has been held by the Commissioner and other officials of this staff.\n\nI wish to assure you that this office will extend to the new Principal every possible assistance in the task to which he has been called.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n/KT\nSchool:\n\nRev. Father Gerald Kelly arrived on Sept. 21st to replace Rev. Father Forbes as Principal of the school. Father Kelly will appreciate the work done by his predecessor and will find a willing and intelligent staff to work with. The primary teacher took Summer School classes in Victoria and wishes to put into practice what she learnt. This training is particularly well suited for Indian children so that it should prove to be a success. School articles were recently requisitioned to enable this teacher to carry out this project. Supplementary readers and more library books are urgently needed. Father Kelly appears to accept the challenge which this school presents and I am sure will make a success of it. No effort will be spared to give him co-operation, and I trust that repairs and supplies required to carry out this programme will be supplied at an early date.\n\nJ.M. Barre,\nActing Indian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: St. Eugene Indian Residential School, Cranbrook\n\nAmong the matters brought to my attention by Reverend Principal Kelly when I visited the above-noted school last month was the difficulty the institution continued to experience in meeting the costs of operation. I am inclined to think that this situation is partly due to the small grant-earning income of the school.\n\nAt the time of my visit there were seven children in the school in excess of the grant-earning pupilage and I was informed that there were twelve others not attending any school who should be admitted. An increase of ten in the number of pupils for whom the grant is authorized would greatly assist this school financially and as accommodation for at least this additional number can be provided, seven of whom are already in the school, it is felt that the Department would be justified in approving this increase.\n\nI may say that I was very favourably impressed with the new principal, Reverend Gerald Kelly. He is a keen, young, active man and has already shown evidence of having taken a firm hold on the administration of the school. He will, I am sure, measure up well to the heavy responsibilities of the Principalship.\n\nThe school is badly run down and consequently much is needed by way of repairs and improvements. I advised Father Kelly that the work required could not all be attended to at once, but that we would do all in our power to assist in having the most urgent items attended to as quickly as the necessary funds could be secured.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, January 3, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of\nthe 31st ultimo, recommending an increase in the\npupilage of the Kootenay Residential School.\nI have discussed your letter with the Director,\nwho intends to present the request to the Minister\nas soon as possible.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nI beg to submit that in this report I have endeavoured to show that a certain amount of progress has been made by the Indians of this Agency in the past six months, but it is difficult to explain the marked change in the attitude of the Indians toward the school, the Department and this office, and law and order. The greatest change of all has been in the Kootenay Indian School, and it is really due to the great change brought about in the institution by the Rev. Principal. Complaints are just echoes of old grievances and the Indians speak of the school with more respect and pride. In addition to the school the Rev. Principal has been of great assistance in dealing with problems on the Reserve. I appreciate his help and trust that he be allowed to remain in this Agency for at least several years. These Indians have many redeeming characteristics as shown in their record of enlistments, and I feel that with old prejudices breaking down and their confidence returning, they will soon be in shape to make some real progress.\n\nJ.M. Barre,\nActing Indian Agent.\nWelfare and Training:\n\nThe Kootenay Indian School under the efficient leadership of Reverend Gerald Kelly, O.M.I., has made very steady progress during this quarter. The pupils are making rapid progress in their class room studies, domestic science, and manual training. The tubercular patients have shown very satisfactory improvements. There has been little or no sickness in school during this quarter except for five cases of measles, one reported on December 17th and four on December 29th. Antimesles serum was used on the contacts and it is hoped that this epidemic will reach no great proportions. The pupils are well nourished and their health is carefully looked after by Sister Marion Clare. The pupils were vaccinated against smallpox and will be vaccinated against typhoid as soon as the measles is over. The school is well supplied with milk, eggs, vegetables and fruit.\n\nThis school carries eight pupils in excess of its quota. Three Auld children, who do not belong to the reserves, will be returned home as soon as the quarantine on measles permits, however, this still leaves us short of space for twelve pupils from the Columbia lake and Shuswap Reserves who should be returned to school, not only for their own good but as a matter of discipline. This matter has been referred to the Department and I am awaiting a reply before taking any action.\n\nThe fire extinguishers requisitioned for the school were finally received, and fire drills are held as per regulations. One unscheduled rehearsal was held at 5:00 o'clock one morning when the new fireman and night watchman inadvertently pulled the fire alarm. This proved to be a good and successful fire drill. In addition to the night watchman and fireman, Rev. Father Kelly has hired a new farm manager, who has good recommendations.\n\nOn my last inspection it was noted that good work had been done in re-decorating the girls play room, several chairs having successfully been re-upholstered with bright materials. Kindergarten tables and temporary chairs as well as other objects have been whitewashed in the Manual Training department. The domestic science department does excellent work in cooking under the direction of Sister John Anthony and Sister Catherine Mary's sewing class produced very good work. The pantry and hallway near the Father's dining room has also been redecorated.\n\nThe situation with reference to the plumbing at the school is still bad, even though some of the toilets were temporarily repaired, flush actions, etc. are so far unobtainable. One urinal near the boys dormitory was put in working order and all taps were replaced.\nWelfare & Training (cont'd)\n\nperiod of years since the power line first crossed the reserve. I would earnestly ask the department's consideration of this project in the near future on the grounds both of good economy and efficiency.\n\nunsuspected talent was discovered in the pupils of both sexes by the Principal when he initiated their training for concerts to be given on special occasions. In the first, at Christmas, the performers were somewhat self-conscious, but this was completely absent when on St. Patrick's Day an excellent program was enjoyed by a large crowd.\n\nThere are further improvements to be seen on every visit to the school not only in the building and furnishings, but, indeed, of school. The Principal, Father G. F. Kelly, has worked untiringly toward a more attractive life for his charges. Under his direction the Kootenay Indian school promises to rank beside any in British Columbia.\n\nJ. V. Boys,\nIndian Agent.\nWelfare & Training:\n\nAt the Kootenay Indian School continued progress is being made both in and out of the classroom. The children are well cared for and have an excellent record of health. A number of replacements have been procured for worn out beds in both the boys' and girls' dormitories. A program of cleaning and painting in the lavatories and several changes in plumbing have made for better hygiene, but a continued project for redecoration of the basement passages is urgently needed. Because it was found impossible to procure replacement parts, the toilets on both sides of the school are still awaiting repairs to seats and flush actions.\n\nThe school is carrying several pupils above its dormitory quota, but more pupils could be accommodated comfortably if some small low-cost changes were effected. This would make possible acceptance of a number of school age children from Columbia Lake and Shuswap Reserves upon whose parents pressure is being applied to have them send their children to school.\n\nMuch trouble has been experienced in recent weeks with lighting and pumping equipment at the school. A series of breakdowns has necessitated repairs to all three power units, overhaul of the emergency 4 k.w. diesel generator, replacement of water pump and batteries, at considerable cost to the Department and to the discomfort and inconvenience to the residents of the school. The Principal and many of the staff laboured for days with some outside help to restore services to normal. From time to time representations have been made to the Department to have an installation made, connecting the school to the West Kootenay Power Line some two miles distant. Though the initial cost is large, so too has been the cost of upkeep of the school's present, inadequate power, electrical and water equipment over the\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nThe following is a report on conditions in\nthe Kootenay Agency, during the quarter ended June 30th, 1946.\n\nWELFARE AND TRAINING:\n\nAt the end of the school year one or two\nteaching Sisters at the Kootenay Residential School are to\nbe replaced. It is hoped that their replacements will have\nhigher academic qualifications and more recent instruction\nin teaching methods. The school would benefit too from a\nthorough inspection by qualified educationist. But above\nall else the services of a social worker are needed to follow\nformer school pupils into their homes to advise and assist\nthem toward clean, sanitary housekeeping habits.\n\nLighting and pumping equipment at the School\ngave good service after several replacements in the last\nquarter, but a pressure tank in the water system caused a\nbreakdown of water supply and demands replacement.\n\nAuthority has been received for alterations\nin the school building to make two balconies tenantable for\npreventorium purposes.\n\nA large piece of land, formerly a garden, has\nbeen made available to the children for a playground.\n\nJ.V. Boys,\nIndian Agent.\nWelfare and Training:\n\nThe Reverend Gerald Kelly, O.M.I., and his staff have done excellent work during this past quarter at our Kootenay Indian Residential School, but much remains to be done before this school can be brought to a high standard of efficiency.\n\nUtilities in general continue to be the greatest problem. A new hydro pressure tank has been procured to replace the worn out domestic water supply tank, but due to extreme weather conditions prevailing at this time, it is impractical to have this tank installed until spring. The extreme hardness of the present water supply has proven costly in water softeners, replacing heating coils, and generally impairs the efficiency of all heating equipment. It is hoped that replacement of the worn out soft water supply line from St. Joseph's Creek can be started in the near future. Although this water is unfit for domestic purposes, it would give a good supply of soft water for general purposes as well as a much needed additional supply for fire protection.\n\nA Mr. McKinnon has been engaged to instruct the classes in manual training. This man has had considerable experience in this type of teaching and it is hoped that progress will be made after the commencement of school January 6th. This vocational training department has made little or no progress since the opening of school last fall due to the inability of procuring a suitable instructor.\n\nInstallation of drinking fountains in the dairy barn have been completed and will undoubtedly prove their worth in higher milk production.\n\nLight and power facilities are performing well, but are inadequate and a considerable course of work and worry for the attendants and it is to be hoped that arrangements will one day be made for the acquisition of hydro power facilities, this in itself would form the groundwork for an efficient\nConsiderable difficulty was occasioned in persuading the parents of tardy pupils in sending their children to the school. This aversion seems to have disappeared and Indians who at the beginning of the term were completely immune to any kind of persuasion have voluntarily brought their children in.\n\nWith 99 (ninety-nine) pupils on the roll, the school is comfortably filled. The children all appear much happier than when they first arrived for the fall term; their work in the classrooms has improved, particularly in drawing and painting, writing and arithmetic. The new system instigated this fall whereby the two junior grades receive full time instruction has shown marked improvement over the work done in these two grades in previous years. Another plan for improvement also shows results. This plan is fulfilled in a study period every evening for all classes. Four of the more advanced pupils are now taking grade nine work from grade nine curriculum and their teacher reports fine progress, especially in English and Mathematics.\n\nAnother fine improvement appeared at the school over the Christmas holidays in the form of a new 16 m.m. sound and moving picture projector. Two good films and a short were procured for the holiday season and school children and parents alike turned out in full force at every showing. The school has obtained access to the local National Film Board Library here in Cranbrook and have applied to the Visual Instruction Service at University of B.C. for educational films.\n\nAt the time of my last visit to the school, the children were happily engaged in winter sports, the skating rinks and toboggan slides were in full swing. The school itself was decorated in festive apparel from attic to basement. These decorations were truly artistic and were a credit to the supervisors and proof of the artistic temperament of the Indian children.\n\nAltogether the morale of the school shows a decided improvement from the time of my last quarterly report and Father Kelly has shown great perseverance with considerable success in overcoming parental distrust and aversion to the school, and, despite a woeful lack of funds, continues to lay plans for future improvement.\nOttawa, August 5, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER.\n\nRe: Kootenay Indian Residential School\nKootenay Indian Agency\nProvince of British Columbia.\n\nThe authorized pupilage at this school at the present time is 100.

Kelly O.M.I. continues to provide satisfactory services to the welfare and education of the Indian children in their care. The spirit of the staff and the attitude of pupils and parents alike is commendable. Several of the parents made a special trip to the office to remark on their satisfaction of the fine progress of their children during the past term.\n\nThe additional classroom provided this past term has relieved the overcrowding and has been used to fine advantage by the staff in their program of increased hours of tuition to the pupils.\n\nOf seven pupils that have been recommended to High School since September 1947 only four are at present continuing their education. Two are taking grade ten and two are in grade nine at the Cranbrook High School. Their progress is not outstanding but has been reported as entirely satisfactory.\n\nA full quota of supplies for the Manual Training and Domestic Science classes has been supplied by the Dept., as well as a fine array of sporting equipment. A good fall of snow plus extreme cold weather finds the two outdoor skating rinks and toboggan slide in fine condition and swarming with the pupils and staff alike at every opportunity.\n\nThe main pipeline to replace the old line that supplied the school with soft water from St. Joseph's creek was laid this past quarter; due to extreme weather conditions prevailing it was impossible to complete all connections and completion of this project had to be deferred until next spring.\n\nThe main school building has received two coats of paint on all exterior trim, all cracks in the cement and stonework have been sealed with caulking compound. The completion of this big project gives great satisfaction to the Reverend Principal and myself and needless to say it will prolong the life as well as it has greatly improved the appearance of this fine structure.\n\nOur inability to procure the services of a qualified Instructor for the Manual Training class is regretted.

Morale among the staff, pupils and parents alike is greatly improved over conditions that prevailed two or more years ago.\n\nParents from Columbia Lake, Shuswap, Lower Kootenay and Tobacco Plains Reserves journeyed up to one hundred miles to attend the Christmas concert by school pupils on the evening prior to the Christmas school holiday. The singing, dancing and acting by these Indian pupils was excellent and drew very favourable comment from parents and guests.\n\nJ. S. Dunn\nSuperintendent.\n\nCopied by J.L.\nThe Rev. Principal has inaugurated a Young Men's Study Group for Indians living on the nearby St. Mary's Reserve. Good attendance is reported at regular evening meetings. Discussions are held on current events and the request for books and periodicals loaned to these young men is excellent. A program of sports has been outlined and a hockey team organized.\n\nJ. S.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI Hummey Confirm that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kootenay Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated this 2nd April, 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kootenay Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1941.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 4th, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended Sept. 1, 30, 1941.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated Oct. 14, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Location]\n\nthis 6th Oct. 1941\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kootenay Indian Res. School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: E.J. Miller\n\nDated: Oct. 3, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Kamloops, this 9th October, 1942\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kootenay Indian School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Dec. 30, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Craigleith, B.C., this 3rd January, 1943.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kootenay Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Oct. 3rd, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kootenay R. School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Dec. 31, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kootenay Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 3, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Cranbrook this 10th April 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kootenay Indian School School for the Quarter ended...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kootenay Indian School School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated Oct. 4, 1944.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Cranbrook, B.C., this 4th October, 1944.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, see another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kootenay Indian School, Cranbrook, B.C., School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: March 31, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Cranbrook this 3rd day of April, 1945.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kootenay Road Board School for the Quarter ended Oct. 3, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Oct. 3, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Cranbrook, B.C., this 14th day of October, 1945.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. L.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return, and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..................................................School for the Quarter ended.............................................193......\n\nPrincipal..................................................................\n\nDated.................................................................193......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at.................................................................193......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................School for the Quarter ended.........................................................193.........\n\nPrincipal......................................................................................\n\nDated.................................................................193.........\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at.................................................................JUL 22 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1937.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 1, 1937\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at OCT 10, 1937\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kootenay Indian School School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1935.\n\nPrincipal: Harold H. Kellogg\n\nDated: October 1, 1935\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Kootenay Agency, October 10, 1935\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kootenay Indian School School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 1, 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated OCT. 10, 1946.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. All Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kootenay Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: January 15, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: JAN 17 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..................................................School for the Quarter ended..........................................................193......\n\nPrincipal..................................................................\n\nDated.................................................................193......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at............................................................APR. 23, 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the........................................................School for the Quarter ended..................................................193......\n\nPrincipal...........................................................................\n\nDated.................................................................193......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent...........................................................................\n\nDated at.................................................................this..................................................193......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kootenay Residential School for the Quarter ended... Oct. 30, 1937.\n\nPrincipal: J. H. Kelly\n\nDated: Oct. 1, 1937\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: OCT. 4, 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kootenay Residential School for the Quarter ended...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' attendance of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paginating No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagin No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................School for the Quarter ended .................................................. 19......\n\nPrincipal ..................................................................\n\nDated ................................................................. 19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent ..................................................................\n\nDated at ................................................................. this ................................................................. 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kootenay School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Oct. 5, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Kootenay Agency\n\nOCT 13, 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at: Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\n[Signature]\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 0548            | Virginia Birdstone | 9   | X   |      | St. Mary's     | X                  |                         | I-9-46                    | 92 - 18    |\n| 0549            | Mary Fisher      | 9   | X   |      | Columbia Lake  | X                  |                         | \"                        | 92 - 18    |\n| 0550            | Rosalie Francis  | 9   | X   |      | St. Mary's     | X                  |                         | \"                        | 92 - 18    |\n| 0551            | Teresa Stanley   | 9   | X   |      | \"              | X                  |                         | \"                        | 92 - 18    |\n| 0552            | Rebecca Capilo   | 9   | X   |      | Columbia Lake  | X                  |                         | 21-4-46                   | 92 - 18    |\n| 0553            | Elizabeth Aloc   | 16  | I   |       | Penticton      | X                  |                         | I-9-44                    | 62 - 0     |\n| 0554            | Sabina David     | 14  | X   |      | L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March; 30th June; 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kootenay Indian School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 5, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nthis April 5th, 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 R. 3608\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Kootenay Agency**\n\n**School at Cranbrook, B.C.**\n\n**Report for Quarter ended March 31/49**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 0557            | Monica D.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils shown on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the feet thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................School for the Quarter ended .........................................................19......\n\nPrincipal..................................................................\n\nDated .................................................................19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent...........................................................\n\nDated at ................................................................\n\nthis .................................................................19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nR. 3608\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6452, file 884-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Kootenay Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Kootenay Residential School at Cranbrook B.C.**\n\n**Reserve for Quarter ended March 31/59**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 229             | Howard Mission | 9   | X   |      | St. Mary's     |                   |                         | 2-9-47                     | 90         |\n| 230             | Wilfrid Squakin| 9   | X   |      | Penticton      |                   |                         | 4-9-47                     | 90         |\n| 231             | Fredrick Swete | 9   | X   |      |                |                   |                         |                            | 90         |\n| 232             | Abraham McCoy   | 8   | X   |      | St. Mary's     |                   |                         | 2-9-47                     | 90         |\n| 233             | Sam Ignatius    | 9   | X   |      | Tobacco Plains |                   |                         |                            | 90         |\n| 234             | Wilfrid Jacobs  | 9   | X   |      | St. Mary's     |                   |                         | 15-2-48                    | 90         |\n| 235             | Andrew Alexander| 8   | X   |      | L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kootenay School for the Quarter ended...

ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................School for the Quarter ended .................................................. 10 ..................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................School for the Quarter ended ..................................................19......\n\nPrincipal ..................................................................\n\nDated ..................................................19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent ..................................................................\n\nDated at ..................................................................\n\nthis ..................................................19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENROLLMENT TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0555            | Martina Pierre | 14  | X   |      | L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return shall be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kootenay School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 7, 1952.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kootenay School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1952.\n\nPrincipal: S. B. Kelly\n\nDated: June 30, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Under these circumstances, the advance requested cannot be made at the present time but, as soon as funds are available, the matter will receive further consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Patterson, Principal of Kootenay Indian Residential School, for an advance of $1200.00 on the June quarterly grant.\n\nI beg to submit that the Reverend Principal informed me today that he had not yet received the balance of about $1300.00 due on the March quarter, and requested me to ask if the cheque had been forwarded, for if so it has no doubt gone astray. As the Reverend Principal has some payments to make within a very few days and is badly in need of funds, if the cheque has not been forwarded will the Department please wire the amount to him in care of the Canadian Bank of Commerce at Cranbrook.\n\nI also beg to suggest that if an advance can be made on the June quarter when funds are available it will be of great assistance to the Reverend Principal. For the information of the Department I beg to state that when the Reverend Patterson took over the management of the school he found it rather heavily in debt, and this has made it very difficult for him to meet his obligations.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.

Father Collins.\n\nI have discussed the matter with our Medical Superintendent and he sees no reason why the children from outlying Reserves should not be allowed to enter the Kootenay School. He is writing the Indian Agent today and I hope that as a result of this action will be taken to permit most of the children to return to the school in the near future. I will keep the matter in mind and before the end of September will ascertain exactly where it stands and if necessary I will then endeavour to make some arrangements that will assist Father Collins in his financing.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

I would like to pay off all outstanding bills & $1500 plus the $360 owed by the Indians will enable me to do so.\n\nI wish to take this opportunity to thank the Department for the $800 of flooring, the papers & nails, which have already come, and also for the tools & material for a Carpenter Shop which are to come.\n\nMr. Commissioner MacKay was here recently. From what I have heard, the local Indians are pleased with his visit. Most of them are making good use of the irrigation system and I expect that they will continue to do so. I am convinced that irrigation was impracticable & disastrous without irrigation.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG. Foster\n\nP.S. The holidays start on the 24th.

Still, no idea is being implanted: One of our younger girls told her aunt, a few days ago, why she should stop her baby from crawling on the floor, etc.\n\nYou may recall that, after you had told me that Mr. Inspector Fredrickson had reported to you that he had been informed that he had no...\nceived only six books per annum, I told you that I knew nothing of Mr. Walter. Since then, I have learned who made the report to him. According to Mr. Simpson, only six books were sent in the year referred to.\n\nMr. Fredericksen has just spent 3 days here. He appears rather pleased with certain improvements in the teaching methods but notes room for further improvement.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC. J.

Quarter. Perhaps my letter was lost on route or mislaid but to date I have had no reply. Although I have already prepared the Quarterly Returns and sent them in to Mr. Dunn, the Indian Agent, I would like some advance immediately if that can be arranged. Heavy expenditure for clothing and the fact that I have had to buy some transportation for the school leaves us rather short of money at the present time. I would be very pleased if you could arrange this advance.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nG.F. Kelly O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, October 7, 1947.\n\nDear Father Kelly:\n\nWith reference to your letter of October 3rd, I am advised that a cheque for $2,000, being an advance on the September quarter per capita allowance of the Kootenay Residential School went forward on September 30th.\n\nI trust that this has reached you by this time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

As I was not sure if you had returned from the West I did not address it to you.\n\nWould you be kind enough to check on my letter to see if it was received and if the requested advance of two thousand has been sent. To date I have not received any reply.\n\nMr. Arneil told me early in August that you were expected at the coast. I am sorry you did not have time to visit us here but no doubt your time was limited.\n\nOur school year is again under way with an enrolment of a hundred and three. All the children of this Agency who are of school age are enrolled so we are off to a good start.\n\nTrusting you can arrange the requested advance and with sincere thanks,\n\nI remain,\n\nTruly Yours,\n\nG.F.

As a matter of fact, I was on my holidays and not on official Government business and I was only able to spend three days in British Columbia.

There where two bills one for $200.00 and one for $25.00. Up to now I have not received payment for this work. On previous occasion I have always received payment within the month. I am thinking that perhaps the bills or even the checks if same have been made out may have miscarried and I beg you to investigate this matter and oblige.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nAlfred Lebeau\nOttawa, March 11th, 1925.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 5th instant, I beg to say that your account of $200.00 therein referred to was paid by cheque No. 5908 on the 23rd February, upon which date the cheque went forward to you at Cranbrook. It was drawn in favour of the Economy Plumbing & Heating Company.\n\nI may add that seemingly your account of $25.00 has not reached the Department.

The charges in the voucher for office supplies and for drugs should be made out on separate accounts as expenditure for schools should not at any time be included in a voucher in which other charges are made.\n\nWith regard to the drugs supplied, I may say you should explain why the Indian who received the same did not pay for them. All accounts for drugs supplied on a prescription should be certified to by the doctor who wrote the prescription, but in this connection I have to remind you that all doctors employed by the Department are not allowed to charge for drugs. Some of them who are on salary should furnish medicines without charge, and you should be particular, therefore, with regard to all accounts for medicines which you transmit to the Department.\n\nWhen you deal with the foregoing matter you should submit the vouchers under cover of a letter of explanation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

With this in mind, I have no fear in being disappointed when I find myself obliged to solicit your interest again in a matter of some importance.\n\nI think you will agree that I have now occupied my position long enough to be able to say with tolerable exactness what are the most keenly felt needs of our School. While some of these regard the main building and the outbuildings, I consider that the most pressing are those which concern the health, the moral and physical upbringing of the children. I wish to call your attention to the lack of all adequate playground facilities.\n\nIt is generally admitted that wholesome recreation is an integral part of all school-life, a fundamental feature in any sound system of education. Besides greatly increasing the prestige of an educational institution, it is as a factor itself in education that the chief usefulness of sport and athletics lies.\n\nTheir physical value is unquestionable. They inculcate care of the body, the development of healthy habits, and induce habits of energizing vitality. Nor is their moral value to be underrated. Well-directed exercise breeds characteristics of vigor, mental keenness and stimulate to greater effort in the class-room. These are qualities which you will recognize are much to be desired in our Indians.\n\nOur Children have been at a disadvantage in this respect. And it may be easily seen that we cannot deprive childhood of its heritage of play without paying the price in stultified youth and unenergetic maturity. The distressing cases of delinquency which have occurred here in the past, I believe I may attribute at least in great part, to a lack of recreational activity. Where wholesome diversion is not provided for the child, he will seek it himself, wholesome or otherwise. And the forming of cliques, the brooding habit, the discontent which this inactivity engenders, is detrimental to the highest influence of the School.\nWe are doing our best to face this difficulty. We have enlarged and improved their playgrounds. But we find that the expense of equipping them with durable apparatus, to provide the boys with athletic goods, is beyond our means. We, therefore, appeal to the Department to defray the cost of the following:\n\n1. A play shed for the girls to be built by the boys under the supervision of Mr. Morris, their Instructor of Manual training.\n\n2. The apparatus called the \"Ocean Wave\" and also the one called the \"Giant Strides\".\n\n3. An outdoor gymnastic outfit for the boys.\n\n4. Two basket ball outfits, one for the boys and one for the girls.\n\n5. A baseball outfit and a football outfit.\n\n6. One vaulting pole.\n\nTrusting that this demand will not be deemed excessive, I am Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(sgd) F.W. Tedrow O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. H.H. Small,\nIndian Agent\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of a letter dated March 31st, which I received from the Reverend Father Tedrow, O.M.I., Principal of the Kootenay Residential School.\n\nYou will notice he has asked me to apply to the Department for assistance in providing equipment for playgrounds for the Indian children.\n\nI am not in a position at the present time to quote you cost of this equipment, but will endeavor to ascertain the cost if you entertain the proposition in any way.\n\nI might say that I thoroughly agree with the Reverend Father, that \"well-directed exercise breeds characteristics of vigor\", and I should very much like to see the school well equipped, and I think it would have a tendency to make the children more content.\n\nI will await your decision in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE.

Sample B was water from Joseph Creek. Both samples showed more than 200 colonies per cubic centimeter. Both gave a positive presumptive test, but no Colon Bacilli were found.\n\nNot knowing anything further regarding the nature of the samples, it is impossible to give any definite opinion upon them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd...

However, the matter was at that time investigated and two samples of water were taken.\n\n(a) Water taken from flume as it leaves sewage works, 17th November, 1923.\n(b) Water taken from Johnson's creek at Mission, 17th November, 1923.\n\nThese two samples were forwarded to the late Dr. R.H. Mullen, Director of Laboratories, Vancouver General Hospital, for a report.\n\nI am enclosing copy of Dr. Mullen's report, dated 27th November, 1923, from which you will note that although bacteria is in evidence no Colon Bacilli were found.\n\nTo further corroborate Dr. Mullen's report I am having some further samples taken of the water in Joseph Creek at the St. Eugene Industrial School property, and when report has been received I will advise you further in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd...

Webb,\nActing District Chief Engineer,\n119 Pender Street, West,\nCity.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your request of the 25th instant, the first samples up to February 11th, are all of questionable value, owing to an error in procuring the specimens, namely, the bottles were not sterilized before taking the specimens. However, some of these being negative are of value in this way. The three sets of specimens procured since the sterilization of bottles has commenced have only shown one specimen containing B. Communior.\n\nIn conclusion of this work, I would like to say that a final definite report could not be made without a local sanitary survey, but the laboratory data to date would show that there may be only occasional contamination from the Sewage Disposal Works. However the number of negative examinations would seem to show that this is an extremely unusual occurrence, if it has occurred, and it would seem that the water is safe for consumption in this regard.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSgd...

This matter had apparently been overlooked at the time by our District Chief Engineer at Vancouver, but recently several examinations have been made of the water in Joseph Creek by the Acting Director of the Vancouver General Hospital Laboratories, the result of which appears to show that the danger of contamination of the sewage disposal works appears to be slight; copies of the reports containing the results of the biological tests are attached hereto.\n\nIf you desire to have further periodic tests made I shall be glad to have your instructions in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The Department agrees that each residential school should have equipment of this type; and, although it is our practice to ask the school management to bear the cost from their per capita grant, I am pleased to inform you that the Department will give some assistance. Basketballs and goals will be ordered and shipped to the school in the immediate future. The boys, under the direction of the manual training instructor, should erect back boards on both the boys' and girls' sides. Two footballs complete with extra bladders will also be sent to the school.\n\nYou might secure an estimate of the cost of the materials and labour for the girls' play pavilion which, I note, could be erected under the supervision of the manual training instructor. You might also indicate what is in mind for an outdoor gymnastic outfit for the boys. I cannot promise favourable consideration in connection with these two propositions, as our funds are extremely limited.\n\nI regret that the Department cannot give favourable consideration to a baseball outfit, as this type of equipment is so easily mislaid and misappropriated. Further, I regret that the Department cannot consider the apparatus known as \"Ocean Wave\" and \"Giant Strides.\" A vaulting pole is not considered suitable for young Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. H. Small, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B. C.\nApril 3rd, 1925\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nAt a great sacrifice, but I take it much to your satisfaction, I allowed Rev. F. Tedrow, O.M.I., to go as principal to St. Eugene School.\n\nAs far as I can gather he has succeeded very well and certainly he is much interested in the welfare of the children. Occasionally, of course, he must visit the Indians at Creston and Windemere, however, I have arranged for a neighboring Priest to attend to the School whenever he is absent.\n\nBut, Mr. Scott, Father Tedrow's salary is very small, in fact, merely enough to provide himself with clothing and books. He does not complain, and yet I know he would be pleased to have a car, so necessary for him in his present position.\n\nUnder the circumstances, would not the Government be willing to make him an allowance of $1600.00. With this amount he might purchase a plain strong car like the Dodge, which would render him and the Indians generally valuable service. A cheaper car, like the Ford, could be had but it would be valueless in a rough hilly country like the Kootenay.\n\nSincerely trusting you will be able to confer on Father Tedrow and his Indians this favor.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, April 21, 1926.\n\nDear Father Welch:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to the Rev. Father F. Tedrow, Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School. I am very pleased that you are satisfied with the way he has handled this difficult situation and I am free to state that the Department also has received hopeful reports.\n\nI regret that it will not be possible to give favourable consideration to the purchase of a car for the Rev. Principal. It is not the practice of the Department to supply Indian residential schools with this type of equipment. It is true that several principals have automobiles, but the funds were found by the management in each case. At the present time, the Appropriation for Indian Education is completely assigned and I am forced to give consideration to regular expenditure only.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nVery Rev. John Welch, O.M.I.,\n59 Blackwood St.,\nNew Westminster,\nB. C.\nOttawa April 24th 1925.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to draw attention to voucher No 837 rendered at $4.16 in favour of the Cranbrook Sash and Door Company Ltd., and also to voucher No 839, which was made out for $11.65, but reduced to $5.50 in favour of the Cranbrook Drug and Book Company, Limited. On the 2nd of April cheque No 6552 for $9.66 went forward to the Cranbrook Sash and Door Co. It covered payment of their voucher (No 837) amounting to $4.16, and through inadvertence it was made to cover also voucher No 839 in connection with which a separate cheque should have issued. I have to request therefore that you will lose no time in obtaining refund from the Cranbrook Sash and Door Co of the over-payment which they received, viz:- $5.46, and that you will pay the said amount to the Cranbrook Drug and Book Company in settlement of their account. You should obtain a receipt from them for the $5.50 and forward it to the Department in order that it may be attached to voucher No 839 before being sent to the Auditor General.\n\nOn the 2nd of April the Department wrote you with respect to voucher No 839. It was stated therein that the payment of $5.50 covers supplies furnished the Indian School. You were told also that a separate voucher might be presented for office supplies and also for drugs. I have to point out that you have not replied to that letter in which a report was requested.\n\nYours truly,\n\nChief Accountant.\n\nE.H. Small Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nCranbrook, B.C., April 29, 1925\n\nRECEIVED FROM Keeleway Agency\n\nTHE SUM OF Four Hundred Dollars $400\n\nFOR July 9th 1925 Indian Indemnity\n\nCranbrook Drug & Book Co., Limited\n\nPer\n\nKINDLY RETAIN THIS RECEIPT\nSir:\n\nAcknowledging receipt of yours of the 24th inst., I beg to enclose herewith receipt from the Cranbrook Drug and Book Company for $5.50 the amount collected by me from the Cranbrook Bash and Door Co., and being an error in payment of Voucher No. 839.\n\nI am also enclosing receipt for $4.00 for medicine supplied to Indian, and included in Voucher No. 839.\n\nI looked this matter up, and found the Indian working, and collected the $4.00 from him.

As several months have passed without receiving your check for this Bill I naturally believe that the Bill had been overlooked or mislaid and I shall be very obliged if the Department would look into this matter and straighten out the account.\n\nThanking you in advance and being sorry for all this trouble, I beg to remain yours respectfully,\n\nA. Lebeau\nMay 20th, 1925.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to say that the Department has received a letter from Mr. A. Labeau, Proprietor of the Economy Plumbing and Heating Company of Cranbrook, in which he requests payment to the amount of $25.00.\n\nSeemingly the said account did not reach the Department, although Mr. Labeau has stated you informed him that you mailed it. If you have not a copy of the account in your office you should obtain one without delay and submit a certified voucher in the usual way for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.D. McLean),\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE.H. Small, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nMay 20th, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 12th instant, I may say that seemingly the Department did not receive the account therein referred to, of $25.00, but a letter has been written to the Indian Agent, Mr. Small, and he has been requested to submit another copy of the account in order that the matter of payment may be considered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.D. McLean),\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr Alfred Lebeau,\nEconomy Plumbing and Heating Co.,\nGranbrook, B.C.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 20th instant, I beg to advise that the plumbing done in the Kootenay Residential School was called for by competitive prices by me. On voucher number 789 the Economy Plumbing and Heating Company, of which Mr. A. Labeau is the Proprietor agreed to do the work for $200.00. Later on Mr. Labeau gave me an account for $225.00, the extra $25.00 being unauthorized by myself or the Department, and I did not consider that we were under any obligation to pay the amount. I told Mr. Labeau this at the time, and asked him to give me invoice for the amount of his tender, which I considered was fair, and that we are under no obligation to pay for extra work that he claimed had been done. I did not inform Mr. Labeau that I sent in a voucher for the $25.00, but I did inform him that I would not pay the extra $25.00 for unauthorized work.\n\nI will, however go over the work with the Sister Superior in charge of the school and if I consider that Mr. Labeau is entitled to that amount I will submit a voucher for the same, but at the present time I am inclined to think that Mr. Labeau has taken upon himself and is not entitled to be paid.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.H. Small,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nMiss Muslin\nThurston\n170. or due\nAgent\nMrs.\nPark\nOttawa, July 13, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 26th May, I beg to say the Department desires to receive from you a statement showing the different advances which you received wherewith to defray expenditure on the Kootenay Residential School. The statement should show the amount of each receipted paylist and voucher forwarded to the Department and should indicate the balance, if any, due you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE.H. Small, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nKootenay Residential School\nCranbrook, B.C.\nAugust 10th 1925\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby take the liberty of bringing to your notice certain repairs urgently needed at the school.\n\nThe first of these is the painting of the barn. This building was erected in the course of 1915 and since then has not received a second painting. I think you will agree with me that to re-paint it at once will be a matter of economy rather than extravagance.\n\nI have spoken to you also about the painting of the Manual training shop which was built during the summer of last year and as yet has not been painted.\n\nYesterday Mr. LeBeau, the plumber of Cranbrook, drew my attention to the water system. Mr. LeBeau was called to make repairs in the upper storeys, but was unable to do so because the valves that control the upstairs water supply were either broken or worn out. There are ten or twelve of these and he estimated the cost of replacing at approximately $75.00.\n\nA last item which I beg of you to consider is the roof of the engine room. This roof was repaired two years ago but the result has not been satisfactory. When it rains heavily or there comes a thaw, water leaks through onto the engine. I fear that the damage caused would be great if this were neglected.\n\nI will be thankful if you will give these repairs your judicious attention.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nF.W. Tedrow, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\n\nH.H. Small Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a request from the Rev. Principal F.W. Tedrow, of the Kootenay Residential School.\n\nRe. painting of the barn.\nThis building undoubtedly requires painting and if you consider it I will submit competitive prices for it and the Manual Training shop.\n\nYou will notice that Mr. LeBeau considers the plumbing will cost approximately $75.00.\n\nThe roof repairs to the engine room, I will go into and submit you prices on repairs.\n\nWill you kindly advise me if you will consider these repairs.\n\nYours obedient servant\n\nE.H. Small\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 27, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, enclosing copy of a letter from the Rev. Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School. With reference to the painting of the barn and manual training shop, I should be pleased if you would intimate whether this work could be done by day labour - the materials to be purchased by yourself. If it were done in this manner, the school staff and older boys could assist in the labour. Please let me have a further recommendation and a statement as to how much paint is required, its probable cost and an intimation concerning the ability of the school management to look after the work with the assistance of say one painter.\n\nYou are authorized to expend a sum of not more than $75.00 in the purchase and installation of new valves for the upstairs water supply. You are also authorized to repair the roof of the engine room. No unnecessary expense should be incurred. Competitive prices should be secured before making purchases of material in this connection. Please have this repair undertaken with as little expense as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. H. Small, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B. C.\nSir:\n\nThe Reverend Father Tedrow, and the Sister Superior of the Kootenay Residential School, have asked me to recommend that a door be put in the outside kitchen of the School.\n\nWhile the plans show a door leading to the outside kitchen it has never been put in, and the wood and other supplies for the kitchen must be taken in through the hallway at the West end.\n\nThis is an inconvenience and also dangerous in case of fire.\n\nMr. G. R. Leask, Contractor, looked it over for me, and estimated that it would cost about $135.00.\n\nWill you kindly advise me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. H. Small,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, September 3, 1925.\n\nSIR,\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, recommending that a door leading to the outside kitchen be arranged at the Kootenay Residential School. I note the estimate is $135.00.\n\nYou are authorized to make arrangements for this improvement, but if a saving can be effected by using school labour, it will be appreciated by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I have to request that you will deal with this matter without delay, and it seems advisable to inform you that the Honourable James H.

H. Small, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B. C.\n\nHave wall examined and submit estimate of cost of repairs.\n\nJ. D. McLean.\nSir:\n\nFor the Special Information of Mr. Russell Ferrier.\n\nOn the 5th inst., in company with Mr. E.H. Small, Indian Agent, Cranbrook, B.C., I made a special inspection of Kootenay Residential School, having in view the idea of checking it over on account of the condition in which I found it last Fall, and which has been duly reported on by me.\n\nI am pleased to report that a great improvement has taken place. The Rev. Lepine, the new Principal in charge, is apparently a good farmer, and has made a vast improvement in the farm and gardens, and if given time I am sure that he will pull things together. He has got a good help outside and seems well able to supervise same. I found that the children are now being well fed and, apparently happy and contented, and I have strong hopes that these reforms which have taken place will help us to get more boys to the school. I find that there are 47 girls and 23 boys. This means that we want about 17 more boys to fill up. I found the manual training proceeding most successfully, and I only wish I could say the same of the other schools. In connection with this, it would be an excellent arrangement if, alongside the building used for carpentering, etc., a small building with a forge installed could be built. This would be a most useful addition to the farm and most instructive. I think if the Principal of the School were supplied with sufficient cement for a small forge they could erect those buildings themselves. Although I am no judge, I should think somewhere between $200.00 and $300.00 would be required. However, I could get you a prepared estimate.\n\nI found also that the children are much better organized in the way of games, and I think this will help as well. Again, I find that the children, that is, the boys, are all having small plots of ground allotted to them for growing vegetables, etc., and I really think it is up to the Department to give a small prize for which they can compete. This would really be a greater benefit to the Indians than the present farm prizes, and could be given under that heading.\n\nReferring to my old reports regarding fires escapes, etc., in this building, I still have fault to find with the method of exit. My belief is that some form of steps should be built up from the floor to the window in order to allow an exit for the smaller children, and in addition, something with which the window could be broken in case of jamming, should be handy. Acting under my advice as given last year, the school authorities have put in fire pails all over the building. They are also erecting escape signs, colored red to show through the smoke, along the passages, as otherwise the children are very liable to mistake which door to take which leads to the fire escapes. I also suggested that a fire\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\ndrill should take place, but this has never been done. The Principal agreed with me in this.\n\nThe engine of the pumping and lighting plant should be overhauled. I understand that this has not been done for many years, and some of the parts are beginning to wear, allowing too much vibration in consequence.\n\nThe Principal informs me that the cold storage place for the meat in the ice house is not at all satisfactory. I went in and had a look at it and find that there is only one side which touches the ice chamber, and I think there must be some error in construction. However, I asked Mr. Small to have this looked into by an expert, and find out what is wrong. You will remember I reported last year that the meat was bad for meals when I last inspected it.\n\nBeyond these criticisms which I have just offered, and which are not the fault of the School Authorities, the only criticism I have to offer is that I found the cows, including those lately bought for the School by the Department, in very poor condition. They badly want feeding up, and I examined the only stock or hay they have left on the premises, which is utterly useless for feeding purposes. I asked the Mother Superior to get some more hay in at once. I know, of course, that they are handicapped by the fact that the farm has been allowed to run down to the extent that they have practically no good hay to feed the stock from last year. I do not anticipate that this will occur again, and I sincerely hope it will not, but at the same time I drew their attention to the fact that it is necessary to keep the cows in good condition in the meanwhile.\n\nWhilst going over the school, my attention was drawn to a very serious leakage in the water running through the wall in the coal hole. The side walls are all cracking and bulging, and I was seriously alarmed lest they should give way at any time. I therefore instructed Mr. Small to wire you for instructions in the matter, which I believe he did.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Geo. S. Pagnell)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nGSP/S.\nOttawa, May 26, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, with general reference to conditions at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. The Department is pleased to note the marked improvement at this institution and that the Rev. Principal is qualified to manage the farm and garden. I note that the enrolment is low and I should be grateful if you would instruct Mr. Indian Agent Small to make a special effort this year to fill the school.\n\nPlease insist that fire drill be instituted and repeated at least once every two weeks. Special emphasis should be laid on this matter immediately after the summer vacation.\n\nYour action in connection with the side walls is approved. Telegraphic instructions were directed to the Indian Agent some days ago. The Department will await Mr. Small's report on the ice-house. You may authorize him to have a competent man inspect the engine of the pumping and lighting plant, with a view to making a report, showing what replacement is necessary and indicating the cost.\n\nI regret the Department has no funds for the purpose of building and equipping a small blacksmith shop.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Kindly give attention to this matter without further delay. I may remind you you were written to in regard to the accounts not only on the 29th April, but on the 24th of February and it is not understood why they have not been presented by you if you received them from Mr. Leask.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Small,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa, June 14, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, with reference to painting the barn and manual training building at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. I have examined your letter of September 17th, last, and I wish to suggest that you check the quantities of stain, paint, etc., required. The quantities seem large for the amount of work to be done. When this matter has been attended to, you should again call for prices on the exact amount of shingle stain, dark green paint and white paint required. The Department cannot allow glass and putty, as replacements of this kind are made by these institutions from the per capita or other earnings.\n\nYou may purchase the materials from the firm quoting the lowest and engage one experienced painter to assist and supervise the older boys of the school. Time sheets, in duplicate, showing the receipts of the man engaged, should be forwarded for payment. When you are submitting a certified account in duplicate, in favour of the firm that supplies the materials, attach thereto a memorandum showing those asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nOur funds are extremely limited this year and I have to request that you will keep the expense in this connection as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Parks and Co. considerably reduced from last year's estimate, and amounting to $485.00.\n\nThe work, Mr. George Higginson estimates at $325.00, making a total of $810.00.\n\nI might say in this connection that the Reverend Principal considers that the work would be too dangerous for the Indian boys, as at the best they are clumsy when on the ground. There is no white help available at the School, as the Sisters only employ two men, and at this season of the year they are very busy in the garden.\n\nAwaiting your approval.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.H.

He was written to for these tenders on the 20th September, but so far has not paid any attention to our request.\n\nThis Agent's salary was increased on the first of last month, and he has been paid at the increased rate for October.

Box 752\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\n\nNovember 29, 1926.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn this date, Mr. Small, Agent for Kootenay Agency, forwarded me your 155-0-5 of the 16th of November, referring to the cleaning and repairing of the Refrigerator Plant at the Kootenay Industrial School. I do not quite see why Mr. Small did not answer you direct instead of forwarding me the correspondence.\n\nI enclose copy of his letter to me in which he asks me to explain the matter. It is hard for me to make any definite statement upon the matter, as my visit was away back last Spring. Possibly in going over the building it was pointed out to me that the refrigerator plant was out of order, and I probably instructed Mr. Small to look into the matter. I, of course, would not authorize any expenditure without first referring to you, but it looks as though Messrs. Sainsbury and Ryan took his instructions to look over the plant as meaning to put it in order. I think therefore that this account should be paid. However, as I said before, I cannot see why Mr. Small should not give you this information himself without having to write to a third party.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n(Geo. S.

Lebling was in the office yesterday and told me that he expected the Superior back here in a very short time.\n\nAs soon as she arrives I will have her either certify Mr. Lessk's pay list or write me explaining why, to the Department.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nE.H.

I may say you are relied upon to attend to the matter as promptly as possible.\n\nIn the official letter quoted your attention was drawn to two accounts amounting respectively to $30.00 and $20.68 from Mr. Leask, but you have failed to report with regard to the same. If you have the accounts, you should forward them with your report thereon, and if they should be paid, you should submit them in proper form for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Mr. Small has been requested to attend to the matter upon her return.\n\nThe Agent was requested by the Department to report with regard to two accounts of $30.00 and $20.68, respectively, referred to in previous correspondence. He did not make report, and the Department is writing him again in the matter. He has been told that if the said accounts are correct he should certify them and forward them to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGeo. R.

You forwarded an estimate from the Hanson Garage, showing that the material would cost $446 and that the labour would be approximately $168. You should consult the Rev.

Small\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMr. Indian Agent Small has forwarded prices for the replacing of the tubes in the heating plant boilers of the Kootenay Indian Residential School. The boiler Inspector claims that new tubes must replace all the old ones before the boilers are used again. Rev. Father Guy has also written urging that the heating plant be put in order as the Principal is greatly worried over the finding of the Inspector. The lowest price received was $1100.\n\nA year ago I learned that the water supply engine and the pump at this school would have to be repaired. I accordingly arranged for a vote of $800. The lowest price received for this is $614.\n\nIn view of the urgency in these connections, I wish to recommend that the work be authorized. The balance of the funds required can be found in the Appropriation for Indian Education.\n\n[Signature]\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, July 6, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with enclosures, with reference to the repairs required to the engine and pump at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. You may have the work undertaken, at a cost of $446 for the material and $168 for the labour. A properly certified voucher, in duplicate, should be forwarded when the work is satisfactorily completed.\n\nI note that the C. P. R. Boiler Inspector has examined the boilers and that new tubes must replace the old ones. You may accept the offer of F. Parks & Company to supply the 120 tubes at a price of $900 and you may have William Reeves do the labour at a cost of $200. When you are forwarding certified accounts in duplicate in this connection, you should have them certified to by the C. P. R. Boiler Inspector. His certificate should read that he has inspected the work, that the prices are fair and just and the labour satisfactorily completed.

(No recess period)\nTwo new boys (beginners) were enrolled in September, the total number of students being sixteen. This formed a much smaller class than in the two previous years, the older boys having left.\nWe now have nine boys in attendance, some of the boys having left through sickness and other causes.\nWe expect a larger enrolment in September as there are several students who will be ten years of age in September.\n\nBuilding.\n\nOur work shop is a separate building and of good size. It is specially suited for its purpose. The boys have done a great deal towards fitting it up; having put in the floor, tool cupboards and ceiling, also the drawing equipment and work benches.\nThe building is heated with a stove, one of the boys has to put on a fire early in the morning during our severe winter.\n\nEquipment.\n\nOur equipment is not elaborate, we have the essential tools for a class of twenty boys. The tools are of good quality, being those as regularly used by mechanics.\n\nSupplies.\n\nThis year we have reduced our supplies to an absolute minimum, and we have purchased them from with the prize money won by the boys at the Cranbrook Fall Fair, the amount being Twenty five Dollars.\nNext year I want to use more Hardwood and hardware and would ask you to sanction and recommend that One Hundred Dollars be granted for this purpose, if possible.\n\n(I)\nKootenay Residential Manual T.

Small Shelves | Housed Joint. |\n\nN.B. All the above exercises are repeated in following models.\n\nThe above boys made exceptional progress in the woodwork but were very slow in drawing.\n\nThe woodwork accomplished by the main class was as follows:\n\n1. Inlaid Table Set | Inlaying, Chamfering. |\n2. Palm Table | Tapering, Glued Butt Joint, Mitre Joint, Fastening with screws, Nosing, Haunched-Stopped Mortice and Tenon Joint, Bow-Sawing. |\n3. Medicine Cabinet | Rebating, Through Mortice and Tenon, Making Stop Bead, Stopped Housing, Shaping to own design. |\n\nThe above models were \"Painted\", materials used being:\n- Raw Linseed Oil, White and Orange Shellac, Varnish, Varnish Stain, Turpentine and Colours, and white Lead Paint.\n\nThe \"Painting\" is treated in an educational way, the use and source of each ingredient is discussed.\n\nDrawing.\n\nAll of the woodwork models made by the main class were properly draughted by the boys. The views are properly placed and named together with all the necessary lettering and detail. The views projected being plans, elevations (to scale), and full size section views.\n\nThe boys are fond on this work and assimilate the instruction as easily as the average white boy.\n\nTheory.\n\nThis consists of a study of the following:\n\n- Trees, Timber, Plane figures, Tools.\n\nProgress.\n\nThe progress made by the boys in this work is equal to that made by my Cranbrook boys. Our Public School course is completed in three years. This course has been completed by the senior members of the class in the same period of time.\n\nInstructor.\n\nMy relation with the Indian boys has been most happy and cordial. I feel that through this work their outlook is made wider and more\nKootenay Residential S.M.T.

This letter was inadvertently mislaid, and I regret the delay in replying thereto.\n\nThe Department is communicating with Mr. Inspector Pragnell and requesting him to have the fire chief of the town of Cranbrook or some other expert visit the school and make a report as to what improvements should be effected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. M.

He states that the present fire escapes would be practically useless in case of fire, and that there is no water tank and no fire hose on hand.\n\nI have to request that you will arrange to have the fire chief for the town of Cranbrook or some other expert visit the school and report as to what improvements should be effected in order to place the fire equipment in an efficient state. The expert whose services you obtain should state fully the alterations he recommends be carried out, and whether any new fire escapes should be installed, the type of same, and also give full particulars regarding the cost. The quantity of any new fire hose, extinguishers, fire buckets, etc., required, should also be stated. Particulars should be given as to the water supply and what would be necessary in order that same could be adequately utilized in case of fire. I shall be pleased if you will attend to this matter at your earliest convenience and forward the report asked for, together, if possible, with an estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

BOX 752\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\n\nDecember 10th, 1927.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your 155-0-5 of the 3rd inst., with reference to fire protection at Kootenay Residential School.\n\nBefore employing or paying an expert on the matter, I thought I had better communicate with you, in case you have overlooked the fact that a report on the proposed fire system for fire protection was made by Mr. H.H. Tredcroft, of the Dominion Water Power Branch, on May 18th, 1922. I presume that you have this report on file, but in case you have not, I can get one forwarded.\n\nThe complaint of the Principal of the School is that there is no water tank and no fire hose on hand. As you will see by Mr. Tredcroft's report, the present system of water supply at the school can only be used for domestic purposes, and it would cost far too much to get the supply for fire purposes from St. Mary's River. He makes the suggestion that the supply for fire protection be taken from St. Joseph's Creek, from which place sufficient pressure could be obtained. Details of this can be seen in the report. He also gives the cost of installing same, and the cost of hydrants and fire hose.\n\nIt would, therefore, be useless to install fire hose or tanks in the school unless the pressure can be got by some such system as suggested, which apparently is the only possible one.\n\nI myself, in a report, dated September 13th, 1923, on the Kootenay Agency, under the heading of \"School,\" stated that the fire escapes were difficult of access, and should be heightened in order to give passage to the roof in case of fire, and in my report of October 29th, 1924, I again drew attention to the unsatisfactory position of the fire escapes, and asked the Mother Superior to make certain improvements enumerated in my report.\n\nUpon hearing from you as to whether you have this report of Mr. Tredcroft's, and as to whether it is sufficient for your purposes, and an answer to your enquiries, I can then write to the Fire Chief at Cranbrook, and ask him to look over the fire escapes of the building, and possibly my report upon the fire escapes may be sufficient.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Geo. S. Pragnell)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, December 23, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to fire protection at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. The report of the Dominion Water Power Branch received in May, 1922, has reference to a supply of water for fire protection, hydrants, hose, etc., and involves a large expenditure. There are no funds at the present time for this improvement, but the Department wishes to take immediate steps to minimize the danger of loss of life in the event of fire.\n\nI should be grateful if you would make immediate arrangements for the visit of the fire chief at Cranbrook; request him to look over the fire escapes with a view to determining if they are properly located and if they are easy of access. The Rev. Principal believes that ladders should be placed from the fire escapes leading to the ground, as there is a drop of approximately twelve feet.\n\nA copy of this letter is being directed to the Rev. Principal with the request that he see that fire drill is practiced regularly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nLt. Col. G. S. T.

I should be grateful if you would see that fire drill is practiced regularly and pay attention to the other instructions in circular letter of October 6th.\n\nThe Department realizes that there is not adequate fire protection in connection with the buildings, but, at this time, I am desirous of minimizing the risk of loss of life in the event of fire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The walls need a few coats of paint and the kitchen floor of necessity must be renewed. Although measurements for same have been taken a number of times nothing has so yet been done.\n\nThe upkeep of the rooms is a duty very because of their condition.\n\nI have no doubt that if you could only see the state of affairs, you would at once see that it was remedied.\nDecember 29, 1927.\n\nDear Father Lepine:\n\nWill you please inform the Reverend Sister Alphonsus that I have received her letter concerning the painting and repairs that are necessary in the kitchen and dining room at the Kootenay Indian Residential School.

Please investigate without delay and let me have a recommendation with estimate of the cost. Would it be possible to have the older boys refloor the kitchen, under the direction of Mr. Morris, the manual training instructor? An early reply is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

The Rev.

MARY'S INDIAN RESERVE SCHOOL,\nCRANBROOK, B.C.\n\nBUILDING:\nof Fire proof construction.\n\nEXITS:\nPlenty of exits on first floor, but doors are all kept locked.\n\nESCAPES:\nAmple fire escapes, but under present installation they are useless. In case of fire the children would have to pass out of their dormitories, and either go upstairs to the top landing of the fire escape, or go through several doors and turn several corners into the private quarters of the Priest in charge, and then climb through a small window on to the escape. This window like all the others are fitted with a fly screen in addition of the storm sash, and this forms a very effective barrier at a fire.\n\nThe dormitories which before every other room in this building should be protected and without fire escapes of any kind. This would cause a panic, and the writer has personally fought a fire at this school and saw a panic amongst the children.\n\nWATER:\nThere is sufficient water on the first and second floor for domestic purposes, but absolutely inadequate for fire protection. The two last outbreaks of fire started on the top floor and on the first occasion had not chemical engines been taken from Cranbrook, nothing could have saved the building, but had there been water the loss should have been nil.\n\nAn overhead tank or cistern should be installed that would give a fair pressure of water for fire fighting purposes all over the building. The lives and property warrant this outlay.\n\nFIRE ESCAPE DOORS:\nThere should be a door at each fire escape landing, not just the small window as at present. The fire escapes should be lengthened so that the children would be able to descend without harm. At present they are too far from the ground.\n\nFIRE DRILL:\nCannot be held to advantage under present conditions. If alterations are made, I would be pleased to visit the school and put on fire drills.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOFFICE OF\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nP.O. Box 752\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\n\nKamloops, B.C.,\nJanuary 11, 1928.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your 155-0-5 of the 3rd. ulto., I am now in receipt of a report from Mr. P. Adams, Fire Chief of Cranbrook, copy of which I enclose herewith. I am not in possession of any plans of this building, and from memory, it is impossible for me to back up the statements made by the Fire Chief in his report. However, I take it that it will be understandable, and will be taken in conjunction with the plans. As far as I can see, his reports amounts to this:\n\n(1) There is no adequate water supply in case of fire. This we already know, and has already been mentioned by me in my last letter and report with cost upon the only installation possible, in order to gain water protection.\n\n(2) He mentions that the exits to the fire escapes are through windows which are blocked to some extent by storm windows and fly screens, and that doors should be placed there instead of windows. This, also, I have already drawn to your attention several years ago.\n\n(3) He states that the means of getting to these exits are blocked by closed and locked doors. This can only be rectified by an order to the Principal that means of access to the fire escapes must be kept open at all times.\n\n(4) Whilst the Fire Chief points out that fire drills cannot be held under present conditions, he means, I take it, that it cannot be done so long as these doors are kept closed. In connection with the possibility of fire drill, I should suggest that a fire alarm system, perhaps after the style of that installed in the Kamloops Residential School last year, should be placed in the building, with the necessary fire axes in glass fronted cases at all points of exits as was done here also.\n\n5. The matter of lengthening of fire escapes to the ground or near the ground is an easy matter.\n\nI notice that he does not say anything about fire hose, extinguishers, etc., but I take it that as regards fire hose, as there is no pressure from the water supply, they are useless, and possibly there are sufficient extinguishers. I also notice that he does not propose new fire escapes, only that the old ones be fixed so that they can be got at easily and made a reasonable size for exit. Of course I have not seen the letters from the Principal upon the subject, therefore I do not know what his proposals were.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nTaking all reports which you now have before you, I should suggest that Mr. Orr go over the plans with these reports in view, and make a plan of the suggested alterations, which could then be submitted for approval and estimate of cost through the Indian Agent at Cranbrook.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Sec. S. Pragnell)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report to you that I have taken Mr. Parkes of Parkes and Co., and James Norgrove to the Kootenay Residential School to examine the proposed work, and herewith enclose their respective estimates on same.\n\nThe old tile floor in the kitchen is so broken and worn that it is impossible to repair it, and it is very hard on the feet of the Sisters that have to work in the kitchen. Mr. Parkes estimate for new floor seems high, but he tells me that the cost of the labor in getting the floor in shape for rubber flooring will amount to considerable.\n\nThe Principal, Reverend Father Choinel thinks it would be useless to try doing the work by the elder boys and Mr. Morris, as there are only a very few big boys and at this time of the year they have plenty of work to do in keeping the School in fuel.\n\nYou will notice from Mr. Norgrove's estimate that the Principal has asked for considerably more work to be done, but I can assure you that it is all badly needed.\n\nI may add that Mr. Norgrove is a very reliable man, and has just completed the painting inside and out of the new R.C. Church, and the Nurses Home here, and is highly recommended by the Fathers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.H.Small,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, January 18, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, enclosing a report from the Cranbrook Fire Chief on the fire escapes at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. I have to thank you for attending to this matter and to inform you that I am today writing to Mr. Indian Agent Small, asking him to get a price on the carpenter work necessary if we carry out the recommendation of Mr. Adams.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nLt. Col. G. S. T. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBox 752, Kamloops, B. C.\nOttawa, January 18, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has had some correspondence with the Rev. Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, concerning the fire escapes. Mr. Inspector Pragnell, too, has made a recommendation and he has forwarded a report of Fire Chief Adams, of the town of Cranbrook.\n\nI should be grateful if you would immediately engage the services of a responsible carpenter to place doors where there are at present windows leading to the fire escapes. These doors should open outward. You should also ascertain the cost of lengthening the fire escapes, as they are at present too far from the ground. An immediate report is requested in this last connection. The Rev. Principal is being given a copy of this letter. He is being instructed to cooperate with you in the matter and to see that the doors leading to the fire escapes are not locked at any time. You may arrange to have fire axes placed in glass-fronted cases at strategic exit points. No unnecessary expense should be incurred in this connection. You may also get a price on a fire alarm system. If you are in doubt concerning the type on which to make enquiry, you should write to Mr. Inspector Pragnell, who arranged for the installation of a suitable system at the Kamloops School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nE. H. Small, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B. C.\nOttawa, January 18, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith further reference to the question of fire escapes at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, I am enclosing, for your information, a copy of my letter of today's date to Mr. Indian Agent Small. When the necessary alterations have been made and the equipment supplied, you should arrange for regular fire drills with various members posted at important points in the building. During the winter months, care should be taken to see that the fire escapes are kept free from ice. All doors leading to fire escapes from the dormitories should be kept unlocked, so that there will be no danger of panic in the event of fire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. M. Lepine, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nKootenay Indian Res. School,\nCranbrook, B. C.\nOttawa, January 18, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, with enclosures, with reference to the proposed improvements at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. The prices you have secured appear high. I believe it advisable for you to prepare a specification of the decorating which should be done and offer it to three responsible firms in Cranbrook. You may use the specification for the labour as prepared by Mr. Norgrove, with one exception - that pipes and radiators should be cleaned and painted. The firms submitting prices should not only quote on the labour but should supply all the materials necessary. You should get a brief specification from Mr. Parks, showing the type of paint to be used. The Department agrees that three coats are necessary.\n\nWith reference to renewing the flooring in the kitchen, the price of $800 is so considerable that the Department wishes you to secure alternative proposals, such as regular flooring or cork linoleum. These prices should be submitted to the Department, also.\n\nI am returning the first proposals for your guidance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. H. Small, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B. C.\nMr. E.H. Small  \nIndian Agency  \nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nRe fire Escape and fire protection  \nat the Kootenay Residential School Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nSir:-\n\nAllow me to submit a few remarks on the above subject matter and in that of a Report of Mr. Adams' fire Chief at Cranbrook, to yourself, report which is the result of an investigation he was asked to make at the School.\n\nMr. Adams' predecessor, Rev. Father L\u00e9pine, in a letter dated October the 1st, 1927 to the Honorable Duncan Scott, advised the Department of Indian Affairs of the uselessness of the present fire Escape, and the lack of fire protection at the Kootenay Residential School.\n\nI am aware of the fact that steps were taken by your Agency to investigate that assertion in view of remedying the existing condition of affairs.\n\nMr. Adams, fire Chief at Cranbrook, was asked to investigate and to report; he did so and was at the School on January the 5th, 1928. I have a copy of his report.\n\nI must say that I fully concur in the general lines of that report, viz., Uselessness of the present fire Escape and entire lack of water for fire protection.\n\nTwo points, however in the Chief's report might call for an explanation:\n\nFirstly:- It is mentioned that the doors of the exits on the first floor are kept locked. Now the reason for locking the doors is quite evident to the Department.- Children will run away for the mere sake of doing it; they belong to a tribe of Indians for whom freedom is supreme, and who do not seem to value the advantage of keeping their children at school. However at all times there is with the children a guardian who has ready keys to those exits. So there is no immediate risk from that source.\n\nSecondly:- Concerning that panic referred to in the Chief's report, my information differs a little from what the report would seem to convey. There was indeed a fire at the school on May the 4th, 1924; the children were at dinner in their common dining room, on the basement floor, and filed out without any panic or commotion. The fire had started on the roof of the building. It seems that Indians from the village came to the rescue, that excitement got the best of their judgment, that they climbed up to the dormitories and started breaking furnitures through the windows and doing other unnecessary damage, instead of helping to put out the flames. The Cranbrook Fire Department, called in haste, had soon done to put the fire under control before it did any too serious damage. But there was no panic among the pupils.\n\nNow coming more fully into the subject which interests us I must say.\n\nI arrived at the Kootenay Residential School on December 27th, 1927 at 7.30 P.M. to take the function and responsibility of Principal of the School. As such I am deeply concerned in the welfare and safety of the children and of the staff of the school. Having noticed that condition of affairs, I have from the start endeavoured to find a remedy to it. It seems that on that account I may be allowed to express my views in the matter.\nIt must be remarked that the words \"Fire Escape\" and \"Fire Protection\" have two different meanings. A fire escape is more immediately for the safe exit of the inmates;\u2014A fire protection is for the building and contents. So I will deal with them separately.\n\n--- FIRE ESCAPES. ----\n\nThere are two so-called fire escapes at the rear of the building; but as it was asserted by my predecessor, which assertion is now confirmed by the Fire Chief at Cranbrook, such escapes are absolutely inadequate.\n\nUnder the head; \"FIRE ESCAPES DOORS\", the report of the fire Chief's has the following: \"There should be a door at each fire escapes landing,....... The fire escapes should be lengthened.... At present we are too far from the ground.\"\n\nI fully concur in those remarks and I would suggest:\n\nThat it is advisable to keep such fire escapes as we have in their present location making to such a few alterations:viz.... 1) Opening of an easier access to them where needed. 2) Making an extension to the lower part of the fire escapes to the ground.\n\nUnder the head; \"ESCAPES from dormitories...........\" The fire Chief's reports that the children would have to pass out of their dormitories and either go upstairs to the top landing of the fire escapes, or go through several doors and turn several corners, and then climb through a small window on to the escapes.\n\nThose remarks are exact, therefore I would call your attention to two facts, and offer a suggestion:\n\n1) The two dormitories for boys are located on the top floor at the extreme north wing of the building, between them and adjoining them is the night guardian's room; the two dormitories for girls are built on the same plan at the extreme south wing.\n\n2) Fire Escapes for such ought to be provided at each end of the building, and if built would have a natural and very easy access from the dormitories through the guardian's room, and also from the stairway inside platform. This would provide the easiest fire escapes from the dormitories.\n\n--- FIRE PROTECTION ---\n\nAttention is called to the lack of water for fire protection. Chief Adams' report says: \"There is an absolutely inadequate provision for fire protection. An overhead tank or cistern should be installed that would give a fair pressure of water for fire fighting purposes all over the building. THE LIVES AND PROPERTY WARRANT THIS DELAY.\"\n\nI think there is no possibility of an adverse opinion on that matter....... I would therefore strongly recommend what has been recommended by former Principals of this School.\n\n1) That an overhead water tank be erected at the rear of the school, at a safe distance; that necessary hydrants be installed outside the premises and fire hoses on every floor.\n\n2) That the present system of water supply be extended further upstream of sufficient gravitation to replenish the water tank and keep full at all times, and overflow should be provided for that tank.\n\n3) It might be usefully remarked that water from that tank could be used for other purposes through a system of turbines for the running of various saws, motors etc.\n\nSir, I will not venture an opinion on the cost of such alterations. Estimates for the above had better be submitted by a competent engineer and a contractor.\nRemarking only that, as the report of Fire Chief Adams has it \"THE LIVES AND PROPERTY WARRANT THIS OUTLAY.\" I would suggest that you forward this letter to the Department of Indian Affairs. Views that I have expressed might prove to be of some use to them.\n\nI am Sir Yours very sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal of Kootenay Res. School.\n\nJanuary 11th 1921\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOFFICE OF\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nP.O. Box 752\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\n\nJanuary 17th, 1928.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to the subject of fire protection and fire escapes at Kootenay Residential School, I beg to enclose report that I have just received upon the matter from the new Principal, who, apparently, has just been appointed, to Mr. Small.\n\nOn looking it over, it approximately amounts to the same as the recommendations already forwarded, that is as regards fire escapes, proper doors for each floor instead of windows, as at present, and secondly, that the fire escapes should be long enough to reach within four or five feet from the ground.\n\nWith regard to the Principal's remarks upon the doors being locked, and the reasons for same, he states that a guardian always holds the keys to these exits, so that there is no immediate risk from this source. Personally, I do not agree with him. Something might happen to the guardian if a panic broke out, or he might misplace the key. If, therefore, it is necessary to keep these doors locked, I consider that they key to same should hang in a glass-fronted box, painted red, outside the door, with a small hammer chained to it, with which to break the glass if the key is required.\n\nWith regard to his remarks about the escapes from the dormitories, without the plans on hand, (which I think should be in the office for convenience in these matters), I cannot quite understand the argument. However, if it is necessary for children to pass upstairs to reach the fire escapes, this is certainly wrong. Direct access should be made to the fire escapes on each floor, one in either wing.\n\nWith regard to fire protection as I think I have already stated, you have particulars with regard to the necessary outlay and possibilities of water supply.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Geo. S. Pragnell)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, January 27, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to the matter of fire protection and fire escapes at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, I have to state the Department realizes that the protection of the building is inadequate; but, to supply water for this purpose, with the necessary hydrants and hose, involves a large expenditure and there are no funds at the present time for this improvement.\n\nHowever, the Department wishes to undertake immediately any reasonable steps that will minimize the danger of loss of life in the event of fire. The Rev. Father Choinel's letter of the 11th instant, addressed to you, has been forwarded to the Department by Mr. Inspector Fragmell. In addition to the authority which was directed to you under cover of the 11th instant, I wish you to take immediate steps to secure places from two firms on the installation of two fire escapes, one at each end of the building, leading from the night supervisor's room, which is between the dormitories at each end. The fire escapes required are steel steps similar to those already on the back of the building. Please give this your early attention.\n\nAs it is necessary to keep the exit doors on the first floor locked, the Department wishes to have a key for each available in the event of fire. The keys should hang in glass-fronted boxes, painted red, immediately inside each door with a small hammer chained to each. Anyone would be thus able to break the glass and extract the key if the emergency arose. The glass box should be no higher than 4 ft. on the wall.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

SCHOOL YOUR BLUEPRINT SHOWING FIRE ESCAPES FROM DORMITORIES IMPRACTICABLE STOP WOULD REFER YOU TO SKETCH SUBMITTED BY ME STOP CHILDREN WOULD ESCAPE BY NIGHT IF DORMITORIES LEFT OPEN STOP SEE PRINCIPAL'S LETTER JANUARY 11TH 1928 WRITING EXPLAINING MATTER\n\nE H SMALL,\nAGENT\nKootenay Residential School\nMarch 7th, 1923.\n\nMr. N.H. Small\nIndian Agent\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI received a \"Blueprint\" showing plans for a proposed fire escape to be erected at both ends of the building known as the Kootenay residential school.\n\nThe same is the Blueprint referred to in a letter from Mr. A.F. MacKenzie to yourself (March 1923, File 155-6-1) in which you are given instructions to ask for tenders for the erection of a fire escape according to those plans specified thereon.\n\nIt is evidently the desire of the Indian Department to provide in the best possible way to the safety of the children of this school, in the event of a fire; and so this communication is meant only for the purpose of seconding the views of the Department as best I can. And I think that before any further steps are taken in that matter that it is my duty as principal of this school, and as such more directly responsible for what may happen to the children, to point out some of the reasons for which the particular specifications as indicated in that Blueprint should not be carried out, but should be revised.\n\nIn fact I firmly believe it would be a mistake and an immediate cause of troubles for the school to have them carried out.\n\nI submit the following reasons:\n\nTOP EXIT.\u2014 The access to the top of the fire escape is shown as from the windows in the two dormitories. Such access must be quite free to the children. Now past experience in different schools must have convinced the Department that Indian children have an inborn tendency to try to run away; and an escape from a room where there is no guardian will afford them the best opportunity of doing so. Then by leaving that door unlocked, the children will be left unprotected during the night against visitors from the outside.\n\nBalusters.\u2014 Such as designed, the balusters might be all right for grown up people; but they afford little protection to a crowd of small children that could be in a rush from a fire. It is greatly to be feared that the smaller children might be pushed through those balusters to a sure death.\n\nLANDING.\u2014 The above remark applies to the lower landing which is specified as an OPEN END Landing, what chance would the children have in a rush? By actual measurements that lower landing is ten feet six inches above the ground. Such a jump to safety cannot be managed without the greatest risk to life or limbs, especially in a rush, they would jump one on top of the other.\n\nMoreover, Sir, the enclosed blue print does not seem to be in accordance with instructions issued by Mr. A.F. MacKenzie; for in connection with the certificate in letter of mine dated Jan. 11th, re that very same matter, Mr. A.F. MacKenzie wrote to you Jan. 27th 1923:\n\n\"The Rev. Father Choinel's letter of the 11th inst., addressed to you, has been forwarded to the Department by Mr. Inspector Pragnell. In addition to the authority which was directed to you under cover of the 18th inst., I wish you to take immediate steps to secure prices from two firms on the installation of two fire escapes, one at each end of the building, leading from THE NIGHT SUPERVISOR'S ROOM, which is between the dormitories at each end. The Fire escapes required are steel steps similar to those already on the back of the building.\"\nAccording to the above it is easy to see that the specifications contained in the Blue Print sent to you do not agree with the directions given by Mr. A.F. MacKenzie.\n\nTherefore may I suggest through you to the Department that it is advisable to revise that plan for those two end fire escapes, and that such be drawn according to directions first given by Mr. A.F. MacKenzie: viz:\n\n1.- The Exit to be through the Supervisor's room, which is between the dormitories at each end.

F. MacKenzie,\nActing, Aest. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. H. Small, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B. C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOFFICE OF\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nP.O. BOX 752\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\nFebruary 20th, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Small:\n\nI am in receipt of yours of the 16th inst., with reference to the fire alarm system for Kootenay Residential School.\n\nThe system installed here was not one of the regular fire alarm systems, but a system installed at the cost of $64.00, by one of the local electricians. It was merely a system of push buttons, fixed in certain places, with wires leading to bells on each floor, for the dormitories and class rooms. The bells were about six inches across this being the largest size that can be worked by a system of push buttons of this sort. The buttons were placed in selected places such as, just outside the Principal's office, the kitchen and certain sleeping rooms of the staff. They were lettered over the top in red paint, with the words \"Fire Alarm\", and placed sufficiently high in order that very small children could not reach and ring them.\n\nThe price for a regular fire alarm system such as is installed in certain public buildings can be obtained from any of the local electrical men, but, in my opinion, the other system is quite sufficient.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Geo. S. Pragnell)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nE.H. Small, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCRANBROOK, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose a letter I received from Mr Inspector Pragnell which explains the system installed in the Kamloops School.\n\nI can have a similar system put in the Kootenay Res School at about the same price but of course would not be concealed wiring as figured on by the Modern Electric.\n\nI talked with the Modern Electric Co this morning and they said without measuring it up they thought they could do this job at about the same price.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nE.H.Small\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 29th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, enclosing a communication which you received from Mr. Inspector Pragnell regarding the installation of a fire alarm system in the Kootenay Indian Residential School. It is noted that the system which Inspector Pragnell states was installed in the Kamloops Residential School cost approximately $54. This system consists of push buttons, fixed at certain points, with wires leading to bells on each floor, for the dormitories and class-rooms.\n\nIt is noted that the Modern Electric Company, of Cranbrook, whom you consulted, state that they would be prepared to install a similar system in the Kootenay School for approximately the same cost as that referred to by Inspector Pragnell, and you may arrange with this firm to carry out the work of installing a fire alarm system. You will be good enough to see that the work is carried out to the satisfaction of the staff of the school and yourself, and, when completed, you may forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expense, which should not exceed approximately the amount stated. The installation of this fire alarm system should receive prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. H.

It would then take care of the children on each side of the corridor at both ends of the building, also the staff and any person who might be in the sick wards.\n\nBesides these in charge having better control it would be the quickest possible means of exit in case of an outbreak of fire.\n\nGreat care however should be taken to see that escapes proper are so constructed that there could be no chance of the very small children being pushed against and through the bannisters, for if this occurred it would mean loss of life.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nFire Chief.\nRe Fire escapes Kootenay Residential School.\n\nSr.,\u2014\n\nI beg to enclose a Letter I have just received from Fire Chief P.Adams, although dated April 10th. I am not sure that his report is what you require, but he tells me that he agrees with the Rev Principal that the escapes should be from the Center rooms between the dormitories.\n\nAnd that it would be impossible to control the children if they were erected as per blue print furnished by the Department and leading from the dormitories. You have the Rev Principal's letter of January 11th which explains the matter thoroughly,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nE.H.Small,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 28, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with enclosure, concerning fire escapes for the Kootenay Indian Residential School. The proposal involves considerable expenditure and I should like to know if the present escapes, supplemented by iron link ladders, would be adequate. These ladders have proven satisfactory at other schools. They are fastened on the inside of windows leading from dormitories, by eye bolts, and, when not needed, are rolled up on the inside. They can be thrown out when required. Please see the Rev. Principal and Fire Chief Adams regarding this last scheme and let me know if they could give their approval. If they do, you should inform me of the number of ladders required and the lengths necessary. Your early attention is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Asst.

It was my business to enquire of the various tradesmen who had already complained, and of any whom I thought might have accounts. Some, I found, had apparently authorized accounts against the Department, others again were genuinely under the idea that they had. All complained of want of explanation on the Agent's part, so in order to clear up the matter of responsibility for payment, in each case I went as thoroughly as possible into the matter with them, and fixed the said responsibility as far as I could. I informed Mr. Small that it was really his duty to attend to this, and even if some of the accounts were not chargeable to the Department it was not right to practically ignore the people but to endeavor to make matters clear, and not let tradesmen and others labour under the misapprehension that the Department was to blame as it reflected seriously upon our good name. I have already reported upon the account with the Cranbrook Cartage and Transfer Company. See my letter K-G-30 of the 13th inst. The other accounts that I endeavoured to clear up, I am reporting upon separately and individually.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOFFICE OF\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nP.O. Box 752\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\n\nJune 22nd., 1928.\n\nK-G-39.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to my Inspection report, and remarks re unpaid accounts for the two Drug Stores in Cranbrook, I have to say that I have been able to clear up the responsibility for payment for several of these accounts, but there are others in which it seems difficult to fix the responsibility other than upon Mr. Agent Small who authorized these accounts, but whether or not with authority to do so I cannot find out. The first set of accounts with the Cranbrook Drug Company (Scott) I was able to clear up with the exception of one account for a foot ball and inner tube which had been supplied to the Indian Residential School. I handed this account to the Mother Superior, and informed her that she would have to pay it unless they could find authority given them by the Department for the purchase of same. If they do find such authority, I have instructed them forward the accounts to you through Mr. Indian Agent Small. I have a strong suspicion that such authority was given by the Department somewhere about the time Mr. Small took over the office.\n\nWith reference to the accounts with Messrs. Bettie Noble Ltd., the other druggist in Cranbrook, I have managed to clear up the responsibility for about $35.00 worth of goods, but there are a few items that were undoubtedly ordered by Mr. Small. I am enclosing account slips dealing with these matters, and have marked a cross in pencil against the items. The first one, as you will see, is an item for $1.00 for sheets of drawing paper supplied to the Mission School. The second one amounting to $3.85 is for pencils and tacks ordered by Mr. Small, but the druggist is not sure whether they were delivered to Mr. Small or to the School. The third one amounting to $10.80 is for two dozen slates ordered by Mr. Small and delivered to the School. Upon questioning Mr. Small upon the matter it suddenly struck him nothing regarding the last item, that he had authority from Mr. Ferrier to purchase these. I asked him, for goodness' sake why he did not submit these account to you for payment, and he did not seem to know why. I ordered him to submit same at once, quoting authority. I also ordered him to look into the other accounts, and to try to find out whether he had authority for such orders, and if he had not, he must submit the accounts to you anyway, giving his reasons why he had made the purchase on emergency.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI pointed out to him that these kind of accounts hanging around with apparently nobody willing to pay, was a hardship on the people who had supplied the goods in good faith, and that it was leading people to believe that the Department of Indian Affairs was very lax in paying its just debts.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Geo. S. Pragnell)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nKamloops, B.C., June 21st, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nInspection Report, Kootenay Agency.\n\nSt Eugene's Mission.\n\nThe matter of drinking water supply was again referred to. It seems that the present supply piped into the school from St Mary's River is seriously contaminated by the dumping operations of numerous mines higher up the river. At the present moment all drinking water has to be hauled from a spring some distance from the school. This is very inconvenient and in addition adds to the difficulty of preventing the children in the hot, dry weather, from drinking out of the sewerage contaminated St Joseph's Creek, which I have already referred to in both my previous reports. A possible solution would be placing a pump for drinking water in the building.\n\nI then took up the matter of fire escapes with the School authorities, Mr. Small, and in the evening consulted Fire Chief Adams of Cranbrook. Separately I beg to submit my suggestion, which meets with the approval of the Reverend Principal, the Master Superior and Fire Chief Adams. The latter have to thank for his keen interest in the school, and its safeguard against fire. He has offered me his services in the training of the children in fire drill, and I am writing the Principal in order to take advantage of his offer.\n\nFire Chief Adams also explained to me that the fire extinguishers in the school should be refilled. This should be done once a year. He offered, on behalf of the Cranbrook Fire Department to have them refilled at fifty cents per extinguisher, this being the cost price of filling all the city extinguishers in charge of the Fire Department, and they are not allowed to make any profit on refills. He states, and from past experience I do not doubt him, that probably no one at the school has much idea as to how these extinguishers are to be used, and would probably be trying to read the instructions amid the smoke and excitement of a fire. If his offer to refill these is agreeable to the Department, he will empty the present ones in the form of instructional drill, and see that certain chosen ones are told off to use them.\n\nThis school is still without a refrigerator. The bakehouse chimney gives a lot of trouble by smoking in certain winds, and this despite constant cleaning and attention. I think a wind cowl would eliminate this, and should suggest its installation.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to my remarks regarding the fire escapes at St. Eugene's School, and my report on the Kootenay Agency, I have to elaborate as follows:\n\nThe Principal let me have the loan of a blueprint which he had received from you, which I am marking in red pencil with my suggestions. You will see the suggestion is that the present escapes, being useless both in the opinion of the Fire Chief, the Reverend Principal and myself, should be removed to the two end elevations of the School. In this way money would be saved and as they are bolted together and fastened by bolts to the wall I should think it would be an easy matter to re-adjust them as suggested. Without a doubt, the danger is at night when the children are in the dormitories, and not in the daytime when they are in the class-rooms. The suggestion, therefore, is that the fire escapes lead from the centre window of the two elevations. These windows are full length ones, and one is in the bedroom where the Sister who overlooks the girls' dormitory sleeps, and the other in the wing of the building where the Brother sleeps who overlooks the boys' two dormitories. In this way, in case of fire, the children would file out from the two dormitories into the centre passage and up five or six stairs and through the window to the fire escape. In this way the whole movement would be in full control of somebody in authority. It would also save any possible chance of children escaping via the fire escapes, if they led directly from the dormitories as suggested, and which is feared by the Principal and the Sisters of the School.\n\nFor double security the steps could be made to pass in front of the landing window, which, if required, would give a double means of escape, even at night, and if required, offer a means of escape from the class rooms in the daytime. With a flight of stairs so handy to the classrooms, it would hardly be necessary for day use anyway.\n\nBy passing the escape from the supervisor's room, the difficulty about having to keep it locked would be obviated. I don't like locking escapes myself, as it only leads to confusion when smoke and flames are around. I hope to draw your attention to the fact that this fire escape could come nearly to the ground, and could have attached to it a further flight of steps, hinged so that it could be kept up when not in use, and merely wants pushing down to reach the end of the escape. This would prevent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to my remarks regarding the fire escapes at St. Eugene's School, and my report on the Kootenay Agency, I have to elaborate as follows:\n\nThe Principal let me have the loan of a blueprint which he had received from you, which I am marking in red pencil with my suggestions.

Both the Principal, Fire Chief Adams and myself discussed the matter from all angles, and the suggestions which I have just detailed meets entirely with their approval and covers the objections that both of them had to other suggestions.\n\nI believe, and so do those concerned, that these changes can be made by a local dealer at a reasonable cost. It is just possible that he might have to get a further length of steps, but I do not know unless measurements are taken. I should suggest that Mr. Agent Small be instructed to get a builder to lay an estimate before you along the lines suggested.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Geo. S.

However, I observe in Inspector Pragnell's report dated 21st June he makes mention of the necessity for changing the fire escapes, but stated he was submitting separately his suggestions which meet with the approval of the Rev. Principal. I take it that the blue print is to be considered as the report.\n\nAs requested, I have taken the matter up with Mr. Inspector Pragnell informing him that his suggestions have been approved and he is authorized to get a competent builder to make the necessary changes in the fire escapes. In the event of his having sent in a special report on this matter he will, no doubt, have a copy of the same for his guidance.\n\nWED/KD.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E.

This necessitates water for domestic purposes being carried from a Spring 400 yards away. St. Joseph's Creek that is giving gravity is also condemned, and can only be used for cleaning and fire protection.\n\nThis, you will understand is purely an engineering proposition, and should be gone into by a man qualified to make a report.\n\nWill you kindly authorize the proper parties to have this report made as soon as it is possible, as the health of the pupils depends a great deal of good pure water.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.H.Small,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n| DATE       | DETAIL                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| August 30th| 5 padlocks supplied Kootenay Residential School as per attached.        | 1.75   |\n\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that all expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nExaminers:\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n| Date | DESCRIPTION          | Folio | Credits | Debits | Total |\n|------|----------------------|-------|---------|--------|-------|\n| Aug. 30 | 5 padlocks - L.

This last teacher has had so far no real accommodation for her twenty pupils, other than common benches which do not afford any comfort or help to the pupils during the class hours; the teacher has no desk wherein to put anything in safety from the children.\n\nWe have nearly enough desks in the other two classrooms to accommodate all the pupils, by a judicious rearrangement and division of such between the three classrooms. In order to meet the requirements of all, we will need the desks described in the Requisition Form.\n\nIt will be seen that we ask mostly for FRONTS and REARS, as those are not in hand at all at the present time and thereby the front of the desk at the head of the class is practically useless, also the rear of the last one in the row.\n\nTrusting this will meet with your approval, and that you will be able to secure a favorable answer from the Department.\n\nI remain Yours very sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 834-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nCranbrook, B.

He had been out to the School quite a number of times making the necessary measurements, etc., required. I received a communication from Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn in answer to mine in which he stated \"that with regard to the assistance which Mr. Leask may have given in this matter, I think it would be quite in order for yourself to recommend payment of a small sum to Mr. Leask for his services.

This matter was taken up some three years ago but so far nothing has come of it.\n\nNow the need of such a pavilion is pressing. It is, in fact, necessary for the general well-being and health of our girls.

Very often too owing to unfavourable weather conditions these girls are obliged to spend the recreation time indoors.\n\nI am most anxious to have these conditions remedied and in the near future.\n\nFor the recreation grounds I also want:\n\nI) two \"Ocean-waves\" i.e., one for the boys and one for the girls,\n\nII) Two footballs and\n\nIII) two basket balls.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, April 4th, 1929.\n\nRev.

EUGENE RESIDENTIAL:\n\nThis school needs painting very badly and\nkalsomining inside. The plaster is coming down in various\nplaces. I found, too, that the tables in the dining room\nwere by no means clean. In fact the drawers to the tables\nin which the children keep their plates, etc., were very\ndirty with bits of stale bread, etc., in them. I pointed\nout that this was a poor way of keeping the plates and\ndifficult to keep clean. All the other schools do not\nuse drawers at all; the dishes, cups, etc., are washed\nand the tables cleaned and laid for the next meal, and\nif necessary, cheese cloth spread over the tables to keep\nthe dust off. Having in view the present tables, I\nwould recommend that new ones be built, without drawers,\nand plain wood top, and that Mr. Small, Indian Agent,\nbe instructed to get tenders.\n\nThis school is still badly in need of a\nrefrigerator. I found, too, that the seats in the boys'\nlavatories are not at all clean.\n\nThe windows, too, on the re-arranged fire\nescapes have not been altered as they should have been.\nPossibly the Departmental Architect can let me know\nwhether this was part of the contract for alteration,\nthough from memory, I do not think it was.\n\nThe janitor and Principal complain that the\ncapacity of the storage batteries is too small. The\nengine has to be run 24 hours per diem during the\nwinter. He pointed out to me that the said batteries\nnow only have twelve plates in them instead of the\nfifteen plates as before.\n\nThe shower bath accommodation is too small,\nas there are only three for use in the boys' wing. The\nroom where these showers are in is largely wasted room\nas it is so big. It would be better if the dividing wall\nbetween it and the lavatories was removed and a number\nof showers run round the walls of room as reconstructed.\n\nI saw the boys at manual training, and they\nare doing very good work and showing great interest\nin it.\nCRANBROOK, B.C.\n21st June 1929.\n\nSir:-\n\nI beg to enclose herewith letter from the Reverend Principal of the Kootenay Residential School and an estimate of the cost of shaker grates for the Boilers from Frank Parks and Co. of this City.\n\nThese, as you will notice will cost $250.00 for the two sets. The Reverend Principal tells me that it is absolutely necessary that these should be installed.\n\nWill you kindly advise me as to this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.H.Small,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, June 27, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, relative to the supplying of two sets of shaker grates for the boilers and also enclosing a quotation for the same. In reply I beg to say that, if you consider the replacement of the present grates to be necessary, you may arrange with F. Parks & Company, Cranbrook, to supply and install two sets of Cyclone shaking grates for the furnaces at the school. The cost should not exceed the estimate submitted by them.

Cranbrook is just five miles from St. Eugene Mission.\n\nFor some time past I have been anxious to give the Kootenay Indians better service, and I am now prepared to put another missionary in the district exclusively for the Indians on the five different reserves, yet at the same time to work in conjunction with the principal of the school.\n\nBut here the old difficulty arises. There is not accommodation in the school for both, and for this reason I beg to suggest that the Department carry out its former intention and build for the principal and his assistant a cottage in proximity to the school. In this way they would be company for each other and at the same time get a firmer grip on the whole tribe.\n\nColonel Pragnell, who knows conditions well, concurs with me, and Mr. Ditchburn, whom I have just interviewed in Victoria, has promised to submit to you my proposal.\n\nI have the honour to be, dear Mr. Scott,\n\nYours most faithfully and respectfully,\n\nJ. Welch. O.M.I.\nOttawa, July 27th, 1929.\n\nDear Father Welch,\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to a principal's residence at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. There are no funds available for this purpose at the present time, but consideration will be given when we are preparing the Estimates for the coming fiscal year. I shall be glad to have Mr. Ditchburn's report giving the details of your proposal.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nVery Rev. J. Welch, O.M.I.,\nSt. Edmund's Rectory,\nMahon Avenue,\nNorth Vancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, August 1, 1928.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have to refer to the account which you submitted, covering the cost of supplies furnished for the use of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, to the amount of $15.65. This covered payment for 20 sheets special size drawing paper, amounting to $1.00; pencils, $3.60; tacks, 25\u00a2; and 2 dozen slates, $10.80. This account was paid by cheque No. 1419, forwarded to you on June 20, 1928. A duplicate payment of the above amount was made you by cheque No. 3062, forwarded September 15, 1928.\n\nThe Auditor General has drawn attention to the duplicate payment, and I have to request that you will forward your cheque to this Department, drawn in favour of the Receiver General, for the amount $15.65 - being the amount of the overpayment.

If he finds that refund is due the Department, kindly make the same without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMessrs. Beattie-Noble, Ltd.,\nDruggists and Stationers,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nOttawa, September 25, 1929.\n\nSir,-\n\nI inclose herewith copy of a letter of the 1st August which the Department wrote to Messrs. Beattie-Noble, Ltd., Cranbrook, pointing out that, in view of the circumstances set forth, they had received overpayment to the amount of $15.65 in connection with supplies furnished for use at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. The firm seemingly fails to understand the matter, and has stated in reply that they have an outstanding account of $17.31, which amount it would appear from their letter of the 20th instant, (copy of which I inclose) has been due since the 30th April last.\n\nThe Department desires that you will look into this matter without delay with a view to effecting a satisfactory adjustment. Your full report is desired. If refund is due from this Company, you should obtain the same and transmit it to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE.H. Small, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nOttawa, September 27, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nSome years ago, there was correspondence concerning the advisability and the cost of securing electric power from the nearest power line at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. I should be grateful if you would give the Department an immediate report concerning the present situation. You should indicate the distance to the nearest power line, the owners and have a rough estimate made of the cost of connecting up with the school. The Department understands that the electric light plant is not now as efficient as desirable, and further, in the event that a frigidaire is installed, adequate power would have to be available. Your early attention is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. H. Small, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCranbrook,\nB. C.\nMr. E. H. Small,\nIndian Agent,\nCRANBROOK, B.C.\n\nSubject:- Light & Power St. Eugene Mission.\n\nDear Mr. Small:-\n\nIn regard to our conversation of today's date, on the above subject, we were in correspondence with Mr. C.E. Webb, District Chief Engineer, in regard to lighting and power for St. Eugene Mission, in February of this year.\n\nAt that time Mr. Webb stated that the requirements for this Mission would be about 40 horse-power in motors; 10 horse-power in motor appliances; and 6 kilowatts in lighting.\n\nFor this load we quote the following rate, for 2200 volt service, metered at St. Eugene Mission, on an annual contract:-\n\nService Charge -- $6.66 per month.\nUsage Charge ---- 4\u00a2 per K.W.H.\n\nDiscount for payment within 10 days of rendering account - 25%.\n\nThe customer to pay all costs of connecting of the service and of disconnecting at the expiration or the contract, unless renewed.\n\nIn regard to the cost of connection, I would like to point out that we have no service in the voltage required, available closer than Cranbrook. Therefore, the cost of connection would be the cost of approximately eight miles of line at 2200 volts, plus lightning arresters and switching, which would, I believe, amount to about $10,000.00 in all.\nMr. E. H. Small,\n\nOct. 5-1929.\n\nI regret that it seems impossible to make a more favourable rate for this business. The problem of going long distances for light loads, is the most difficult one that we have. However, I would like to state that, once the connection is made, the question of power supply to this Mission is solved.\n\nYours very truly,\nEAST KOOTENAY POWER CO., LTD.\n\n[Signature]\nGENERAL MANAGER\n\nABS/D\nCranbrook, B.C.\nOctober 9th 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI55-0-5, Sept. 27th 1929.\nRe-Light and Power for Kootenay Residential School.\n\nI made a trip to Fernie to see Mr. Sanborn, the Manager of the East Kootenay Power and Light Company Limited. Mr. Sanborn informs me that, with the cost of $10,000 to connect up the School that he considers they should have at least $350.00 per month revenue. This would be out of the question as far as the School is concerned.\n\nThere is the possibility of having more batteries installed with the present system, and that would give us sufficient power to run a refrigeration plant. This, I consider should be gone into by a competent Engineer, as I am not in a position to figure exactly what adequate power is required.\n\nFor your information, I am enclosing Mr. Sanborn's letter to me which explains itself.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.H. Small,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, October 22, 1929.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nPursuant to your conversation with the Superintendent of Indian Education, concerning electric power for the Kootenay Indian Residential School, I have now to inform you that the capital expenditure will be approximately $10,000, and the Power Company would not consider such expenditure, unless there was a monthly revenue of approximately $350. As this is out of the question, I regret that the Department can take no action in the matter at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nVery Rev.

You may arrange for the purchase of 100' of maple flooring to be used in the construction of a blackboard platform for the junior classroom. It is noted that the cost of this flooring will be approximately $18. The school carpenter is to perform the labour in erecting the platform. Relative to the kalsomining of the interior of the school, I have to say that you may incur a small expenditure in supplying the kalsomine required, but the labour in carrying out the work is to be performed by the school authorities without expense to the Department.\n\nAfter you have purchased the flooring and kalsomine, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen I took charge of the School here, the former principal informed me that our electric lighting system was defective. On investigating the matter, I found that the batteries do not hold their charge and consequently the engine is kept running about five hours a day. Our engineer informs me that the work done on the engine two years ago was faulty and that many parts of the engine are worn out. He submitted to me a list of the repairs necessary for which I enclose an estimate. Since getting this estimate I find that the governor of the engine is also badly worn, I have not yet secured an estimate of the cost of batteries. If these repairs were approved by the Department they could be installed by our engineer.\n\nI would like to have the opinion of the Department regarding the installation of a turbine system. St. Joseph's Creek runs close to the school and might be used for developing power.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you at an early date.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"J.M. Patterson, C.M.I.\"\nPrincipal.\nReverend Sir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 15th ultimo in reference to the lighting system of your School which has become defective.\n\nIn reply I would be much obliged if you will kindly advise me as to when and by whom the present system was installed, also what is the type and nature of the same; also, let me know who did the repairs two years ago which you speak of, as there is no information on file here relating to that installation.\n\nAs soon as I am in receipt of this information I shall be in a better position to consider the remedial proposals which you have suggested in your letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.B. Ditchburn\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nReverend J.M. Patterson, C.M.I.,\nPrincipal, Kootenay Indian Residential School,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nKootenay Indian Residential School,\nCranbrook, B.C., Feb. 20th, 1930.\n\nMr. W.B. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nVictoria, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nIn reply to your letter of Feb. 8th, File No. 15/5/16698, I wish to state that our Electric Lighting system is an Otto Engine, 13 h.p. 250 r.p.m. with a Canadian Westinghouse Generator, Direct Current, 10 K.W.--125 volts--60 Amp.--250 R.P.M. There is also a storage battery, 13 plates.\n\nThe System was installed when the building was built, but I do not know by whom. It was first installed in the present laundry and was run for about five years without a battery at all. Then Gould batteries were installed and in the spring of 1928 a new set of Delco batteries was installed which are at present in use but are not giving satisfaction as they do not hold the charge very long.\n\nAbout two years ago the cylinders of the engine were re-bored and a new piston furnished. The piston was manufactured by the Cranbrook Foundry and the work on the engine done by Manson's Garage, a local concern. The engine was never inspected after the work was finished.\n\nAs there are a number of problems needing attention at the school at the present time I would appreciate the favor if you would appoint a special representative to call and make a report on the condition and needs of the school. It would help greatly in my estimation in laying a solid foundation on which to continue the improvement of the Kootenay reserves.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"J.M. Patterson, O.M.I.\"\nPrincipal.\nRe - Kootenay Residential School.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI am enclosing herewith correspondence I have had with the Reverend J.M. Patterson, O.M.I., Principal of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, at Cranbrook, having reference to the condition of the electric lighting plant at that institution which is claimed to be in an unsatisfactory condition. The cost of the parts needed will amount to $271.50 f.o.b. Philadelphia, plus the repairs to the governor. Apparently the engine is an American one, and probably the new parts might be secured in Eastern Canada by the Department and shipped out to the School and installed by the engineer. This would keep the engine going for some time at least, as it would be impossible to have a report on the advisability of installing a turbine system to take the place of the present engine as the engineers of the Dominion Water Power and Reclamation Service are all engaged at present, and even in the event of a satisfactory report being received, the change could not be made for some considerable time.\n\nIn regard to the sending of a special representative to Cranbrook to make a report on the condition and needs of the School, I can send Inspector Pragnell to do this if you think it advisable.\n\nKindly let me hear from you in this matter at as early a date as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

Kootenay Indian School.\n\nMy dear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have recently returned from a visit to the Kootenay and had an opportunity of discussing the school situation with Rev. Father Patterson, the principal of the School. He has asked me to draw your attention to the following points:\n\n1. There is a small creek (Joseph's Creek) carrying open sewerage from the city of Cranbrook right through the school grounds about two hundred yards from the house. At certain times the smell from this creek is quite offensive and at all times it is objectionable.\n\n2. The sewerage from the school itself empties into a flat a few yards from the house and flows through the property to the river.\n\n3. The drinking water is now carried by pail from a spring which is close to the place where the sewerage from the School empties onto the flat. The water from St. Mary's is not safe and the Indians of the district make this an excuse for not sending their children to the school. They have no prejudice against the school itself but always talk about the impure water and the bad sewage conditions.\n\n4. Owing to the tubercular condition of the children from this district, a plentiful supply of milk is absolutely necessary. Father Patterson suggests that if the Department could enable him to buy\nten cows and a bull of the Shorthorn breed, suitable for both milk and beef, he would be able to do much towards restoring the health of the children at the school.\n\nI am told that the condition of the Indians in this district is pitiable in the extreme and the lack of care and food is playing havoc with the children. It is always several weeks after the opening of the school before they begin to recover from their previous lack of food. A nurse for the district and a plentiful supply of milk would work wonders. I am told that some of the Indians on the reserves live in a continual state of semi-starvation. One can readily understand why it is that so many of the children are diseased and that so many die at an early age.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nProvincial.\nApril 5, 1930.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. SCOTT.\n\nWith reference to the first comment in Father Grant's letter of the 29th ultimo, concerning the water supply of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, I wish to report that St. Joseph's creek, which is a few hundred yards from the main building, carries the sewage from the city of Cranbrook, which is five miles distant. However, no water for cooking or drinking is taken from this creek, and the only dangers are: (1) children drinking from the creek, contrary to orders, and (2) the odour.\n\nIt would be a very expensive proposition to divert the creek so that it would flow to the west of the school buildings or to pipe it through school property. In 1923, the Dominion Water Board were asked to investigate concerning the St. Joseph creek pollution. Their report was not received until April 15, 1925, at which time Mr. Johnston stated in part: \"Recently, several examinations have been made of the water in St. Joseph's creek, by the Acting Director of the Vancouver General Hospital Laboratories, the result of which appears to show that the danger of contamination from the sewage disposal works appears to be slight.\" Mr. Johnston offered to have further periodic tests made. In 1924 Inspector Magness believed it advisable to consider piping the St. Joseph creek so that it would not be available for irresponsible children and in order that the odour would be lost; but, in view of the report received a few months later, it was decided it was not necessary to take any action, particularly when improvement was so costly.\n\nConcerning Father Grant's second comment, it is true that the septic tank is near the school, but the drainage is away from all school buildings. The disposal, generally speaking, is the usual arrangement, and if the management is taking drinking water from a spring near the septic tank, it may be dangerous. As far as I can learn, they have had no instructions to discontinue the use of the regular supply.\n\nFather Grant refers to the necessity of carrying drinking water, by pail, from this spring because the water of the St. Mary's river is not safe. In this connection I wish to report that water has been taken from the St. Mary's river right from the\nfirst installation. The intake is above the confluence with St. Joseph's creek. In 1922, there was trouble with the intake (which is at \"G\" on the blue print hereunder); but this was remedied in 1923 by the Dominion Water Power Branch, at our request.\n\nIn 1928, Mr. Inspector Fragnell questioned the suitability of the water from the St. Mary's river because of \"dumping operations of numerous mines higher up the river\". Mr. Fragnell adds: \"This is very inconvenient and, in addition, adds to the difficulty of preventing the children in hot weather from drinking out of St. Joseph's creek. . . . A possible solution would be placing a pump for drinking water in the building.\" Mr. Indian Agent Small also wrote in 1928 that a mining and smelting company at Kimberley (approximately 15 miles away) was operating a concentrator.\n\nThe Dominion Water Power Branch was written on October 24, 1928, to have one of their engineers investigate the situation and furnish a report and estimate of the cost of providing a reliable source of water supply, which would not be exposed, in future, to contamination. Mr. Johnston replied on the 26th idem that he had asked the District Engineer at Vancouver to arrange for the investigation and report. No report has yet been received from the Dominion Water Power Branch and, as over a year has elapsed, I propose asking them for early attention. Recently, evidence has been placed on the file that the Dominion Water Power officers are making an investigation. We have lately paid an account, in favour of the Vancouver General Hospital, for 124 analyses of samples of water from the Kootenay Indian Residential School.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nApril 7, 1930.\n\nDear Father Grant:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to conditions at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. It is true that St. Joseph's creek is somewhat offensive; but, as late as 1925, several examinations were made of the water. The result appears to show that danger from the upstream contamination is slight. It would be a very expensive undertaking to pipe the water across our property. Perhaps the odour can be endured and the orders to the children relative to drinking therefrom can be strictly enforced.\n\nThe school sewage disposal system is the usual one and the natural drainage is from the septic tank away from the school buildings. I am sorry to learn that drinking water is being carried from a spring which is not far from the septic tank.\n\nThe Department has no evidence that the school's water supply, which is from the St. Mary's river, is really unsafe. Some months ago, when I received reports that the water was unpalatable, I arranged to have the Dominion Water Power Branch investigate the matter. Recently, 124 samples of water from the river have been analyzed, and I expect the report from the engineers at an early date.\n\nVery Rev. W. Byrne Grant, O. M.

This report, which will be expedited, will deal with the whole question of the water supply and sewage disposal at the school.

Cyanide of potassium and other flotation chemicals from the Sullivan Mine are blackening the base of the stream and this condition of pollution of a stream which serves the domestic requirements of Kootenay Indian Residential school has been the cause of much complaint for some time past. Careful inquiries elicited the information that although this Creek serves the school the actual drinking water is taken both for the school and by the Indians from a spring which is on an elevation slightly above the area contaminated and is therefore in no way affected by the sewerage or chemical discharges.\n\nApart from this, however, a very objectionable condition exists which is about to be partially remedied by the City of Cranbrook at St Joseph's Creek which runs into St Mary's River.\n\nInsofar as the school sanitation is concerned, however, I consider that there is greater menace to the health of the school children in the nearness of the discharge of sewerage from the school itself. This empties into a poorly constructed ditch close to the manual training building on the school grounds and is a certainly bad feature to have right under the noses of the children who are at present unable to use the manual training building on account of the stench from the discharge scarcely twenty feet from this building. Recently Father Patterson has had a trench dug to take care of this and this will probably improve the condition complained of. Moreover, an engineer of the Dominion Water Power and Reclamation Service is expected any day to look into the feasibility of carrying the water to the school from the unaffected spring referred to. If this can be done, there should be little further difficulty in obtaining a sufficient supply of potable water for the school, even though the partially clarified water from St Mary's River will have to serve in the future for laundry and other domestic services.\n\nChas. C. Perry.\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, July 8, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am enclosing, for your information, a copy of my letter of today's date to Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn. I may say that the Department is arranging for a tuberculosis survey at your school, concerning which you will be written in due course.\n\nWill you please arrange to close up the open space between the wall and the iron fire escapes. Mr. Perry believes that a strip of iron should cover this opening down the whole length of the escapes. Please have this done with as little expense as possible. Mr. Perry also writes as follows: \"Entering the main building from the fire escape, one sees on the right hand and on the left a window with a drop of several feet into the school dormitories. In case of fire, this would present a serious obstacle to the exit of the children. These windows should be taken out and doorways placed there instead, with convenient steps down to the dormitory floors. These steps would lead into the night teacher's quarters, which are between the dormitories and the fire escapes. The windows now there serve as watch windows for the teacher into the dormitories. Doors with glass could be put in so as not to interfere with the view of the dormitories by the teacher.\" Will you please arrange to have these changes made. You should see that no unnecessary expense is incurred. You may certify to the accounts yourself and forward them direct to the Department.\n\nYou may secure new bricks for the cooking oven in the school kitchen and approximately 50 panes\n\nRev. J. M.

Generally, the school authorities are expected to replace broken glass, but, in this case, the Department is giving you special assistance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\nDear Sir:-\n\nHerewith please find a copy of Mr. Assistant Commissioner Perry's report dealing with conditions he found at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, Cranbrook, B.C., while visiting the Kootenay Agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,-\n\nI have the honour to submit my report of an inspection made of conditions at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, which, with matters affecting the Kootenay Agency, was the subject of a letter sent to you from the Deputy Superintendent General dated April 7th last in which this inspection was especially ordered. As you will be aware, a report on the Agency as apart from the School has been made separately, likewise a report also on the methods of administration of Mr. Indian Agent B.H.Small.\n\nIn making this report I have before me a copy of letter dated 25th March, 1930, received by Dr. Scott from Reverend W.Byrne Grant, O.M.I., Provincial of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, New Westminster, B.C., which was sent for your perusal and enquiry.\n\nI visited this School on May 20th, where I was graciously received by the Reverend Principal Father Patterson, O.M.I. and Very Reverend Father John Welch, O.M.I. We discussed fully and frankly all that appeared relevant to a critical investigation of school conditions and affairs. The class-rooms were visited and the pupils examined and addressed. The whole building and grounds were carefully inspected. Sanitary conveniences and water and sewerage disposal means were closely examined; and suggestions offered by the Reverend Principal and very Reverend Father Welch were duly noted.\n\nMy observations, therefore, will begin with a review of the contents of the letter of Reverend W.Byrne Grant, O.M.I., above mentioned.\n\n(1) Before leaving for this School, I had been informed by you that you had brought to the attention of the Provincial Health authority the fact that the insanitary condition of St.Joseph's Creek resulting from sewage discharge of Cranbrook should be investigated and, if possible, corrected. The St.Joseph's Creek is quite a sizeable flow of water into St.Mary's River and is carried along by the larger river which discharges later into the Kootenay River near Fort Steele. In view of observations I will make hereunder under heading No.2 it is believed that the objectionable smells referred to by Reverend Father Grant emanate from the School sewerage rather from St.Joseph's Creek.\n\n(2) The school sewerage discharges so near to the School buildings as to be deemed most objectionable as well as being a menace to the health of the inmates. The manual training classes have been held in a building\n\nW.E.Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nwhich was formerly erected for the housing of pigs and which has been improvised for manual accommodation. So far in the School sewerage discharge to this building it has been possible to keep the air carry on the manual classes because of the unbearable nature of the atmosphere in this vicinity. In an effort to improve the conditions, Rev. Principal Patterson has recently had a trench dug to carry off the School sewerage discharge to the St. Joseph's Creek below the School, and thus do away with the stagnant sewage for the disposal of which no suitable drainage appears to have been provided in the past, the school grounds having been under the direction of the Reverend Sisters who may not have known just what to do. It is rather remarkable, however, that advice was not given them to allow the sewage to be discharged on the flats. The Principal purposes having the drain covered in, when completed, and this action should now remedy in large measure the objectionable features of this sewerage discharge. It will also remove the insanitary condition about the manual training class-room.\n\nReverend Provincial Grant, O.M.I., appears to have understood from his conversation had with Reverend Principal Patterson, O.M.I., that the spring water is liable to contamination from the sewage from the School which empties on to the flats. The Reverend Principal informed me, however, that he did not intend to convey the impression in his conversation that the water was not contaminated. The spring of water which serves the School and the Village Indians as a notable supply is at an elevation above the contaminated ground, and although there may be a remote possibility of this spring becoming contaminated in time, unless the draining mentioned under heading No.2 were done, it is thought that the diversion of the sewage away from the spring area will remove such a possibility of contamination. An engineer of the Dominion Water Power branch is now on the ground and may suggest a way by which the spring water used for irrigation purposes be conveyed to the School building instead of having to be carried in pails as is at present the practice.\n\nThe tubercular condition of the children at the School and some who are now in the villages appears admittedly as a serious indictment of past administration at this School. A deplorable condition exists here, in fact, a worse condition than I have seen in my twenty-three years' experience with the Indians. I found the school a veritable tubercular institution. My information from Reverend Principal Patterson, Constable Ryckman and Agent Small is to the effect that up to November, 1924, the School was conducted by about seven Reverend Sisters of Charity. These all left at that time, since when Reverend Father Patterson, O.M.I., has been in charge with other workers; that during the regime of these Sisters it was their practice to sell most of the milk and eggs and other produce in order to augment maintenance funds, disposing of these products at a rate of about $250.00 a month; that the children were given skim milk and were poorly fed;\nthat parents were forced to put their children in the School against the protests of parents, some of whom appealed to Dr. Coy, of Invermere, to give certificates of health to support their contention that their healthy children should not be sent to the Kootenay School to be contaminated by tubercular pupils known to be in the School; that children were kept in school in a tubercular condition until they were perforce sent home to die; that 50% of the pupils now in the School are in varying stages of tuberculosis; that with the exception of about two or three children the remainder are in a predisposed condition and easy contacts; that Dr. Green, medical officer, at Cranbrook has averred and has told Dr. Stone, of the Department, that if the physically unfit were eliminated from the School on medical examination, the School would have to be closed; that the enrolment of pupils was 74, five of whom died in one year, eight were sent back to their reserves on sick leave with tuberculosis in too advanced condition to remain in school; that there are about 61 children in the villages of whom the majority are tubercular; that there are at present 61 children in the School, and that the maximum pupilage for this School is 84.\n\nI interviewed both Dr. Green, of Cranbrook, and Dr. Coy, of Invermere, both of whom stated the conditions to be serious at this School. Perhaps the medical reports of these doctors on file may give some details of conditions. If such reports are not on file, something must be wrong. For if the children are admitted as pupils in tubercular condition or are allowed to mingle with other healthy pupils in such a condition contrary to the regulations of the Department, those responsible should be questioned regarding the matter.\n\nI have no reason to question the veracity of the representations made to me regarding the adverse conditions at this institution both by the local Church representatives as well as by the Department's officials in the locality of the School and medical officers having to do with the pupils. But I would advise very strongly that if the conditions are as bad as I am led to believe they are, a medical survey should be made independently of the local medical officers without delay, in order that such facts may be given the Department and may not lead to any arguments. As a lawyer, I do not feel competent to qualify, as a result of a brief visit to the School, statements of men who have been there for years and have watched the problem more closely, but I do feel that a medical survey would be a safe and proper course to take. This recommendation is not based upon hearsay regarding the School, but upon conditions, I saw for myself whilst at the institution. On the date of my visit, May 20th, 1930, there were 61 pupils, male and female, present as resident scholars. The Principal was distressed about the condition of the children who, he alleged, had undoubtedly been neglected in the past at the School. (No doubt the reports of the late Inspector R.H.Cairns (Indian schools for B.C.) would show to what extent the farm produce was disposed of here).\n\nThe children....\nThe children were being given cod liver oil with their meals. A nurse was in charge of them. One long table set apart from the others accommodated pupils whose tubercular condition had been pronounced more advanced than others; and the dishes of these pupils were gathered up after each meal and washed separately from the others to avoid contagion. The other accommodations at the School were open to the children collectively. The Principal told me that everything is being done that is now possible for these children and all efforts were being concentrated upon the health of the pupils, the institution being regarded as an educational sanatorium rather than strictly a residential School.\n\nThe Principal stated that when the Sisters vacated the School in November last, he took over a deficit of $4,000.00 which he was now endeavouring to cover. I asked him for a financial statement, which he has promised to send to you at an early date.\n\nIn order that a continuous supply of milk and eggs for the use of the children may be assured, the Principal has asked that the Department provide the School with ten cows of Shorthorn variety of milking strain, also one bull to take the place of the present scrub animal; also about 150 head of sheep laying and layer strain or poultry. At present there are 77 cows and one bull at the School. Eleven cows are at present being milked yielding 12 pails which aggregate about from 25 to 30 gallons of milk per day. In order to meet freshening and other conditions, the Principal thinks that if the animals asked for can be provided, there will be fifteen cows being milked throughout the year. There would also be beef food available, which the School has not now on hand. The 80 poultry produce about 50 eggs per day. There is accommodation for from 200 to 300 birds. Barred Rocks or Rhode Island Reds are asked for.\n\nThis year considerable farm land has been sown to crops calculated to sustain from 60 to 70 heads of cattle as well as to provide grain for the poultry.\n\nA grant of $75.00 a month is asked for also for the salary of an assistant nurse whose services would be used in the several missions in the Kootenay Reserves, as well as at the School itself. It has been pointed out in my general report of a visit made to the Kootenay Agency that the services of a travelling nurse in the villages might have a beneficial effect.\n\nStaff: The present staff serving the various school undertakings are as follows:\n\nNurse. Mrs. H. Norman. 12 years' general nursing course in England. Trains four children each month for home nursing.\n\nAsst. Matron. Miss F. Bowker. No qualifications.\n\nTeacher. Miss E. Halbrow - Intermediate Certificate and 2nd class B.C. Certificate.\n\nTeacher....\nTeacher. Miss J. Niedzwiecki - 1st Class Certificate Alberta Normal, Juniors.\n\nTeacher and Manual Instructor. Mr. S. Killen - Matric. Ontario, also manual training experience.\n\nFarm Instructor. Mr. P. Binns.\n\nCaretaker. Mr. A. Duke.\n\nCook. Miss M. Tronson.\n\nBuildings: The interior of the building is in need of varnishing and painting as well as kalsomining. Material only is wanted.\n\nOwing to the cold of winter and the difficulties of keeping the play-rooms reasonably warm, the radiators (46) which are now attached to the ceilings should be, it is stated by the Principal, put on the ground by the walls in order to overcome this trouble which is said to have been the cause of considerable sickness.\n\nThe lavatory accommodation should be re-arranged by separation of two rows of 4 toilets each which are now inconvenient and do not tend towards good discipline or sanitation. Nine additional shower apouts would result in better conditions of sanitary accommodation.\n\nThe re-arrangement of the School fire escapes, authorized by Departmental letter No. 155-0-6, January 18th, 1928, is not quite satisfactory, in that an open space exists between the wall and the iron escape sufficiently large for a child's feet and leg to go down which might cause a terrible accident should a child fall whilst numbers of following children were making an excited exit. A strip of iron should cover this opening down the whole length of the escape. This step was omitted and apparently knowingly so, for there is a strip at the top of the escape where the exit floor connects with it, showing it was considered necessary in order to avoid accident where the escape floor joins the building. Entering the main building from the fire escape one sees on the right hand and on the left a window with a drop of several feet into the school dormitories. In case of fire this would present a serious obstacle to the exit of the children. These windows should be taken out and doors placed there instead with convenient steps down to the dormitory floors. These steps would lead into the night teacher's quarters which are between the dormitories and the fire escapes. The windows now there serve as watch windows for the teacher into the dormitories. Doors with glass could be put in so as not to interfere with the view of the dormitories by the teacher.\n\nSeveral new bricks are needed in the cooking oven of the school kitchen.\n\nThe school fencing is in a state of disrepair and sufficient material such as wire and staples will be required and also some lumber of which the Principal is to give the Agent a proper estimate.\n\nA new...\nA new truck for the hay carrier at the barn is required to replace the one at present in use which is not functioning and is worn.\n\nPaint is also required for the outside of the buildings, an estimate of which is to be furnished the Indian Agent.\n\nTwo hundred (200) panes of glass are cracked in the main building. Fifty new panes will be required to replace those broken beyond use.\n\nForty (40) new mattresses are required. Half of those now in use are between 15 and 20 years old and should be replaced by the forty mentioned.\n\nTwo large enamelled washtubs in the kitchen are worn and in need of being reconditioned.\n\nIt is thought that an estimate for all the material might be obtained in due course; the labour other than that of a technical nature should be taken care of by the men at the School.\n\nIt is recommended that action be taken in the matter of a medical survey as soon as possible as it is possible that medical officers might recommend other suitable accommodations which may be found to be essential if this School is to be put into efficient use as an establishment for the proper treatment of tubercular Indian children.\n\nThe several matters reported on herein have been fully discussed with the School authorities and with our local officials, all of whom have endorsed verbally the representations made.\n\nIt is further recommended that in future a more than cursory inspection of this School be made by the Inspector of Schools at approved intervals.\n\nThe observations of Reverend Provincial Grant, O.M.I., under this head must, regretfully, be read in the light of the preceding paragraphs of this report which qualify the assertions made in regard to the alleged malnutrition of the children of the Reserves.\n\nI am assured by Constable Ryckman and Agent Small that for many years the Indians of the Agency have been generously treated in the matter of relief. The fact that this Agency contains only 499 Indians of all ages and only six reserves should be borne in mind, when stating that the estimate for relief given to 111 members amounts annually to $6,600.00, apart from all medical services, aids to agriculture and other forms of relief. One is struck with the clemency and perhaps weakness of an agent who, as Mr. Small has done, will grant relief supplies of gasoline to young Indians who have the boldness to call at the Cranbrook office with their motor cars to obtain it. During my stay at Cranbrook two Indian cars drove up to the office demanding gasoline, one of them was taking his girl to Idaho for a trip. I instructed the Agent's Constable to refuse it and they went away quite peeved.\n\nNor......\nNor should the Agency Constable's crime report for the calendar year 1929 be overlooked. This report shows Indians in this Agency having been convicted as follows:\n\n- Intoxicated.................. 16,\n- Breaking and entering....... 6,\n- Theft.......................... 9,\n- Liquor in possession........ 3,\n- Escape from custody......... 3.\n\nInvolved in these cases were fines aggregating only $110.00, while jail sentences, during which the earning power of the reserves was greatly reduced, totalled an aggregate of 179 months\u2014approximately 15 years. It is not to be wondered at, under these circumstances, that families have been disorganized and expenses incurred and travelling done by interested relatives, in addition to the losses already mentioned, all having a tendency to undo all the good that the Church and Department have been trying to do for them. The children must necessarily suffer to some extent on account of such conditions, added to the proverbial lack of the instinct of self-preservation which marks the progress of some Indian families. But this suffering does not appear to have been ameliorated to any great extent by the admitted lack of sustenance and attention given the pupils within the School, from a health standpoint, and it is therefore thought that the source of malnutrition may not be wholly traced to the Reserves.\n\nThere appears no good reason why all the Indians of the Kootenay reserves should not be able to produce a plentiful supply of milk and egg food in their abundant holdings of land. It is admitted that immigrant labour has reduced the opportunities for outside employment. It should also be stated that the Indians who occupy the reserves close to the American border\u2014Tobacco Plains and Creston\u2014gamble away their horses and cattle in their indulgence in gambling with their American Indian neighbours who have become smart in their ability to turn opportunities to advantage through the impulse of their contact with larger monetary and public means.\n\nThe only remedial measures that I can suggest are that the missionaries and our Agency officials should concentrate more in their efforts to induce these Indians to live a better mode of life and to encourage a policy of making the Indians contribute themselves something towards the means of their own advancement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas.C.Perry\nAssistant Indian Commissioner\nfor B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6453, file 884-5 part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, July 8, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 15/5/17999 of the 16th ultimo, enclosing Assistant Commissioner Perry's report on the Kootenay Indian Residential School. This report has been and is receiving the attention that it deserves. I note that the Rev. Principal has recently taken remedial measures concerning the sewage disposal and that the spring of water, which is used as a source for drinking purposes, does not appear to be contaminated.\n\nI note that there is a deficit at the school and that the Rev. Principal is preparing a financial statement, which will be forwarded in due course.\n\nA separate communication will be written, concerning the supply of milk and eggs for the use of the children.\n\nThe Department has already arranged for the calimining and decorating in the interior of the building. Will you please arrange to have some local responsible clumber report on the position of the radiators in the basement and to give a price on placing them lower, if the system will allow such action. The Department is not prepared to change the lavatory accommodation or to add shower bath facilities until a decision regarding the future of this school has been made. I have written direct to Father Patterson, authorizing him to arrange for a strip of iron to cover the opening between the fire escapes and the windows to put in doors leading to the fire escapes. Father Patterson is also being instructed to secure a few bricks for the cooking oven in the school kitchen. He has been written also regarding the fencing. A new hay carrier in the barn has been authorized, as well as replacing some window panes.\n\nGenerally, the Department asks school authorities to make replacements to mattresses; but as this school's finances are in poor condition, I have to authorize you to purchase 40 new ones, after ascertaining what sizes are required. Please make purchase from a suitable source.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. Macdonald,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E.

A pneumatic system is in use with a storage capacity of approximately 2,500 gallons. No provision is made for fire protection in the design of the plant, the capacity of which is probably about 75 gallons per minute. This quantity should be sufficient for ordinary domestic use but is entirely inadequate for fire protection purposes.\n\nQUALITY OF WATER\n\nAs mentioned previously, up to the present major consideration has been given to the question\n\nC.E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water Power & Reclamation Service,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\nof quality. Investigations in the watershed of the St. Mary's river disclosed the possibility of a large amount of untreated sewage finding its way into that stream at points varying from six to ten miles above the intake of the school system. With the object of establishing the degree of pollution and to determine the possible methods of treatment it was considered advisable to have a bacteriological analysis covering a period sufficient for this purpose.\n\nAccordingly, arrangements were made with Dr. Hill, bacteriologist at the Vancouver General Hospital, for analysis of samples to be submitted weekly. Samples were taken in duplicate at the intake and the kitchen tap in the school, in bottles supplied by Dr. Hill, and forwarded by mail to Vancouver requiring three days from the time of collection until they were placed under observation.\n\nThe significant feature of Dr. Hill's report, hereto appended, is the apparent absence of fecal bacteria during the periods February 13, 1929 to June 6, 1929, and November 30 to March 13, 1930, and their presence during the intervening period.\n\nThe absence of harmful bacteria during the periods noted may be explained by the extreme weather conditions prevalent during such periods when little or no surface drainage reaches the river, while the presence of such bacteria is apparently coincident with the freshet season and at such times as surface drainage from the watershed is general.\nFrom Dr. Hill's report it may be assumed that pollution is general throughout the period June to November, with periods of higher concentration. The positive indications seven times during the twenty-two weeks period is sufficient evidence of the prevalence of contamination. It is quite possible that if samples had been taken more often a higher percentage of positive indications would be found.\n\nThe absence of fecal bacilli at the tap coincident with their presence at the intake, as pointed out by Dr. Hill in his report, I do not think has any particular significance. Water is pumped daily and no treatment is provided, therefore one can have little reason to suppose that complete elimination occurs at all times. I am of the opinion that if samples had been taken oftener at the tap the presence of fecal bacilli would have been disclosed.\n\nNothing may be found in the chemical analysis supplied by the Provincial Analyst to prevent the use of the water for ordinary purposes.\n\nTREATMENT OF ST. MARY'S RIVER WATER\n\nTreatment of the present supply may be effected by chlorination and filtration. With a carefully applied process it is usually assumed that results as high as 99% efficiency may be attained.\n\nMechanical pressure filters in three units should be employed to give an adequate supply for backwashing and a chlorinator of an automatic type would be the more reliable in operation as\nwell as providing a greater degree of accuracy in treatment.\n\nThe results obtained with such a system would be proportionate to the care with which the treatment is applied.\n\nChlorination apparently would only be necessary during the months June to November, and should afford practically complete sterilization.\n\nPOSSIBLE SOURCES OF SUPPLY\n\nThe available sources of supply may be summarized as follows:\n\nSt. Joseph's Creek\nSt. Mary's River\nWater from underground sources\n\nThe first mentioned of these, St. Joseph's creek, while suitable for development as a source for fire protection purposes, would not prove desirable for domestic use. Sewage from the city of Cranbrook, situated about six miles upstream from the Mission, finds its way into the stream and as this sewage constitutes possibly fifty percent of the flow of the creek, it should not be given consideration for the latter purpose.\n\nIn respect to St. Mary's river, pollution is more likely to be augmented rather than to diminish for the reason that new developments at the Sullivan Mine will probably enlarge the capacity of the various plants situated in this watershed with a consequent increase in population. No sanitary measures have been taken up to the present in the handling of sewage from the communities in the watershed.\nIt will be apparent that water for domestic requirements will have to depend upon a supply from underground sources or upon a chemically treated supply from either of the above mentioned streams.\n\nIn regard to securing a supply from ground sources, no particular investigations have been made in this connection. That there exists possible sources of supply of that nature is almost an assured fact as springs are noticeable in the locality. As to whether these are fit for use or may be tapped can only be determined by tests. It is possible that these springs may be the result of seepage from St. Joseph's creek.\n\nIn considering a supply from such a source, the fact must not be overlooked that it is occasionally necessary to provide treatment for underground water to make it suitable for some uses.\n\nHowever, it may generally be assumed that a good well provides water of superior quality to that from streams which require treatment of a chemical nature.\n\nWith these points in mind I am of the opinion that the best interests of the school would be served by attempting to secure a suitable supply from underground sources even if some form of treatment should be required.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nI would recommend that tests be carried out to determine the possibility of securing a\nsuitable supply of water from underground.\n\nThe cost of such tests should not exceed $500.00 and should prove well worth while. As to the cost of providing for a supply from such a source this can only be determined after the water is found. It is possible that the present equipment could be adapted to such a supply. On the other hand, if the depth of the well exceeded twenty-five feet, new pumping equipment would be necessary.\n\nSurveys are to be carried out during the coming month at St. Mary's Indian Reserve, nearby. Supervision of well tests could be made at the same time if funds could be made available immediately.\n\nFUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the event of finding a satisfactory supply of water for domestic use from wells, the most economical development for fire protection purposes would be by gravity system from St. Joseph's creek, as it is very doubtful if a ground flow would be available at a sufficient rate for such a purpose. Such a system as outlined would cost, with complete fire equipment inside and outside the buildings, approximately $9000.00.\n\nShould attempts at securing a usable supply from below ground prove unsuccessful, development of a supply from St. Mary's river would prove more economical for both domestic use\nand fire protection purposes and could be carried out for approximately $13,500.00.\n\nHereto are appended copies of report on bacteriological investigations made by Dr. Hill of Vancouver General Hospital Laboratories, and of chemical analysis made by Mr. Whittaker, Provincial Analyst.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

(Sometimes\n2 instead of 4 samples were received.)\n\nFollowing June 6, 1929, 88 samples were\nsubmitted covering 22 weeks (one not finished at\nthis date); of these the following showed Fecal\nBacteria present.\n\n| Date       | Description          | Lowest Amount of Water showing positive |\n|------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| June 12    | Tap (Dup. Samples)   | 10 cc.                                 |\n| June 19    | Intake (one dup.*, one -)* | 1/10cc.+in 1 Dup.*                     |\n| Aug. 14    | Intake (one dup.*, one +)* | 1 cc.                                  |\n| Sept. 6    | Intake (one dup.*, one +)* | 1 cc.                                  |\n| Sept. 13   | Intake (one dup.*, one +)* | 10cc.                                  |\n| Oct. 26    | Intake (one dup.*, one -)* | 1/10cc.+ in 1 dup.*                    |\n| Nov. 8     | Intake (one dup.*, one +)* | 1/10cc.                                |\n| Nov. 18    | Intake (one dup.*, one -)* | 1/10cc.+ in 1 dup.*                    |\n\nThe proportional numbers of fecal bacilli\npresent are indicated roughly by the amount of water\nrequired to give a positive test\u2014thus the tap showed\nfecal bacilli once only and then in 10cc. The Intake\nhowever showed fecal bacilli seven times in all; six\ntimes in the last four months as against once in the\nprevious five months; on one occasion they were found\nin 10cc.; on 2 occasions they were found in 1cc., on\n3 occasions in 1/5cc.; the last three now complete\nshowing twice in 1/5cc., once in 1/10cc.\nIt is fair then to assume that fecal bacilli have been increasing in frequency and concentration since June.\n\nThe freedom of the tap sample from fecal bacilli (except once, and then only in 10cc) suggests that the water becomes rid of the fecal bacilli in its passage from intake to tap. Knowing nothing of the lay-out of the supply we cannot offer any specific explanation for this change. Lapse of time, opportunity for sedimentation, filtration, chlorination, etc., would of course act to diminish them between these two points.\n\nAs to further samples being necessary, I suggest that you decide thus\u2014if our results so far are consistent with increasing contamination of the supply as evident from inspection I should think no more samples were required. But if our results are not consistent with the inspection results and further analytical evidence would help to elucidate the discrepancy, it would be well to run tests to next February, thus furnishing figures for one complete year.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n(H.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:-\n\nRe: St. Eugene School,\nStorage Battery,\nElectric Light Plant.\n\nAs requested by you I made an inspection of the above mentioned plant and wish to report as follows.\n\nThe present battery, a Delco, was installed about three years ago and although it has had to carry a considerable overload, it has stood up well which is probably due to the good care it has received. While it apparently has not yet served its useful term of life, it is undoubtedly inadequate for the service for which it was intended. This battery has a capacity of about 160 ampere hours and should not be expected to provide current at a greater rate than about 10 to 15 amps her hour for continuous service or sufficient for about 50 lights whereas the maximum demand is about double that rate, as a result of which the battery becomes fully discharged early in the evenings, especially during winter time.\n\nThis necessitates the operation of the engine driven generator to carry the load for a large part of the evening. As this machine has an output of 80 amps at full load the efficiency is not very high when operating at less than half load or about 4 amps, the normal lighting load.\n\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\n739 Hastings Street West,\nVANCOUVER, B. C.\nIt will be apparent that a smaller engine plant would be more suitable except for the fact that the laundry machinery is operated by electric motors and requires about 5 K.W. which the large plant will handle nicely and charge the battery at the same time.\n\nThe installation of a larger battery would provide a greater operating economy. I would suggest a battery of approximately 300 amp. hours capacity which would take a higher charging rate and would not require the operation of the engine plant every evening as at present.\n\nThe installation of a new larger battery would not require the scrapping of the present battery as they may be run in parallel until such time as the old one is completely worn out.\n\nMr. Ditchburn has suggested a made in Canada battery. I am under the impression that there is not any completely made in this country.\n\nThe battery installed at Sechelt cost about $1360.00. It is an Exide, supplied by the Crawford Battery Company of Vancouver and has given good satisfaction for the past three years. Any other make of equal rating at a price equivalent to that suggested, should give equally good service.\n\nI would suggest that if it is the intention of the Department of Indian Affairs to have a new battery installed, that it should\nbe undertaken before the 1st of October as at that time the demand on the plant becomes heavy and the replacement would be most useful to the school.\n\nIn addition to the outlay for the battery which has been estimated to cost $1360.00 f.o.b. Cranbrook, some additional expenditure amounting to about $150.00 would be necessary for fixed resistance switching and wiring to charge the two batteries in parallel so that the cost of the new battery installed would amount to about $1500.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Tests are to be made as to the quality and purity of the spring and if it should provide a suitable supply it may not be necessary to expend the $500 authorized in your letter of the 12th instant for the sinking of test wells.\n\nA further report is expected in the course of a few days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Ryckman, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAfter having made a careful examination of the heating system in the basement of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, I beg to submit the following for consideration.\n\nPrimarily, the mains in the rooms inadequately heated should have the asbestos covering removed. This would make an approximate difference of one foot of radiation for each foot and one half of pipe uncovered, which would make an appreciable difference in the heating of the rooms as will be readily seen. Care should also be taken, in the event of the radiators remaining in their present positions, to have them properly vented at least once each week, through vents supplied for that purpose and now in place.\n\nAs hot water is the system used in heating the School, the radiators will not function if placed below the mains, which are at present some three feet from the ceilings of the rooms. And as it is desirable to have the heat circuits run as closely to the floor as possible, I would suggest that this could be accomplished by having one or more electric fans playing on the ceiling in each room. I would also suggest that this be tried out in one room only, and if it is then found that it functions satisfactorily, the remainder of the rooms could be similarly equipped. I would suggest, also, that the storm windows should be supplied for all basement windows.\n\nIn the heating of these rooms, two other courses are open. First, the radiators now in use to be removed from the ceilings and placed near the floors. Second, these radiators remain where they now are and additional radiators placed near the floors. In either case it would necessitate new mains being installed, but these would be smaller than those now in use and would be run under the floors.\n\nAs either of the above would be rather costly, I would strongly advise that the use of electric fans, as recommended, be given serious consideration. The cost of this will be very little, and if it does not prove entirely satisfactory I shall be pleased to submit estimates of the two other systems as set forth above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPatmore Bros.\nPer H.S. MacLaughlin.\nWith further reference to Departmental letter dated July 6, instant, No. 155-0-5, I have the honour to make reference to the proposal suggested with respect to the readjustment of the heating system at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. The Department's instructions to have a steam-fitter report on the position of the radiators have been duly carried out, and I am in receipt of a report made by Messrs. Patmore Bros of Cranbrook, B.C., copy of which is sent herewith and will be self-explanatory. This report will explain some of the difficulties to be met with in the changing of the present system.\n\nMr. MacLaughlin of the Patmore Bros. Company states that had the heating been steam instead of hot water it would have been fairly easy to move the radiators for the steam could be forced downward, but that this cannot be done with hot water. Mr. MacLaughlin states also that provided the asbestos covering is removed from the mains there is ample radiation in the rooms as they now are, but that the heat remains near the ceilings and the floors will always be cold unless some method is used to force the heat down. It is for this reason that the use of electric fans has been recommended, and it has been submitted that if this proves to be satisfactory it will be an easy and inexpensive solution of the difficulty. As the number and cost of these fans have not been stated in the correspondence, I have written to ascertain further information and this will be forwarded to the Department in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, August 1, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a copy of the report of Mr. Webb, of the Dominion Water Power Bureau, which has reference to the lighting plant at the Kootenay Indian Residential School. I understand he made the examination at your request. If you have not already written the Department in the matter, please let me have a recommendation. I understand that you have a copy of the report. The Appropriation for Indian Education is completely assigned and the improvements that can stand until next year will have to wait; but, if a new and larger battery is really required this year, it may be possible to find funds for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

No definite arrangements were made regarding the purchase of a 23 plate battery set, as suggested by the Principal for service in the operation of a freezing plant as well as the general lighting plant, until a report could be had from an engineer of the Dominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau, whose advice was thought advisable before acceding to a request made by Reverend Principal Patterson that he be allowed to purchase a battery set in New York which would have cost approximately $1800.00 laid down at Cranbrook.\n\nThe set now proposed by Mr. Engineer-Warren to be purchased in Vancouver, B.C. would cost about $1800.00 installed at the School, and I would recommend that authority be given for the purchase of the set recommended in Mr. Warren's report, copy of which was forwarded to the Department on July 29th ultimo from this office, addressed to the Secretary and annotated for the attention of Mr. Orr.\n\nIt is thought that if funds can be made available now for the purpose this should be done so that the plant might be put into efficient condition before the shorter days come for service during the winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Ryckman, who is in charge of the Agency, dated August 1st, together with quotation received from the Modern Electric Shop, Cranbrook, on fans proposed to be installed as previously reported on.\n\nIt will be noted that it is proposed to try these fans out first in one room only, using two fans, the cost of which will be $31.00 each and if these are found successful it is proposed to install ten more, making twelve in all in which event the sum of $38.00 each would be charged for the twelve fans.\n\nIn view of the report of Mr. Ryckman and of the recommendations of Messrs. Ratmore Bros., I would recommend that the Reverend Principal be advised to have the asbestos removed from the leading pipes as suggested in the report of Messrs. Ratmore Brothers' steam fitters, dated July 26th, ultimo, which was sent to the Department with my previous letter. It is thought that the removal of the asbestos covering will provide sufficient additional radiation to make a considerable improvement in the temperature of the building. At least, this could be tried as an experiment and if it is found not to meet the requirements then two fans might be purchased later if circumstances warrant. I would not recommend the purchase of fans, however, unless it is shown that the stripping of the pipes would not be effective.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E.

September 29th, 1930.\n\nMr. W. E. Ditchburn,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your recent letter regarding lighting repairs, and installation of batteries, I find that we are getting better service from our lighting plant since it was overhauled and a new engineer placed in charge. While the engine was being overhauled, however, it was noticed that the crankshaft of the engine was in bad shape, so that it was dangerous to continue running the engine for any length of time without a new one. I mentioned the matter to Mr. Warren, and he told me to order a new one as soon as possible. Accordingly I wired the Otto Engine Works and had a new crankshaft sent by express. I shall send the receipted vouchers to your office for payment as soon as I have them.\n\nIt is costing me about $150.00 more or less to have the engine parts installed by a competent engineer. I would like to know whether, in view of the many extra expenses we have had to meet this summer, it would be possible for the Department to pay this account? We need this assistance especially at the present time.\n\nI am glad that Mr. Warren has taken up the water supply question again. I hope that his findings regarding the springs have been favorable as a fresh supply is very much needed for the school. We find the children much improved in health this year, and we are doing everything we possibly can to keep them so.\n\nThanking you in advance for a favorable reply, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"J. M. Patterson, O.M.I.\"\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a letter dated September 29th, ultimo, received by me from Reverend J. M. Patterson, O.M.I., Principal of Kootenay Indian Residential School, Cranbrook, B.C., in regard to repairs which he states he has found necessary to have done to the electric lighting plant of the school. The letter will be self-explanatory. In view of its contents it is deemed advisable under the circumstances to recommend that the Department's favorable consideration be given thereto as to reimbursement of the sum of $150.00 upon submission of a properly rendered account. If the Department is favorably disposed in this matter and will so advise me, I shall be pleased to submit the account, when received in good order, attached to an official voucher certified for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

In reply I have to say that you may submit a properly certified voucher, in duplicate, covering reimbursement to the Principal of the sum of $150., for the expenses incurred by him in having the engine parts installed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

STONE'S REPORT\non\nKOOTENAY RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nThe Principal has made some unauthorized urgent expenditures, especially to provide for ventilation of the dormitories. He will present the account and I think should be reimbursed, at least for the ventilation work, which was quite necessary and well done.\n\nThat the water supply should be put in shape at the earliest possible moment. There are scarcely any big pupils and the drinking water will have to be carried or drawn about 500 yards. This is not suitable winter work for the pupils, who will have to do some of it, at least.\nEXTRACTS FROM DR. STONE'S REPORT\n\nKOOTENAY RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nPROPERTY:\n\nThe property is badly run down. The outside woodwork needs painting, the laundry is in a bad condition and some minor repairs to plumbing are needed. The sewage system has been overhauled and is now much improved. Fences and grounds are untidy and the ground about the barn very unclean. I am satisfied that these defects will be remedied in time under present management, but I have some doubt that the appearance of the barns and fences will ever correspond with the efficiency of the farm and dairy. The standard of the outside people is that of the western farmer and results will be valued rather than appearance.\n\nWATER SUPPLY:\n\nThe facts are, I believe, on record. Both the streams available are grossly polluted. Washing water comes from the St. Mary's River, but drinking water has to be carried from a spring which is not well protected from contamination. It will be almost a calamity if this cannot be remedied this fall. There is a spring 1/2 mile west of the school which, I am told, will give an ample supply for all purposes, and which can be connected with the present intake by about 1/4 mile of pipe line. This is the most urgent matter in connection with the property, that I observed.\nOttawa, November 7, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to your 2543-W \"A\" of July 24th, last, concerning the domestic water supply at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, near Cranbrook, B.C. The Department has not yet received the further report referred to in your letter, and, as improvement to the present system is urgent, I should be grateful if you would let me have a recommendation at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

We believe that general tenders have been called for and we have been in touch with at least one contractor who has put in his tender, namely, Mr. Jones at Cranbrook.\n\nIt has not been our privilege to have a copy of the specifications in connection with the steel equipment such as stalls and stanchions as may be required for this particular job and if detailed specifications have been prepared we would very much appreciate receiving a copy.\n\nYou, no doubt are familiar with our goods as they have been purchased from time to time for the various barns built in connection with Indian Residential Schools. As you know, our goods are manufactured in Fergus, Ontario and we maintain a branch here where we carry a full supply ready for immediate shipment.\n\nAnything you can do to either specify our goods or recommend their use for this particular job in case the work is given to a general contractor would be very much appreciated indeed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBEATTY BROS.

It is not considered that they are entitled to receive the same in addition to an allowance of 10%. A cheque No. 5869 drawn for $507.20 is enclosed in full settlement. Kindly explain the matter to the firm.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF.S. Ryckman Esq.,\nIn Charge Indian Office,\nCranbrook, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that a Christmas Tree entertainment is being arranged and will be held at the Kootenay Indian Residential School during the Christmas week.\n\nDuring the past year the children have made such exceptional progress with their studies, and their conduct in and out of the school has improved so greatly that I beg to suggest that if the Department would consider donating a small sum, say from $20. to $50., for the purchase of prizes or gifts for the children, I am certain that it not only would be greatly appreciated by the pupils, but would tend to stimulate interest in the school work. This I beg to submit for the consideration of the Department.\n\nI also beg to suggest that as Mary Justin Edward of Columbia Lake Reserve will have completed her term at the School on January 1st next, and as this girl's conduct while in school has been particularly good, and her work, especially dress making, etc., has been outstanding, that if the Department would consider supplying her with a sewing machine, it would be greatly appreciated. I beg to state that Mr. P.W. Willis, local agent for the Singer Sewing Machine Company, has offered to place a singer machine, style 127-3-6, that regularly sells at $105.00, for the sum of $50.\n\nThe above is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. S. Ryckman,\nIn charge Kootenay Indian Agency\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nOttawa, December 12, 1930.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant relative to the providing of a grant to purchase prizes or gifts for the pupils of the Kootenay Indian Residential School, to be given them at Christmas. In this connection I have to say that it is not the policy of the Department to provide grants for this purpose at Residential Schools. It is expected that the school authorities will provide the cost of any supplies for a treat to the pupils at Christmas from their per capita earnings or other receipts. Our funds for the present fiscal year are entirely assigned and it is therefore regretted we will be unable to consider the providing of a grant to purchase gifts for the pupils of the Kootenay School.\n\nYou will be written in a separate communication regarding a request to supply a sewing machine for the use of Mary Justin Edward who will be discharged from the school on January 1st next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.
