As you will note, there is some minor work to be done on the building. Mr. Krawchuk also advised that we should have at least one year's guarantee on the roof, as he considers there may be a leak in this roof - but he will be unable to tell for sure until the summer. I have advised the North American Buildings Ltd., of this, but I consider their contract carries a year's guarantee and probably this will cover the roof.\n\nThe workmanship on this building appears to be very good, and I consider a good job has been done, with the exception of this trouble which may occur in the roof.\n\nEnclosure\n\nR.S.

Father Langevin, Coadjutor to the Archbishop of St Boniface, some weeks ago made an application to reopen the Roman Catholic School on Gamble's Reserve, Birtle Agency, closed in the earlier part of 1836, as the Department was informed by letter from this office dated the 6th July 1836. Before transmitting to you such request for your approval I have communicated with the Indian Agent at Birtle in regard to the probable number of children of school age who could attend. The answer is not satisfactory, there being hardly over four pupils in a position to do so. The church authorities, however, state that they have been repeatedly asked by the Indians to open such a school, and have already built a new house for the purpose and engaged a qualified teacher who will open the school on the 1st of March and will not be deterred from doing so either by the small population of Indian children or the possible inability of the Department to help them under the circumstances, of which they have been advised.\n\nThe Deputy of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nThe Reverend Father wishes to ultimately establish a Boarding school there and as the Qu'Appelle Industrial School has now reached its full number of pupils, it will be for the department to consider whether this application might not be granted and make this school a centre for the Roman Catholic children of the Birtle Agency, in which case adequate provision should be made in the Estimates for next fiscal year.\n\nThe Rev Father Langevin also wishes to reopen the pay School on Kaaseekouse's Reserve, Pelly Agency as soon as a good teacher can be found, the same to be turned into a Boarding school later on when the church authorities will be able to provide competent persons to manage it.

There is no Catholic school except at a great distance.\n2. Because the objections against its establishment are not in accordance with the instructions I possess.\n\nNo Catholic school in the neighborhood. To prove this assertion, I tabulate here below all the schools of Treaty No. 4, as indicated in the annual Report of the Department of Indian Affairs for the year ended 31st June 1893, pages 288 to 294.\nThere are therefore thirteen Protestant schools within the limits of Treaty No. 4, while there are but three Catholic schools, and the Indians of the Reserve of Bitter Lake have to pass near the door of four Protestant schools, to reach the nearest Catholic school.\n\nThis is considered, by the Indians, as a great inconvenience, and it cannot be denied that it is an inconvenience.\n\n2nd The information I possess does not\ndo not agree with what you state in your letter. You say: \"not more than four pupils being reported as in a position to attend this school.\"\n\nRev. Father Allard was on the spot at the first announcement of the school. Six children were there before his eyes; a few days after they counted eleven in the school, with the assurance of an increase immediately.\n\nYou say also that \"nearly all the other children of school age having been transferred in the Qu'Appelle Industrial School.\" The Agent of Birtle knows more about it and so do I, as I have often received complaints on the subject and many parents strongly object to sending their children to Birtle Industrial School.\n\nBesides, you add: \"also on account of no provisions having been made for it.\" Your letter shows that this obstacle is not insurmountable, since you state that it would be better to make provision for receiving the remaining pupils from this Reserve at the Qu'Appelle school.\n\nUnquestionably the Department may do so if it chooses, but I cannot forget that you refuse to pay for the maintenance of several...\nseveral children who were actually in the Qu'Appelle Industrial School because, as stated, they were over and above the number allowed, though in reality, an equal number of children, counting as pupils, had been absent, some of them for over a year. They were not discharged; they counted as belonging to the school and those who replaced them and who were actually in the establishment were refused recognition.\n\nWhen I wrote to you I knew that Mr. Forget had given a negative answer to Rev. Father Laveau, but I thought that owing to your position in the department, you could obtain what had been refused through one of your subalterns.\n\nI still hope it will be so and suggest that the said school should be recognized.\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHayter Reed, Esq.,\nDeputy of the Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nOut.\nMy Lord Archbishop,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Grace's letter of the 14th instant, and regret to find that Your Grace is not satisfied with the grounds upon which the Department bases its inability to give assistance towards re-opening a school at Gambler's Reserve, and should feel compelled to still insist upon such being done.\n\nIt is hoped that the following fuller explanation of the Department's policy will convince Your Grace of the impossibility of consistently meeting Your Grace's wishes in this direction, much as it always desires to do so when it can.\n\nThe Department's policy has been to provide as far as possible Industrial and Boarding Schools, not alone on account of their superior advantages as compared with Day Schools, from which experience has proved that little benefit is derived, but also to enable children to be removed to a distance from contact with the objectionable influences of the Reserves, and consequently brought more fully under that of their preceptors. When these Industrial and Boarding Schools were established it was with the understanding that they would\n\nHis Grace\nThe Archbishop of St. Boniface,\nSt. Boniface,\nManitoba.\nwould, to a considerable extent, enable the Department to dispense with Day Schools on the Reserves, which, as already said, have been found to be of little benefit, and indeed it is only the greatest retrenchment with regard to the latter class that at all justifies the cost of maintaining the former, or enables it to be met.\n\nIt may be observed in passing that in pursuance of this policy in the District to which Your Grace makes reference Day Schools have been dispensed with at the Crooked Lakes and Muscowpetung Agencies respectively, and at the latter, and largely with a view to enforcing cultivation of the Industrial School at Regina, the Boarding School at Lakes End, one of those mentioned by Your Grace, has recently been closed. In this connection it may be mentioned that another of the schools referred to by Your Grace, namely, a Day School at Turtle Mountain, although countenanced by the Department, has received no grant from it.\n\nThere are of course Reserves where circumstances require Day Schools still to be maintained, but wherever the number of children and other circumstances are such as to make it possible to provide for the children by sending them to Industrial or Boarding Schools, (and the Department considers that Gambler's Reserve belongs to this class,) it is felt that such should be done, and until children from such Reserves have been accommodated those at Reserves where there are Day Schools made to attend them.\n\nExperience\nExperience has proved that exercise of energy and persistence does succeed in getting parents to send children to a greater distance than separates Gambler's Reserve from Qu'Appelle, and it is hoped Your Grace will recognize that the superior advantages more than compensate for any inconvenience which the parents complain of, and that they should be encouraged to send their children to Qu'Appelle as vacancies occur.\n\nYour Grace reminds me that the department has refused to pay for the maintenance of children at the Qu'Appelle School, on the ground that they were over and above the number authorized, though an equal number had been absent, some for over a year, and the Department admits that with a view to insure to children such length of residence at these institutions as can alone confer any lasting benefit it has had to adopt a system of payment calculated to counteract indifference about letting children leave in the expectation that the admission of others would earn the grant, and it may be added that the excellent results which have accrued from the enforcement of this regulation afford its strongest justification.\n\nThis, however, is in no way inconsistent with the Department's desire to give to as many as possible the permanent benefits to be derived from the Industrial Schools, and with this end in view the Department has been recently curtailing severely in various directions, to enable it to get together funds for\nfor additional accommodation at the Qu'Appelle School,\nwhich is now on the point of being given.\n\nI have the\npleasure\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy of the Sup't General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nP.S.

Vide teacher's register; and inclusive of the 17th inst., there had been thirteen pupils enrolled; the names, ages, total days each attended and absent, and other information is herewith attached. There are five other children in fairly good health, of school-age, on that reserve, that should attend school. Their parents\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6250, file 567-5, part 1)\nnames are Shahmanitourgivam, boy aged 6 years; Manitourgivam, girl aged about 8 years; Jandrew, boy aged about 11 years, claimed by father not to be in good health; and two children of Louis Meas.\n\nIt is reported that Manitourgivam will not agree to place his girl at any school, and that two of Louis Meas were baptized by the Rev. Geo. Scott, Presbyterian missionary, which is probably the reason why he has not already sent them to the day school, with pupil W.S. If this school on the reserve is continued, I approximate the average attendance, out of the pupils named above, and on abstract, at five.\n\nThere are however 12 pupils at the Bible boarding school, from that reserve, that any day may be removed by their parents, if the Principal does not conduct the school in accordance with their views.\n\nIf these 12 are removed, and attend the school on the reserve, they will probably do so about one half the time, which would make the attendance average 10 or 12.\n\nOn Saturday last, Ingoose sent his son here for one of his children, and Principal McLean refused to allow him to go, when he\nhe was told that Bigoote would come down and take all his children (4) from this school, and place them at the school on the reserve. I anticipate that he will carry out his threat, and if the teacher at the reserve school does not meet his wishes, he will probably keep them at home, or return them to the Bible school again, if allowed to do so.\n\nI think that you will agree with me, that my position in this matter, between the two Christian denominations referred to, is not an enviable position, as there will be a clashing of interests, if the school on the reserve is to be continued; and to guard against this, and check as much as it is possible to do, the arraying of one school against the other, and dictation as to management of both schools by the parents of the pupils, I respectfully request that Mr. Principal McLaren, of the boarding school, be authorized to strike off the names of pupils so removed, from his roll, and authorized to substitute other pupils in their place.\n\nYours,\n\nJ.

It had been said that there were no children for the school; the facts contradicted.\ncontradicted the statement and to make it good, means were taken to keep the children away from the premises. It may look a great achievement on the part of the performer, but the least I can say is that I consider the proceeding as very strange, owing to the fact that you yourself were corresponding with me on the subject, but where there is a will there is a way.\n\nThat the Department would think it proper to refuse assistance, your letter had prepared me for that conclusion, but I was not prepared for that summary way of ending our correspondence. I confess that I find very little relief when you say: \"Parents should be encouraged to send their children to the schools.\" You have named but one school and the very one into which it is certain that the children would not be authorized to enter, while you do not mention other schools, where they would be received, and towards which they are directed by constant efforts.\n\nThere is no question, of course, of the superiority of Boarding or Industrial Schools over the Day School. The only question for me is the difficulty with which we can establish such schools and our striking instance of such difficulty so that each renewed by Bishop\nBishop Pascal, of Prince Albert, he has not an Industrial School in his whole diocese and you know all the difficulties and the little encouragement he has met in trying to start one.\n\nI cannot be blind nor am I blind as to what the Department is doing in the direction of affording school facilities to the Indians, but I am in a position to see what is going on, and the difficulties by which certain schools are surrounded compared with the facilities afforded to others.\n\nIt is the old and unpleasant conviction which is received and sustained almost every time we have to deal with the Department respecting school matters.\n\nWhen there are exceptions to the rule, I am very happy to see and acknowledge it.\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n+ Aly.

At the request of many Indians of that Reserve\nwe asked for a day-school sending in the meantime\na school-teacher, Mr. Clement, because we thought\ncandidly that this helped the cause, being not all\nan intrusion on the rights of the Department.\n\nII. His Grace, late Archbishop Tache, our lamented\nfather, made a mistake in the petition; he\nput \"Gamblar's Reserve\" instead of Way-way-see-cappi.\nThe consequence was that while you rightly pointed\nto him that there was not a sufficient number of\nchildren on \"Gamblar's Reserve\" to keep a school going\non.

They put up a building and opened the school on the 14th of March, 1895. The Department never assisted this school, and, so far as it is aware, it was only carried on for a short time. Mr. Markle, then Indian Agent, who reported on the opening of the school, stated: \"I think you will agree with me that there will be a clashing of interests between the two Christian denominations, Presbyterian and Roman Catholic, if the school on the reserve is to be continued.\"\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nIndian Industrial School\nat Pine Creek\nCampbellville, Ont.\nMay 18, 1916\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOntario\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am just in receipt of a communication from the Indians of Hazard Point reserve and signed by the chief and his two councillors. They are asking for the opening of a day school on their reserve. There is none on their reserve. They have informed me, and their children, Catholics and non-Catholics, are growing up without any education. They state in their letter that they are opposed to send their children to any kind of school, Boarding or Industrial, Catholic or non-Catholic, away from their reserve. Our Catholic missionaries has been visiting their reserve and also says that the children there are growing up uneducated though the parents seem to be anxious to send them to a day school on their reserve, if there was established.\n\nWould you kindly let me know what your Department could do for them to give them satisfaction if it is possible; we all know that your Department, in matters of education of Indian Children, has always been generous and has always given them the best means to attain civilization.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Leonard, Principal of the Pine Creek Boarding School, writes the Department stating that the Indians of Lizard Point (Waywayseecappo's Band No. 62) wish to have a day school on their reserve, as their children are growing up without education.\n\nThere are 204 Indians in this band, 80 of whom are Presbyterians, 43 Roman Catholics, 80 pagans and one Anglican. There are 46 children of school age, 15 of whom are enrolled at the Birtle Boarding School and one at Qu'Appelle, leaving 30 children without any educational facilities. The 15 children at Birtle should account for nearly all the Presbyterian children on the reserve.\n\nIn 1894 Mr. Markle, who was then in charge of the Birtle Agency, reported that the Roman Catholics had put up a school-house on the reserve, which was opened in March of that year with an enrolment of 13 pupils. The Department never recognized or assisted this school and as far as it is aware it was only carried on for 25 days. Mr. Agent Markle, who reported on the opening of the\nthe school stated that \"I think you will agree with me that there will be a clashing of interests between the two Christian denominations, Presbyterian and Roman Catholic, if the school on the reserve is to be continued.\"\n\nThe correspondence regarding this school ceased in October, 1905, and the only subsequent letters received have been from the Presbyterian Church authorities protesting against the Roman Catholics having a school on this reserve. The Roman Catholics would certainly object to the school being placed in charge of the Presbyterians and, as it would be impracticable to have two schools there, I do not see what can be done, unless they would agree upon an undenominational school.\n\nShould you care to entertain the application for the establishment of a school on this reserve it might be well to have a report from Inspector Jackson and Agent Wheatley as to the educational needs of this band.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This would entail, if a day school was opened, the necessity for vans to be in operation to take the children to the school. The expenses would be large and the attendance, in my opinion, would not be satisfactory unless compulsory attendance was strictly enforced.\n\nThe object of the Indians in wanting a day school opened on the reserve is to keep them from sending their children to the Boarding schools; this applies especially to the parents who are Roman Catholics who are adverse to sending their children on account of the long distances of their schools from their reserve.\n\nA number of parents, Roman Catholic, were willing to send their children to the Birtle Boarding school but as the regulations does not allow this I urged the parents (who were very indignant because they could not send them to the Birtle school) to send their children either to Pine Creek, Sandy Bay, or Crooked Lake Boarding, or the Qu'Appelle Industrial.\n\nTo\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6250, file 567-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nIndustrial schools, but the Indians refused to send them, stating that the schools were too far away from the reserve. This is another factor, when they could not send their children to the Birtle Boarding school, why the Indians requested Rev. Father Lenoard, when he visited their reserve in May last, to have a day school opened on the reserve.\n\nThe number of children of school age on the reserve, including all denominations is 34.\n\nReligious denominations are as follows:\n\nPresbyterians attending Birtle Bd. School 13\ndo Living on reserve 10\nRoman Catholics attending O'Appelle Indist 1\ndo do do on reserve 12\nPagans, on reserve. 12 = 34\n\nOut of the 34 children of school age on the reserve, a number would have to be deducted, as not physically fit to attend school regularly, probably 7 or 8, perhaps more.\n\nAs the Boarding schools are the best suited for the education of the Indian race, and as a number of them (Boarding schools) need more pupils, especially the Birtle Boarding school, which has been remodeled at a large expense I would not advise the opening of a day school on the reserve. The present advantages for the education of their children, are not accepted by the Indians, as they should be, which are given at no cost or trouble to the parents.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I was at the reserve last week and did not think it necessary to call a meeting of the band to consider the starting of a day school, as we talked over the matter about a year ago. At the present time there are about thirty children of school age available for school and they are about equally divided between the Presbyterian, Roman Catholic and Pagan Religions, and any Day School started would have to be Non-denominational, and this would not suit the Roman Catholic Church.

Some of the Indians who signed the petition are not Roman Catholics, but signed the petition merely to show their sympathy with the Roman Catholics who have to send their children to distant schools.\n\nThere are no Catholic schools nearer than the ones at Sandy Bay and Pine Creek, and it is hard for the parents to visit the children, but they have no difficulty getting them to and from school, as stated in the petition, as the children are delivered to their homes at holiday time, and taken back to school when the holidays are over.\n\nThere are approximately thirty-six children of Roman Catholic parentage on this Reserve. Six of them attend the Presbyterian School at Birtle, one attends the Roman Catholic School at Lebret, one attends the R.C. School at Sandy Bay, and one attends the R.C. School at Pine Creek.

No provision has been made in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1938-39 for a day school on this Reserve, consequently, it will not be possible to even consider opening a school until the following fiscal year.\n\nIn the last paragraph of your letter you state that six Roman Catholic children from the Waywayseecappo Reserve are attending the Birtle Indian Residential School.

Francis Tanner, the Father of the two Tanner boys, gave his religion as Presbyterian in the application for admission form. I have no copy on file of the application form for Jean Mecas, but I think it likely that in that case also the Father has given his religion as Presbyterian. My opinion is that these people were originally Roman Catholics, although they were educated in the Birtle School. For many years there was no Catholic church on this Reserve, though they had occasional visits from a Priest. Now they have a new church built, and are having services more regularly, and in consequence, are returning to their original faith. Others in this Band have recently been baptized as Roman Catholics, who were Presbyterians until now. In reality I am of the opinion that these people have no real opinions of their own regarding their religion, but are very easily led in this line, and a little persuasion would make them change their faith.\n\nR.A.

G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies, province of Manitoba, in which the inspector deals very fully and in detail with the erection of a Roman Catholic church on the Waywayseecappo reserve.\n\nInspector Hamilton states that a Roman Catholic church was erected on this reserve a number of years ago, on property granted to the church authorities by the Department at that time. In addition to a lot necessary for the establishment of a church, another lot was granted for a cemetery. The new Roman Catholic church, which was completed last fall, was built on the property formerly set apart for this purpose. The Inspector, in his instructions to the Indian Agent, stated definitely that the church, if erected, must be erected on the property already owned by the church authorities.\n\nThe request of the Indians for the establishment of a day school on this reserve has been carefully reviewed by the Department from time to time. It is not, however, the policy or the intention of the Department to build day schools, unless the accommodation at other Indian day and residential schools in the district is inadequate to meet the needs of the Indian population.

G.

Mr. MacInnes informed Mr. Jackson that the Agent was advised on May 27, 1938 that no action could be taken at the present time. The census (1934) the population of the Waywayseecappo Band is 193 Presbyterians and 28 Roman Catholics.\nHon. T.A. Crerar,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nMy dear Mr. Crerar,\n\nWe have been trying for some time to obtain permission to build a little church on the Rolling River Indian Reserve. There has been delay and I do not know for what reason. We have a certain number of Catholics there and surely there can be no valid objection to our building a little church for them. We wanted to build it this year, but, if there be any further delay, it will be too late. Will you please have the officials of the Indian Department look into this matter at once?\n\nMoreover, we have been trying to have a school built on the Lizard Point Indian Reserve for our Catholic children there. The Protestant children go to the Protestant Indian School at Birtle, which is not far distant from the Reserve. Our Catholic children have no Catholic Residential School near them, and we would respectfully request that a Day School be provided for them on the Reserve. I do not know the precise number of Catholic children, but this can be obtained from Rev. G.E. Comeau, O.M.I., Sandy Bay Indian Reserve, Marius P.O., Man. I wish you would give favorable consideration to this humble petition.\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nArchbishop of Winnipeg.\nOttawa, September 2, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe last Census report indicates that there are 235 Indians on the Waywayseecappo reserve. Of these Indians, 193 are listed as Presbyterian and 26 as Roman Catholic.\n\nIn view of the fact that a petition has reached the Department asking for the erection of an Indian day school on this reserve, it is highly desirable that we should have up to date figures indicating how many Catholics reside on this reserve and how many Catholic children there are of school age. This matter is likely to come up for review by the Minister at an early date. If you can undertake this task immediately and supply us with these figures, your action will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. G. Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle,\nManitoba.\nOttawa, September 2, 1938.\n\nMy dear Archbishop Sinnott:\n\nI have for acknowledgment Your Grace's letter of August 25th, in which you express regret at the failure of the Department to grant permission for the erection of a church on the Rolling River reserve, Birtle agency, Manitoba.\n\nI may state that the request for permission to erect this church reached the Department in a letter from the Indian agent, dated May 25th, last. In departmental letter dated May 26th, the Indian agent was informed that permission to construct a church on the Rolling River reserve could not be granted except on the basis of a surrender of the necessary site by the Indians of the reserve. This expression of opinion was based on a judgment handed down by Mr. Justice MacLean of the Exchequer Court, dated December 23, 1932. The Indian agent did not reply to this letter, waiting, no doubt, until he secured a formal surrender of the property from the band. On August 25th the Department communicated with the agent again, asking him to discuss the desirability of this surrender with the members of the band at the earliest possible date. I have issued instructions to the officials to communicate with the Indian agent again, in an attempt to secure the consent of his Indians. The Department has no objection whatever to the erection of the church. We shall be glad to do all we possibly can to expedite the matter.\n\nI note Your Grace's reference to the petition received by the Department for the erection of an Indian day school on the Waywayseecappo reserve. I may state that\n\nMost Reverend A. A. Sinnott, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Winnipeg,\n353 St. Mary's Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nno provision has been made in the estimates of this year for the erection of a day school on this reserve. I shall be glad to review the claims of these Indians for a day school when the estimates for the coming fiscal year are under consideration. I have received a number of vigorous protests against the erection of a school on this reserve from individuals who believe that the erection of a day school will adversely affect the residential schools in which the pupils are now receiving instruction. If a Catholic school were erected, no doubt a demand would immediately arise for a school capable of accommodating all the children on the reserve - Catholic and non-Catholic. This condition, if allowed to develop, would have a very serious effect on the attendance at the Birtle residential School, operated under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church. I have been informed that a number of the pupils from the Linard Point district attend the residential school at Pine Creek. You will be interested to learn that, this year, the number of pupils eligible for a per capita grant at this school has been increased from 105 to 120. I desire to assure you at this time that the claims of the Indians of this reserve for a school were very carefully considered. These claims, however, must be considered in conjunction with a large number of claims for Indian day and residential schools that reach the Department from year to year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Of these, 193 are listed as Presbyterian, 28 as Catholic and 14 of aboriginal belief. It is just possible, however, that there has been a substantial increase in the Catholic population on the reserve in recent years. I am today communicating with the Indian agent, asking him to undertake an investigation and to let us have a report indicating the exact Catholic population and the number of Catholic children of school age.\n\nIn view of the opposition that is likely to arise, should we proceed with the construction of a school on this reserve, it is altogether likely that the Minister may desire to discuss the matter personally with Archbishop Sinnott.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Five of these children are in the Birtle Residential School and five in Catholic schools. The Roman Catholic children who are in the Birtle school were signed in as Presbyterians. I am of the opinion that the parents of these children are really Catholics, but gave their religion as Presbyterian, in order to get their children into the Birtle School, so as they would be nearer home than if they went to a Catholic School.\n\nYou stated in your letter that at the last Census the population of this Band was 235.

The draft letter to Archbishop Simnett which you prepared for the Minister's signature was shown to the latter. In view of the report of the Agent no doubt you will wish to make the necessary changes.

The Indian agent was notified by the Department at that time that permission to construct a church on the reserve could not be granted until a surrender of the necessary site had been secured from the Indians.

On August 25th the Department communicated with the agent again, asking him to discuss the desirability of this surrender with the members of the band at the earliest possible date. The agent, in his reply, dated September first, which has now reached the Department, intimates that the members of the band are not in favour of granting a surrender of the site. He adds that a meeting of the band has been held, at which a vote was taken, resulting in 13 members of the band voting against the request and 7 in favour thereof.\n\nIn view of the fact that there was no evidence before the Department to indicate that this meeting had been -\n\nMost Reverend A. A. Sinnett, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Winnipeg,\n353 St. Mary's Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nbeen regularly called, the Department communicated with the agent again on September 10th. In this letter he was instructed to call a meeting of the band at the earliest possible date for the purpose of considering the advisability of surrendering a site for the construction of a church on the reserve. With this letter, application and surrender papers, together with blank forms on which to record accurately the vote of the band members, were enclosed. It is scarcely necessary to add that the Department has no objection whatever to the erection of the church and that everything possible has been done to expedite the matter.\n\nNo provision has been made in the estimates of this year for the erection of a day school on this reserve. It is my intention, however, to review the claims of these Indians for a day school when the estimates for the coming fiscal year come up for consideration. The agent reports that there are approximately 17 children of school age on this reserve and that of these 5 are enrolled at Catholic residential schools.\n\nI have received a number of vigorous protests against the erection of a school on this reserve, from individuals who believe that the erection of a day school will adversely affect the residential schools in which the pupils are now receiving instruction.

They state\nthat when their children come back from the Birtle\nschool they usually know nothing practical about farm\nwork or other lines of work and are usually quite\nunfitted to do anything useful. They complain that\nat the Indian School there is very little taught to\nthe children as to ordinary farming operations or\nother useful kinds of work, and they think that\ninstructions should be given along these lines\nin addition to the ordinary school subjects such as\nreading, writing, etc..\nThe Minister of Indian Affairs, November 16th, 1938.\n\nI have heard that at some of the Western Reserves there is a farm instructor engaged by the Government for boys of a certain age but do not know just how much is included in this kind of instruction.\n\nThe above parties state that there are about fifty children on the Rolling River Reserve, and thirty on the Reserve at Elphinstone, and that the number at Rossburn would be approximately one hundred. This, no doubt, includes the children of all ages from seven up to eighteen or nineteen.\n\nThe said Councillors state that at all of the meetings held on the three reserves, the Indians expressed the desire to have day schools established on each Reserve so that, if possible, the children might stay at home and be under their parents supervision during the school period. As you no doubt know, the Indians are very fond of their children and, like other parents, wish to have them at home as much as possible during their school years.\n\nThe Councillors have the idea that the Queen told the Indian people in the treaties made many years ago that they would have the right to have their children educated on the Reserves. I do not know what the treaties may have provided in this respect but the Indians seem to attach great importance to the alleged promise.\n\nI mentioned to the Councillors the matter of the large investment in the Birtle Indian School, also the considerable further expenditure which would be necessitated by establishing schools on the Reserves. They do not appear to have considered this angle of the matter very much but I think they appreciate the difficulty from the financial standpoint. They, however, are very anxious to have the separate schools established on the Reserves if that is at all possible and have instructed me to write your Department to ascertain what you would be prepared to do along that line. If it should be found impracticable to grant their request at the present time they are strongly in favor of adding instruction in practical farming and suitable vocational training to the curriculum at the Birtle School.\n\nAlthough the Councillors did not mention this possibility, it occurs to me that the ideal solution\nThe Minister of Indian Affairs, November 10th, 1938.\n\nof this problem would be to establish day schools upon the Reserves for the younger children between the ages of seven and thirteen and to make vocational training available for the children from thirteen and upwards. This would, I believe, go a long way to satisfy the Indians on the sentimental side and would supply the children with the practical training in farming, trades, etc., at the age when they would be best able to take advantage of the same.\n\nThe Indians apparently feel that the education their children are at present obtaining is of little practical use to them. One of the Councillors remarked that when the children come home after going through school \"they don't know how to work and don't know nothing\". This is no doubt exaggerated but it seems to me that these people have real grounds for complaint as to the results of their school education.\n\nI am sure that your Department will give these people's representations careful consideration and trust that something may be done along the lines suggested to improve the situation. I will be glad to hear from you at an early date advising as to your attitude to my clients' request.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC. L. ST. JOHN,\n\nPER\n\nSTJ/JC\nOttawa, November 17, 1888.\n\nRe: Educational facilities on Indian Reserves, Birtle Agency, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. St. John:\n\nYour letter of November 10, addressed to the Minister of this Department, has been passed on to me for consideration and reply.\n\nI may state the records indicate that the desirability of establishing Indian day schools on the reserves to which you refer in your communication has been carefully reviewed and considered by the Department on a number of occasions. This matter was given very careful thought prior to the rebuilding of the Birtle Residential School, in the fiscal year 1930-31. At this date there is a very persistent demand for the establishment of a Roman Catholic day school on the Waywaysescappo reserve. I may state, however, that the difficulties in the way of establishing Indian day schools on these reserves are almost insurmountable.\n\nSubsection 2 of Section 10 of the Indian Act reads: \"No Protestant child shall be assigned to a Roman Catholic school or a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices, and no Roman Catholic child shall be assigned to a Protestant school or a school conducted under Protestant auspices\".\n\nIf a Roman Catholic school were established on the Waywaysescappo reserve, the demand would immediately arise for the establishment of a Protestant school, and the existence of these schools would seriously jeopardize,\n\nC.

(RG 10, Volume 6250, file 567-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nas you state, the heavy investment at the Birtle Residential School.\n\nIt is my personal opinion that the policy of the Government with respect to the education of the Indian population will move gradually toward the multiplication of Indian day schools on reserves, and it is just possible that in the future a number of residential schools may be organized to provide vocational instruction for senior pupils. The present policy, however, cannot be changed overnight.\n\nPrincipals of Indian residential schools were instructed in departmental circular dated January 15, 1937, that at least one third of the school period should be devoted to manual or vocational instruction:- Elementary agriculture, gardening, care of live stock, blacksmithing, carpentry and auto mechanics for boys and hand loom weaving, dressmaking, fruit preserving, crochet work, etc., for girls.\n\nInspector Sigvaldason, in his last report on the Birtle Residential School, dated January 12, 1937, states in part as follows:\n\n\"Mr. Carmichael is doing good work with classes in woodworking. All pupils get practical work. The girls do sewing, laundry work, kitchen duties and other household services, while the boys are engaged in work outside. I was particularly pleased to see the interest taken in the outdoor rink. The boys have a couple of excellent hockey teams. This year they played with teams from neighboring towns. A music teacher is on full time duty at the school. The pupils who are musical are given every opportunity to develop their talent\".\n\nIt is my intention to ask the public school inspector to make a special inspection of the Birtle School and report to the Department. Just as soon as this report reaches me, I shall be glad to communicate with you again. In addition to this, I am today communicating with Home Mission -\nMission Board of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, intimating that a certain amount of dissatisfaction exists with respect to the studies provided at the Birtle institution. The costs at the Birtle School are the highest in the Dominion, and there is no reason whatever why a worthwhile course should not be provided for the pupils in attendance.\n\nI have noted with interest the Indians' reference to the Treaties and certain provisions contained therein for the education of their children. I know of no provisions in these Treaties other than the provision that adequate educational facilities shall be provided for the Indian population.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nBishop's House,\n353 St. Mary's Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man., October 21st, 1939.\n\nHon.

The accommodation which it offers is considerably greater than was contemplated by the Government grant and I am instructed to ask you that provision be made for 40 pupils instead of for 20 as at present.\n\nThe reasons on account of which I think this request ought to be granted are briefly these:\n\n1. The building can accommodate this number.\n2. The children are available and there is no prospect that they can be persuaded to go to the Regina or any other school. Regina is so far away that...\nThere is no possibility that even three or two each year can be persuaded to go there. The leaders will be taught at Rielte and the larger boys and girls will be persuaded to go to Rielte to learn them.\n\n3. The Indian Department has all along been in favor of the enlargement of the Rielte school. The late Superintendent of Indian Affairs put some years ago a sum in the Estimates for the erection of new and building at government expense and it was only when he was overcome by the members of the Government that the matter was dropped. Indian Agent Kendall reports in 1892 in regard to the School as follows: \"The attendance has been much more regular than in former years and if the school were only able to accommodate more, it would very soon be more largely patronized as the advantages of the situation and good management have been greatly appreciated by the Indians within reach of it.\"\n\nIn virtue of these considerations, and such others...\nof a similar character as will naturally occur to you.\n\nI have to ask that the grants be increased as indicated and I am\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAndrew B.

The only difference of opinion seems to be as to whether to allow the Birks School more pupils would tend to keep the Industrial School manned to its full capacity.\n\nThe Department notices what you say about there being no prospect of getting the children whom it is hoped to secure for the Birks School to go to such a distance as Regina, but it is unable to agree with the view that the distance of a school as a rule influences parents, if their objection to parting with their children at all can be overcome. In fact, experience, as witnessed by the number of children who have gone from the Bloodfoot Agency in one direction, and from St. Peter's Reserve on no other, to attend the Mission Institution, from the Buck Lake, Carlton, and Broadview districts to Regina, from Carlton and from Buck Lake districts as far as to the east of La Corne, to Littleford, from Buck Lake and Carlton to Qu'Appelle, has so clearly demonstrated the opposite as to have led the Department, without fear of the\nthe result, to establish an Industrial School at Pon-\ndon, although intended for the benefit of children,\nfrom the far distant Reserves in Manitoba.\n\nThe Department, however, is prepared to admit\nthat in some cases the prospect of having the children\ndesperately near at hand may, in the first instance,\nrender it easier to persuade parents to send children\nto the boarding school, but it is quite convinced that\nwhen parents have once been persuaded to send their\nchildren to a boarding school, and become satisfied\nof the good treatment extended to them, and of the\nbenefits conferred upon them, they can be induced by\ncooperatively small exertion and determination to\nconsent to their transfer to the Industrial Schools,\nwith their superior advantages.\n\nIt is clear, however, that the more numerous\nthere are at boarding schools the less prospect there\nis of exertion being made to remove pupils from them\nto Industrial Schools, and consequently it would not\nappear to be a wise or justifiable policy to extend\nthe scope of the boarding schools' work, until, Indus-\ntrial Schools having been once filled to the extent\nof their capacity, there may be a reasonable prospect\nof their complement being maintained by a cooperative-\nly small exercise of energy and self-sacrifice in the\nbest interests of the whole, on the part of those conducting the boarding schools.\n\nI am,\n\nSovorn Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is surely extremely unfair that when the Church has expended $7,000 in improving the accommodation of the school, it should be handicapped in making the full use of the building by the refusal of the grant which, from the attitude of the Government to the school first and last, it had every reason to believe it would receive.\n\nI note what you say to the effect that the increase of grant would neither be in the interests of the Church nor of the Government until the Industrial School at Regina is occupied to its full capacity. Upon this matter allow me to draw your attention to the following considerations -\n\n(1st) We are glad to know that the Regina school, which is indeed a most deserving Institution, and one of higher grade than that at Birtle, is being gradually filled up, and we will relax no effort to send pupils to it, especially from the nearer Reserves, until it is occupied to its fullest capacity. As you are aware however, our efforts in the way of getting pupils from such Reserves as Crooked Lakes, File Hills and Muscowpetungs, have been seriously thwarted, and in some cases by officers of the Government whose names have been given to you in my earlier correspondence. We are convinced that if pupils on which Presbyterian missions are established are allowed to go without interference to the Regina school, it will be possible to accomplish this within a few months without drawing upon territory as distant as Birtle.\n(2nd) Even if this were not so, there is no hope of getting more than an occasional and exceptional pupil from the Birtle agency. I note what you say as to the success which has attended the effort to take pupils long distances to other Industrial Schools; but I have to remind you that not a few instances might have been quoted on the opposite side, and among them Birtle. Our school has been established there for some five years. For the greater part of that time it has been over-crowded and the agent and teachers made honest efforts to secure the transfer of some of the pupils to the Regina school, but I know of only a single instance in which they were successful. The question as to whether the Regina school, which is more than 400 miles away, is full or empty seems to make little difference in regard to the schooling of Indian children in the Birtle agency. I hope indeed that there is a better time coming, and efforts will still be put forth to have as many children as possible transferred to Regina so that they may get the benefit of the superior advantages of the Industrial School.\n\n(3rd) Permit me to call your attention to the fact that your decision in regard to the Birtle school is not in a line with your action in regard to the schools of other denominations. Several years ago, while the Battleford Industrial School had but a meagre attendance, you erected at large cost a school at Elkhorn, and when it was little more than organized, you gave very liberal encourage-\nWinnipeg\n30th March, 1894\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo (File No. 5824) in which you express your regret that the time has not yet arrived when you can agree to the increase of the grant to the Birtle Boarding School, so that forty pupils may be maintained instead of twenty, as at present.\n\nI am instructed to express to you the regret of our Committee that the increase of grant has not secured your approval, and to say that the arguments which apparently have led to your conclusion do not seem to us to have the weight which you attribute to them.\n\nIt is admitted on all hands that the Indian Department approved of the increase in the capacity of the school\u2014indeed pledged itself to enlarge the school at its own cost, and was only hindered from carrying out this pledge by the action of the Government as a whole in refusing to pass the necessary estimates.\n\nAfter waiting for a couple of years and seeing the school suffer, the Church went on and erected at its own cost the necessary accommodation.

It is surely extremely unfair that when the Church has expended $7,000 in improving the accommodation of the school, it should be handicapped in making the full use of the building by the refusal of the grant which, from the attitude of the Government to the school first and last, it had every reason to believe it would receive.\n\nI note what you say to the effect that the increase of grant would neither be in the interests of the Church nor of the Government until the Industrial School at Regina is occupied to its full capacity. Upon this matter allow me to draw your attention to the following considerations\u2014\n\n(1st) We are glad to know that the Regina school, which is indeed a most deserving Institution, and one of higher grade than that at Birtle, is being gradually filled up, and we will relax no effort to send pupils to it, especially from the native Reserves, until it is occupied to its fullest capacity. As you are aware however, our efforts in the way of getting pupils from such Reserves as Crooked Lake, Pile Hills and Nuncowpetungs, have been seriously thwarted, and in some cases by officers of the Government whose names have been given to you in my earlier correspondence. We are convinced that if pupils on which Presbyterian missions are established are allowed to go without interference to the Regina school, it will be possible to accomplish this within a few months without drawing upon territory as distant as Birtle.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6251, File 575-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\n(2nd) Even if this were not so, there is no hope of getting more than an occasional and exceptional pupil from the Birtle agency. I note what you say as to the success which has attended the effort to take pupils long distances to other Industrial schools; but I have to remind you that not a few instances might have been quoted on the opposite side, and among them Birtle. Our school has been established there for some five years. For the greater part of that time it has been over-crowded and the agent and teachers made honest efforts to secure the transfer of some of the pupils to the Regina school, but I know of only a single instance in which they were successful. The question as to whether the Regina school, which is more than 400 miles away, is full or empty seems to make little difference in regard to the schooling of Indian children in the Birtle agency. I hope indeed that there is a better time coming, and efforts will still be put forth to have as many children as possible transferred to Regina so that they may get the benefit of the superior advantages of the Industrial School.\n\n(3rd) Permit me to call your attention to the fact that your decision in regard to the Birtle school is not in line with your action in regard to the schools of other denominations. Several years ago, while the Battleford Industrial School had but a meager attendance, you erected at large cost a school at Elkhorn, and when it was little more than organized, you gave very liberal encourage-\ngoing to the establishment of a school at St Pauls, Manitoba. These schools are under the care of the Church of England. Similarly, when there was plenty of room in the High River Roman Catholic School, you enlarged the Qu'Appelle Roman Catholic School and at the same time made a grant towards the erection of a Roman Catholic school at Stoniface. I find no fault with your treatment of these schools. The success which has attended most of them shows, I think, that the proper policy was pursued; and I hope that the same policy will now be adopted in the case of our schools, and that the grant for the maintenance of the increased number of pupils will be made to the little school.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Deputy Sup't General\n\nof Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, ONT.\nFeb. 7, 1894\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs you are aware a stone building has been erected by us for the Birtle Boarding and Industrial school, at a cost of nearly $7,000, and it is now being occupied, much to the increase of comfort of both staff and pupils. The accommodation it offers is considerably greater than is now contemplated by the Government grant, and I am instructed to ask you that provision be made for 40 pupils instead of for 20, as at present.\n\nThe reasons on account of which I think the request ought to be granted are briefly these -\n\n1. The building can accommodate this number.\n2. The children are available and there is no prospect that they can be persuaded to go to the Regina or any other school. Regina is so far away that there is no probability that more than one or two each year can be persuaded to go there. No trade will be taught at Birtle and the larger boys and girls will be persuaded to go to Regina to learn them.\n3. The Indian Department has all along been in favor of the enlargement of the Birtle School. The late Superintendent of Indian Affairs put some years ago a sum in the estimates for the erection of the new building at government expense, and it was only when he was overcome by other members of the Government that the matter was dropped. Indian Agent Markle reports in 1892 in regard to the school as follows - \"The attendance has been much more...\"\nRegular than in former years, and if the school were only able to accommodate more, it would very soon be more largely patronized, as the convenience of the situation and good management have been greatly appreciated by the Indians within reach of it.\n\nIn view of these considerations, and such others of a similar character as will naturally occur to you, I have to ask that the grant be increased as indicated, and I am\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAndrew B. Baird\n\nThe Deputy Supt. Gen'l\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, February 23rd, 1894\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, in which you request that provision for the Birtle Boarding School may be increased, to permit of the maintenance of 40 pupils instead of 20, as heretofore, and advance reasons for considering that the request should be favorably entertained.\n\nIn reply I have to state that, glad as the Department will be when circumstances become such as, in its opinion, to justify the measure proposed by you, it regrets that the time has not yet arrived.\n\nThe Department can quite sympathize with the desire to have all available accommodation at the Birtle School utilized, but although, as you say, it has always been in favor of that course, it has never seen how it could be justified in gratifying such desire at the cost of leaving inoperative other provision already made at larger outlay for affording still greater advantages at the Industrial School.\n\nThe Department feels that it would not alone be unjustifiable on its part to build up with the one hand and pull down with the other at the country's cost, but that that course would not be in the Church's own best interests in its educational work among the Indians; but it is unnecessary to dwell upon this aspect of the question, since I am glad to believe that the Church and the De-\npartment are so far agreed. The only difference of opinion seems to be as to whether to allow the little School more pupils would tend to keep the Industrial School unused to its full capacity.\n\nThe Department notices what you say about there being no prospect of getting the children whom it is hoped to secure for the little School to go to such a distance as Regina, but it is unable to agree with the view that the distance of a school as a rule influences parents, if their objection to parting with their children at all can be overcome. In fact, experience as witnessed by the number of children who have gone from the Blackfoot Agency in one direction, and from St. Peter's Reserve on the other to attend the Elkhorn Institution, from the Duck Lake, Carlton and Broadview Districts to Regina, from Carlton and from Duck Lake districts as far as to the East of Laforme to Battleford, from Duck Lake and Carlton to Qu'Appelle, has so clearly demonstrated the opposite as to have led the Department, without fear of the result, to establish an Industrial School at Brandon, although intended for the benefit of children from the far distant Reserves in Manitoba.\n\nThe Department, however, is prepared to admit that in some cases the prospect of having the children comparatively near at hand may, in the first instance, render it easier to persuade parents to send children to the Boarding School; but it is\nquite convinced that when parents have once been persuaded to send their children to a boarding school, and become satisfied of the good treatment extended to them, and of the benefits conferred upon them, they can be induced by comparatively small exertion and determination to consent to their transfer to the Industrial Schools, with their superior advantages.\n\nIt is clear however, that the more vacancies there are at Boarding Schools, the less prospect there is of exception being made to remove pupils from them to Industrial Schools, and consequently it would not appear to be a wise or justifiable policy to extend the scope of the Board Schools' work until Industrial Schools having been once filled to the extent of their capacity, there may be a reasonable prospect of their complement being maintained by a comparatively small exercise of energy and self-sacrifice in the best interests of the whole, on the part of those conducting the boarding schools.\n\nI am, Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nHaytor Reed\n\nDeputy of the Sup't General\n\nof Indian Affairs\n\nRev Professor Baird\nJoint Convener\nPresbyterian Foreign Mission Committee\nWinnipeg, Manitoba\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Presbyterian Church has had an Indian Boarding and Industrial School in operation in the town of Birtle for the last five years. During the last Summer a $7,000 stone building was erected at the expense of the Church, in the confidence that the Government would increase the grant for the maintenance of the pupils in proportion to the increased capacity of the building.\n\nMr Hayter Reed, the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, seems disinclined to do this, on the ground that there is still some vacant room in the Regina Industrial School.\n\nI send you copies of the correspondence on the subject, so that you may understand what is to be said on each side of the case, and I shall be very much obliged to you if you will do what lies within your power to aid what I think you will confess is one of the most deserving Institutions within the bounds of your constituency, and the good work of which is I am sure already known to you.\n\nI am yours very truly,\n\nMr N. Boyd M.P.,\nOttawa, ONT.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6251, File 575-1, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM\nFOR THE INFORMATION\nOF THE SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL.\n\nThe undersigned begs to report as follows regarding attached from Rev. A. B. Baird to Mr. H. Boyd, M.P.\n\nThe Department's policy has been to have Boarding act as feeders to Industrial Schools, and Mr. Dewdney could only have encouraged expectation of increasing number of pupils at Birtle on assumption that, by Church's loyal co-operation in said policy, Regina School would in meantime have been filled.\n\nThe Church having failed to co-operate, the only method of compulsion seems to be to refuse to increase numbers at Boarding until Regina School be filled, after which the difficulty, (with which you are well acquainted) in finding funds, would constitute the only objection.\n\nExperience through Manitoba and the North West Territories generally proves that parents will about as readily send children to distant as to schools near at hand. A few might, in the first instance, rather send to Birtle than to Regina, but without doubt after children have been some time at Birtle the Church's representatives could transfer them to Regina, as those\nthose in charge of the more distant school at Crowstand (Pelly) have done.\n\nThe Church's representatives recently pleaded interference by our officers in excuse for failure to send children to Regina, and Mr. Baird said that but for interference they were convinced it would be possible to fill Regina School to fullest capacity within a few months, without drawing upon territory so far distant as Birtle. This admission justifies the undersigned's contentions, and as the accusations of interference have been proved unfounded it seems clear that the Church has the remedy for what it complains of in its own hands, always excepting the question of finding funds.\n\nApril 17th, 1894.\nI note your conviction that if pupils on Reserves where you have missions established are not interfered with it will be possible to fill the Regina School to its fullest capacity without drawing upon Territory as distant as Birtle. Since I find that the interference to which you refer did not apparently occur, as you were led to suppose, I am encouraged to hope that you will, from what you say, soon be able to fill the Regina School.\n\nAs to what you say about the decision in this case not being in line with others quoted by you, I may remark that the latter are not regarded as analogous, but even if they were, and the Department had in quest of the best policy, fallen into errors, its duty would surely be to profit by avoiding repetition of them.\n\nYours, Rev. Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent General\nIndian Affairs.\nWinnipeg, May 3rd, 1894.\n\nTo Sir,\n\nI reply to your letter of the 17th April in reference to an increase of grant to the Indian Boarding School at B\u00e9dell. I have to express the regret of the Committee that you have been unable to recognize the justice of our claims, but I understand that your opinion is evidently based on a misapprehension of the facts of the case. We hope that expeditious correction of this misapprehension, a satisfactory conclusion will be reached.\n\nI note your conviction that Mr. Murray could only have encouraged the expectation of increasing the number of pupils at B\u00e9dell on the assumption that the church would have by the exercises of its representatives\nBy the circumstance fitted the Regina School to close down entirely without foundation such a statement is, it is only necessary to remind you that by a comparison of dates it will be seen that if Mr. Redmayne had been able to fulfill his promise the two schools would, in all probability have been placed about the same time.\n\nIn reply to my statement that the failure of the Regina School had been hindered by interference on the part of government officials and others you \"find that the interference is fictitious\" I \"refer did not apparently occur.\" I am quite at a loss to know how you can have been so seriously misinformed. Briefly the facts are, that Mr. Redmayne complained to Mr. Reed of three acts of interference. Shortly complaints of the third were made for several years. Of the three cases each involving more than one child, I have received...\nExplanations. All these Mr. Reed's orders have been connected with one of them. The third submitted by the Rev. Mr. P. Moore has been admitted by the Department, and the conditions required by Mr. Reed are now being fulfilled.\n\nAnd I expect that the child will at an early date be placed in the Regina School. In view of these circumstances, I beg to liberate Willie from his present chain before. Shall the Regina School would now be filled with pupils there is not that the dropping of pupils from various schools where there are Presbyterian missions is being interfered with, and that in some cases the persons charged with interference are officers of the Indian Department.\n\nIn reply to my statement that the increase of grant asked for would be in a line with other grants made last by the Indian Dep't, you imply that such a policy was carried out by saying that even if the Department had...\nIn quest of the best policy fallen into errors, or likely would surely be profited by avoiding repetition of them. Now this committee has never tried to make capital out of past mistakes of the Dept., and yet the inclination of endeavoring upon such a course does not appear that aspect of the case I have nothing further to say, but the statement above it, figures to say, thoroughly advantageous, because the policy to which I referred is not a thing of the past, but a policy which is something pursued, at may be learned from under. Details from handling through the department.\n\nI have only to repeat my request that the grant to the Bible School be increased was to provide for 40 child there instead of 20 as heretofore, and I shall this request upon the merits of the case, upon the implied promise of the late Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, and upon the\nPolicy pursued in regard to other schools.\n\nWhere else should we\n\nin\n\nfur medium demand.\n\nAndres Reid\n\nThe Hon.\nThe Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nHon. T. Mayne Daly, Esq., Q.C., M.P.,\nMinister of Interior,\nOTTAWA ONT.\n\nDear Mr. Daly:\n\nRe Birtle School\n\nI have just been going over this matter and corresponding herein with the Foreign Mission Committee of our Church (Rev. Prof. Baird convenor) and considering that this school was built or enlarged with the consent and concurrence of Mr. Dewdney, and considering the action of the Department towards other denominations and other schools it would appear that the action herein would be far from just under all the circumstances.\n\nThe Committee have always avoided bringing any pressure or Government influence to bear, but I fear if the attitude and decision of the Department is adhered to, they will likely take some action. I would regret this very much, and I trust you will make a personal examination in connection with this case.\n\nI am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

My conviction as to what must have actuated Mr Dewdney was grounded on my inability to suppose that he would have acted in a manner apparently inconsistent with his own policy and it certainly is not shaken by the comparison of dates you suggest. From such records as I can find so far from the probability being that, had Mr Dewdney been able to fulfil his promise, the two schools would have been opened about the same time, the money wherewith to set about the purchase of a site for, and the erection of one, could only have become available on 1st July, 1891 when the other was already in operation, leaving ample margin for the indulgence of such expectation as I attributed to Mr Dewdney.

Something on a larger scale may have been contemplated later, doubtless to relieve the over-crowding complained of, and possibly with a view to increasing the number later when such could consistently be done.\n\nIt is evident that the Department's letter to you of the 3rd April last with enclosures has miscarried. A perusal of copies transmitted herewith will make it intelligible to you why I am not disposed to admit that I had been seriously misinformed (as you assert) when I wrote to you that I found the alleged interference with the Church's efforts to fill the Regina School had not occurred.\n\nWith regard to my statement which you feel at liberty (although it is noticed with regret) to characterise as thoroughly disingenuous, I may point out that if, as you now suggest, you referred not to a thing of the past, but a policy which is now being pursued, there might be some justification for your opinion, and perhaps for your very candid expression of it. If such was your intention it is to be regretted that you so completely disguised it by confining your citation of examples (in support of your contention) to past actions\nand still refrain from particularizing any of the undertakings now passing through the Department, to which you make a general reference.\n\nI am, Reverend Sir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nDear Mr Campbell,\n\nI duly received your letter of the 3rd inst., and note the impression made on you by a perusal of recent correspondence with Rev.

Smart,\nDeputy Minister of the Interior,\nOttawa, ONT.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nPursuant to the promise I made to you when Professor Hart and I talked with you during your recent visit to Winnipeg, I now write about the matters of our interview. After several postponements we have had an interview on these subjects with the Commissioner and have laid before him our wishes with respect to them.\n\n1. In the matter of the additional land for the Reserve of the Sioux Indians near Prince Albert I need say nothing further since there has already been correspondence on that subject.\n\n2. We are anxious that the Government should undertake the erection of an addition to the Birtle Indian Boarding School. This school was established by the Presbyterian Church, with the approbation of the Government, in 1888. Birtle is an extremely central and convenient point for such an institution, for there are Reserves on almost all sides of it. The school has been very successful and has now an average attendance of about forty-five pupils. The reports of the local Agent and of the Inspectors have been uniformly of a very favorable character. The Presbyterian Church owns thirty acres of land in connection with the school,\nand buildings to the value of about $7,000., the mission building being a substantial and well built stone structure which now serves as school-room, residence for the pupils and residence for the staff. The land was purchased and the buildings erected entirely at the cost of the Presbyterian Church. If the Government agrees to erect an additional building for the accommodation of the school, and is unwilling to build it upon land which is not its property, we would be quite willing to deed a suitable site to the Government; or if it is thought advisable, a convenient site can be purchased from another proprietor within a few yards of the present building. The reasons upon which we base our request to the Government for the erection of an additional building or the enlargement of the present building are mainly these -\n\n(1) The school is centrally situated, is largely patronized and is doing excellent work; the present accommodation is entirely too small and there is urgent need for an enlargement.\n\n(2) Before the present building was erected and while the school was being carried on in rented premises, the Honorable E. Dewdney, then Superintendent of Indian Affairs and Minister of the Interior, promised inviting that the Government would bear the cost of such buildings as were needed. Very much to his own regret, his fellow members of the Council failed to grant the money required; but I quote this to show that the school is one which has long enjoyed the good will of the Department, and the Church did not undertake the erection of the buildings until there was an urgent demand for them.\n\n(3) The additional accommodation for which we ask has already been asked for by the local Agent.\n(4) The accompanying statement showing the amounts paid towards the erection of boarding schools in Manitoba and the North West indicates that during recent years the Presbyterian Church, although it has made repeated requests, has not been receiving a large share of Government patronage.\n\n3. The Presbyterian Church wishes to undertake a mission on the West side of the Lake of the Woods. About this we believe the Rev Dr Moore of Ottawa, Convener of the Missionary Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, and the Rev Principal Grant have already interviewed the Minister of the Interior. There is a considerable number of Indians numbering between 550 and 600, in the neighborhood of the North West angle and Shoal Lake for whom nothing at all of a missionary or educational character is being done. It is true that Priests of the Roman Catholic Church have, at infrequent intervals, paid them visits, usually when they were gathered together at the time of treaty payments; but there has been no steady and persistent effort to reach them with the benefits of education and of the Gospel. The Church of England, which has several missions on the other side of the Lake of the Woods, has through the Venerable Archdeacon Phair, Superintendent of Indian Missions, expressed hearty approval of our proposal to do something for these people. The Indians themselves of two of the Shoal Lake bands have sent a formal request, asking us to establish a school at some central place for the benefit of their children.\n\nWe ask, therefore, that the Government erect a building suitable for use as a boarding school at or near Keewatin, or some other\nsuitable place, and that it provide the usual grant of $72 per head for such children as may be gathered into this school. I enclose a map showing the location of the reserves which will be tributary to the school, and\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe\n\nP.S.

I expect however to be able to send one within a few days.\n\nA.B.S.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 27th January, 1899\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nIn reference to the letter of the 7th instant from the Rev. D. Baird, Joint Convener of the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, Winnipeg, applying, inter alia, for the erection of an addition to the Birtle Boarding school, I beg to say that the records of this Department bear out the reverend gentleman's assertion as to the success of this school, provision for which is now made at the rate of $12 per capita for 40 pupils.\n\nThe Indians in the vicinity of the school have frequently objected to having their children sent to any great distance from their Reserves and have expressed their preference for the Birtle school.\n\nThe Industrial school at Regina, which is conducted under auspices of the Presbyterian Church, has an enrollment of 131 with provision for 140 at $130 per capita, being a difference of $58 in the cost per head of the two schools.\n\nI consider that a boarding school, for all practical purposes achieves equally good work with an Industrial school with pupils up to a certain age\u2014say about 14 years\u2014and at a much less cost. If the Department considers it advisable to increase the grant to any of the denominations now carrying on Indian schools, I should say that the money could be spent to much better advantage in\nin assisting or establishing boarding schools, than increasing the number of Industrial schools, or making provision for more pupils at those already established.\n\nDr. Baird also asks for the erection of a building suitable for a boarding school, at or near Keewatin or some other suitable place in the neighborhood of the North-West Angle and Shoal Lake and a per capita grant of $72 for such children as may be gathered into the school.\n\nDr. Baird states that the Church of England, which has several missions on the Lake of the Woods, has, through the Ven. Archdeacon Phair, Supt. of Indian missions, expressed hearty approval of the proposal of the Presbyterian Church to do something for these people, and the Indians themselves have sent a formal request asking for the establishment of a school for the benefit of their children.\n\nThe Census Return for 1897 shows most of the Indians in this locality as pagans, while a number of Bands north of Lake of the Woods are put down as Anglicans and Roman Catholics.\n\nA boarding school was recently established at Rat Portage under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church, to which the Department contributed $2500 and provided for 20 pupils at $72 per capita.\nOTTAWA, 7th February, 1899\n\nRev.

The fire was caused by the furnace pipe getting hot and setting fire to the joist in the first floor which runs quite close to the pipe. This joist was burnt about ten feet and laths on part of the partitions first floor scorched. Most of the damage to the building was caused by our having to break down the partitions and flooring to locate the fire and keep it from spreading. The fire started about 10:30 p.m. and was first noticed by Mr. Small, the Principal, who was returning from town. The alarm was given to the town people through the Matron and assistants shouting fire.\n\nI was amazed on arriving at the school to see what a fire-trap the work about the furnace pipe hole was, the laths running almost up to the pipe and it is a mystery that the building has escaped so long. The builder deserves censure, for had the fire occurred later many lives would have been lost. Most of the plaster in the clothing-room was broken down, also part of the flooring and part of the plaster\n\nIndian Affairs.

Two more should be supplied at once. Four extinguishers from Birtle were on hand as were also a large number of the citizens who assisted in every way in putting out the fire. The fire extinguishers used by the town of Birtle were the \"Stemple\" made in Berlin, Ont. These machines are of greater use, and will do more work at putting out a fire than the other ones.\n\nAn alarm bell should be furnished this school as at present in case of fire, they have no means of calling for assistance, only by shouting. The school is three quarters of a mile from town.\n\nA well should also be connected with the building, as at present all the water used in it for cooking purposes has to be hauled from the Bird Tail Creek three quarters of a mile away. A cistern for soft water only is in the building, but the supply is limited, being secured during the rainy season from piping and spouts on the roof connected with the cistern in basement.\n\nI have the honour, &c.\n\n(Sgd) G.H. Wheatley,\nIndian Agent.\n\nTo The Hon. David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to forward a copy of a letter reporting some damages caused by fire at the Birtle School. It is rather fortunate that the damage has been very limited and that the lives of the children were protected.\n\nI am forwarding more fire extinguishers. In regard to a well and an alarm bell I think the Church authorities ought to attend to this. It is extraordinary that such an old institution has not seen its way to dig a well.\n\nAs no claim is made on the Department to contribute towards the repairing of the damage caused by fire, I daresay the matter had better stand until a formal request is made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYours of the 13th January, re water supply at Birtle Boarding School, received.\n\nAllow me in the name of the Foreign Mission Committee, to thank the Department very cordially for their action in allowing $750.00 for the purpose of installing a water system at that school.

Dr. Hart stating that when he sent me $649.60 for the grant for September quarter 1903, he had sent me $100.00 more than he should have by mistake.\n\nI think there must be some mistake. If $549.60 was all that we should have got, I do not understand how the calculations are made. I understand it allow me to explain it as follows:\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6251, File 575-1, part 1)\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nThe pupils have been allowed three weeks vacation in July. If they had one week at Xmas; otherwise they have had four weeks leave in July. For this time the grant has been paid as if they were at school.\n\nNow this school draws a grant for 40 pupils. The number of days in the September quarter was 92 less 21 days (three weeks that they were allowed home though some were allowed four weeks and some few were late in returning).\n\nThe required \"Aggregate number of days present during the quarter\" to draw the whole grant of $720 would thus be 40 x $1 = $40. My return showed an aggregate\nof 2715 with an enrollment of 482.\n\nEven if the number of \"days present\" of the two non-grant-earning pupils was taken from this, it would still leave at least 2676. If this were correct, the grant would then be $\\frac{2675}{2840}$ or about $653.85.\n\nI hope that I have made myself understood and I sincerely hope that it will be found to have been a mistake. It has been such a hard winter that the loss of 100 dollars or more in our grant will be plainly evident in a deficit at the close of the year.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It was caused by the wood-work catching fire from the furnace pipe, running through the new wing, in the school-room floor. I examined the pipe hole where the fire started, and was surprised at the poor work done around the thimble running through the floor, in fact it was a veritable fire-trap. The work around the thimble was done with pieces of brick and mortar and this was enclosed with pieces of plank, which became heated and caused the fire.\n\nThe water supply in the building and the house were used to good advantage to put out the fire, after it was located, under the school-room floor. The fact of the school-room floor being laid with maple flooring and no draught to get to the fire, saved the building.

Yet I take the liberty of presenting another similar case, equally encouraging and deserving. Our Board during the last year expended in the Birtle Boarding School $6080.00, not only putting the school in a state of repair but purchasing a large tract of land,-240 acres in all. The building as formerly arranged would accommodate 50 pupils, but will now accommodate ten more,-60 in all. The present enrollment is 53. The Indians on the neighboring Reserve are unusually friendly, as is the case on all the Reserves recently. Without solicitation eight boys and two girls have come from the Lizard Point Reserve and more are promised for 1909. This is of course encouraging to the Department as it is to us, and especially to the missionaries. We have in Mr. McLaren far and away the most aggressive men we have yet employed. He is so strong a man intellectually and scholastically that it is only the question of health that has led him into the Indian service. Now that we have him we must try and keep him.\n\nIn order to make it possible to take in as many children as there is accommodation for, would it be possible to increase their per capita grant for 1909? If so it will be much appreciated.\nOttawa, February 8, 1909.\n\nRev.

You may use your own discretion as to when and how the regular leave is to be taken.\n\nIn future communications with the Department it would like you to write on paper of foolscap size, as the pages used by you are most inconvenient for filing purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Sir,\n\nMr. Wheatley, Indian Agent, in his January report on the Birtle Boarding School, states that Miss Susette Blackbird, a graduate of the school, was in charge of the class-room at the time of his visit; the regular teacher, Miss McGregor, being absent on leave. Mr. Wheatley speaks very highly of the work that was being done by Miss Blackbird and suggests that her services might be utilized by the Department in some of the day schools.\n\nThe Department would like to have a report from you as to the age, educational qualifications, etc., of this girl, and you should also state whether you consider that she is possessed of the other qualities which tend to make a successful teacher of an Indian School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

Mr. McLean\nIndian Boarding School, Bo\u00eete.\n\nDear Mr. McLean,\n\nIn reference to your inquiry concerning Susie Blackbird, I would say that, in my opinion, she is liable to attacks of a \"hysterical\" character, in which emotional outbursts are a conspicuous feature. These attacks being most likely to occur if she, in any way, overstresses her physical or mental capacities. This would in all probability mean were she to undertake the responsibilities of scholastic duties without having someone to whom she could refer if necessary; it is quite a different matter teaching here to what it would be elsewhere.\n\nHer personal & family history, as touching such as to make it advisable for her to lead a life free from mental stress as possible.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Maclean,\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your favor No. 116624/7 regarding the age qualifications etc. of Sweetie Blackbird (Pupil No. 034), I would say that she was exceedingly pleased to have her work as substitute teacher as favorably reported to me by the Indian Department. She has known for years that she was an Indians girl of unusual talent but unfortunately handicapped physically as you will see by the enclosed report of our school physician Dr. Wetherburn.\n\nSweetie is one of five children of a half-breed Indian woman by name Betty Blackbird who belongs to the Kurekowomin band of the Battle Agency. This woman in her youth was a most attractive looking woman and as a result she was repeatedly desired by white men who should have known better. The family are therefore largely half breed. Sweetie, for this reason, is reputed to be one of Winnipeg's leading prostitutes\u2014she was once a factor of the Red River Mounted Horse of the Hudson Bay Company. The worst kind of woman was unable to give proper care to the children. What little care they got was given by a sister (of the mother). Subsequently married to Mr. Joseph Boggan\u2014a chief\u2014a councillor and a missionary of the Kurekowomin band and by Chief Leo Boggan. By these two\u2014the whole family was put in this school\u2014Sweetie being a toddler of about four years of age. She has been 15 years in the school\u2014being now fifteen years old. The mother degenerated into a demoralized prostitute following the lumbermen and associating with the same Indians one of whom Jack Foster by whom she lived with a husband and wife. Among the conditions of the matter and the poor rearing of all the children during their first years of life\u2014all the children were weak in...\nIndian Boarding School,\n(Birtle Agency)\n\nBirtle, Man., 190\u2014\n\nBody and some how in mind particularly the boys. The oldest boy and a sister younger and one older than Neville died when they became about thirteen years ago. The two who survived live because of exceptional care. The boy Jacob was saved and nursed and was successfully treated at the Portage la Prairie hospital by Doctor Lindo in 1904 and 1905. Since then he has been residing at Redvers Indian Reserve. He has grown in vigor, mind and body and is now one of the most nearly clean living industrious young Indians in this agency. At present at the age of 23 he is making little progress being housed fed and clothed by Indians who require his services\u2014particularly by Chief Mr. Bone and Joseph Boyer. Under proper guidance and properly equipped he would make a good enough for a school boy's colony. He simply needs sympathy and a little friend to do his thinking and encourage him. So far, he has not got a fair chance and therefore no good location for him or his own work. His land is rough scrubby land unsuitable for a boy of his temperament and means of equipment of one horse and three or four cattle. Moreover the present house and stables and surroundings of cultivated soil through Boyer abutting his location\u2014which Mr. Boyer has offered to the land for something over a hundred dollars would be a little use to him under the circumstances. More especially if his present stock on him in payment. It is this scheme thought out by the resourceful mind of Mr. Boyer who contemplates developing this property to build near his own farm\u2014that is the real root of the unhealthy report concerning Neville. What holidays Neville had until she was 16 years old were spent with Mr. Bone. But when Mr. Boyer's own daughters Clara came to school he asked that Neville be allowed to spend her holidays with Clara and Neville's aunt\u2014Clara's stepmother and Boyer's second wife. Mr. Boyer following others somewhat an exceptional girl she was and immediately began to plan to get control of her upon graduation.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6251, File 575-1, part 1)\nIndian Boarding School,\n(Birtle Agency)\n\nI told him plainly that while Susette (health permitting) would be allowed to visit his house provided only proper persons were encouraged to come there while Susette was there\u2014 that neither he nor any other Indians would ever be allowed to exercise any guardianship over her\u2014seeing the child had been given to them to have our nation by the poor mother\u2014that the guardian right of heir he knew had been formerly recognized or acknowledged by myself & family\u2014and that the attempt to allow Indians to adopt and take back to join a similar person had been frustrated by his agent's refusal. Failing here he said thought of getting back settled somewhere with a house of his own and Susette as housekeeper. Here came the suggestion that Susette teach the summer day school displaying her manner who spoke from a certain school displaying her manner\u2014had done fairly good work also\u2014evidenced by the knowledge of English by the few young pupils who attended this school from here last autumn. Mr. Barger has never missed an opportunity to complain of Miss Murray, and as Miss Murray's work had been disparaged also by the agent\u2014the proposal to have Susette as teacher was simply a means to an end. I have repeatedly told the agent and the doctor when asked his opinion privately by Mr. Wheatley not more than a fortnight since told him that teaching as a permanent occupation would mean a complete break down of the girl. But a desire to please Mr. Barger to have this Murray removed and incidentally if possible get the girl away from the school which has been practically her only home since infancy and when anything prejudicial to her welfare has been correctly safeguarded against.\n\nThen on certain private reasons arising out of a difference between Mr. Barger and the agent's house that have no place here.\nIndian Boarding School,\n(Battle Agency)\n\nBATTLE, MAN.\n\n358973\n\nIn view of the importance of the report as to\nSaville's success as a teacher, we urge your favor. However,\nto the fact herself and her future, for that is the chief thing\nto be considered.\n\nSaville is one of the most capable all-round gifted\ngirls I have met. She has inherited her father's musical gifts,\nalong with certain dangerous physical tendencies from\nher mother. She has acted as substitute occasionally whenever\nher manager has been ill\u2014on a day or two at a time. She has\nno original gifts but is able to follow a routine worked out by\nher former instructors\u2014with wonderful fidelity. She also\nis able to maintain good discipline\u2014this largely because she has\nbeen accustomed to it. She has to fall back on this\ninstructor's approval with rarely. The religious and ethical teaching\nis a little beyond her and she could not undertake this kind\nof work without extra training. She is deficient in reasoning\npower and in prolonged application. On this account we\nhad to give up our plans of having her join for her entrance\nand teacher's examination. We also found the necessary\nconcentration of mind was having a harmful effect upon\nher mind. We find the work is beginning to tell on her\nand that it would be undesirable to take her & continue\nit. Anything requiring long mental strain is unsuitable\nfor her. We fear the dangerous symptoms of her\nworry tend to arouse the dangerous symptoms of her\nphysical ailment mentioned in Dr. Hildreth's report.\nTeaching once more would therefore be out of\nquestion.\n\nLast spring along with Louise Catteau, now at Kamloops\nat school\u2014Saville had charge of the kitchen for some seven\nweeks and did exceedingly well. This too was a work\nroutine but she gave out under that and was under\nthe complaint for some months until for a time we found\nher mind was affected\u2014she used to become excited or\nsomething similar but so that she felt traps and nothing\ncan be held by the hand or the arm. Her mind at the\nsame time becomes clouded and melancholy and unpredictable.\nShe got rapidly worse when she went to the reserve owing to the\ninduced anxiety and the settling comment of the Indians.\n\nIndian Affairs.

She an unusually handsome and accomplished girl whose cleverness would be lost upon any of the Indians in this district. She is aged 18th October, stained Christian character to whom the license of the average Indian would be repulsive and repugnant and to whom the rough and ready life of the reserve would be the sure precursor of a physical break down.\n\nYou will pardon me for the length of this letter of explanation and for the personal considerations which I necessarily have alluded unto it.

It is to be hoped that her health will enable the contemplated plan to educate her as a nurse to be carried out. In view of the conditions as described the Department will not at present allow her to engage in teaching, and, in order that there may be no interference by outsiders, her name may remain on the roll of your school, although it will not be possible for the Department to pay the grant in her case.

Sir,\n\nIn view of the amount of arable lands now in connection with the Birtle Boarding School the Department is of opinion that the services of a competent practical farmer would be of great benefit in giving the boys training in agriculture. In view of the proposed closing of the Regina Industrial School and the consequent increase in the per capita grant to your school it might, when the change is consummated, be possible to provide for such an appointment.

The parents as well as the pupils cherish such. For some years we have given a diploma framed and also a graduating class photo to our graduates. They are being found doing up in a prominent place in their homes and act as an incentive to the pupils to live up to the standard and not disgrace their school. Thus we feel by the Department will appeal still more strongly to the Indians as being a beautiful and tangible token of the Government's paternal interest in their children.\n\nWould the Department provide interested with an instructor manual of the drill used by our Canadian regiment and cadet corps? Our new farm instructor J.M. Seppala, B.S.A., B.S.C., is a former member of the American Volunteer Corps and is thoroughly up in the manual of the U.S. Army. He is most willing to give our boys a thorough course in British drill if he can obtain a manual which will show how American British differs from American drill. We are exceedingly fortunate in having such a thorough, enthusiastic and well educated man as he leader to round off our staff. His graduation from Columbia University in Art and Law and Manitoba Agricultural College in Agriculture. He is especially well up in the care of stock and in the analysis and cultivation of soils. He is getting fully helpful aid in experimental plots on plot for each boy and girl so that they may be taught the process of improving the soil growing the finest crops may be taught to the children. This work is being conducted upon the same principles as the Macdonald Institute Public Schools.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nW.M. Laverne\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, April 22, 1910.\n\nRev.

My substitute during that time will be J.W. Snyder, B.A., L.L.B., an undergraduate of Manitoba Agricultural College, who is at present farm instructor.

McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour favor No. 16624/1 of the 16th inst. came duly to hand.\n\nI desire to bring to your attention the policy of your Department as to the desirability of providing a competent practical farming instructor for the crops of this school. At the time I came to the school five years ago, I felt that something more than was being done should be done in the way of keeping the crops occupied and producing them for future use on the farm. We had then but two acres in crop. During the next two years we broke up all the arable land on their head - some thirty acres in all. By examining closely one of the new reserves, the church authorities gave me a grant of $250 per year towards the salary of a farm instructor. With that, they managed to have a new house built, provided a land locker of farming experience in the Old Country for the first part of each year, but now that we have some acres in crop this year and will have about 120 acres in subsequent years, and now that we have a large number of boys over fifteen years of age, I feel with you something more permanent and effective is needed. Up until now, any money I could spare has been devoted to the equipment of the farm. In fact, the last two years, I have spent some $100 in the last two years. Unfortunately, this hail and frost during the last few years, particularly the last three, saw some loss and beef cattle. We have had no revenue from the farm and have had to expend from $250 to $300 a year for fodder and seed. Last year we got with 175 bushels from 50 acres of crop because of hail. The result is a deficit of some $150 against the school due almost entirely to the loss by hail and frost in our farming operations. This rather discouraging state of affairs also militates against any larger outlay towards the salary of a first class farm instructor. I trust that with the closing of spring, our school may have an opportunity of completing its equipment from the funds saved by stock and implements necessary to work the large farms, anticipating somewhat your suggestions and in view of the necessity of having a competent man to take my place while I should be absent or otherwise engaged.\n\nI have signed J. H. McLean, B.A., M.B., B.S., as farm instructor and assistant principal. Mr. Snyder is a new teacher by both and having spent fifteen years on a farm there. He is a productive A.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He desires to devote himself to industrial mission work. It consequently logically is connected by Principal Clark of the agricultural college and respectfully accommodating his knowledge and things to the practical needs of Indian work. I think he will become an intimate friend to each\u2014being obtained willing to lead the boys learning from a reasonable scientific standpoint and yet enable them to deal with the limited resources usually at their disposal where setting up for themselves. He working splendidly with the boys and seems to know how best to benefit them.

As the proceeds went down from the Principal R. B. Stern towards covering out the deficit of the Regina School, and the stock is much higher in price at Regina than here, the amount thus from a financial standpoint has been done, although it meant disappointment to any of our Boarding Schools who may have been notified of possible distribution.\n\nHowever, Inspector Graham has very kindly sent me and promised they are on their way\u2014a cow and a heavy gang plow for breaking and stubble work\u2014also house hold effects and tools for the use of the seven pupils such has.\n\nOur present stock of horses is inadequate to undertake our work. We have one draught team for general purposes and an old pony. During the very early spring we shall get in our teams of crop this year but mind that will go in the last week of May\u2014all after too late to be of the best results. This summer we wish to break 30 to 40 acres more, with an average of over 100 acres seed crop. We shall require at least a strong four horse team or preferably two teams of the amount of plowing necessary about a school five hours\u20143 boards on a light frame, 2 hours and three springs and 2 for general work. Given a walking plough, harrowed, two and also in need of milk cows. We have no pasture for cows and two calves only two of them on milking. The others will not come in until late in the summer. We require two men in full health to provide for the needs of school and hospital. A friend of the school gave us a fine young stock horse bull\u2014rigid\u2014 and extra well bred\u2014so that with a nucleus of good cows we hope to work up a good herd.

While in Edinburgh, demand the allotment of trust funds to the extent of $100 per year for the education of our graduates who by the proper qualifications mind and character do work of an educational or missionary nature among their own people. Miss Blackbird is the first to benefit under the fund. Only Indian boys and girls of very superior character will be recommended in the future and all subsequent graduates drawn and from the fund must express their willingness to pursue their further education under the immediate supervision of one of our Boarding Schools or of one of our church mission or colleges such as the one at Red River. Miss Blackbird is 15yo. and also to devote themselves to work among their own people subsequent to graduation under some Protestant body interested in Indian work. I have another boy recently from Regina - Alice Field by name who is attending the Battle Public School with a view to becoming a teacher. If he succeeds in securing a certificate and proves himself worthy, this same fund will provide for his professional training at the Normal School at Portage la Prairie. In this way there will be a minimum risk of our graduates becoming separated from their own race and from work among and for them.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6251, File 575-1, part 1)\nI should like the Department to consider the admirable manner in which Miss Blackbird has conducted the hospital during the last four months. It is reported that she has taken full charge of the patients, discharged her duties with great satisfaction to herself, and has been able to perform them during my frequent visits. She has effected a saving of the usual salary paid to a trained nurse of $5 per month for four months or $20 in all. I would suggest that an allowance be made for her work and that an increase be given her training this winter, she be granted $15 per month or $60 in all. The school gave her $20 per month last winter when acting as substitute for Miss Macgregor in the classroom.\n\nLastly, I should like to know what steps have been taken in connection with the tent hospital associated with the Bertha School. Prior to its removal to Bertha, I agreed to become responsible for its financial management and for its general supervision under the direction of Mr. Agent Wheatley and to finance it for the year at a maximum outlay of $250 spent from the reserve of removing the tents from Wagway to Bertha and of rebuilding them there. I have not the exact figures at my hand but so I recollect them, the gross cost of maintenance was including considerable capital expenditure for a new tent and furniture and clinical supplies has been considerably under $250 for 14 months. The hospital has done good work, has won the confidence of the Indians, and the wagway occupiers, and has given our older pupils good training in simple nursing. I am quite ready to continue to do what I agreed to a year ago, but if the hospital is to be habitable for the winter certain improvements will have to be made immediately. The two tents used by the patients as sick wards are no longer satisfactory. The strain of the weather during four years constant service has worn out the cotton that they no longer afford protection to those sheltered within. We found also that a tent was hardly suitable as a constant abode for the nurses, and it would be difficult to get a good nurse.\nI have been consulting with those connected with tuberculosis institutions in Great Britain and Canada during my absence and also attended the Tubercular Congress in Edinburgh last June and practically all are opposed to the use of the tent for hospital purposes save an open outdoor shelter from wind and rainstorms saying they are difficult to ventilate and also that they also provide no dormitories. One of the chief requisites along with fresh air and food is clean water. In our region where they are also less available in temperature and too expensive in the matter of fuel. If the Department deemed it advisable to continue the hospital upon the tent a permanent building basis, I would advise the erection of simple inexpensive wooden structures of the same size as the tents above mentioned providing a maximum of sunlight and fresh air. Beyond the framing of the structure practically all the normal labor will be done by the older boys once proficient in wood working and carpentry at Regina. The total cost would be little more than that necessary to replace the tents; the outlay would be fixed and the structure could be constructed to admit of being easily taken down in case a removal was deemed advisable future time. If it is decided to go on as before with the abro improvements included, I shall then be in a position to provide for the necessities of the winter in the way of fuel, drug and food supplies\u2014things which would not come under pending definite instructions.\n\nI would advise also the insurance of the tents and other property of the hospital\u2014the cost to be met out of the vote for maintenance. The whole property especially if improved otherwise will be worth from $100 to $200 and when so many storms and such a precaution against loss would limit the responsibility of them in case of the hospital.\n\nFinally, I shall be endeavoring to secure a successor for Mr. Blackbird and I should like to receive your advice whether the instructions of the Department in that connection.\nI regret that owing to my lack of foresight in arranging for my return passage from Liverpool to the West, I did not secure tickets permitting my going to Ottawa and returning in person the matter referred to in this form. I would thank the Department for their kindly attention granted me during the last summer, and I am glad to report that I am returning to the Butte School fully restored to continue the work there. I trust that even more than in the past, the work done in the future may merit the confidence and commendation of the Department.\n\nKindly address reply to me at the Butte School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW. M. Larran\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, September 29, 1910\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, and in reply to that portion in which you ask for leave for Miss Blackbird in order that she may attend the Training Home in Toronto I beg to say that the Department has much pleasure in granting your request.\n\nIf you will submit to the Department, through the local Indian Agent, a voucher for the salary of Miss Blackbird for four months at the rate of $15.00 a month, accompanied by a certificate from Dr. Wotherspoon to the effect that her duties were satisfactorily performed during that period payment will be made.\n\nYour remarks with reference to the tent hospital will be dealt with in another letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. W. W. McLaren,\nPrincipal,\nBirtle Boarding School,\nBirtle, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nAs convenor of the Committee in charge of Indian missions within the Province of Manitoba and the North Agency I was directed to send a confidential statement as to the condition of the work on the various reserves, and in the school, suggesting certain things which in our opinion would lead to more efficient results.\n\nWe would endorse heartily the action of the Department in appointing a special officer to enforce the Indian Act, while we feel a short-service official whose identity would be absolutely unknown to Indians outside settlers would secure a more thorough enforcement of the law especially against the hardened offenders most of whom so far have managed to avoid capture; and also a more equitable distribution of sentences (many of the officials would have no political business or social affiliations) yet while knowing the personal weaknesses in character of some respects in the Indians we feel he is the most competent official to secure for himself in this agency there has been less drinking, less wandering about, and more attention to farm work during this last summer than in many a previous year. The large amount of breaking occurring following these promises will for another year. The continuance of the special officer for another year would conserve the gains already made.\n\nWe would ask that all offenders be prosecuted without fear of favor outside settlers whether they wish it or not be admonished or give evidence. Cases particularly at Waywayseecappo and Keewatinwinni were not prosecuted because of the aloofness of certain settlers. Certain old offenders escaped because of their deceiving information against them. Offenders with less social influence are punished and some were let off lightly or not punished.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6251, File 575-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nbecause of family and other affiliations, while depreciating the infliction of severe penalties on the Indians\u2014still we think something more than a mere talking to or empty threats is required to instill respect for the law. The use of firm-handed butters, carrying a period of months or years strictly enforced, with thanks for accomplished upon the reserve would be useful in this regard.\n\nFurther, we would ask that the confidence of our missionaries who have done so in their power to assist the officers of the Army be thoroughly respected and that their names be kept strictly out of all reference in matters relating to the enforcement of the law except when they themselves proclaim to the Indians their personal concern in the matter. All our missionaries openly let the Indians know of their intention to uphold the act, usually telling offenders beforehand of their contemplated action, but information given in confidence as to what witnesses or offenders should be treated as strictly confidential\u2014otherwise the missionaries will have to choose between action which holds the confidence of their Indian congregations or sustaining the officials connected with the agency.\n\nA more strict supervision should be maintained over visitors from befriended settlements\u2014from other agencies and particularly from the United States. This seems particularly true of the Bird Tail reserve. Practically all violations of the Indian Act which occur there are due to the evil influence of visitors. All cases of gambling drinking, immorality, pagan marriage which have occurred in the last five years at the Bird Tail have been due to this pernicious outside influence. Public opinion on the reserve is against such violation of the law & the better Indians reflect promptly any infraction thereof. All violators should be warned upon duty and any offenders immediately dealt with by fine, imprisonment, deportation. Observe the work done in our schools among our simple minded Indians in contrast to the more polished, more clever Indians from the United States.\n\nSomething should be done particularly at Waywayseecappo.\nReserve & safeguard the young graduates from the in-\nternal pagan influences which prevail so large an ex-\ntent. The best male graduate from the North School Walter\nLongeleara through the continued pressure of his parents\nwas initiated into the medicinal rites but also was made\na brave a day or so after the treaty payments in June 1879\nthis boy and another young Indian initiated at the same\ntime now act with four other men as medicine men going\nthrough all the ceremonies incidental to such treatment.\nThe refusal of a fine doctor to all able-bodied Indians has\nplayed into the hands of the pagan medicine men women\nwho have discreetly been called in to treat school graduates\nand their families. Immorality is so rife that no girl over\nfifteen years of age is safe from solicitation some of the girls\ngraduates will be unmarried refuse to remain at home, keep-\ning out at service because the want of protection afforded\nby their friends and some of the older girls now at school have\ntheir names too familiarly associated with men upon the\nreserve because of what took place when they were house\nfor their holidays. The changed disposition for the worse their\nconduct upon return to school gives evidence that common sense\nhas all too good a basis in fact. Unfortunately some of the worst\noffenders to the chastity of the younger girls are the older\nschool graduates who fall victims to older women, now\nalso married as a rule the chief offenders to the chastity\nof the younger girls these girls naturally when they marry\nare too often faithless. The evil thus spreads & the whole moral\ntone of the reserve falls often to a lower level than upon a\nprosperous pagan reserve. The consequent spread of sexual\ndiseases militates as a high birthrate & a weak rising genera-\ntion of children. The regular visitation by a qualified physi-\ncian, Dr. Gilbert who speaks the Indian language\u2014dis-\ncusses lectures by him on the causes treatment of diseases\u2014\nthe gradual suppression shameful pagan rites\u2014a more\nstrict suppression immorality as a measure of compulsory\neducation which should instill as many young boys\nboys girls to run up with the free license of the reserve women to meet & eat these girls the formation of some kind of Colony etc that at the Hills seems the only remedy for the evil upon this one reserve unmarried girl graduates at home or out at service should have special supervision to allow them girls to work in hotels in white houses where people have an unsavory reputation for immorality dealing in liquor or breaches with parents or guardians who are unfit to occasionally afford to the wishes of their wards to remain chaste & Christian should not be permitted yet such things are continually allowed in this agency no decisive action is taken to remedy matters.\n\nWe would heartily commend the new policy the Department with reference to schools particularly so far as they relate to the Girls Boarding School in connection with the Methodist day school upon the Keshawonawas Reserve we would recommend that with a view to appointing a qualified certificate teacher for the school (its chief need at present) that the school be thoroughly renovated with a view to making it habitable for the teacher whose up to date for efficient work we would recommend a measure of compulsory education throughout the whole agency. Parents of able bodied children over say ten years of age being required in the presence of the Inspector at the treaty payments to give adequate reasons why their children should not be sent to school. Practically no Indians in this agency are opposed to education they simply do not care to send their children to school particularly if they are Indians. In this connection particularly if the parents be a under old or delinquent the treat many of the school children should not be funded the funding of treaty money is one of the chief objections to letting the children go away. Under the new regulations any encroachment is made in the Girls School the new buildings should be large enough to provide accommodation for all.\nChildren of school age\u2014between seven and fifteen years. The school at present is completely organized, and there are full twenty children of school age, apart from those at Kenekonominis\u2014Reserve not going to school within the agency\u2014and the population of the agency in spite of death by sicknesses is increasing slowly. The quiet presence of Inspector and Agent backed by regulation instructions from the department together with the cooperation of the missionaries would mean that practically no child would grow up uneducated, particularly of delicate children who are taught in connection with an open air service. Connected with the hospital, we welcome the more strict supervision. The school by Departmental inspectors and the determination to keep the school up to the highest possible efficiency, and as an aid thereto, the large increase in the per capita grants.\n\nOwing to the insufficiency of the per capita grants in the past, the school has had to depend upon loans or grants from the Church\u2014so into debt as allow the pupils their education to suffer. The former course was pursued apart from the expenditure in conjunction with the Department of $1000 in 1866-67 for the complete renovation. The school proper\u2014the Church has spent $1500 to provide the same has given loans (the extent of $175) for the running equipment. The farm\u2014has paid up deficiencies in current accounts\u2014therefore the inadequacy of the per capita grants\u2014the extent of $250 more today, the school has in addition to the loans just mentioned an overdraft at the bank of $2500 or a total liability of $3500 as this money was incurred in providing efficient means for caring for and instructing the children particularly in farming\u2014providing food, clothing\u2014sanitary housing such as wood keep the children in the best possible health\u2014and such as they have done, the persistent just complaints of the parents and guardians of the children\u2014we would respectfully ask the Department to consider the...\njustice and advisability of their meeting to pay this obligation which would not have arisen at the rate had been upon the 700 per capita basis during the last two or three years. Free from this large indebtedness, the school moved out of the increased profits and the revenue from the farm will be able to make the additions to the buildings, stock equipment, the farm necessary if it is to give efficient instruction in mind farming & the pupils. The Church has during the last year made an all round increase in the salaries paid its principals, matrons teachers with a view to securing better and more permanent staffs. At Butte this movement increased our budget by $450 last year apart from the increase in those working upon the reserves. The Department can rest assured that anything the Presbytery can do to promote the efficiency of the school or the welfare of the Indians within its bounds will be done heartily and cheerfully, and any measure of cooperation deemed advisable will be given.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nS.M.K.

Viz:\n\n1. Enlargement of barn - to include new horse stables, larger piggery, granary, and proper hen coops, cost about $750.00. This will provide room for 10 horses, 25 head of cattle, 100 fowl, 5 breed sows, and 20 or 30 hogs, including the present stable; which accommodates but 5 horses, 15 head of cattle, 3 sows and 20 hogs.\n\n2. A heavy team of horses, with harness, cost $550.00. Present equipment consists of 3 work horses, 1 set double harness, and 2 set single harness, insufficient to work 100 acres, now ready to be put in crop, and do necessary teaming of a school.\n\n3. A new binder, cost $150.00.

At present\n\nIndian Affairs.

Practically all butter has to be purchased, and insufficient training given in dairying.\n\n5 - 1 set of bob-sleighs, cost about $30.00. The school at present has but one set, which is insufficient for the amount of teaming necessary in the winter.\n\n6 - 1 single walking plough, cost about $30.00.\n\nThe school out of its revenue has tried to equip the farm, but owing to frost for two years, hail one year, and insufficient work, in 1910\u2014along with the fact, that all but 10 acres, has been broken in the last four summers, the farm has given small returns\u2014causing a deficit in current account of $2500, in the school funds. Out of the school funds, in addition to maintaining all buildings and equipment in full repair\u2014has been expended fully $2000.00, distributed as follows:\u2014New stable for cattle and hogs $350, small granary $75, horses $550, harness $70, cattle $200, hogs $40, fencing $250, waggon $75, binder $50, gang plough, 2 breaking ploughs $80, seed drill $110, hay-rack $20, gasoline engine, 4 horse power, $135, Cream separator, $30, and farming mill, $40, and the usual quantity of small tools. Owing to the smallness of the per capita grant $72. per head, this has meant\u2014the carrying of an over draft at the bank of $2500, at the present time.\n\nOn the new $125. basis, the school will be just able to meet all running expenses, and keep everything in full repair, because of the larger demand.\ndemand, which will result from the upkeep of larger buildings, and a more expensive staff. Henceforth the school will be responsible for $1100. of the salary list\u2014 or $22. per capita on the 50 pupil basis. This leaves $103. per capita for the school, which just suffices, apart from the farm, to run the school upon an efficient basis. Apart from the farm or special grant\u2014 there is no available fund to meet either the cash deficit, or equip the farm.\n\nI have been requested, by the Principal of the Birtle Boarding school, Rev. W.W. McLaren, to place the above facts before the Department, for its favourable consideration, as under the present financial conditions, the farm equipment is not sufficient to work 100 acres. It is only fair to state, that unless the farm has proper equipment, very little can be expected of the pupils, under present conditions,\u2014 only a very superficial knowledge can be gained. The Dairying also is a necessary branch, that should be taught the girls, and the school should keep more milch cows. The quarter section of land purchased by the school, should be increased, at least by another quarter, which would allow more land for cultivation, pasturage and hay.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 13, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant in reference to repairs to the Birtle Boarding School and equipment.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that under the new agreement, which went into effect on the first of April, the Church authorities are responsible for all equipment and buildings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Gilbert our medical officer in cooperation with Charles J. Andrews, Pupil No. 320. This boy had his left eye ball burst while watching an older boy lift a pair of tongs out of an old crockery pan - by means of a looped piece of wire. The weight of the water in the pan caused the small end of the loop to spring back and strike the boy's eye with force enough to rupture it. Fearful of the injured eye by the injury and of the healthy eye in case sympathetic inflammation set in, I had the midnight surgeon stop his Sabbath evening - a few hours after the accident and took the boy to St. Boniface Hospital for treatment by Dr. Ford. Within half an hour after our arrival the eye was examined by Dr. Tremblay, Dr. Ford's partner. He is fearful not only of the sight being lost in the eye but also that it may have to be removed to prevent injury to the other. Meanwhile he is doing his best to save the injured eye by prompt disinfecting the boy for life. We believe will report more fully in connection with his monthly hospital report.\n\nI trust this best but necessary procedure will meet with your approval.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW. M.

This school of course, is conducted on the per capita basis, but I think the principal might be written to to the effect that if the requirements of the school could be met within the town at prices as reasonable as they could be bought for in Winnipeg, it might be just as well to have this done.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nOttawa, February 17, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nIt has been represented to the Department that the groceries used in the Birtle Boarding School are purchased in Winnipeg instead of locally and that this is not in fairness to the dealers of the town of Birtle.\n\nWhile the Department fully realizes that your school, conducted upon the per capita grant basis, is entitled to make purchases wherever they can be had to the best advantage, still it is considered that if the local dealers would give you as good prices as you can obtain in Winnipeg it would be more satisfactory to expend the funds provided by the Department in that way. This suggestion is offered to you and if upon inquiry you find that you can obtain as good terms in Birtle it would be well to buy there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev. W. W. McLaren,\nPrincipal,\nBirtle Boarding School,\nBirtle, Man.\nIndian Boarding School.\n\nBillie Agency.\n\nBillie, Man. Feb. 23 1912\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nActing Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYou have in No. 624/11 of the 17th inst., regarding the purchase of supplies for the Billie Indian School and its provisions in particular, come duly before me in reply I would give the main principles governing me in my purchases both for the school and for the Indian Hospital.\n\nFirstly, I consider the money placed in my hands as a trust committed to me by the Indian Department and by the Presbyterian Church in Canada. As such, it is my duty to expend them to the best advantage, irrespective of any affiliations political, ecclesiastical or geographical. This trust is now incumbent upon me among this school has been, and so today laboring under a heavy deficit incurred almost wholly in an endeavor to provide the pupils with the most wholesome diet possible and to provide our farm with a proper equipment. By during the last seven years - the same standard of expenditure for foodstuffs had prevailed in Billie School as has prevailed in even our other Presbyterian Schools - we would have had no deficit but owing to the presence of a very large proportion of children in this agency predisposed to scurvy, pulmonary tuberculosis and anaemia complicated with heart weakness and owing to the complaints made by the Indians particularly in the earlier years of my principalship as to the quality, variety, and quantities of food given the children and owing to reports asked for from me as house diet by the Department itself - our expenditure for foodstuffs was raised from 27\u00a2 per capita in 1905 to 38\u00a2 per capita in 1911. The difference in these rates will represent the actual increase because the purchase of provisions from wholesale establishments has never been considered balanced therein in the cost of foodstuffs. The purchase of provisions locally meant either a larger deficit for the school to carry or a decrease in the quantity of food or the purchased a poorer quality. Our local merchants had full control over supplies until 1904. They looked upon the schools legitimate pay for private gain upon a retail basis and not as institution doing a work of charity and purchasing food upon a wholesale basis. For ten percent off - the usual.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6251, File 575-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nIndian Boarding School.\n\nBelle Agency.\n\nBelle, Man.\n\nIn order to save money, we must be very careful in our purchases. We have been working hard to reduce our expenses and improve our budget. The school has been doing well, but there is always room for improvement.\n\nSecondly, subject to the above principles, always give the trade of the school to Presbyterian merchants seeing it is the Presbyterian Church that is responsible for the capitalised ordinary expenditure over and above all grants made by the Indian Department. Then use Presbyterian merchants in the dry goods and grocery lines in Belle. The firm in Winnipeg with which I deal is one of the most generous contributors to the benevolent work of the church and society. Its leading shareholders take a deep interest in assisting our Indian work. Allow flour and meat are purchased locally from Presbyterian business men who have met me halfway and who in addition have come to our assistance in other ways when called upon. Some 10% was paid therefrom. Of the local merchants got $34. The remainder spent on food stuffs $268 went to the Winnipeg firms.\n\nThirdly subject to the above two principles, I give all trade to local men. Our total controllable expenditure last year against foreign sources came to $665. Of this $4047 was expended locally and $267 outside (in the main for grocer, boots and shoes, dry goods and fuel). In all cases the local men have had an opportunity to compete and I have purchased from outsiders only when I was the gainer financially.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The wholesale firms in Winnipeg have been exceedingly courteous, painstaking and generous in their treatment of me and of some of my other Indian schools. All denominations throughout the West. They have promised for me any articles I desired from other wholesale firms - articles not kept in stock by themselves. To deal a firm which has been the receiver of savings over hundreds of dollars in actual cash and also by compelling local merchants to deal with us on reasonable footing when purchasing in wholesale quantities. In the case of purchasing from local men some firms have never paid a farthing to the school in its twenty-five years' existence in this place and who have treated it and the Indians throughout its history and all of whom have treated it solely as a public institution from the maximum. If such was to be taken instead as a charitable enterprise deserving common consideration - would not be honorable way of doing business.\n\nI do not think these principles really conflict in any way with the suggestions made in your favor. This school is a source of gain to every business man in Belle - either directly through sales to the school or indirectly through purchases by members of staff. To purchase outside only subject to these principles.\n\nFifthly - the same freedom of purchase - on condition of which I agreed to try to finance the Indian Hospital here if possible upon the basis of not more than $250 per year so to be continued. I would not care to be irresponsible for its financial success if it were to be founded by the limitations of patronage lists drafted to vent political spleen or petty business rivalry. Our school has high ideals. From such in the past and do not wish to entangle in such in the future. Only thus can it maintain an honorable reputation as an institution maintained by one of the Canadian Christian denominations.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nW. W. Laren\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Agent further reports that there is a lack of union and harmony between the Principal and the ladies of the staff and he suggests that the want of discipline in the boys may be owing to this, as they are very observant. The Agent is of opinion that a male teacher should be employed to take charge of the boys at this school and, under existing conditions, this would appear to be necessary. He also states that an instructor should be employed to teach the boys farming and the care of stock.\n\nAs you are aware this school is rated in Class \"A\" and receives the maximum grant of $125.00 per pupil. The Department trusts that the church authorities will at the earliest possible date obtain the services of satisfactory and efficient staff throughout. I shall be glad to hear from you in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. A. S. Grant, M.D.,\nSupt. of Home Missions of\nThe Presbyterian Church,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nD. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nExtract from Report of G.H.Wheatly, Indian Agent, on the Birtle Boarding School for the month of November, 1912. Original on File 116624/7.\n\nThe class-room was visited and was clean and in good order. The pupils present were clean and fairly well clothed. Progress noted in the girls in the different grades, in reading, writing and arithmetic. The boys are making no progress at all, and the lack of discipline amongst them is very marked. They pay very little heed to their teacher, and this is very noticeable amongst the bigger boys, who think that they are too big to go to school. Calisthenics are taught daily, but the boys take no interest in this and the performance I saw must be very discouraging to the teacher. There seems to be a lack of union and harmony between the principal and the ladies of the staff, and this may account for the lack of discipline amongst the boys, as they are very quick to notice, and this seeming lack of harmony is doing lasting harm to the school.\n\nAs this school is rated No.1, and receives a Government grant of $125.00 per capita for 50 pupils, the staff should be increased, so as to give the best instruction and care to the pupils. A male teacher should be employed to take charge of the boys, one who had a knowledge of drill, and would be a strict disciplinarian. An Instructor should also be employed to teach the boys farming and the care of stock, etc.\n\nSgd. G.H.Wheatly\nIndian Agent.\nI have the honour to report for your information, that the Rev. W.W. McLaren, Principal of the Birtle Boarding school laid an Information against Johnny Singoose, pupil, No.122, charging him with breaking into the school storeroom and stealing candies, and running away from school. The value of the candies stolen was $1.00. Two other boys Allan Mecas, No.118, and Gilbert Longclaws, No.119 were also mixed up in the affair. Constable Thomas Bell was sent after Singoose to the Waywayseecappo's reserve, and he returned with him on the 24th instant, and was brought before me, along with the other two boys. All pleaded guilty to breaking into the storeroom and taken the candies. I gave the boys a good talking to, and warned them, to conduct themselves better in the future, as in case a like offence was charged against them, that they would likely get a sentence in the town cell if it was proved against them. As these boys are employed when not in school, working on the school building, and receive 10\u00a2 an hour for their labour I decided that they should pay the expenses of Const. Bell which amounted to $10.50 for livery meals and days pay.\n\nTo\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, January 10, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo reporting the fines imposed by you on some of the boys at the Birtle Boarding School who were found guilty of stealing.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your action in this matter is approved. These occurrences are an evidence that the report made by you in November last, was well founded and I may add for your information that the Department upon the receipt of the report above referred to communicated with the Rev.

This cannot be done, if the farming instructor is classified as a labourer and has to be the general choreman for the school, (and this is the only classification to give the present holder of the position) he loses prestige with the pupils and cannot possibly have much influence or time to teach anything practical to the boys who are generally inclined to pay very little attention to his orders.\nOttawa, September 18, 1913.\n\nRev.

We are\npaying large amounts for salaries and for maintenance,\nand have put a great deal of money into these school\nbuildings, and from the trend of some of the Department's\nletters, it would look as though we were the parties that\nwere being benefited, rather than the Government. You must\nnever forget that in educational matters the Indians are the wards of the Government, and not of any church, and while we are trying to help in the matter of their education, we believe the government ought to always be ready to meet any reasonable request that is made to them, where we are volunteering such large expenditure of time and money.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nASG/CMcG.\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Supt. of Home Missions\nPresbyterian Church in Can.\nIndian Boarding School,\nBelle, Man., Sept. 27, 1913.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you that my term as principal of the Belle Indian School ceases October 1st next, and that Rev. D. Donald B.A.; B.D., Springfield, Mass., will succeed me. Mr. Donald is a nephew of Principal Donald of Aberdeen, Scotland. He was brought up in a farm in Scotland, came to Canada as a boy\u2014twenty-eight years ago. He taught school in Manitoba for ten years and has been running a spring field for two years. He is about twenty years of age and from his varied experience should prove a most successful and efficient principal.\n\nI would thank the Department and its officers for their courtesy and assistance to me and to the school during the last eight and one half years.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW. M. Loring\nPrincipal\nOttawa, October 3, 1913.\n\nRev.

McLaren\nBirtle Boarding School,\nBirtle, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report for your information, that the Principal of the Birtle Boarding school, Rev. W.W. McLaren, has resigned, and his successor the Rev. D. Iverach, B.A., has been appointed to the position, and has taken charge from the last instant.\n\nThe new Principal is a married man, and has a family of four small children, and as there was no accommodation for his family in the school building, he has rented a house in the town of Birtle. He takes his meals at the school, and sleeps at home.\n\nThis arrangement may work very well, but in my opinion, the Principal's residence should be close to the school, especially during the winter months, as in case of a fire breaking out during the night, it might end disastrously, for the lack of proper discipline.\n\nThe new Principal has had ten years experience, as Principal in the Public schools of Manitoba, and has a good knowledge of farming.\n\nTo\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report for your information, that in company with the Rev. D. Iverach, Principal of the Birtle Boarding school, and his predecessor Rev. W.W. McLaren I made a round of the Bird Tail Sioux, Keesekoowenin's, Rolling River and Waywayssecappo's reserves, for the purpose of placing before the Indians the new Regulations, entered into between the Department and the Presbyterian Church in relation to the Birtle Indian Boarding school. We also put before them the several reasons why every parent who has children of school age, should send all who were physically fit to attend. The Indians on each reserve gave us a hearty welcome and all expressed their views, that it was a good thing to have their children educated. As conditions in the school had not been as they should have been, owing to lack of discipline, and the proper teaching of English, through the pupils having been allowed to speak their own language most of the time. They also felt that something was radically wrong to account for the frequent runaway of the pupils. The Indians found fault with the school on these heads. It was explained to them that these matters would be remedied, and the Department would now have a closer supervision over the school, and that the new Principal had the authority to discharge any member of the staff.\n\nTo\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nstaff, who failed to faithfully fulfil their duties, as laid down by the Church authorities and the Department.\n\nNow that the improvements to the building are about completed, and the school starts work under the new Principal, with a new staff, the Indians could feel assured, that the interests of their children would be well looked after in the future. They asked to have time to see how the school was to be conducted, and if satisfactory to them, that they would send their children to school.\n\nOn the Bird Tail Sioux reserve, all the children of school age, fit to attend, were their parents have promised to enter them by Nov. 1st. next; two of them are over 15 years and have never been to any school, Simon Hanska, No.29 and Samuel Bopha, No.35, who enter from Nov.1st. to April, 1st. These boys are anxious to learn English and agreed to go to school for this term.\n\nIt now remains for the school authorities to let the Indians of the reserves see, that improvement along the lines mentioned above are carried out, when I am assured, that the number of children required to fill the school, will be forthcoming.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\n447780\nIndian Boarding School,\nBirtle Agency.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBirtle, Man., October 31st 1913\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg leave to report that Miss Alison B.

To make the school a success and give the new principal a free hand to carry out his programme, he should have a new qualified staff under him.\n\nThe Farming Instructor, as I have previously reported, is a good labourer, but not qualified as an instructor to properly teach farming, maintain discipline and have the goodwill of the pupils.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nIn those schools for which you have demanded the larger accommodation, the increased cost of maintenance is so great that we find it impossible to carry on these schools on the per capita grant that we are receiving. We have been putting up money all year for Birtle, and are now asked for $2000 more, over and above the receipts, and the Board is not going to stand for this large expenditure. Unless you are prepared to meet this situation by increasing the grant, we will have to close these schools. I think, if we pay the salaries of the workers, we ought not to be expected to furnish these farms and equip them, and also bear the brunt of the expense of carrying on the work of the school. This is the work of the Government. Now, unless you are prepared to do something to meet this situation, you will have to bear the whole burden of this yourselves, as we cannot continue to spend as much money as we are doing on this work.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Superintendent of Home Missions\nPresbyterian Church in Canada.\nMr. D.

I am glad to know that there is a possibility of evolving a scheme by which the difficulties regarding the Roman Catholic and Protestant children in the schools will be solved. You say that you do not think that you can hold out any hope for an increase in the per capita grant. That simply means that we will withdraw from this Boarding School work. It is unreasonable, with the increased expenditure that has been caused by the demand made by the Government for larger buildings and better equipment, and the increased cost of living, we should be expected to carry on this work. It looks to me like a very short sighted policy on the part of the Government, inasmuch as, by educational measures alone, they can never solve this Indian problem, and, in my judgment, are wasting the people's money by their present methods.\n\nThanking you for the information contained in your letter,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA.S.G.-A.V.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Can the Indian agent there prevent said child from attending Birtle Indian School?\n\nCan the Roman Catholic clergy take this child against the wishes of the father from home and place in a Saskatchewan Catholic School; are these Church schools under government control?

If the Government want an assistant principal in connection with the Birtle School, they will have to furnish the salary. The grants that we are receiving for the maintenance of this work are altogether inadequate. We have relieved the Principal of the Birtle School from all responsibility for work on the Reserves, so that he might give his entire time to the work of the school. He has no occasion to be absent on any Church business, because there has been none assigned him, and the business of visiting the Reserves to receive recruits should be the business of the Government, and not the Church. We spent over $2000 on that school last year, and nearly $5000 the year before because of arrears, and we do not purpose increasing the expense of maintenance by appointing any additional workers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAndrew Grant\n\nIndian Affairs.

A. S. Grant, Superintendent of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, who states that they have relieved the Principal of this school from all responsibility for work on the reserves, so that he might give his entire time to the work of the school, and that he has no occasion to be absent on any church business.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

SCHOOL.\n\nMiss Elizabeth McCurdy, the teacher has had four years' experience in the Indian work. She has a first class certificate and Normal training, but is not competent to handle the class-room at the school; if it is proposed to continue the system of all the grades in one class-room, Miss McCurdy has a good way with the younger pupils but has no control over the larger scholars and a change of teacher should be made at once if the one class-room is kept at this school.\n\nIn my opinion it is necessary to have, in addition, to the present staff a good general purpose man; at least during the summer months when the farmer is away so much, owing to the distance of the school farm from the school\u2014three miles. He could run the garden with the smaller boys and girls and earn his wage easily in this way. The Principal of an Indian Boarding School situated on or near the reserve has a lot of running about to do and the school should never be left without a male officer in charge. I have reported on this matter before and the Church should be notified at once that it is necessary to make this addition to the staff. The Presbyterian Church having shown their interest in the education of the Indian children by the very large amount of money they have recently spent on an addition to the Birtle school, they should now go a little farther and make the staff fit the building.\n\nSlates are being used in this school and the sooner they are done away with the better as there is altogether too much noise in the class-room.\n\nReport dated\u2014May 27th, 1915.\nOttawa, June 19, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nComplaints having been made about the moral conditions at the Birtle Boarding School, Mr. Inspector Jackson was instructed to make a special inspection and report upon this institution dealing particularly with these charges. His report has now reached the Department, from which it would appear that there were ample grounds for the complaints made.\n\nMr. Jackson attributes the bad conduct of some of the pupils to the want of proper supervision. The Principal lives in the town of Birtle, about a mile away from the school, and cannot, therefore, have the close supervision which would be possible if he were living there. The other male member of the staff is a married man, who lives with his wife on the second floor of the school building, and, as the boys are not locked up at night there is nothing to prevent their getting out, if they wish to do so.\n\nMr. Jackson gives it as his opinion, with which the Department agrees, that, in addition to the present staff, a good general purpose man should be engaged, at least during the summer months when the farmer is away so much, owing to the distance of the school farm from the school. On April 26th, last, we were advised that it would be\n\nRev. Andrew S. Grant,\nGeneral Supt. of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\nConfederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nbe well if an assistant principal were engaged. I trust you will see the necessity of having an extra man engaged for this school.\n\nMr. Jackson, in reporting on the class-room work of the school, states that Miss McCurdy, the teacher, is not competent to handle the classes at the school if it is proposed to continue the system of all the grades in one class. Miss McCurdy has a good way with the younger pupils, but has no control over the older scholars and a change of teacher should be made at once, if one class-room only is to be kept at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, June 21st, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, submitting your report on the moral conditions and other matters affecting the Birtle Boarding School.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the Department has noted carefully the different portions of your report, and the Rev. A.S. Grant, Superintendent of Presbyterian Home Missions, is being requested to arrange that the pupils at the Birtle Boarding School receive closer supervision in the future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

McLean,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McLean:\n\nFile No. 116624/1. Yours of June 19th received. I note what you say about discipline in the Birtle School. We relieved the Principal of the Birtle School of all work on the Reserve, so that he could give his whole time to the School, and then we appointed a competent farm instructor to have oversight of the boys. I do not see that the grant we are receiving for the pupils would stand for any more supervision than this. The cost to us of conducting this school, as I have already stated, is already altogether out of the question. I will take up the matter of the teacher also with the Principal of the School at once.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA.S.G.-A.V.\nGeneral Superintendent of Home Missions\nPresbyterian Church in Canada.\nMr. J.

Grant,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letters of 18th ult. and 22nd ult. have come duly to hand.\n\nRegarding the heating plant, I beg to state that the plant was examined last winter by a skilled workman and pronounced in good condition. The small repairs that are now necessary can easily be done before the plant is needed. I would point out, however, that the real difficulty with the plant is due to the long distance the steam has to go in making its circuit. The far end of the class room is over 70 feet away from the boilers and it takes a very high pressure to keep up steam with such a length of pipe and radiators. This difficulty can only be overcome by constant attention and an abundant supply of fuel. It is too late now to discuss alterations in the plant. No matter what the Government inspectors may ask, I would not recommend touching the plant. I think, however, that a better stove in the class room would be all right. There should also be a better stove in the laundry as the old stove there now is wasting fuel.\n\nRegarding the water supply, I have already informed the Department that our present supply is insufficient, and that I would not approve the sinking of a well at the back of the school as there is no likelihood of our obtaining a permanent supply.\nfrom that source. The Government has already refused to repair their own well that caved in through bad workmanship. I don't see why we should do it when we have water enough without.\n\nI think we can get the old poultry house repaired at a small cost, and we have part of the work done. This building was out of use for some years. We need a good place for pigs if we are to continue to keep them.\n\nRegarding the report of Inspector Jackson regarding moral conditions here, I would beg to point out that the matters dealt with in his so-called investigation were fully considered by Dr. Murray on his visit here last winter. The main point was that two girls, pupils of the school, gave birth to children. Both these girls had been absent during the month of July for holidays. Both laid the blame on pupils of the school. I accepted the statement of the first as true and was a consenting party to a marriage between the persons named. I have since had strong suspicions that I was deceived, but cannot say for certain as the child was of premature birth. In the second case I was positive that the girl had been guilty of immorality on the reserve during holidays and that it was impossible that the boy named should be guilty, as he was at school and they could not have met for over two months. The birth of the child showed that I was right, but the parents of the girl were angry that their plans miscarried and I have since been informed they have slandered myself in connection with the matter, but not before the Inspector.\n\nThe problem of safeguarding the girls both in and out of school is always a difficult one in Indian schools, more especially\nas little or no dependance can be put in the girls themselves, and here where there is so much cover the problem is more difficult. After thinking the matter over I determined to make the work of supervision easier for the matrons by enclosing the girls playground with a strong fence. This was completed in August last and since then we have had no trouble with girls straying beyond bounds. I cannot however say that there will be no trouble of the same kind as last year, as I do not think the parents will take the trouble to look after the girls properly during holidays.\n\nNow, regarding the fact of my residence being a mile away, I think my wife has more reason to complain than either the Church or the Government. Mr. Jackson made a note of the fact that I am here almost the whole time from the time the children get up in the morning until they go to bed at night and the farmer is just as constantly on duty and very seldom away at night or in the evenings. His room is at the foot of the stairs where the boys come down. I have no reason to believe that the big boys come down the stairs at night and Mr. Jackson can produce no evidence to that effect. It is only a simple matter to turn a key to lock them in, but we have no done so regularly, as I did not think it necessary, and I am still of the same opinion. I have already pointed out to you the advantage of having a good handy reliable man about the school all the time, but this would not be advisable unless the attendance is larger. So far as I can see the discipline of the school has been steadily improving and the supervision of the children has been as close as at any period in the history of the school. Truancy has now almost disappeared.\nIn regard to Miss McCurdy, I have given the matter careful attention and regret to state that so far as I can see the only satisfactory course is to remove her from here and appoint a new teacher in her place. I thought that I had made that plain to you a year ago. My letter in the winter had reference solely to the threatened action against her for slander. I did not intend it to be taken as an endorsement of her work. I have never been satisfied with the results of her teaching larger pupils and do not think results from her teaching ever will be satisfactory.\n\nIf it is possible to secure a good male teacher I think that would be the easiest way of meeting the wishes of the Department. If that is not possible a good strong woman would do. It will also be necessary to secure another assistant matron for the laundry. Miss Henderson is withdrawing from the work owing to her brother's death and other family rearrangements. Up to the present the crop prospects were never better and the garden is looking well.\n\nIn previous years I have urged the necessity of owning the land between us and the street. The Department sent their Inspector over it last year and he recommended the purchase but nothing has been done. I think it would be well if there was an agreement reached on this and other matters. They have put new desks in the classroom; are improving the hospital and have authorized the fitting up of the gymnasium. They wish us to move the sewing room. I think about a week's work with a carpenter and a small amount of material would do. The new arrangement would be better as it would be easier to keep the girls on their own side of the building.\n\nI pointed out to you in previous letters that it would be\nmore economical for the church, more satisfactory to the Department and much easier for the principal if you could secure a man who could live in the school and whose wife could be matron. This might now be possible, as the principal does not need to be qualified for the ministry since the work on the reserve has been taken off. I would not recommend the building of a principal's residence at the school, but if such a step is considered, I would point out that there is a good residence nearby that can be bought cheaper than we could build. This house cannot be rent as the owner lives in it.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) David Iverach.\nOttawa, July 17, 1915.\n\nRev.

Our present contract with the Government would not be renewed at the present rate, and we are not going to undertake the work of carrying on these schools unless the Government are prepared to meet the situation, as far as requirements go for the educating of the children. You might as well know the worst now, before we enter into any further contract.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA.S.G.-A.V.\n\nIndian Affairs.

My attention was called to general condition of the Hospital department. The buildings are most unsatisfactory, especially that occupied by the nurse. This building is really unfit for occupation in winter time. The kitchen and wards are about 20x24, nurse's apartment 12x20, divided into two rooms. On the south side of each ward are verandahs, enclosed by wire screens, used for open air treatment. The wards might serve their purpose seeing that outdoor treatment is necessary in the majority of Indian cases. The floors, however, are in bad condition. The inside walls of all the buildings have been ceiled with lumber, put on before properly seasoned, and by no means free from knots. In many cases these knots have fallen out, leaving holes.\n\nThe nurse's room is a one-story building\u2014poorly built; the inside ceiled, with unseasoned lumber, and in many places the shrinkage has resulted in cracks or openings. A single room, with four outside walls, and a poorly ceiled roof, cannot be made habitable, or comfortably so, in 40 below zero. It simply cannot be kept warm in winter. Everything liquid freeze the moment the fire declines, and in extreme cold, ordinary firing will not resist frost, even in daytime. If the nurse has much of a strain upon her, she ought to have at least a decently comfortable place in which to rest and sleep. The kitchen or work room is also intolerably cold in winter. A range stands in the centre, and beside it a large heater. The cooking range is not sufficient to prevent things freezing in the cupboard, or larder, in daytime, but has to be supplemented by the heater, in extreme weather.\n\nIt is difficult to make a suggestion. The wards might serve if repaired. The store room is not important. The other rooms should be reduced to lumber, and the lumber utilized in erecting a more comfortable structure. There is no reason why the kitchen, nurse's rooms and store room should not be arranged under one roof. The nurse's room need not be connected with the other parts, but the three rooms could be so built as not to have more than two outside walls. The one could protect the other. Fuel could be saved and comfort increased. The present condition is not in keeping with comfort, even to a decent degree. Nurse White was afraid to face the winter, and resigned last summer. Nurse Denny declares the rooms quite unfit for occupation. As you know her resignation is in. There may be other reasons as well for her resignation, but the fact remains that she considered the domicile unfit for winter occupation. The Government should put these buildings in comfortable condition before another winter. I feel confident that, if the Government\nrealized the actual condition, no pressure would be necessary. The Department I believe are anxious to have things right.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nS. C.

The building was in good repair and the dormitories, kitchen, laundry, sewingroom and basement are kept in excellent order. The Gymnasium-room is used for calisthenics exercises and other drills, for both boys and girls. The stables and other outbuildings are kept clean and in fairly good condition.\n\nThe pupils are well clothed and neat and clean about their persons, and their table manners very good. Bed-clothing kept in good condition.\n\nThe sanitary and ventilation arrangements, are kept in good working order.\n\nThe water supply is sufficient for all necessary requirements in the school, also for fire purposes. The Cottage hospital also gets its supply from the school plant, but it has to be carried there in pails, which entails extra labour for the nurse, when bathing the patients.\n\nThe fire equipment seems to be in good condition and fire drill taught regularly. I have advised the Principal to have the fire-hose tested, so as to be sure, that there is no defects in it.\n\nTo\n\nThe meals served to the pupils, are prepared by\n\nThe Asst.

(RG 10, Volume 6251, File 575-1, part 1)\nprepared by the older pupils, and are of good quality, plain but substantial. The bread used, from second grade flour, is good and wholesome. The cooking and making of the bread, is under the supervision of the Asst. Matron, Mrs. W.A. Mitchell. The girls are receiving an excellent training in the kitchen, laundry, sewing-room and the general work done, in a well regulated household. Butter-making is also taught during the summer months and poultry raising all the year round. The pupils attend in the class-room regularly, with the exceptions of half days, when the senior pupils, are receiving their training along the above lines; under the supervision of the Principal and the Asst. Matrons.\n\nThe senior boys are receiving an excellent training, in farming, gardening, in the care of stock, use of carpenters tools, running the gasoline engine and the general work necessary, on a well conducted farm. The boys also attend to the milk cows and do the milking, and the necessary chores about the school and the Cottage Hospital. The boys are under the supervision of Mr. Perry, the Farming Instructor and his assistant, Mr. Gibson. The boys are getting an excellent grounding along the above lines, and the senior boys, seem to have a good knowledge of farm work and the care of stock, which it is hoped, that they will put this knowledge to good use, when they leave the school and start farming on their own account on their own reserves. Both the instructor and his assistant, are good practical and experienced men, and take an interest in the pupils and their work, and the result is that the boys are interested in farm work and are making efforts to master all the details of running a farm, which they will have to do, on their own ac-\naccount, when they leave the school and start farming for themselves.\n\nStock:\n3 horses, 3 mares, 1 mare colt, Total 7 head.\n9 milch cows, 1 heifer calf, \" 10 \"\n2 Breeding sows, 6 young pigs \" 8 \"\n40 poultry, 3 Turkeys \" 43\n\nAnimals sold & beefed.\n1 cow beefed, 4 yearling steers and 3 Bull calves sold. Young stock realized $192.00. Young stock sold on account of shortage of feed.\n\nThe general work done by the boys, during the quarter, under the supervision of the Instructor and his assistant is as follows:- 32 cords of wood hauled from the farm to the school, car of coal hauled from the C.P.R. Station, repairs done to stables, two new hay-racks made, repairs to root-house and henhouse, and running chopper etc. They also carried out a contract for grading a road near school farm, which when finished, the school Principal received the sum of $150.00 for the work done. $11.90 was also collected for chopping grain, for outsiders.\n\nOwing to the continued cold weather, the cost for heating the school buildings will be very high this year. Hay and straw were a very light crop and feed scarce in this district and it was on this account that the young stock was sold, as it is the school authorities have to purchase feed for the remainder of their stock.\n\nMr. Gibson the asst. Instructor has resigned. It is not a very easy matter to engage a suitable man at present, and it is the intention of the Principal to get along without one, for the present, as the\nthe older boys are looking after the furnace etc., under the supervision of Mr. Perry.\n\n**Classroom**\n\nThere are 70 pupils on the Roll, classified as follows:\n\n- Standard 1: 30\n- \" 2: 14\n- \" 3: 17\n- \" 5: 9 = 70\n\nThere were three pupils graduated \"Xmas. 1917,\" and seven new pupils enrolled. The average daily attendance in the classroom is about 65. The pupils are making excellent progress in reading, writing, spelling, arithmetic and geography in grades 1, 2 & 3. In grade 5 the pupils are making steady advancement, in reading, spelling, writing, arithmetic, composition, geography and drawing. They speak English fairly well now and the improvement along this line is very marked. It was noted also, that during the \"Mas.holidays,\" when the pupils were at home on their reserves, that their behaviour was excellent and while often being entertained, by their white friends in the vicinity of their reserves, their conduct and table manners were excellent. The teacher Miss Leslie, also the staff deserves credit, for the good work now being done at this Institution, under the supervision of the energetic Principal, Mrs. S. Marshall.

It was a very poor building, and in winter was most uncomfortable. They are persuaded, however, that, with an attendance of seventy pupils\u2014and more expected\u2014it will be absolutely necessary that there shall be a nurse employed at Birtle, giving practically all her time to the care of the children. You are now providing nurses at Cecilia Jeffrey, Portage la Prairie and File Hills. We trust that you will adopt a similar policy in regard to Birtle. It may not be necessary to secure the nurse until after the summer holidays, but, when the autumn comes, another member will have to be added to the staff.\n\nI trust you will give us permission to engage a nurse beginning say the 1st of September. You are allowing us $50 a month for the other nurses. I presume the nurse at Birtle should receive the same remuneration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.H.E.-A.V.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nMay 20th, 1918.\n\nDear Mr. Edmonson -\n\nI have your letter of the 16th inst., with reference to the appointment of a nurse in connection with the Birtle Boarding School on account of the closing of the cottage hospital.\n\nI am leaving the office today for some time, but I shall keep your request in mind and give the matter consideration at an early date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

In return for each visit which he makes to the school he will be paid $5.00 for his services. He should only be called when it is absolutely necessary for him to treat any of the pupils. The payment of $5.00 will cover all work which he does at the school. Under ordinary circumstances in all cases where pupils suffer from broken down glands of the neck, etc., they should be sent to Dynevor Hospital, where they will receive necessary medical attention from Dr. Grain. It is expected, therefore, that it will not be necessary for Dr. Smith to perform any operations at the school, and you should guard against such necessity arising.\n\nThe pupils with broken-down glands now in the school will have to go to the Dynevor hospital for treatment, and their parents or guardians should be notified that this is to be done.\n\n\"In the event of pupils from the school who require...\"\noperations, being sent to Dynevor Hospital, it would seem unnecessary to employ a woman as nurse at the school, but I may say that your recommendation in this connection may be submitted. The Department does not propose to engage a trained nurse in any event.\"\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) G. H. Wheatley,\nIndian Agent.\nMr. D. C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI wrote you May 16th re appointment of a nurse at the Birtle Indian School, Manitoba. I am enclosing a copy of a communication that was sent by Mr. Wheatley, your agent, to Mrs. Marshall, the principal of the Birtle school.\n\nMrs. Clark, the Convener of the Indian Committee of the W.M.S. was visiting the school at Birtle, when this communication reached Mrs. Marshall. She, at once, sent it on to me. After looking over the situation carefully, Mrs. Clark feels that there ought to be someone appointed at Birtle to care for the health of so many children. She feels that in the event of it being necessary to send a few children to the hospital at Dynevor, a nurse's salary would soon be covered, even at $50.00 a month, as it means a trip of over 200 miles each way.\n\nMrs. Clark reports that Miss Reid, a graduate of one of the Winnipeg hospitals, is now at work at Birtle. She will be there for a month and is willing to remain if the Government will grant her a salary of\n$50.00 a month. We, of course, cannot retain her unless the Department is willing to allow her this salary. As you are supporting nurses in other institutions of a similar character, we do not see why you would not be willing to retain a nurse at Birtle.\n\nHoping to hear from you soon,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/LM.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6251, File 575-1, part 1)\nI think you will agree with me that a graduate nurse could not be actively engaged all the time at a small school like Birtle, unless in the case of some unforeseen epidemic; in such cases special provision may be necessary, as we made at File Hills recently when they had an epidemic of small-pox.\n\nI have looked over the record of the Birtle school for a year past and find that they were almost entirely free from any serious sickness necessitating children being placed in the hospital for treatment. With the provision we have made for the treatment at Dynevor Hospital of special cases, I think the welfare of the children will be satisfactorily safeguarded. Might it not be possible to have the nurse at Portage la Prairie spend a portion of her time at Birtle, which is not far distant. This would be carrying out the policy originally agreed upon.\n\nThere is only one other institution in Canada at which a nurse is engaged at the expense of the Department, and that is the large industrial school at Brandon, with an enrolment of over 120 pupils, more than double the number at Birtle.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nJune 21st, 1913.\n\nDear Mr. Edmison -\n\nI have your letter of the 17th inst., with enclosure, in further reference to the appointment of a nurse in connection with the Birtle Indian Boarding School. When I made the arrangements with Dr. Grant in January, 1914, provision was made for the appointment of two nurses whose services would be given in connection with the schools conducted under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church. For a time one nurse was at File Hills and later on a transfer was made to the Cecilia Jeffrey. At the present time we are paying for two nurses, the one just mentioned and one at the Portage La Prairie Boarding School. There is a nurse at the File Hills Colony but none on the staff of the school.\n\nI am sorry that I cannot see my way clear at the present time to increase the expenditure for this special work.\n\nRev.

Wheatley Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\n\"Birtle Boarding School\"\n\nSituation:\nThe Birtle Boarding School is situated in the town of Birtle, Manitoba on the west bank of the Bird-Sail River.\n\nAgency:\nIt is situated in the Birtle Indian agency, Treaty No. 1, J.A. Knott as the Indian agent.\n\nLand:\nThere is 80 acres of land belonging to the school, of which five acres are under cultivation.\n\nReligious:\nThis is a Presbyterian school and is conducted under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church.\n\nBuildings:\nThe school is a large grey stone building three stories high and also has a basement. It was built by the Presbyterian Church at a cost of $7000. The government did not give any grant toward building the school. It has ample accommodation for 45 pupils. The building is heated by two furnaces which burn cordwood. Beside the school building there is also a good sized barn, upon a stone foundation, which will accommodate 15 head of stock.\nThe Birtle Boarding School was started at the beginning of the first quarter 1888 and was conducted in the public school building which was closed from the town of Birtle for the summer. This seems to have been rented from the town up to the summer of 1889. In the Presbyterian Church built a new school of their own at a cost of $1000.\n\nThe first Govt grant given the school was in 1888-89 by an order in council dated 23rd May 1888. The amount paid each year they were granted an allowance of $60 per annum for each of 20 pupils. The amount of this grant actually paid the school for that year or till the end of the June quarter 1889 was $469.19.\n\nThe Estimates for the school were the same in 1889-90 as the previous year but only $26.42 of the grant was actually paid to the school.\n\nIn the Estimates for 1890-1 the grant was increased to 25 pupils @ $60 per annum. The school only received $927.50 of the amount voted during that year.\n\nIn 1891-92 the Grant was increased to $1410 being an allowance of $72.50 per capita for each pupil up to the number of 20. The school continued to be paid at this rate during the fiscal years of 1892-93 and 1893-94, also during the year 1894-95.\nIn 1895-96, the grant was increased and the estimates for that year provided for 25 pupils @ $7.00 per capita.\n\nIn 1896-97, the school was paid at the same rate as the preceding year viz.: 25 pupils @ $7.00 per capita.\n\nIn 1897-98, the estimates provided an allowance of $7.25 per capita for each of 40 pupils being an increase for 5 pupils over that of the two preceding years.\n\nIn 1898-99, the grant remained the same as in the preceding year of 1897-98.\n\nNote: For all correspondence in regard to above increase in grants or in connection therewith see File 58, 2417/116, 624.\n\nFacts of interest in the Bertha Body School:\n\nOn the 31st Dec. 1888, the Rev. Andrew Band Joint Commissioner of the Presbyterian Synod wrote the Comm. of Indian Affairs and among other matters stated that a Boarding or Industrial School had been opened at Bertha and was being conducted in the public school building which had been rented and fitted up for the purpose. He requested the Govt. to purchase the building which the town was willing to sell and place under the care of the Church for Boarding School purposes. The school was situated so far out of the town that it was inconvenient for the purpose for which it...\nit was built and because of this circumstance it could be purchased at a price much below the original cost.\n\nIn a memo of the 6th June 89, the Deputy Chief of Indian Affairs stated that he could not entertain the proposal of giving assistance towards the erection or purchase of school buildings situated on land which does not belong to the Govt.\n\nHowever, on the 16th Nov 89, the Dept wrote the Indian Comm at Regina instructing him to find out and report the value of the building and how much it would take to complete a similar one.\n\nThe Comm replied that he had procured the services of a contractor who valued the building and its site together with the site to be worth $9,000.00 and that a sum of $5,000.00 would be necessary to improve the building before it would be suitable for school purposes.\n\nIt was also of the opinion that a new building equal to the one now standing could not be erected for less than $9,000.00.\n\nWhen the Supp. Estimates for 1891-2 were being prepared an amount of $10,000.00 was put in \"for the erection of the building and purchase of necessary land\" for the proposed Boarding School at Birtle but for some reason...\nSome reasons were afterwards struck out. This fact shows that it was at that time the intention of the Court to give the Presbyterian Church a grant towards building the new school.\n\nFor further information on this point see letter dated May 18, 1894 on file No. 116, 624 to the Rev. Andrew Baird.\n\nAlso correspondence on Cowcotland File No. 116, 747.\n\nAgent Marple in his report for 1894 says: \"What a splendid stone building who completed and fairly well furnished and was occupied in October 1893 with an average of 30 pupils. Previous to that time the work was carried on in a building not well suited to such work.\" (This was probably the Public School Building which was first rented in 1888.)\n\nIn a letter to the West, dated April 6, 1894, Rev. Mr. Baird said that during the summer...\n(continued)\n\nSummary of 1893 a store building costing $7000 was erected in the town of Birtle at the expense of the Church.\n\nLand again on the 7th January 1899 writing to the Dept he says that the land was purchased and the buildings erected entirely at the cost of the Presbyterian Church. (See plans of building on File No 116/674.)\n\nMr. Wadsworth in his report dated June 17th 95 on this school estimated the land, buildings etc. to be worth $7970.\n\nThe following bands are benefited by the school:\n\n\"Bird Jail\" - Waywaysee Cappo\n\"Valley River\" - Riding Mountain\nOak River and Oak Lake Band\n\nThe inspectors and agents in their reports invariably give the Birtle School a good report.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6251)\n\nFile 568-1, part 1\nBirtle Agency - Rolling River School -\nProposed School. 1893\n\nFile 575-1, part 1\nBirtle Agency - Birtle Residential\nSchool - Presbyterian Church - General\nAdministration. 1899 - 1920\n\nFile 575-1, part 3\nBirtle Agency - Birtle Residential\nSchool - Presbyterian Church -\nGeneral Administration. 1933 - 1948\n\nFile 575-2, part 1\nBirtle Agency - Birtle Residential\nSchool - Presbyterian Church -\nQuarterly Returns. 1941 - 1950\n| Date       | Description          | Amount |\n|------------|----------------------|--------|\n| 1/1/49     | PA 1/3/49 GP         | $61    |\n|            | E                   | $285   |\n| 7/1/49     | ML 7/1/49 AP        | $61    |\n|            | E                   | $696   |\n| 1/1/50     | PA 1/1/50 AP        | $61    |\n|            | E                   | $696   |\n\nDO NOT WRITE BELOW THIS LINE\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6251, Pile 575-1, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nDear Sir,\n\nSome time ago you wrote me that one of the teachers at Birtle was not doing the proper quality of work. I took the matter up at once, with the result that the teacher of the senior room is being released, and the Committee is this week making an appointment of a teacher, re whom I will notify you a little later.\n\nThe particular item about which I wish to speak to you is this; I find that there has been a very serious mix up in regard to text books at Birtle School, and in justice to the outgoing teacher, I must state that I feel she has been in large measure a victim of circumstances, through not being furnished with proper text books. A very insufficient number of text books were on hand at the opening of the school, and the teacher had to manage with this insufficient equipment until such time as other books could be sent. When the books arrived, some one who had not sufficient knowledge of geography to realise where Birtle school was, sent on Ontario text books to be used under a Manitoba inspectorate, which naturally aroused the criticism of the Inspector and handicapped the pupils in having to change again to other text books in the middle of the term. In some subjects none of the text books arrived until the school year was nearly over. Is it any wonder that the pupils have shown very little progress this year? Why I was not informed of this earlier, I do not know, or I should have certainly kept the wires hot to Ottawa. I realise that with a change of administration and the death of Mr. Ferrier, and the multiplicity of details undertaken by those who were striving to carry on work new to them, that mistakes easily occur. It is too late this year to rectify the mistakes with the pupils, but I do wish to make this statement in justice to the teacher, as I feel that no teacher could have accomplished proper work in another term under such circumstances.\nI hope you will note this in regard to Miss Manzer's work. At the same time, we are letting her out.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary, Indian Department.\nOttawa, July 6th, 1933.\n\nMadam,\n\nIn the absence of Dr. McGill in the West, I desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant.\n\nIt is noted that you have arranged to replace the teacher of the senior room at the Birtle Indian Residential School. In this connection, I may say that, in reporting on his visit to this school on the 6th of January, last, Public School Inspector Clarke wrote, as follows:\n\n\"Regarding Miss Manzer's teaching methods, she should definitely plan her work. She should lecture less and endeavor to develop more initiative in the students. A better balanced time table is necessary. There should be an attempt made to give the pupils a desire to study, rather than to be always compelled to do so by the teacher.\n\n\"Good relations do not exist between Miss Manzer and her students. More of a spirit of indolence rather than a spirit of industry is evident in the room.\"\n\nYou will note from the above that the Inspector criticizes Miss Manzer's work and made no mention of shortage of text books.\n\nI have carefully reviewed the requisitions received from the Birtle Residential School during the past year and find that practically all the books requested by the Principal have been supplied. With special reference to the Geographies, I may say that the Principal stated that geographies for Grade Five were required and the Department, therefore, forwarded the \"Canadian Geography for Juniors\" also Work Books to accompany same. These are used in practically all Indian residential schools in Canada and have been found very suitable.\n\nWe have no record of receiving any complaint from the Principal regarding delay in receipt of books. If there was any delay, the Principal should have brought the matter to our attention and arrangements would have been made to expedite delivery.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

We are appointing in his place the Rev. E. H. Lockhart and Mrs. Lockhart, formerly of Winnipeg. Mr. Lockhart is an ordained Presbyterian minister, with full university and theological qualifications, is qualified to be principal of a school, is skilled in finance and in stretching money, and appears from the testimonials which I have had about him, to be the very man for the position. We have had applications galore for the position, but Mr. Lockhart did not apply, we approached him, and have arranged for him to be at his new post as principal the 1st of September, to be assisted by the old principal for one month, to give him a better chance to carry on the work of the school.\n\nI know that the Department will be glad that we have appointed an ordained man, as you suggested to us some time ago.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary, Indian Department.\nJuly 20, 1933.\n\nDear Mrs. McKerrell:\n\nIn the absence of Dr. McGill in the West, I desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nI note that Mr. Currie is retiring as principal from September 30th, next.\n\nI note, also, that you nominate the Reverend E.

The letter is in connection with the dismissal of Mr. Ingram who has been the engineer at the Birtle Industrial School since its completion. The Department, of course, is aware that these schools are equipped with expensive and high-priced machinery and that only qualified engineers should be placed in charge.\n\nI understand a Mr. Dunn has received the appointment but have obtained no information as to his qualifications. I am writing the Principal in connection with this matter, and will forward to the Department information. In the meantime, I thought it well to make known the change in order that the Department might take whatever action they see fit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, August 22, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from the Acting Indian Agent at Birtle, regarding the dismissal of Mr. Ingram, the engineer, at the Birtle Indian Residential School. I may state that the Acting Indian Agent reported this matter to the Department.\n\nThe Department has taken this matter up with the authorities of the Women's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church, under whose auspices the school is conducted, and definitely informed them that we could not be responsible for any damage that might occur to the plant until the services of a competent man are engaged.\n\nI note, from your letter, that a Mr. Dunn has received the appointment. Unless his qualifications are entirely satisfactory and he is fully competent to take charge of the equipment at this school, the Department will not approve of his appointment. Mr. Lazenby, who visited the Department on the 19th instant, will look into this matter upon his return to Birtle. I may add that Mr. Sutherland, Acting Superintendent of Indian Education, will be visiting this school early in September, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6251, File 575-1, part 3)\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the situation at the Birtle Residential School, as to the engineer, Mr Robert Ingram being discharged, I beg to report that acting on verbal instructions I received from the Deputy Superintendent General when I was in Ottawa, I have been to the school and discussed the condition of the heating and water systems with the Principal, Mr Currie. The newly appointed Principal, Rev; Mr Lockhart has not yet arrived at the school.\n\nThe high pressure boiler, from which is operated the steam dryer and other machinery in the laundry, is, in its present condition, absolutely useless, as all the flues are badly leaking. Mr Dunn, who has been placed in charge since Mr Ingram's dismissal, filled this boiler with cold water, and then began to apply some pressure, but before the gauge registered any pressure at all, the water was pouring out of the leaky flues.\n\nThe damage to the flues, is apparently just at the level at which the water rests when the boiler is in operation, and has evidently been caused by corrosion.\n\nMr Dunn had taken one flue out, and replaced it with a new one. On examining the flue taken out, I found that it was extremely thin in the walls, just at the water level.\n\nMr Principal Currie advised me that none of the boilers have been inspected by a boiler inspector since a year ago last spring. I therefore asked him to make arrangements to have them all inspected as soon as possible. It is compulsory that threshing engine boilers be inspected once.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Onti;\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6251, File 575-1, part 3)\nonce a year, and these only operate for a short time each fall. The high pressure boiler at the school is in almost constant operation the whole year round, and in my opinion should, for safety's sake, have a proper inspection at least twice a year, particularly as the water used in it is chlorinated before reaching it.\n\nMr Principal Currie advises me that the present condition of this boiler is due to Mr Ingram's neglect, yet in a letter written by Mr A.G. Smith, while acting as Indian Agent Mr Currie is quoted as expressing himself as quite satisfied with Mr Ingram's work at the school. This letter is dated 11th August and is addressed to Mr Inspector Hamilton. Mr Smith also states in his letter that Mr Ingram had advised him about the flues beginning to leak about six weeks prior to his writing, and that Mr Ingram had reported their condition to Principal Currie a long time before that, but no action had been taken. If such is the case, it would appear that there has been some neglect on Principal Currie's part, in not having the matter attended to promptly when it was first reported to him. I have had no opportunity to get Mr Ingram's version, as he is at his home in Virden, and I have not seen him since my return to Birtle.\n\nIn the boiler in question, there are 48 flues one of which is a new one, and before any use can be made of it, it will have to be practically re-flued throughout. What this would cost, I do not as yet know, though I am writing to the Vulcan Iron Works Ltd of Winnipeg, the makers, to find out.\n\nWith regard to Mr Dunn, who is now in charge of the plant at the school, I beg to say that he has a 3rd class steam engineer's certificate. He was in the employ of the Canadian Pacific Railway for about 9 years as a steam fitter, and states that he knows all branches of boiler work, and was a fireman on the road for some time. He knows very little about electrical work, such as electric wiring and motors. I asked him if he thought he could operate the chlorinator, and he stated that he had been trying to study it up from the books that are at the school, but was unable to understand it, which means that it will be necessary to have a representative of the manufacturers come to Birtle to teach him how to manage it, if it is to be operated at all.\n\nWhen the newly appointed Principal arrives, in a few days time, I will see him, and discuss with him plans - for -\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6251, File 575-1, part 3)\nfor the future operation of the school generally, and the engineer's department in particular, and will then report further to the Department.\n\nI consider that the change of engineers, that has been made, is a poor move on the part of the school or church authorities. Though Mr Dunn, the man now in charge, may have the same qualifications as Mr Ingram had, as to steam boilers, he has practically no knowledge at all of electrical equipment, and if any work requires to be done in connection with the electrical equipment at the school, it will be necessary to get in a competent man from outside to do it. It will also be necessary to have an expert come to the school to give Mr Dunn practical instruction in the operation of the Chlorinator, and these items mean extra expense.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

Mr Dunn informed me at that time, that he knew nothing about the filter. In reporting to Mr Inspector Hamilton regarding this department of the school, I requested him to obtain from Mr D.B.Gow of the Dominion Water Power Branch, a book of instructions regarding the operation of the filter. I received this a few days later, and immediately went to the school, and went over the whole operation with Mr Dunn, and together we washed out the filter.

The Notice is signed by Mr. Lockhart, the Principal and Mr. Lavender, who was then Agent. Mrs. Bone wishes to know if the Department have authorized such a Notice to be posted. Apparently several of the parents are quite concerned over this new regulation. They have advised me that when they were invited to the opening of the new school at Birtle they were shown certain rooms and were told that these rooms were for the accommodation of parents who wished to visit their children at school.\n\nThey suggest that if there is not sufficient room to provide quarters in the school building for accommodation of visiting parents that, at least, some small shanty with a stove be provided somewhere on or near the grounds for the accommodation of parents who visit their children during the winter-time.\n\nDuring the summer months they can provide their own accommodation in tents but they feel that at least a shed should be provided with a stove for their accommodation during the winter months if they are to be refused admittance to the school building.\n\nI would be obliged if you would let me know what can be done in this connection and if the Order prohibiting visiting as posted was authorized by the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.

The Department is aware that principals of schools are often inconvenienced by inopportune visits from Indian parents.

It is necessary, in the interests of the work at the school, that regulations be made, setting forth the time when parents will be permitted to visit their children and also regarding the accommodation that can be provided for them. As you may be aware, Indian parents have the habit of visiting schools, indiscriminately, at any time and remaining for indefinite periods. While they have the right to see their children, it must be at the time stated by the principal of the school.\n\nThe Department is asking the agent to report specially on the accommodation provided for the parents when they visit the Birtle School. On receipt of his reply, you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. E. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nW. C. Richardson, Esq., LL.B.,\nBarrister,\nElphinstone, Man.\nBirtle, Manitoba,\nMarch 23rd, 1935.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI herewith reply to your letter of March 14th,\nNo. 106-1-1.\n\nParents and other relatives of the children of our school have never been denied an opportunity of visiting their children since I became Principal. They have not always seen them at the time they asked, and that because of the children being occupied in the classroom or on other duty, but they have never had to return home without this privilege being granted them. I have repeatedly said that it is most natural that they should desire to see their own. On different occasions we have provided a sleeping place in a small room where brooms and scrub pails are stored, and that at an inconvenience to ourselves. I have also let men sleep inside boiler room. I can find no sleeping accommodation provided by the Department in the erection of this building. If there is such I would like to be shown it. There is one small room in which we store flour, etc., that I am told by members of our staff was intended for a meeting place for parents and children. This I found used for a store room when I took over the work, not knowing for some time but that that was the purpose for which it was there. These people have been given seating accommodation in a large hall to visit their children and in many cases have been allowed to be with them in the playrooms.\n\nWhen Indians, married and unmarried, young and old, men and women, boys and girls, come here and ask for sleeping accommodation, any number from one to a dozen at a time, what am I to do but tell them that I am sorry, but the Department has not provided accommodation for them, and that in coming to visit with the intention of remaining they must provide their own.\n\nThis Mrs. Robert Bone, who asked lawyer Richardson to write you, has landed in here off the train a number of times without sending any word ahead. We have always made her comfortable and treated her well. She has remained several days at a\ntime. Once in the midst of her stay here, Mr. and Mrs. Harry Bone came off the train and asked for sleeping quarters. They thought it would be all right for the three to sleep in the broom room, which of course I did not agree to, and in a way that apparently caused no offence, I told Mr. Bone the best we could give him was a place in the furnace room.\n\nNever have any of the Indians endeavored, before leaving home, to arrange with me for accommodation. They have, as it were, forced themselves upon me and I could not turn them out in the cold. I only wish a representative of your Department could have been here at certain times and could have seen for himself.\n\nThen in the matter of meals, apart from the question of sleeping quarters - those who stay at nights walk into our children's dining room for their three meals a day; but here is an instance from the nearest Reserve. One Saturday five people of one family connection came to the school arriving shortly before noon. Of their own accord they walked into our dining room. We made room for them and gave them their dinner without uttering a complaint. The next Saturday at 11.40 a.m., ten people of the same family connection came. I felt obliged to tell them that we were not prepared for them, which I did after speaking to Agent Lazenby over the phone.\n\nLet me mention this important matter. We are trying to do our best for the health and cleanliness of our children. When these children come to us from the Reserves, whether it be their first admission to the school or their return after holidays, they have to be thoroughly examined and cleansed as for vermin and skin troubles, etc. The risk is great enough through the granting the privilege of a brief visitation, but think of our anxiety when these people come and live amongst the children for days and even weeks.\n\nYou have asked about visiting hours for parents. I have not arranged such, but, as you see I have never refused the privilege. It will certainly be to our advantage to have definite hours, and I would be pleased to receive and consider suggestions you might offer in this connection.\n\nAs for the suggestion you received, re the providing of a shanty for their winter accommodation, I would suggest that if you make a move of this kind you provide two separate places, one for each sex, as you certainly do not want any opening for the bringing of disgrace upon the School and Institution, and that these places be carefully supervised.\n\nIn the matter of their stay, whether in tents or in the above mentioned places, I think there should be a limit. I think they might well be limited to two days. Some have stayed here I believe as much as a month at a time. Under these circumstances\nwe cannot do the best for the children; they are in a very unsettled state of mind while this lasts as to their studies and other duties. They want their children with them a part of every day they are here. And think of these children sitting and lying on the filthy blankets in those Indian tents.\n\nAs for the poster that was sent to the Reserves bearing the signature of Mr. Lavendar and myself. That was framed by Mr. Lavendar who told me he could speak for the Department in the matter as the Department has voiced itself really in the erection of a building with no sleeping quarters provided for the parents.\n\nAll this I respectfully submit.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL/S\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa, April 1st, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 6th ultimo, regarding the complaint of Mrs. Robert Bone, an Indian woman, as to the visiting hours and accommodation provided for Indian parents when they visit their children at the Birtle Indian Residential School, I have to say that a report has been received from the Rev. Principal, regarding this matter.\n\nThe Principal states that this woman has landed at Birtle off the train a number of times and has remained several days each visit. He states the school has always made her comfortable and treated her well. The Principal states that \"never have any of the Indians endeavored, before leaving home, to arrange with me for accommodation. Then, in the matter of meals, apart from the question of sleeping quarters, those who stay at nights walk into the children's dining room for their three meals a day.\" The Principal gives an instance of a visit of Indians from the nearby reserve: \"One Saturday, five people of one family connection came to the school, arriving shortly before noon, of their own accord, they walked into our dining room. We made room for them and gave them their dinner without uttering a complaint. The next Saturday, 10 people of the same family connection came.\"\n\nI am sure you will see it is necessary, in the interests of the work at the school, that definite regulations be made and that these inopportune visits from Indian parents be discouraged. The Principal has been instructed\n\nW. C. Richardson, Esq., LL.B.,\nBarrister,\nElphinstone,\nMan.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6251, File 575-1, part 3)\nto arrange definite visiting hours, when Indian parents will be given every opportunity to see their children. He is being informed that it is not necessary for Indians from nearby reserves to remain at the school over night. Indians from a distance, however, may be given accommodation, but their visit should not exceed 24 hours. There is certain danger occasioned to the health of the children by the visits of Indians to the school, in spreading communicable diseases or vermin. Indians, when they visit the Birtle School, are given seating accommodation in a large hall and, in many cases, they are allowed to visit their children in their playrooms.\n\nYou will see that it can hardly be expected that the Principal should provide meals and accommodation for lengthy periods for any Indian parent visiting a child at the school. There is no accommodation specially provided for over-night Indian visitors, but the Principal can, no doubt, arrange accommodation for not more than one or two over night. The Indian parents will be given every reasonable opportunity to see their children. It cannot be expected that they will be allowed to walk in at any time and interfere with the regular school routine.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, April 1st, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, regarding the matter of visiting hours and accommodation provided for Indian parents visiting their children at the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say the matter of visiting hours and accommodation for Indians at Indian residential schools is left in the hands of the Principal and staff of the schools. It is necessary, in the interests of the work at the school, that definite regulations be made, setting forth the time when parents will be permitted to visit their children. I would suggest the afternoon of the weekly holiday from classroom activities - probably Saturday in your case.\n\nFrom the information contained in your letter, it is considered you are being imposed upon by the Indians in furnishing them with meals and in the length of time they remain at the school. You should set certain hours each week for Indian parents to visit their children and adhere to them.\n\nIndians who come from a distance might be permitted to remain over night but not for a longer period. The Indian parents from the nearby reserves should not be given meals and should not be allowed to remain on the premises over night. Of course, there will be exceptions to the above, and you will have to use your own discretion in the matter. Your school should certainly not be called\n\nRev. E. H. Lockhart,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBirtle, Man.\nupon to provide meals to Indian parents from the reserves near the school.\n\nThe indiscriminate visits by parents or relatives are not in the best interests of the health and cleanliness of the children and upset the regular school routine. You should take a strong stand in discouraging Indian parents and relatives of the pupils remaining several days at a time; and this practice should not continue.\n\nRegarding the providing of sleeping accommodation for over-night Indians, I would say that, during the warm weather, they should provide their own tents and blankets. In cold weather, you will, no doubt, be able to arrange accommodation, either in the school building or in the outbuildings, for an Indian who remains over night. The Indians should be definitely informed that they cannot remain for a longer period than one night, and their visit should conform to the periods set apart by you for parents to visit their children.\n\nThe question of visiting hours is generally left in the hands of the principal, and he should see, while giving the parents reasonable opportunity to see their children, that the school and staff are not unduly imposed upon by Indian visitors.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.J. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nBirtle, Manitoba,\nMarch 29th, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of No. 106-1-1 dated March 14th regarding accommodation at the Birtle school when I made enquiries from the Principal he asked to make a report. Today I received from him a copy of it and he advised me he had forwarded it.\n\nI believe his report covers the information asked for; trusting it is satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. C. Benson\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6251, File 575-1, part 3)\nSir:\n\nI wish to draw the Department's attention to the last paragraph of Mr. A. C. Benson's report for the month of April, 1935, in which he mentions that trouble is developing between the Indians and the Birtle Residential School with regard to limiting the visiting hours and days.\n\nIt is my impression that the Indians on all the reserves in the Birtle Agency have been badly spoiled during past years by the Principals in charge of the Birtle School. They have been allowed to visit the school practically when they desired and were given the privilege of camping close to the school without any supervision, and with no limitation on the time. The children of the school were allowed to go with their parents and often remained with them over night in the camp, with the result that it was impossible for the school staff to keep the children clean and free of lice.\n\nI am quite sure that the Rev. Mr. Lockhart is not placing any hardship on the parents and I am also convinced that the discipline of the school cannot be considered too rigid. This matter may be brought to the Department's attention at a later date, but I think the Department are aware that the Indians are far better in their homes on the various reserves than hanging around the school spending a large portion of their time begging for a living. I hope the Department will give Mr. Lockhart the necessary support in connection with this matter in order that he may better carry on the operation of his school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, May 15th, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your 201-11B of the 11th instant, with reference to the trouble between the Indians and the Principal of the Birtle Residential School with regard to limiting visiting hours and days.\n\nThis matter had already been brought to the Department's attention by the Principal and by Mr. W. G. Richardson, Barrister, Elphinstone, Man. For your information, I enclose copy of our reply to him and also a copy of official letter of April 1st addressed to the Principal of the Birtle School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n336-6th St., Brandon, Man.,\nAug. 14/36\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFor the past year I have been employed as a classroom teacher in the Birtle Indian Residential School. By arrangement of the principal the term ended June 24th and we were instructed that the school would open Aug. 6th.\n\nOn July 7th I received from Mrs. H. Kendall notice of my dismissal stating also that my work did not satisfy the standard required for our Indian Schools as per the inspector's report which she said I already knew. I have never been advised what any reports concerning my work were. I believe I have a right to know these so I can check up on all my work. Will you\nkindly send me a copy of reports.\n\nAccording to the Manitoba School Act all resignations and dismissals should be in the hands of the school boards and teachers by June 1st and contracts signed as soon as possible.\n\nMy discharge from duties at the school came so late that it prejudiced my chances of securing work as teacher which is decidedly unfair. I am anxious to secure the position as teacher somewhere, if not in Manitoba elsewhere. I am taking this opportunity to ask you if you have any vacancies in day or residential schools and if so to place me in one if possible.\n\nThanking you, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\nAlison Blackwell.\nOttawa, August 19, 1936.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, regarding your dismissal from the position as junior teacher at the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I would say that the engagement of teachers and staff at this school is in the hands of the church authorities under whose auspices the school is conducted, subject to the approval of the Department.\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in his annual report of inspection of this school in January, last, reported regarding your services as follows:\u2014\n\n\"Miss Blackwell is not definite or clear and does not stimulate much in her classroom teaching. I rate her as poor in methods. In the junior grades reading is poor. More attempt should be made to get better expression. Arithmetic is very poor in these grades - the lowest I have seen in this school. There is an absence of instructional seat work for the junior grades. Miss Blackwell has no excuse on this score as she is supplied with lots of suggestions and ideas in helps I recommended. The writing is much below standard. I was much disappointed in this teacher's management and organization.\"\n\nI would suggest, if you have any further correspondence in the matter, that you refer same to Mrs. D. T. L. McKerrell, Women's Missionary Society, Presbyterian Church, 19 Laws Street, Toronto, Ont., to whom the Department looks for the engagement and dismissal of members of staff at the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

The Manitoba Department of Education requires me to submit recent inspectors reports, and therefore I should consider it a favour if you were able to forward to me a copy of the report made concerning me in January 1936 by Inspector Clark of Shoal Lake, Manitoba.\n\nThanking you for what you may do in this matter, I am\n\nYours Truly,\n\nA.T. MacLeod\nTeacher - Birtle Residential School\nOttawa, October 14, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from A. K. MacLeod, teacher at the Birtle Indian Residential School, in which he states that he wishes to change his Ontario teacher's certificate to a Manitoba certificate and, consequently, requests a copy of the last inspector's report.\n\nYou may inform Mr. MacLeod that Inspector J. W. Clarke visited the Birtle Residential School on January 13th and 14th, 1936, and reported as follows regarding his work:\n\n\"Mr. MacLeod is definite, confident, effective and dynamic. Mr. MacLeod's work is rather well advanced, except in History and Geography. I gave him suggestions regarding drill in Arithmetic. I was pleased with the written work in this room and also with the results of tests in Arithmetic.

Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man., December 30, 1936.\n\nAttention of Mr. Phelan.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter No. 106-1-10 dated December 16th and at the outset would state that it is rather difficult to say just where the blame lies in connection with the truancy at the Hirtle School. I have discussed this matter with the Agent, Mr. Smith, and he agrees with me that in general terms the trouble lies in the spirit which pervades the school. I do not think the Principal has the co-operation of the staff and I have no doubt there are faults on both sides.\n\nI have always felt that it is a mistake to have the wife of the Principal act as matron of a school and I have no doubt some of the trouble may come from that source.\n\nThere is undoubtedly something in the spirit of the school that should not exist there and I am convinced that neither the staff nor the children are as happy as they should be, but I cannot definitely say what the trouble is.\n\nMr. Smith states he is greatly pleased that the Department have forwarded equipment for sports and he will make it his business to see that this equipment is used to the best advantage.\n\nIf, at a later date, I receive any definite information concerning conditions at this school, I will advise the Department. Mr. Smith reports that there has been no truancy during the present month.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) A. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nManitoba.\nBirtle, Manitoba\n8th March 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of Dec. 21st last, (No. 291-11B) regarding conditions in the Birtle School,\n\nThe girls in the school have had no sport and hardly any outdoor exercise all winter. Last month I was up there, and quite a percentage of the girls had old leather boots on which were quite unfit to go outdoors in during the winter months. During the play hours they just hang around in the basement playrooms. I pointed out to Mr. Lockhart the condition of their footwear and he agreed that many of them were unfit for wear, and stated that he did not know that they were in that condition. A few days ago I was up there and am glad to say that quite a number of new boots were in evidence. Mr. Lockhart has promised to have a toboggan slide and some skates for the girls next winter. I am of the opinion that these children should be outdoors for a certain time daily, when the weather is fit, especially as they are subject to T.B., and it is surprising to me that such a condition should exist in an Indian School. Many of the Indian mothers know how beneficial fresh air and exercise are to their children, and see that they get it when possible.\n\nDespite this the children have enjoyed excellent health all winter. The boys have had very good sport on their rink. The boys have also had good footwear all winter, though when I was up there last month about 70% had no laces in their rubber boots, which made them look anything but tidy. That is remedied now however.\n\nMy opinion is that the Church have lost the services of a very efficient Pastor, in appointing Mr. Lockhart Principal of the School, and have not obtained a good Principal. Mr. Lockhart is a very fine man, and does his best, but I do not think that he understands children, and he does not seem able to enlist the co-operation of his staff.\n\nMrs. Hilliard\nMrs. Hilliard is still there, and I am sure that Mr. Lockhart does not desire to have her on the staff, as there is continual friction between them.\n\nI am told that Inspector Clarke has recommended that Mr. McLeod the teacher, be replaced in the summer, and I am sure that that is a move in the right direction, though I am not in a position to judge his work in the class room.\n\nI do not like to criticize the work of the School, and really do not feel qualified to do so, but I am sure that the girl pupils have not had a chance all winter, to be reasonably happy and contented. Five of them ran away last month. Fortunately they were caught only five miles from the school. They tied sheets together and slid out of a dormitory window. To be candid I cannot blame the girls, as the life they have been leading is enough to breed discontent.\n\nWhen the weather improves, I am sure that Mr. Lockhart will try to get these girls interested in some form of sport.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) A. G. Smith\nIndian Agent.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nDominion Public Building\nWinnipeg.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\n\nWINNIPEG, MAN., March 15th, 1937.\n\nDept. File 106-1-10.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to my letter dated December 30th, 1936, and to enclose copy of one which I have now received from Mr. A. G. Smith, Indian Agent, Birtle, Manitoba.\n\nI realize Mr. Smith hesitates to criticize the work of the school because it is very difficult to find out just where the trouble lies. It will be noted that when certain conditions have been brought to the attention of the Principal, an improvement has immediately been made. I believe Mr. Lockhart has the work all right, but I think Mr. Smith has struck the right note in the last paragraph on the first page when he states that in his opinion the Church have lost the services of a very efficient pastor in appointing Mr. Lockhart Principal of the school and have not obtained a good Principal.\n\nIt appears to me that, not only Mr. Lockhart, but several on the staff do not understand children, or else they have no interest in the school, other than the fact that it provides a job.\n\nIt is a serious matter when children run away from school in the winter months, and in February Mr. Smith states five ran away. I am more and more convinced that members comprising the staff of an Indian Residential School should be young people, thoroughly trained in the work they are to do, and interested in young people. If the various churches obtained people of this class, I do not think there would be any trouble in making school life very attractive for the children and, if this is accomplished, naturally we will have no truancy.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

I have been much concerned over the content of the enclosed letter from Mr. Hamilton. Would it be possible to find out who else upon the staff besides Mr. Lockhart have come under the criticism of Mr. Hamilton? There are one or two whom I myself have felt should be considered before the summer, but I would like to have some further details.\n\nI had heard a rumour, (one cannot act upon rumours) that Mr. Lockhart had been crossing swords with the Inspector over some matter. As this is only a rumour, possibly I should not even refer to it in this official letter, but to get at the root of any trouble I feel there must be full confidence between the Department and the Church.\n\nI shall be obliged to you for any further details.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Mrs. W.T.

McKerroll,\nWomen's Missionary Society,\nPresbyterian Church,\n19 Lansdowne Street,\nToronto, Ont.\nBirtle Manitoba\n\n3rd May 1937\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo No. 201-11, requesting a detailed report on the Staff of the Birtle Residential School. I really do not feel qualified to report on the Staff, and feel that the Principal is in a much better position to do so than I am.\n\nThere is not sufficient co-operation between the Principal and some of the members of the Staff, and I am sure that this lack of co-operation creates an atmosphere that is detrimental to the work of the School. I do not know who is to blame for this. Mr. Lockhart, the Principal does not seem to have the confidence of some members of the Staff. The ladies are over-worked and have not sufficient time for recreation and relaxation. When they are not on duty, they are too tired to take any interest in affairs outside the School, which is a pity, as such a condition tends to make them lose interest in their work.\n\nI feel that Mr. Lockhart spends too much of his time and energy on the School Farm, which work could be done very well by the Farming Instructor. I doubt whether Mrs. Lockhart is able to take her full share of the duties on account of ill health.\n\nThe other members of the Staff are as follows:\n\nMiss Bright; Boys Matron. Miss Bright has given very faithful service for some years in Indian work. She is well liked and respected by the children, and in fact by everyone with whom she comes in contact. On account of her age she is finding the work hard now, and will soon retire I think.\n\nMrs. Hilliard; Girls Matron. I do not think that Mrs. Hilliard has a suitable disposition for the work, and think that any Principal would find her hard to manage.\n\nMiss Bray; Teacher. A splendid teacher who was giving excellent service until her health broke down. Unfortunately I do not think that she will ever be physically fit for this work.\n\nMr. McLeod; Teacher. According to School Inspector Clark, of the Provincial Dept. of Education, Mr. McLeod is a poor teacher. He is also very careless about his appearance. I am sure that he is not a suitable teacher.\n\nMiss Gubbed (?) Nurse. According to Dr. Edwards the Medical Officer of the School, Miss Gubbed is a very efficient nurse.\n\nMr. Stone\nMr. Stone, Farming Instructor. Very capable and seems to get on very well with the boys, who seem to respect him. In my opinion Mr. Stone is an ideal Farming Instructor.\n\nMr. Dunn, Engineer. Seems to be quite capable.\n\nMrs. Dunn, Cook. So far as I know she is a good cook. I do not know anything about her qualifications regarding teaching the girls cooking.\n\nMiss Bruce, Laundry. Miss Bruce has had a good deal of experience in Indian work and is an exceptionally capable girl. She seems to be very fond of the Indian girls, and is very interested in their welfare.\n\nMr. Pittendry (?) Boys Supervisor. Seems to be very capable of managing the boys in an efficient manner. Last winter he trained the boys very well, and got up some very good hockey games for them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent\n\nA.G. Hamilton Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg.,\nSinnipeg\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to Department letter 106-1 dated April 17th, I now enclose copy of a report submitted by Mr. Smith, dealing with members of the staff at Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nThere is undoubtedly lack of cooperation between Principal and staff. On the occasion of my last visit, this was very noticeable and at that time some members complained that they were overworked. Perhaps more members are needed on the staff or, on the other hand, some may be too old to withstand the strain of work and discipline.\n\nI agree with Mr. Smith when he states Mr. Lockhart spends too much of his time and energy on the farm. He has a capable Farming Instructor and should leave the outside work for his supervision. I do not know what work Mrs. Lockhart does, but her health has indeed been poorly and no doubt some of her duties fall on others. As a general rule, I have never found the matronship satisfactorily filled by the wife of the Principal and would recommend, wherever possible, that the matron selected be someone other than the Principal's wife.\n\nThe remarks made by Mr. Smith on each member I consider fair and have nothing further to add.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G.

It is the duty and responsibility of the Department, however, to insist that the work in the classrooms is maintained at a high standard of efficiency at all times.\n\nIt would appear, from the reports here, that your work to begin with at the Birtle Residential School was eminently satisfactory. The last reports, however, are far from satisfactory.

He will not send him to school and I may have to have him taken to school by a truant officer.\n\nMecas is really a Roman Catholic I think, yet two of his children attended the Birtle Indian School. On one application form he gave his religion as Presbyterian and on another Protestant. Last week I saw him and asked him which church he belonged to, but he would not commit himself, and said he was between the two i.e., Presbyterian and Roman Catholic. In reality he is pagan I suppose. I think that he would rather his boy attended Birtle School.\n\nIf I have to force him to send the boy to school, and he still will not admit his religious faith, will you please advise me which denomination I should have educate this boy?\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa.\nEX'D.\n\nFebruary 4, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 31st ultimo I may say that if Alex Megass is recognized as a Roman Catholic his son should be placed in the school conducted under the auspices of that Church.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHirtle, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nWe are now operating our farm by means of six boys and two men. The work is quite different to what we have had to do in the past four years when we were converting the forest scrub land into a farm, and erecting so many buildings\u2014almost all except the main house & cow sheds. We have also doubled our machinery with which to do field work, and have bought threshing machine, tractor and truck. We are now hoping for a good crop. They have been very poor in the Birtle district every year since my coming here especially in 1937.\n\nYours truly,\nE H Lockhart\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nThank you for your letter in which you stated that you would make some effort to have the floors at the Birtle school attended to. We hope that this will be completed during the summer.\n\nI have had two letters from Mr. Byers regarding the matter which was spoken of at the meeting here in Toronto when you were here. He is still having trouble with the agent over the matter of locking the dormitory doors, and I am sending you a copy of his letter to me. Would it be possible for you to intimate to the agent that there has been a mistaken interpretation of the Department's instructions?\n\nIn a second letter he refers to Frank Churchill who was on the staff at Kenora. I am also sending you a copy of this letter, which will explain fully conditions there. Do you think you could do something to have this man put into a Sanitarium where he will have proper attention? It seems to be a case for the Department's attention and owing to the fact of their being 4 small children it seems a pity that something should not be done immediately.\n\nHoping that you will be able to do something to help us in these two matters,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndians Secretary.\nAugust 9th, 1938.\n\nDear Miss Lang:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo.\n\nAt our request, Inspector Hamilton recently visited Birtle School and advises us that he considers it necessary to have an engineer inspect the floors to decide what is best to be done. Arrangements will be made to have an engineer visit this school in the near future.\n\nOfficial letter is being directed to Indian Agent Edwards, which it is hoped will prevent further discussion between himself and Mr. Byers regarding the locking of dormitory doors.\n\nThis morning I discussed with the Medical Superintendent the case of Frank Churchill. He will give the matter immediate attention. We find it rather difficult to find places for some of these Indians, in view of the fact that accommodation at most of the T.B. hospitals is at a premium. However, I feel certain our Medical Superintendent will do everything possible to handle this case.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss J. Florence Lang,\nIndian Secretary,\nWomen's Missionary Society,\n279 Lytton Blvd.,\nToronto, Ontario.\nOttawa, November 17, 1938.\n\nDear Miss Laing:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Mr. C. L. St. John, K.C., Barrister, Minnedosa, Manitoba, which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"I have been consulted by George Shinnicapa, Councillor of Rolling River Indian Reserve, and David Burns, Councillor of Elphinstone Indian Reserve, in connection with the existing school arrangements for the Indian children on the above three Reserves.\n\n\"They stated that within the last few months there have been meetings of the Indians held on each of the three Reserves mentioned at which great dissatisfaction was expressed with the results obtained from the present Indian School at Birtle. They state that when their children come back from the Birtle school they usually know nothing practical about farm work or other lines of work and are usually quite unfit to do anything useful. They complain that at the Indian School there is very little taught to the children as to ordinary farming operations or other useful kinds of work, and they think that instruction should be given along these lines in addition to the ordinary school subjects such as reading, writing, etc.\n\n\"The Indians apparently feel that the education their children are at present obtaining is of little -\n\nMiss J. Florence Lang,\nWomen's Missionary Society,\nPresbyterian Church,\n279 Lytton Boulevard,\nToronto, Ont.\"\nof little practical use to them. One of the Councillors remarked that when the children come home after going through school \"they don't know how to work and don't know nothing\". This is, no doubt, exaggerated but it seems to me that these people have real grounds for complaint as to the results of their school education.\n\nYou are probably aware that the cost of maintenance at the Birtle Residential School is the highest in the Dominion, but the Inspectors' reports on the institution have never been wholly satisfactory since I entered the Department two years ago. I find it difficult to convince myself that Mr. Lockhart has the training and qualifications necessary to undertake successfully the principalship of a residential school. Our Inspector of Indian Agencies in the province of Manitoba assures me that Mr. Lockhart is very sincere and is doing his best for the pupils. I should state, however, that unless there is an immediate change in the course of study provided and in the prevailing atmosphere at the institution, it is going to be exceedingly difficult for the Government to resist the demands reaching us for the establishment of Indian day schools on the reserves from which Mr. Lockhart is at the present time securing his pupils.\n\nI shall be glad to have any comments you may care to offer on the situation at Birtle, any time at your convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, November 17, 1938.\n\nRe: Educational facilities on Indian Reserves, Birtle Agency, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. St. John:\n\nYour letter of November 10, addressed to the Minister of this Department, has been passed on to me for consideration and reply.\n\nI may state the records indicate that the desirability of establishing Indian day schools on the reserves to which you refer in your communication has been carefully reviewed and considered by the Department on a number of occasions. This matter was given very careful thought prior to the rebuilding of the Birtle Residential School, in the fiscal year 1920-31. At this date there is a very persistent demand for the establishment of a Roman Catholic day school on the Waywayseecappo reserve. I may state, however, that the difficulties in the way of establishing Indian day schools on these reserves are almost insurmountable.\n\nSubsection 2 of Section 10 of the Indian Act reads: \"No Protestant child shall be assigned to a Roman Catholic school or a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices, and no Roman Catholic child shall be assigned to a Protestant school or a school conducted under Protestant auspices\".\n\nIf a Roman Catholic school were established on the Waywayseecappo reserve, the demand would immediately arise for the establishment of a Protestant school, and the existence of these schools would seriously jeopardize,\n\nC. L. St. John, Esq., K.C.,\nBarrister,\nMinnedosa, Manitoba.\nas you state, the heavy investment at the Birtle Residential School.\n\nIt is my personal opinion that the policy of the Government with respect to the education of the Indian population will move gradually toward the multiplication of Indian day schools on reserves, and it is just possible that in the future a number of residential schools may be organized to provide vocational instruction for senior pupils. The present policy, however, cannot be changed overnight.\n\nPrincipals of Indian residential schools were instructed in departmental circular dated January 15, 1937, that at least one third of the school period should be devoted to manual or vocational instruction\u2014Elementary agriculture, gardening, care of live stock, blacksmithing, carpentry and auto mechanics for boys and hand loom weaving, dressmaking, fruit preserving, crochet work, etc., for girls.\n\nInspector Sigvaldason, in his last report on the Birtle Residential School, dated January 12, 1937, states in part as follows:\n\n\"Mr. Carmichael is doing good work with classes in woodworking. All pupils get practical work. The girls do sewing, laundry work, kitchen duties and other household services, while the boys are engaged in work outside. I was particularly pleased to see the interest taken in the outdoor rink. The boys have a couple of excellent hockey teams. This year they played with teams from neighboring towns. A music teacher is on full time duty at the school. The pupils who are musical are given every opportunity to develop their talent\".\n\nIt is my intention to ask the public school inspector to make a special inspection of the Birtle School and report to the Department. Just as soon as this report reaches me, I shall be glad to communicate with you again. In addition to this, I am today communicating with Home Mission -\nMission Board of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, intimating that a certain amount of dissatisfaction exists with respect to the studies provided at the Birtle institution. The costs at the Birtle School are the highest in the Dominion, and there is no reason whatever why a worthwhile course should not be provided for the pupils in attendance.\n\nI have noted with interest the Indians' reference to the Treaties and certain provisions contained therein for the education of their children. I know of no provisions in these Treaties other than the provision that adequate educational facilities shall be provided for the Indian population.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDirector.\nNovember 25th, 1938.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI was very much surprised and disturbed at the contents of the letter which I found on my return.\n\nIt is certainly strange that these Councillors should approach a lawyer on this matter. Why does the complaint not come through the Inspector or the Indian Agent? I feel that there is someone at work making trouble.\n\nAs I took over this Indian work just a year ago, I know there was a change in the male teacher. Mr. Carmichael, who came on a year ago last September, was considered very fine. He left in June to take a position as Vice-Principal, I think, in a Public School.\n\nMiss Hill, the other teacher, was recommended very highly. The Boys' matron, Miss Robertson, has been in several of our institutions and has done very efficient work. Miss Stewart, the nurse, is a real pioneer and has carried through a first-aid course, 28 certificates being presented by Col. GilEspie of Winnipeg, who went to Birtle for the occasion.\n\nI think this will give you some idea of the efficiency of our staff and I am writing to Mr. Lockhart for the report of the School Inspector. I shall certainly inform him of the criticism, and ask him for an explanation, and a full description of the course of study provided.\n\nI am sending you a copy of our Annual Report in which there is marked the report of the Indian Schools, which I hope will be of some use.\n\nAs soon as I have a reply from Mr. Lockhart, I shall write you again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nJ. Florence Lang\nIndians Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

May I suggest that during your visit to Winnipeg you discuss with Inspector Hamilton the existing conditions at both of your residential schools. If you can see your way clear to do this I feel confident that Inspector Hamilton will be in a position to supply you with very helpful information in respect to both institutions.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss J. Florence Lang,\nWomen's Missionary Society,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n279 Lytton Blvd.,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa,\nDecember 6, 1940.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Miss Lang:\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies for the Province of Manitoba, inspected the Birtle Residential School on October 21 and at that time he expressed doubt regarding the ability of Mr. Beaton to properly care for the machinery at the school.\n\nMr. Hamilton was instructed to again visit the school but he has just replied stating that he has been informed that Mr. Beaton, the present engineer, is leaving in a month and that a new man is to be appointed.\n\nIt is very important that there should be a fully qualified man appointed engineer at the Birtle School. He should be thoroughly familiar with the operation not only of the boilers but also the chlorinator filter, softener and kelvinator. It would be preferable if he could do minor electrical repair work. This school is well equipped with machinery and unless the engineer is fully qualified to discharge his duties properly there will be not only great inconvenience to the school authorities but also extra expense which will be rendered unnecessary if the engineer is competent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMiss J.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI am sorry to have been so long in replying to your letter of December 6th, but I was waiting for definite information from Birtle.\n\nI have today received the following information from Mr. Lockhart regarding the engineer: \"Mr. Swinson, who is to arrive today (Dec. 30th) has Second Class Engineer certificate. The Department asks for this standing. I suggested to him about two weeks ago that in the meantime he get all information he could re chlorinator, kelvinator and water softener. I also arranged with Mr. Smith to see him personally, which he did, and Mr. Smith, Mr. Hamilton and I were all of one mind that he spend a while in Winnipeg to get whatever useful information he could.\"\n\nI hope this will be satisfactory to the Department as Mr. Swinson's qualifications seem to be of the necessary standards.\n\nWith best wishes for the new year,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nIndians Secretary.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 3, 1941.\n\nDear Miss Lang:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant with reference to the appointment of Mr. Swinson as engineer at the Birtle Indian Residential School.

April 2nd, 1941.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI am sorry to have to report that Miss Helen Patterson of Aurora, who went to Birtle last September as Boys' Matron, has had to return home and is now in the Brantford Sanitarium with very little chance for recovery. The doctor at Brantford thinks that the history of the case shows that the infection was contracted about Christmas time and I have been wondering if it could possibly have come in through the Indian visiting the School at Christmas. There is a good deal of objection to these Indians sleeping in the basement of the School, but of course we have not taken any stand on this matter. Mr. Pitts of Cecilia Jeffrey thinks it is a good idea to have a building for the Indians to sleep in and I do not know whether this would be possible at Birtle or not.\n\nJ. Florence Lang,\nIndians Secretary.\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nSome time ago I reported to the Department that Miss Helen Paterson, of the Birtle School, had returned home in a very serious condition. She is now in the Brant Sanitarium in Brantford with very little hope for recovery.\n\nIt is a great shock to us all to learn that Miss Kathleen Stewart, a nurse at Birtle, has been suddenly stricken with what is apparently the same trouble and is now in the Ninette Sanitarium, Ninette, Manitoba.\n\nWe are very much concerned as this will certainly affect other members of our staff very seriously and we feel it will be difficult to get replacements under these circumstances. We feel that a very thorough investigation is needed into conditions in the Birtle School.\n\nHoping that this will have your immediate attention,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndians Secretary.\nDear Miss Lang:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant and was extremely sorry to learn of the condition of Miss Stewart.\n\nThe Assistant Superintendent of Medical Services, Dr. Moore, is in Manitoba at the present time and is expected back in the office next week. At that time I will take up with him the contents of your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss J. Florence Lang,\nIndians Secretary,\nWomen's Missionary Society,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n279 Lytton Blvd.,\nToronto, Ont.\nJuly 7th, 1941.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nThis morning I had a letter from Miss Stewart, the nurse at Birtle who was sent to the Ninette Sanitarium, stating that her case is not T.B. She had developed pneumonia following an attack of German measles. She expects to be out of the Sanitarium in about a week but will need some time to recover her strength. We are very much relieved.\n\nThere is no doubt that those in charge of the case were very much alarmed following Miss Paterson's case and I suppose that is why they wrote as they did. I am sure you will be relieved, as we are, to know that there is good hope for her early recovery.\n\nThe treasurer has asked me to say that if the Department would like an accounting of the Grant given us, we shall be glad to forward it.\n\nMr. Lockhart, of Birtle, thought he should have an account of the amount sent for the Birtle School but the Treasurer feels that it is sufficient to make an accounting to the Department.\n\nThanking you for your early attention to our former letter,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndians Secretary.\nJuly 15, 1941\n\nDear Miss Lang:\n\nMr. Phelan of the Schools Branch has drawn to my attention recent correspondence you have had with him regarding health conditions in the Birtle Indian School. For your information I wish to advise you that all the pupils and staff of this school were examined by the Provincial clinic of the Manitoba Sanatorium Board on May 13, 1941, and steps have been taken to remove any contagious cases of tuberculosis that there were in the school.\n\nWe were sorry to hear of Miss Paterson's serious illness but, like yourself, were much relieved to know that Miss Stewart's illness was not tuberculosis.\n\nWe will endeavour to have the pupils in this school followed closely by the travelling clinic and to promptly remove any of the children who are found to be suffering from tuberculosis.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP.

I, too, was greatly pleased to learn that Miss Stewart's illness was not as serious as was first anticipated.\n\nI do not see any necessity at the present time for your Treasurer to forward an accounting of the grant. If we ever require this information, we will make special application to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss J.

Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nMr. Lockhart, of Birtle, who has been under a rather severe strain during the past year, has been given two months' leave of absence beginning November 15th. We have asked Mr. Candy, the teacher, to carry on as acting Principal and will engage someone to help him for the two months if he finds he needs extra help. I hope this arrangement will meet with your approval.\n\nWe have not yet received the grant for Birtle and I have asked Mr. Lockhart to send in his report before he leaves, if he has not already done so.\n\nOur Board has on hand a fund for use on the Shoal Lake Reserve (old Cecilia Jeffrey School) and we would be glad to have your approval of opening up some work on that reserve. We feel that something should be done to help our ex-pupils who go back to the Reserve. We would consider sending in a nurse evangelist and would like to make some arrangement next Spring for a little building to accommodate her.\n\nI understand that, when the old School was moved to Kenora, the Indians were promised that at some time a junior school would be opened on the Reserve. It would be a great help if the young children could be taught some English before they come into Kenora. We would be glad to have the attitude of the Department toward such an undertaking. Would they be willing to make any grant toward a junior school on the Reserve? If we could have the consent of the Department to such an undertaking, we would like to make some arrangement so that the work could be begun in September, 1942.\n\nThanking you for your consideration in this matter,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndians Secretary.\nOttawa, November 15, 1941.\n\nDear Miss Lang:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 12th instant in which you intimate that Mr. Lockhart, Principal of the Birtle Indian Residential School, has been given 2 months' leave of absence beginning November 15. The arrangement you have made, to have Mr. Candy, one of the teachers, assume responsibility in the absence of Mr. Lockhart, is satisfactory to the Department.\n\nI find it somewhat difficult to express an opinion in respect to the proposal you make for the establishment of an elementary training centre on the Shoal Lake Reserve, in the Kenora Agency. If such a centre were established by the Church the Department could not, under existing regulations, make a grant for its maintenance. Our support would be confined to the establishment and operation of an Indian day school, and I frankly doubt the wisdom of establishing an Indian day school on this reserve. If such a school were established, I am afraid it would be difficult to secure recruits for the Kenora Residential School, where we have, as you know, a large investment. In addition to this, the Government's building program has been suspended and is likely to remain suspended for the duration of the war. Then again, we have not yet succeeded in securing a sufficient number of Indian day school teachers to fill the vacancies that have occurred this year.\n\nIn view of all the circumstances, I am disposed to think that your Society might seriously consider -\n\nMiss J. Florence Lang,\nWomen's Missionary Society,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n279 Lytton Boulevard,\nToronto, Ont.\nconsider providing one or two scholarships for the Shoal Lake pupils who have completed their courses at Kenora, or, if they feel so disposed, helping certain graduates of the school who return to the reserve. Such help could be extended on the recommendation of the Principal. I have in mind the purchase of sewing machines, household utensils, etc. In view of the comparatively small population on the reserve, it would seem to me difficult to justify the employment of a nurse or missionary at a time when capable help in the Dominion is exceedingly scarce and becoming more so from day to day.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

E.H. Lockhart, Principal of the Birtle School, has resigned and left the school on the 5th instant. I am communicating with the Women's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church in Canada regarding his successor and on receipt of any information in this regard I will advise you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nLast November the Rev. E. H. Lockhart, of Birtle, wrote saying that he would not be responsible for the management of the School after the 15th of November. We offered him two months' leave of absence hoping that at the end of that time he would feel that he was able to continue. After his return to the School on the 15th of January, he wrote me saying that he wished to leave the School on the 31st of January.\n\nThe Board of the Women's Missionary Society decided that it was wisest to accept Mr. Lockhart's resignation, and have asked Mrs. Lockhart to continue as matron until June. The Board had also asked Mr. A. E. Candy, who was Acting Principal during Mr. Lockhart's absence, to remain as Acting Principal and he has agreed to do so. We are hoping that this arrangement will be satisfactory to the Department. Mr. Candy seems to be very much interested in the work among the Indians and came to us highly recommended by some of our own people.\n\nI have just this morning received word from Mr. Candy saying that he would be willing to continue but there are some changes he would like to make if he is to have the appointment permanently. It will be necessary for us to appoint a teacher, a man, if we can get one. There is a young woman who lives in Birtle, who is at present acting as a supply teacher and, while her school work is satisfactory, she is of no use after school hours as she is living in the Town.\nIf Mr. Candy's appointment is satisfactory, I think our Board would be willing to appoint him permanently, and it is just possible that we shall have to appoint another matron later on.\n\nI am sorry that this information has been so late in reaching you but the letter from Birtle just came this morning.\n\nI wrote to Dr. Johnston some time ago telling him of Mr. Lockhart's resignation and stated in my letter that I would let the Department know as soon as I had definite information.\n\nThe Board would be very glad to know that you approve Mr. Candy's appointment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. Lawrence Lang\nIndians Secretary.\nOttawa, February 20, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter dated February 6, 1942, from Indian Agent Smith, in which Mr. Smith intimates that the Reverend E. H. Lockhart has resigned from the principalship of the Birtle Indian Residential School. We have now been informed by Miss J. Florence Lang, Secretary of the Women's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, that Mr. A. E. Candy has been appointed acting principal.\n\nThe Department is fully aware that you will be very busily engaged during the weeks immediately ahead of us in the organization of your farm program and with your general duties. Nevertheless, it would be appreciated if you could find the time necessary to make a couple of inspections of the Birtle Residential School between now and the end of the present school year. Miss Lang, in her letter, intimates that if Mr. Candy's work during this period is satisfactory, the Board would be willing to appoint him permanently. In view of this fact, it is of the utmost importance that we should have, from one of our own senior officials, an unbiased report on Mr. Candy's fitness for the position and an expression of opinion in respect to the success that he is likely to make of the administration of the Birtle School should be secure the appointment. I have intimated to Miss Lang that it is our intention to make the courses of study at Indian residential schools increasingly more vocational and practical in character and that the principal of the Birtle School, in our judgment -\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\njudgment, should be sympathetically disposed to such studies. I have also suggested to her that Mr. Candy, or the principal that may be appointed, should visit one or two schools in Canada and perhaps one or two schools in the United States where vocational studies have been organized on a satisfactory basis.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, February 20, 1942.\n\nDear Miss Lang:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 13th instant, in which you intimate that the Board of the Women's Missionary Society have decided to appoint Mr. A. E. Candy as acting principal of the Birtle Indian Residential School. It is noted also that you have asked Mrs. Lockhart to continue as matron until June.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nBirtle, Manitoba,\nMarch 16th, 1948.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following report for the month of February 1948.\n\nThe Rev. E.H. Lockhart, Principal of the Birtle Residential School, resigned on January 31st. Since that time Mr. A. Candy, the senior class room teacher, has been acting Principal, and has filled the position very well so far. There have been some truants, but they have run away for no apparent cause. Mr. Candy has already made some improvements in the building, having had a good deal of work done on the plumbing, where it was out of order. He has also had the boys do some painting in the interior of the building, which has brightened it up a lot. A new engineer has been appointed and I think he will take good care of the plant.\n\nA.G. Smith,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nI acknowledge your letter of February 20, 1942, File 106-1-1, and would report as follows in connection with the Birtle Indian Residential School and its Acting Principal, Mr. A. E. Candy.\n\nMr. Candy is a man about 32 years of age, but he appears much younger. Previous to taking over the duties of Acting Principal, he held the position of senior teacher. Mr. Candy has a pleasing personality and is a man of high ideals. He is interested in young people, and most considerate of the children. I think Mr. Candy would make an excellent principal, provided he can enforce discipline.\n\nSince taking over his duties he has had many minor repairs carried out, and also has had the boys do considerable interior painting. He has engaged the village blacksmith to teach blacksmithing in a class of boys one-half day a week. Already splendid results have been obtained, and I cannot speak too highly of this work.\n\nMeat for the school is purchased from the town butcher. Arrangements have been made for two boys at a time to learn from this butcher how to cut this meat, make sausage, and in fact do all kinds of work relating to butchering. This is a line of work which should prove useful.\n\nA music teacher from Birtle has also been engaged to teach piano lessons to a number of girls, and violin lessons to 5 or 6 boys. This is a change from the regular program of studies and is apparently enjoyed by the pupils.\n\nRecently a Mr. Dickenson has been engaged as farming instructor. I was greatly impressed with this man, and feel confident there will be a marked improvement in farming methods. Mr. Dickenson is also interested in gardening, and proposes planting a large vegetable garden. This school has no root cellar and one should be provided. Mr. Candy states he is prepared to arrange for all the labor if the Department will provide the material. It is estimated this material will cost about $150.00. I understand that in past years only a summer garden was grown, and winter vegetables were purchased as required due to the fact that no cellar was available. I urge that a cellar be authorized and the necessary funds provided.\n\nMr. Candy also wishes to improve the grounds, and grade and gravel the drive leading to the highway. This will entail considerable work and it will be necessary to purchase a quantity......\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\na quantity of gravel. I would recommend that $75.00 be allowed to help pay for some extra help and the gravel.\n\nMany Indian parents visit the school. There is no accommodation and they are obliged to sleep in the hall leading to the Chapel. On Saturday there were six visitors, one of whom was quite sick and later had to be removed to the hospital. This situation should not exist. It disrupts the school, makes it more difficult to keep the place clean, and is a means of bringing sickness into the school. It is also a financial burden involving added expense for food. Mr. Candy is prepared, with his farmer and the boys, to erect a small log house to accommodate the parents, if the Department will assist in providing the lumber and windows, at a total estimated cost of perhaps $150.00. The work will be good training for the boys. The parents will then be able to come only when room is available, and will be required to bring their own blankets and food.\n\nThere are still two percheron stallions cared for at the stables. Mr. Candy and the farming instructor both agree that these animals are not necessary and should be sold. I advised Mr. Candy to secure a buyer if possible, and sell the animals.\n\nThe boys' supervisor at this school is a man well past 60 years of age, and in my opinion is not suitable for the position. A young man familiar with sports, with the ability to enforce discipline and yet be a leader, should be appointed. I doubt if such a man can be found at the present salary, which I understand is $40.00 per month plus allowance. Ordinary farm labor receives this wage.\n\nThe senior room is now in the charge of a lady teacher, and again I think this is a mistake. A man teacher with experience is required. If suitable help were provided in this classroom, and an alert and active disciplinarian appointed as boys' supervisor, then Mr. Candy would have a fair opportunity to show whether he can handle the situation.\n\nThe following facts came to light during my discussion with Mr. Candy, which I think amply justify my claim that discipline is now the essential requirement at the school:\n\nA few of the older boys are very unruly. At times they are disrespectful to the staff and refuse to obey.\n\nSeveral children have run away, and Mr. Candy is afraid to punish these children when they are insolent or disobedient for fear they will leave again.\n\nSome boys complain openly about the food, and recently one boy said the sausage was unfit for food and threw his on the floor and stepped on it. The sausages were fresh and made from clean wholesome meat. Some of the children refuse to eat eggs and so Mr. Candy now serves them only about once a week. At present they gather about 150 eggs daily. I advised Mr. Candy to serve eggs at least 3 times a week, but suggested he might have them cooked differently for each serving. At present the boys apparently pick and choose their food, and in my opinion their likes and dislikes are given too much consideration.\n\nRecently the boys broke into the storeroom and stole considerable canned food and bread. They make skeleton keys and apparently do not hesitate to use them for any purpose.\n\nThey know......\nThey know they are stealing but seem to have little regard for honesty. I am convinced all this is due to lack of proper supervision by people who know how to discipline children; and further, that the pupils have too much idle time without supervision. The idle hours should be employed in supervised wholesome sport.\n\nFrankly, I was amazed and shocked at what I saw, and unless this tide of discontent and disregard for order and honesty is checked, the staff will have no control over the children; and the older pupils returning to the reserves will constitute a real problem.\n\nI again recommend the appointment of a boys' supervisor and also an experienced male teacher for the senior classroom. Both appointments require men who understand children and can enforce strict discipline. If these changes are made at once, perhaps by June 30th one could speak with more accuracy as to the wisdom of appointing Mr. Candy as principal. At present the outlook is not good but I feel Mr. Candy has been greatly handicapped by certain members of his staff and this throws altogether too heavy a burden on him. Again I point out that Mr. Candy has many excellent qualities and is a hard worker. He is anxious to make good and there is evidence of close cooperation between him and Mr. Smith, the Indian Agent. At present the strain is heavy, due to the lack of discipline and the long hours of work. The changes suggested should greatly relieve the situation.\n\nAs requested, I will visit the school again late in June, after which a further report will be submitted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa,\nMarch 30, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 27th instant with reference to your recent visit to the Birtle Residential School. The insubordination on the part of the pupils is very disturbing and I am communicating with the Secretary of the Women's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church and recommending that a new boys' supervisor be obtained immediately.\n\nWe are prepared to consider purchasing the material required for the root cellar and you should forward a requisition for what is required.\n\nWe are also prepared to favourably consider the expenditure of $75.00 for graveling the drive leading to the highway.\n\nFrom our experience at other schools, I do not think that it is advisable to proceed immediately with the erection of a building to provide accommodation for parents visiting their children at the school. Conditions existing at present in this particular regard should not be allowed to continue and everything humanly possible should be done to discourage parents from visiting their children except on one, or possibly two, special afternoons each week. Certainly the Acting Principal should immediately discontinue allowing parents to sleep at the school over night. If a building for their accommodation were erected it would only aggravate this condition. It is quite\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\npossible that this incessant visiting on the part of the parents is the cause of a good deal of the trouble with the children. Definite instructions should also be issued to the Indian Agent in connection with this matter, as the Department expects him to co-operate very fully with the Principal in arranging for certain definite days for visiting and also to point out to the Indians the impossibility of continuing the present practice of allowing parents to sleep at the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nMarch 31, 1942.\n\nDear Miss Lang:\n\nI attach, for your information, a copy of a report from Inspector Hamilton regarding a recent visit to the Birtle Indian Residential School. The information regarding insubordination on the part of the pupils is very disturbing and I think you will agree with me that immediate action must be taken to remedy this condition. I realize that it is extremely difficult to obtain suitable staff at the present time, but I feel that I must insist on a new boys' supervisor being appointed immediately. This man should be properly qualified to do the work that is required. A male teacher for the senior room should be secured for the academic year 1942-43.\n\nI should appreciate an early reply to this letter outlining the action that you are taking.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss J. Florence Lang,\nIndian Secretary,\nWomen's Missionary Society,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n279 Lytton Boulevard,\nToronto, Ont.\nApril 4th, 1942.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Birtle Indian School\n\nI am very glad that Inspector Hamilton has visited Birtle and made such a full report. Our Board thinks that Mr. Candy has done exceedingly well in very trying circumstances.\n\nWe advertised in a Winnipeg paper about two or three weeks ago for a male teacher but had no replies at all. We are again advertising in Winnipeg and one other Western paper. Possibly the salary offered - $650.00 was not attractive enough. We are prepared to offer more but will ask applicants to state salary as it is a matter of getting a good man.\n\nI knew that the boys' Supervisor, Mr. Herron, was rather old and I am writing to Mr. Candy asking him to look for a young man with the required qualifications at once, and to offer a larger salary, probably $60.00, as he does not need the teacher's standing.\n\nBirtle has been unfortunate in having so many changes. We expect to put Miss MacKay into deaconess work after the summer holidays, so we shall have to find another junior teacher. We are glad that Mr. Hamilton approved of the new farm instructor. We have had to increase his salary to $80.00 with house and meals for himself. Formerly the farmer was paid $40.00 with house and meals but we think the farm will show better results under this new man. We are glad to have the extra allowance as this will help with the increased salaries. Mrs. Lockhart asked for an increase in salary but the Board has decided that it would not be wise to continue her appointment if Mr. Candy is to get the appointment permanently and she will be needed in the manse if Mr. Lockhart accepts the Church.\n\nI hope these facts will relieve your anxiety about Birtle and I would like to assure you that we shall do everything we possibly can to help Mr. Candy. With a capable staff we are sure he will be able to enforce discipline.\n\nIndians Secretary.\n\nP.S. We shall be very glad to see you whenever you come to Toronto.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The older boys know that they get work outside at fair wages, and that also has something to do with it I think. Mr Candy, the Acting Principal, is doing his best, and I think that the Staff is improved considerably by some recent changes. At present there is no boys supervisor, and no male class room teacher, and that makes it very hard on the Principal.\n\nA.G.

I think it could easily be converted into a hospital or convalescent home. If it was required for any such purpose, I do not think that the Church would object to their buildings on the Reserves being used as schools for the duration of the war.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G.

G. Smith, Indian Agent, Birtle, Manitoba.\n\nThe Birtle school, to which the agent refers, is a government-owned institution. The records indicate that this school was built in 1930 and that the farm consists of 655 acres. The building is fireproof.\n\nThe officials of the Welfare and Training Service are of the opinion that it would not be difficult to provide day school accommodation for the 115 pupils enrolled at this date at Birtle. In view of these facts, the suggestion made by the members of the Waywayseecappo Band might be carefully considered in connection with accommodation for the group of Japanese now resident in British Columbia, who appear to be suffering from certain physical disabilities. There is an objection, however, to the use of this particular school for the care of Japanese, that should not be overlooked. The school buildings are quite close to the town of Birtle, I should think not more than a quarter of a mile from the town boundaries. This fact might not constitute an insurmountable obstacle if the building were used for the care of invalids.\n\nEncl.\n\nDirector.\nJune 27th, 1942.\n\nMr. R. A.

There are only three trains per week from Basswood to Birtle going west on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and returning on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays and travelling is rendered still more awkward by the fact that the buses are now being removed from the highways. They have already been removed from the Elphinstone to Russell highway and it seems a strong probability that these buses may be taken off the Minnedosa to Russell highway as well before very long.\n\nThese Indians are anxious to retain the right to visit their children during the winter time and state that\nthey would be satisfied to visit not more than twice during the said five winter months. These people are very fond of their children and a good many of them appear to be loath to send their children to the Indian School unless they can visit them during the winter months. They would like particularly to visit the children at Christmas time, and upon the occasions of their visits during the cold months they wish to have sleeping accommodation and meals while there. The visits would not, in most cases, last more than a day, and I believe that the accommodation and meals furnished are the simplest and most inexpensive in character. Evidently if the Saturday afternoon rule is insisted upon throughout the winter that would practically amount to forbidding the Indians to visit at all during the winter months. I asked these parties if they knew of any sickness which had been brought into the School upon the occasion of any such visits but they stated that they did not think that any diseases had ever been brought in in that manner so far as they knew.\n\nThey also think that the Chief and Councillor of each Reserve should not be limited in their visits like the parents and relatives, as they appear to feel a special responsibility for the well-being and education of the children and think that accordingly they should be allowed to visit whenever they want to check up conditions in the school so that they may be at any time in the position to report conditions back to the Reserve Indians.\n\nThese parties have also got the opinion from reading the Treaties with the Queen recorded in an old copy of the Treaty Book in their possession, that the Indian School should be built and operated upon the Indian Reserves. I explained to them that these Treaties had probably been altered by a Statute or by a Department regulation so as to provide for teaching the Indians in central schools like the Birtle School. I would appreciate your advising me as to the legal situation in this respect and, if possible, you might give me a reference to the relevant Statutory provisions and regulations in this connection.\n\nI hope that it will be possible to meet these Indians requests as to accommodation of visitors somewhat along the lines above proposed, and will be glad if you would write me advising as to what can be done to modify the existing situation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.

It is just possible that when conditions become normal again an attempt will be made by the Department to erect outside accommodation at a number of our schools for visiting Indians. I have in mind a number of small inexpensive cottages and a central kitchen in which they could do their own cooking. Buildings such as these have been established at the Lebret school in Saskatchewan and are, in my judgment, serving a very useful purpose. It would be impossible, of course, to consider the erection of such buildings until the end of the war.\n\nI note your reference to certain treaties. I regret to state that we have no copies of these treaties outside the larger bound volumes. It is just possible that Mr. Hamilton, to whom a set of these treaties was forwarded recently, might be able to let you have a typewritten copy of Treaty No. 2. It is true that in these treaties there are references to the liability of the Government to establish schools on Indian reserves, etc. In actual practice, however, we have discovered that the Indian day school, except in very rare cases such as the old Indian communities in the East, is not yet an efficient educational unit. This is largely due to the distances the pupils have to travel to the school and the irregularity of attendance. Prior to the outbreak of the war, however, we were building Indian day schools at the rate of about five per annum. It is just possible that this building program will be resumed again when conditions become normal. These are days, however, that call for the exercise of a great deal of patience and a measure of self-sacrifice on the part of all of us.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nI received your reply of July 29, concerning an account owing to me by Mr. J. Harris at present employed by you at Beausejour, Man.\n\nI am sorry to take up your time, but I feel it best to explain this account so as you can judge it yourself. I maybe should not have let this account run so high, but here are the facts: Mr. Harris, with a 4 year old daughter and his wife an expectant mother was not steadily employed when I first took over the milk route. He explained his position and asked me to run the bill for awhile and he would pay me a bit at a time and then would pay me $5 monthly on his account and his current bill. In about 6 months he got a job with the Defence Industries plant in Winnipeg, Man. The first month he...\ndid not give me the promised $5 payment and promised it for the next month. When the time was due for this payment, Mr. Harris had turned over his accounts to the County Court of H.P.Q. and included my account and listed it as owing to the Modern Dairy Co. Ltd. This happened in Nov. 1941, he then quit buying milk from me and switched over to the Crescent Creamery owing me a total of $33.75. I had to bring along our Sales Manager to explain to Mr. Harris that if he did not pay this account I would have to. Mr. Harris was in receipt of a salary of $117.50 per month and agreed to pay me one dollar per month on his account.\n\nMr. Harris filed with the County Court on H.P.Q. on Nov. 4, 1941 and I have received a total of $86 as my pro rata share, and $20 from Mr.\nHarris leaving a balance of $29.31. He was to make monthly payments into the County Court, which he has not done since employed by your department. He had promised to pay in July and has not done so; now promises it for October. If Mr. Harris was employed by private enterprise and failed to make his payment I could get a court order, but being employed by the government, I can't guarantee.\n\nNow, I am in the RCAF (R18664) posted on leave without pay. I myself have a wife and a 1\u00bd month old son, do you think it fair that I should pay for Mr. Harris' milk? There is no doubt that Mr. Harris can afford to pay this bill, if he so wishes. In fact he could have paid it by now.\nIs there no way that you can arrange to have Mr. Harris pay his bill in instalments? If you can do this and inform our manager of this arrangement, I know that they will give me back my $29.51 which I need for my family.\n\nI am sorry to trouble you, but I am sure you can understand how I feel.\n\nThanking you, I am\n\nYours truly,\n\nPeter Mikalchuk\n\n286 Dumoulin St.,\nSt. Boniface\nMan.\nOttawa, September 14, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 8th instant and have noted with interest the information supplied therein.\n\nI must point out that you are wholly in error when you state that Mr. J. Harris is an employee of this Department. Mr. Harris, I understand, is at present employed at the Birtle Residential School, which school is operated by the Presbyterian Church of Canada. There is nothing whatever, therefore, to prevent you from securing the regular court order for the amount owing you at this date by Mr. Harris.\n\nIt has occurred to me that you might be well advised to write to the Principal of the School, Mr. Roy Webb, in regard to this matter. My letter of July 29th to you was written as a matter of courtesy and in an attempt to help you collect the money.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Peter Mikalchuk,\n286 Dumoulin Street,\nSt. Boniface, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am troubled because some half breeds who live near this Reserve are continually coming on the Reserve and causing trouble. I wish that something could be done to stop these people from coming on the Reserve.\n\nThere is another thing I want to tell you. We have a number of cattle so that they will not wander all over the Reserve and spoil the crops of hay and grain, we keep them in a pasture, the Indians watch them as closely as they can, but for a number of years now there is some missing, and this year there are ten or maybe more missing and all these animals have the I.D. brand on them. This is a serious loss.\n\nDuring the winter months, the Indians that own cattle do not look after them, so some die. I would also like to know what the farm inspectors duties are.\n\nI want you to read this over very carefully and then I know you will do all you can to help us.\n\nYours Truly,\nPrince Albert Reserve Chief\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6251, File 575-1, part 3)\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nThere is also another thing I think a lot about, and that is the children of this Reserve, so many are growing up and cannot read and write, and so they have not the chance they ought to have. There are a number of boys and girls over 4 years who ought to be in school. I have always understood that the Indian Act says, \"a child should be in school when it is 4 years old.\" I wish that you would instruct the Indian Agent to see to it, that the children go to school. I hope that you do not think that I am making too many complaints.\n\nPov er Astakusie\nBirtle Manitoba\n19th September 1942\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn the 12th inst Mr Webb the Principal of the Birtle Residential School, was taking a load of pupils from the school out to the field to do a little stocking by truck. He met a car on the way, which apparently would not give him his share of the road, so he turned into the ditch to prevent a collision, and the truck upset. Fortunately only two children were injured, one has a slight fracture near the elbow, and the other girl had her knee injured slightly. The Doctor informs me that both are doing very well and should be all right in a few days. The arm fracture is not a complete break, but a chipped bone.\n\nMr Webb informed me of the accident on the 14th inst, as he could not get into touch with me when it occurred because I was out on the Reserves.\n\nWhen the accident took place there were about 70 children in the truck, which is far too many. However Mr Webb has assured me that he will not attempt to transport a big load of children again by truck, and I feel sure that he has learnt his lesson.\n\nHe is doing his best at the school, and he undoubtedly has ability. The Principalship is a hard position for an inexperienced man to fill, and both Mr Webb and his wife are possibly rather too young to shoulder the responsibility. However I think that he will make a good Principal when he gains some experience, if he stays there. Some of the Indians are rather upset about the accident, but I am giving Mr Webb all the support that I am able to.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines and Resources\nOttawa\nOttawa, September 24, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, in which you refer to two pupils of the Birtle Residential School who were injured in a motor accident on the 12th instant.\n\nThe officials here were greatly disturbed to learn of the practice of taking pupils of the school out to farm work by truck. It is my understanding that there is in the Manitoba Highway Act a clause prohibiting this practice and imposing a rather severe penalty for those who indulge in it. In any event, it is almost unbelievable that the principal should permit 70 pupils to be conveyed in a truck.\n\nThe action you have taken appears to be about all you can do at the present time. In your own interests, however, and in the interests of the Department, you should notify the Principal in writing that this practice must be discontinued immediately and that so long as he occupies his present position he will be held definitely responsible for the care and wellbeing of the pupils committed to his care. The Birtle school has been subjected to a great deal of criticism by Indians during the last 4 or 5 years, and I am inclined to think that this incident may make it exceedingly difficult for the principal to secure pupils in the future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

However, the new Principal seems to be taking hold of the work quite well, and also most of the staff.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nA.G. Smith,\nIndian Agent.\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa\n\nI beg to refer you to your letter No.106-1-1 dated March 30th 1942, addressed to Inspector Hamilton in Winnipeg. Since we have stopped allowing parents to sleep in the Birtle School when visiting their children, in accordance with instructions contained in the above letter, many of the parents are continually complaining about this ruling, and it has made recruiting pupils for the School difficult, even though we know that the rule is a wise one.\n\nLast week I was at a meeting of the Band on the Rolling River Reserve, and one Indian asked me if the same Government ran all the Indian Schools in Manitoba. I replied in the affirmative of course, and he then asked why the rules were different at different schools. I found that he was referring to the fact that parents are welcome at Sandy Bay School. I know that the parents are put up and fed there when visiting their children, and thought that this complaint was worth bringing to your attention.\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent\nBirtle Manitoba\n12th January 1943\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa\n\nI have to advise you that Mr Webb, the Principal of the Birtle Indian School, met with a serious accident on Sunday night, and is now in Winnipeg General Hospital in poor condition.\n\nHe was coming down the hill from the school to the town in a toboggan, hit a big stone, and splintered the front part of the toboggan. A splinter from the toboggan penetrated the thigh and went into the bladder.\n\nI have advised Miss Lang, the Indian Secretary of the W.M.S. of the Presbyterian Church in Toronto, of the accident, and have recommended that an Acting Principal from outside the staff be appointed to carry on in Mr Webb's absence, providing he is not able to resume his duties in a month or so.\n\nBoth Mr and Mrs Webb are capable and it has been a pleasure to co-operate with them in the work at the school. In Mr Webb's absence Mrs Webb could carry on the work inside the school, but the farm would suffer considerably without Mr Webb's supervision.\n\nA.G.

This particular theft was not so cut and dried as it appears, and the agent and I are still winding up the affair. I have been negligent in not reporting the affair as it progressed; but, I thought it would be better to report it in its entirety rather than piecemeal.\n\nMay 22nd was a Saturday. Mr. Drey had recommended that the parents be allowed their children one day a week to a day that would not interfere too greatly with the school's program. These first Saturdays have been parent days for at least a year and a half. May 24th always brings the parents in large numbers to the school. It has been one of the \"big\" days of the year for quite some time. The parents arrived on the twenty-first. They had their children all day Saturday and visited them all day Sunday at the school, and had them again all day Monday the twenty-fourth. Then parents had their families with them including boys over and under school age. These older boys had at least two bicycles. These boys have ridden to the school on them many times during the...\nyear. While here, they lend their bicycles to the school pupils. Therefore, it is a common sight to see the boys on a bicycle over the weekend, and the staff members thought nothing of it.\n\nThe senior boys have been allowed to go downtown on Saturday nights for some years. They usually attend a show which starts at half past seven and ends towards ten o'clock. They are usually home by ten. There is only one staff member detailed for duty on Saturday evenings; and, he remains at the school to supervise the junior boys and to put them to bed. On Sunday afternoons, the engineer, boys' supervisor, headman and the male teacher take turns supervising the boys just as they take turns every evening of the week; and, every Sunday morning and evening.\n\nOn Saturday, May 22nd, the bicycles were here. The owner of the bicycles (older Indian boys) rode some of our lads downtown (1 mile down hill) on them. Lloyd was one of them. He spoke with an Indian lad from Roseau whose name is Milton Lennard. After the show Milton and Lloyd started school. After the show Milton and Lloyd started home. They called in at a livery barn for a drink from the well. Leaning against the door was a bicycle which they thought was the one Lloyd had ridden downtown on. They decided...\nBIRTLE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n(PRESBYTERIAN)\nR. WEBB. PRINCIPAL\n\nBIRTLE, Man.\n\nTo go for a ride on it. This bicycle was the same color (red) as the one that the Indian had lost. Lloyd and Milton took the bicycle intending to just have a ride, and also thinking it was the bicycle they had been playing with all day. While riding it they saw the Indian lad who was supposedly the owner of it. He did not say anything to them and they concluded he didn't mind them riding it. They joined the whole group of school boys and visited and came up to the school with it. Just when they discovered they had someone else's bicycle I do not know for sure. Lloyd says it was not until Sunday because Milton Turner had it when he (Lloyd) came to bed Saturday night shortly after ten o'clock. However, when they did find out they were too frightened to say anything about it. Another older lad Peter Kewatinacapo took the bicycle and it was he that broke it.\n\nThe Mounted Police came and questioned Lloyd. The Agent knew all about it. Milton and Peter vanished from the tenting ground. The Agent thought it was a boyish prank and he still maintains so. However, many bicycles have been stolen in Manitoba recently and the Crown prosecutor decided that this case would serve as a warning. Lloyd was the only one of the three boys who could be easily reached. He admitted taking the bicycle (along with Milton); but, he still insists that he thought it was a bicycle belonging to an Indian lad. Milton\nBIRTLE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n(PRESBYTERIAN)\nR. WEBB, PRINCIPAL\n\nBIRTLE, Man.\n\nCannot be reached save by horse at this time of the year and so the agent and I have been waiting to get this story. Then I intended to write to you.\n\nI have seen the bicycles belonging to the Indian lads. The one bicycle does resemble very much the bicycle that was taken. The Indians are one of the best families that have been to this school. Lloyd told the Agent and the police and myself the same story (that he thought it was his friend's bicycle). He admits that it is wrong to take anything without permission. The damages which he claims were made by Peter Kowatapappo (as do the other school lads), Lloyd agreed to pay out of his own money because as he said \"I should not take things without permission.\"\n\nI must apologize for not writing to you first. It must have been a shock to you to receive the first intimation from Mr. Story.\n\nThe senior boys do go down to the show unsupervised but I, myself, often go down and start them on their homeward way immediately after the show. If I do not, some other staff member who is downtown does.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. Webb.\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nThe enclosed letter is in regard to the complaint by Mr. Webb regarding the trouble.

His answer came by return mail. I am sending it to you under separate cover. I think that his explanation is very satisfactory and I also think that the R.C.M.P. was a bit severe in his action.\n\nApparently the Indian Agent agrees with Mr. Webb that it was just a boyish prank and not so serious as we were led to believe. I hope that this explanation of the matter will be satisfactory.\n\nMr. Webb has received an Income Tax form for the farm. Will you please let me know if he should fill it out?\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndians Secretary.\nOttawa,\nJuly 2, 1943.\n\nDear Miss Lang:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, with reference to Mr. Webb's letter of June 18. The contents of this letter have been carefully noted.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter, I understand that income tax forms are being forwarded this year to all farmers. I do not think that this applies to the land owned by the Department and operated as a farm for the benefit of the Birtle Indian Residential School. I suggest that the Principal write to the Income Tax Collector outlining the fact that the produce raised on the farm is used solely for the pupils of the school. This will probably serve the purpose.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss J.

They appear to be making fair progress and all the work seen was well done. Both classrooms were well aired and tidy.\n\nThe dormitories were clean and the beds neatly made. The plumbing appeared in good condition.\n\nIn the sewing-room the girls are taught all kinds of sewing, mending and darning. At present they are making new dresses of uniform style and color. The pattern is smart and the material good.\n\nThe kitchen is nicely arranged and from what I could see I believe the girls receive a fair training in general cooking and in the making of bread. The dairy adjoins the kitchen and the girls also are taught buttermaking. The bread just baked was well done and of excellent quality.\n\nThe furnace room was tidy and all the equipment operating. The boy appears to understand his work and gets along quite well.\n\nI believe it is possible, in making the farm self-supporting, to raise cattle. The cattle provide the milk and the calves will provide meat. At present they are being kept to raise more calves. Later these will be killed.\n\nThe hens already are laying and several more will be added next year. Mr. Webb expects to have a good supply of eggs.\n\nIndian Affairs.

WEBB, PRINCIPAL\n\nBIRTLE, Manitoba, Oct. 7, 1944.\n\nMr. A. G. Smith,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nTwo years ago, this school changed from a policy of a half grade a year to a policy of a full grade a year. The reason for this change was that children were leaving this institution equipped with only a grade three standing, on the average, which is very inadequate. Now a child attending this school for eight years has the opportunity of leaving school with a grade eight standing, or, continuing to high school. There are two teachers here, one in charge of grades one and two, and the other in charge of grades three to eight. In order to make this change, all children in grades one and two went to school a full day; children in grades above two went to school half a day, and, the other half were engaged in farming, laundering, etc.\n\nAs a result of this change, there are approx. thirty-five children in grades three and four this year (50 in one and two, and the balance in five to eight). The children in grades three and four are ten and eleven years old. Next year, some will be nine. These children are too young to engage in farming, laundering etc. They should be in school all day, but, this is impossible without another teacher.\n\nWould it be possible for the dept. to furnish this school with another teacher?\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nMr. Webb, of the Birtle Indian School, has made\na suggestion, which the Women's Missionary Society is willing\nto try out for a period of two years if the Department of\nIndian Affairs will give its consent to the plan.\n\nOwing to the number of younger children from eight\nto twelve years, a problem has arisen. These children are too\nsmall to be of much use in household tasks and, as all the\nmembers of the staff are very fully occupied, the supervision\nof these children during the half day they are not in school\nreally requires another member of staff. Mr. Webb thinks that\nthese children might better be in school the full day. They\nwould advance much more quickly in their studies. We have had\nsuch good results from the farm that Mr. Webb is quite sure\nthat he can take care of the extra salary from the farm profits\nup to $75.00 per month for a teacher. If the Department approves\nwe would like to try this arrangement for two years. Our Board\nwill be responsible for the teacher's salary and any extra\nsupplies needed.\n\nThe Indians are beginning to see the need of better\neducational standing and they are most anxious to have the\nchildren in school all day. I hope the Department will agree\nto this plan, and I shall be glad to have your reply as early\nas possible.\n\nThanking you for your consideration,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndians Secretary.\nOttawa, November 9, 1944.\n\nDear Miss Lang:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of November 8 and have noted with the utmost interest the suggestion contained therein.\n\nIt has been my hope for a number of years that one or two of our residential schools would undertake the experiment of providing classroom instruction for the younger pupils during the regular period provided for instruction in public schools. I may state, therefore, that the suggestion you now make is very much in accord with my own views.\n\nIn addition to the reports received periodically from the public school inspector, it would be appreciated if we could have, from time to time, a report from you on the progress of these junior pupils.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

Albert Blackbird of Elphinstone has instructed me to write on behalf of the parents asking that the children be permitted to return home for the holiday between Christmas and New Year. Please give this request your attention and oblige.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW C Richardson\n\nElphinstone, Man. Dec 29th 1944\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nDEC 4 1944\n\nREGISTERED\nOttawa, December 5, 1944.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, requesting that the children attending the Birtle Residential School be allowed to go to their homes for the holiday period between Christmas and New Year's Day.\n\nThe Department has always taken the position that the allowing of holidays during the winter is neither in the best interests of the pupils themselves nor conducive to the progress of residential schools. Pupils residing close to the school might be allowed home for Christmas Day only, provided they will return to the school the same evening. As a matter of fact, we have always encouraged residential schools to arrange some special celebration, either on Christmas Day or one of the days in Christmas week, and have the parents come to the school and spend the day with their children.\n\nIn view of our policy, which has been in effect for several years, the Department cannot see its way clear to allow the pupils from the Birtle School the privilege that you request.\n\nYours truly,\n\nActing Director.\n\nW. C. Richardson, Esq., LL.B.,\nBarrister,\nElphinstone, Man.\nI inspected the Birtle Indian Residential School on December 6th, 1944.\n\nThere are 108 children enrolled and three classrooms are now in operation. The juniors or beginners are in charge of Miss Hamilton. She has thirteen beginners and fifteen in Grade 1. Mr. Frost has the intermediate grades listed as follows:\n\n| Grade | Pupils |\n|-------|--------|\n| 2     | 18     |\n| 3     | 16     |\n\nMiss Kenney has the senior room and the grades are as follows:\n\n| Grade | Pupils |\n|-------|--------|\n| 4     | 15     |\n| 5     | 16     |\n| 6     | 13     |\n| 7     | 1      |\n\nThere is one grade 9 pupil attending the Birtle Public School.\n\nThe classrooms are bright and airy. The children were clean, with the girls dressed in uniform. The work seen was well done and I am confident the children are making fair progress. Miss Kenney is greatly interested in her work. She has a bright, cheerful personality and is full of energy. Mr. Webb is fortunate in having her on his staff.\n\nThe kitchen is well equipped and the girls receive excellent training. The meals are well prepared and there is plenty for all. Mr. Webb, the Principal, believes the farm should produce most of the required food for the school and so nothing is sold. The milk is used for the children and for butter. Beef, pork and eggs are seen in abundance, and the vegetable crop was excellent. He also has turkeys and poultry sufficient for Christmas dinner for all.\n\nThe school garden was excellent. The potato crop yielded about 1400 bushels. In addition there was an excellent crop of onions, turnips, cabbage, parsnips and carrots. The root cellar is built in the side of the hill and due to the excessive soil rains is too damp. The result is the vegetables are not keeping well. Serious consideration should be given to building a suitable cellar with ample storage space. Abundance of vegetables is essential at all our schools and the need for a suitable root cellar should receive first consideration.\n\nThe laundry equipment appears in fair condition and the sample of work seen spoke well for the girls' training.\n\nThe dormitories were all tidy and well aired. The beds were neatly made and the bedding of good quality and clean. The fire escapes' exits are convenient and all extinguishers charged ready for use.\nIn the sewing-room the senior girls were busy making new uniforms. These uniforms are made in a nice style from a blue material trimmed with red. The work was neat and the sewing good.\n\nThe furnace room was tidy and the equipment all in working condition. The filter, cold water pressure tank and the underground outside tank have given good service; but at any time renewals may be required. These tanks are all badly pitted and just how much longer they will last is a question. The renewal of any one will cost in the neighborhood of five hundred dollars.\n\nThe boys half of the infirmary is dark, as there is only one window. This room could be improved if the walls and ceiling were painted a light shade. Mr. Webb planned a special scheme of color for both rooms in the infirmary and had purchased special wall stencils, hoping the Department would furnish the paint; but for some reason the paint specified for this work was omitted. I would recommend that it be supplied, as sick rooms, especially for children, should be bright and cheerful. The requirements are:\n\n- 6 gals. turquoise, flat wall $10 Silkstone\n- 1 \" shell pink, \" \" $11 \"\n\nThe Principal's residence should be re-papered downstairs. There is a large hall, a dining-room and a large living room. The paper and labor will cost approximately $75.00. I would recommend Mr. Smith, the Indian Agent at Birtle, be allowed authority to proceed with the work.\n\nThe two main barns have been painted and are in good repair. The hog barn, chicken house and machine shed remain to be painted and the paint required will cost about $75.00. This work should be done next year without fail.\n\nThe stock are all in good condition. Twelve cows are milking at present and others will freshen during the coming year. At present Mr. Webb has over 60 hogs and he informed me all would be used for the school.\n\nThe staff all are greatly interested in their work and a fine spirit of cooperation exists. Mr. Webb, with his wife as Matron, is doing a splendid work. I am confident the children are well fed, well clothed and happy.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa, December 26, 1944.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, reporting on your inspection of the Birtle Indian Residential School on the 6th instant. I am pleased to learn that you found everything satisfactory at this school.\n\nThe expenditures which you recommend will receive immediate consideration.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nWelfare and Training\n\nAt the Birtle Residential School a new class-room has been opened and another teacher employed, and now all the children are a full day at school. This is being financed from the profits made at the school farm at present, and means also that extra help has to be employed to assist in the laundry, kitchen etc., seeing the girls are in the class-room all day. It should be a great help to the children in a few years as they will graduate with a much higher standing, than they do at present. The girls still have classes in cooking and sewing, and also first aid, and they do cleaning and dish-washing etc., after class-room hours, and the boys do the farm chores.\n\nA.G. Smith,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI am sorry to have to inform you that Mr. Webb of the Birtle Indian School has asked to be released about the 15th of August for health reasons. Our Board has offered the position to L.A.C. Martin Rusew, who was on the staff of the Kenora school before he enlisted in the Air Force. We are asking him to be in Birtle as soon after the 10th of August as possible in order that he might have a few days with Mr. Webb. He has accepted the position but is afraid he may not be released by that time. Would it be possible for the Department of Indian Affairs to hasten his release? He is in the Air Force camp at Portage la Prairie, and we would be very grateful if any influence could be brought to bear to have him released by the 10th of August or as soon after as possible.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nMiss J.

Mr Webb has done excellent work at the School, and has made many improvements, and I am very sorry that he is unable to carry on. If he had been able to carry on his duties for another year or two I feel sure that the School would have been one of the most progressive in the West.

Smith  \nIndian Agent\nMinister of Mines & Resources,\nLegislative Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have recently been offered a position as laundry matron of the Little Indian Residential School. I have an eleven-year-old son whom I would like to take with me, if possible. The principal of the School, Mr. W. M. Ross, stated that I could not have my son with me at the school, as the Dept. would not allow it. I am writing to ask special permission of you, to be allowed to take him with me.\n\nIt is necessary that I earn a\nliving for myself and son, and it is difficult to find a position in a private home when one has a child of that age. I could leave him with relatives but I would rather not, as I believe it is a mother's duty to personally train her child and supervise his education to bring him up to be an honorable man. My son would also be much happier if he were with me.\n\nI would be willing to pay for his board and tuition at the school and have him subjected to the same discipline and duties required of the Indian boys of his age.\n\nTo be able to accept this position and take my boy with me means a great deal to me, so kindly give this matter your thoughtful attention.\n\nThanking you in anticipation of a favorable and early reply.

I am going to be out of the city for some time and have therefore sent in my resignation to take effect the end of the year. As yet no one has been appointed, but the work of the Indian Department will be carried on from the office until the appointment is made and all correspondence should be sent to Room 800 - 100 Adelaide Street West, Toronto, 1.\n\nI have had some correspondence with one of the missionaries on the Reserve at Rolling River. There is a good deal of dissatisfaction among the Indians about the accommodation provided at Birtle School. As you may know, there is no place for the parents to spend the night but the basement of the school. There are apparently more comfortable houses in some of the other schools and this is telling on the attitude to the school at Birtle. I do feel that the Department should make an effort to provide a small house to accommodate the parents, as it is not satisfactory having them in the basement of the school.\n\nI am very sorry indeed to give up this work, but have known for some time that I could not carry on any longer.\n\nWith all good wishes for the New Year, I am\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJ.

You are probably aware that it has never been the policy of the department to encourage Indian parents to visit our Residential Schools in large numbers and for a number of reasons that would readily occur to you, I am not at all sure that they should be encouraged to do so in the future. However, we shall be glad to communicate with the Indian Agent at Birtle with respect to the matter.\n\nMay I embrace this opportunity to thank you very heartily for the contribution you have made to the advancement of the Indian population and to express the hope that the year upon which we are entering may be a very happy and prosperous one.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMiss J.

G. Smith,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa\n\nI have your letter No.106-1-1 of the 2nd inst.regarding the question of accommodation for Indian parents when visiting their children at Birtle Residential School. This matter does cause dissatisfaction amongst the Indians of all the Reserves. The Roman Catholic Schools do provide some accommodation for the parents, and I am sure that they make them comfortable and provide for them to some extent when they visit the schools. The Roman Catholic children from this Agency attend Pine Creek and Sandy Bay Schools, which are situated a considerable distance from the Reserves, and therefore there is not much danger of the parents making a nuisance of themselves there, which they would do at the Birtle School, as it is not so far from the Reserves. I have never visited Sandy Bay or Pine Creek school, but I know that the parents go there by train in winter without making any provision for their own accommodation.\n\nTwo children from Rolling River Reserve were enrolled as pupils at Sandy Bay School last fall, mainly because the guardians could visit them there, and the Missionary does not of course approve of that as he is Presbyterian. In this case the Guardians, who I think are really Pagans, signed a declaration that they desired the children to be brought up in the Roman Catholic faith.\n\nPersonally I think there should be some accommodation for parents at the schools, but of course visiting would have to be curtailed, and controlled carefully. I do not think that the Indians will ever be satisfied until they have day schools on the Reserves, on this Agency, and judging the work of the school by the ex-pupils over a period of years, we cannot be satisfied with the result ourselves, and we cannot convince...\nthe Indians that Residential Schools are really doing something for their children until we can show them some satisfactory results.\n\nDuring the past year pupils in Birtle Residential School are attending classes all day, and I think that under this system, some results can be shown in a few years.\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI submit the following report on the Sirtle Indian Residential School, inspected May 6th, 1946.\n\nThere are 107 pupils enrolled - girls 52, and boys 54. They are arranged in three classrooms, beginners or juniors, intermediate and seniors. The classroom work seen was well done and I am confident that the children are making fair progress. The children were neatly dressed and clean. The classrooms were well aired and very tidy.\n\nThe sewing room is well supervised and the senior girls do excellent work. They can make their own dresses, knit and do excellent fancy work. Some of the sewing machines are in poor condition and need repairing. I would recommend that one new Singer Sewing Machine be supplied.\n\nThe dormitories were clean and the beds neatly made. There appeared ample bedding. The toilets were clean and all in working order.\n\nMr. Rusaw, the Principal, has with the assistance of the boys done considerable painting. The colour scheme is excellent and the painting has been carefully done. At present they are doing the staff living room. The chesterfield and two chairs are very shabby and should be replaced. The covering is badly worn and the springs useless. I strongly recommend the purchase of a new chesterfield and two chairs to match.\n\nBattleship linoleum has been used to cover the rough cement floors in the main hall, Principal's office and in the infirmary. This along with the painting has effected a wonderful change which I am confident is appreciated by all. The school interior is now bright and attractive. There are still rooms to paint as well as dormitories, and no doubt more paint will be required. The painting has been a real training for the boys and they can be justly proud of their work.\n\nThe playrooms and washrooms have also been thoroughly cleaned and painted. The taps and plumbing are all in good condition.\n\nThe Principal would like to build some cupboards and make a large table for the sewing room. He is prepared to do the work if the material can be supplied. I told him to secure a bill of material and this will be forwarded for consideration when received.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6251, File 575-1, part 3)\nThe laundry equipment appeared in good condition and the girls are receiving a good training. The clothes seem were well washed and the ironing well done.\n\nThe barns and out buildings are in good repair and the yards have been made clean and tidy. A quantity of shrubs have been transplanted and flower beds have been made ready for planting.\n\nAt present 12 cows are milking and there are more to freshen. The pigs number all told about 60. Last week the Principal sold 15 for which he received $204.00. He expected to sell another 15 this week. Of the balance six or eight will be butchered for meat and the rest sold late in June.\n\nThe chickens have laid well all winter and the eggs collected on the day of inspection numbered 91. Baby chickens numbering 300 had been received and were being cared for in a brooder house located some distance from the main building. Geese and turkeys are kept and already some birds are setting.\n\nThe farm work is done by tractor and four horse team. Two other teams are used for cleaning-up and garden work.\n\nThere was no sickness and I believe the children are well fed. They appear happy and were quite willing to engage in conversation.\n\nI consider the school is well managed and Mr. Rasaw is greatly interested in his work and in the welfare of the children.\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nfor Manitoba.\nREPORT FOR QUARTER ENDING MARCH 31st.\n\nEDUCATION:\n\nAt the Birtle Residential School the boys are now taking classes in wood-work, which is being taught by the Principal. The children are doing well in class-room work, as they spend four and a half days a week in studies. The Principal has had a lot of painting done by the boys with excellent results, and this is brightening up the building a lot. Battle-ship linoleum has been laid in the hospital which is also an improvement. There have only been two truants during the quarter. The children are well clothed considering the shortage of clothing and material, and are well fed, though the parents are continually complaining about the food. The engineer is a good man and keeps the plant and plumbing etc. in good repair.\n\nA. G. Smith\nIndian Agent\nBIRTL\u00c9 MANITOBA AGENCY.\n\nBirtle, Manitoba,\n26th July, 1946\n\nI beg to submit the following report for the period ending June 30th, 1946.\n\nEDUCATION:\n\nThe children have done well during the year at Birtle Residential School. They have been in classrooms practically all the time, with the exception of the older children who attend four and a half days a week. The class room teachers are all very capable and interested in their work. Sewing is taken up in the classrooms and very good work is done. The School building is in good condition on the whole, though of course repairs are constantly cropping up which require attention. The windows have all been painted which improves the appearance of the building.\n\nA.G. Smith,\nIndian Agent.\nFurther to the marginally-noted in this connection I have to report that inquiries have been continued in this matter on all patrols to the Birtle district, but so far without result. The matter is being kept in mind on all patrols, and every effort will continue to be made to learn something of value to this investigation.

Mr. HEBB could not be interviewed this date as he was away on a reservation in Saskatchewan for a load of children to start the fall term. Mr. FINDLAY could offer no information of value. He stated he was in bed before midnight Saturday, and he heard nothing whatever until time to get up Sunday morning. He could suggest no possible suspects at all, having seen nobody loitering around the school recently whatever. He said the children sleeping in the school just now could be entirely trusted, and the theft must have been committed by an outsider.\n\nMiss Ray ANDERSON was next questioned, and she told of being awakened about 4:00 a.m. Sunday, and seeing a big Indian standing in her room by her bed. She was badly frightened, and screamed frantically. The Indian turned and ran, and there was just sufficient light for her to say that he was wearing a red and tan two-tone sweater, similar to a hockey sweater, with a spot on the back which could have been a number. She was so frightened that she only took time to slam her door shut and then she jumped back into bed and stayed there until morning.\n\nThe little girls sleeping in the dormitory at the West end of the corridor stated they did not hear anything during the night at all. They are only young children, about eight and nine years, respectively, and all members of the school staff state that they are beyond suspicion.\n\nEric HILLIER, the asleep at the East end of the corridor, was next interviewed. He was questioned at some length, but could give no definite information. He said he heard nothing at all during the night in question, but slept soundly until morning. When he heard of the money being stolen from Miss HEBB, and of someone having been in Miss ANDERSON's room, he says he looked over his own things and found two boxes of White-Bang .22 cartridges missing. (Shots). The value of these cartridges is $5.00 apiece, a total of $10. Eric said he could not be sure they were taken Saturday night, but they were there a couple of days previously, and when he looked for them Sunday, they were gone. This boy was then asked whether he had seen any Indians around the school or down town in Birtle on Saturday, who might have been responsible. He replied that he did see one fellow that he thought was from the Rosebud Reserve (Lizard Point), but he did not know his name, being from Rolling River himself. This man was rather drunk, and he was wearing a red and white hockey sweater with the number \"11\" on the back. When Eric saw this man, he was on the main street of the town of Birtle, and was all alone.\n\nOther inquiries in and around the town of Birtle failed to reveal anyone who knew this allegedly drunk Indian, although several persons stated they remembered seeing him around. The only description was that he was a medium-sized Indian, very dark, and wearing a sweater with the number \"11\" on the back. As far as could be learned, this was the only Indian noticed in town on Saturday night.\n\n(See page 3)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6251, File 575-1, part 3)\nThe Principal, Mr. ZOBEN, occupies a suite of rooms on the main floor of the building, and the engineer, Fred FINDLAY, has a room in the basement. Mr. HUGAN could not be interviewed this date as he was away to a Reservation in Saskatchewan for a load of children to start the fall term. Fred FINDLAY could offer no information of value. He stated he was in bed before midnight Saturday, and he heard nothing whatever until time to get up Sunday morning. He could suggest no possible suspects at all, having seen nobody loitering around the school recently whatever. He said the children sleeping in the school just now could be entirely trusted, and the theft must have been committed by an outsider.\n\nMiss Fay ANDERSON was next questioned, and she told of being awakened about 4:00 a.m. Sunday, and seeing a big Indian standing in her room by her bed. She was badly frightened, and screamed frantically. The Indian turned and ran, and there was just sufficient light for her to say that he was wearing a red and tan two-tone sweater, similar to a hockey sweater, with a spot on the back which could have been a number. She was so frightened that she only took time to slam her door shut and then she jumped back into bed and stayed there until morning.\n\nThe little girls sleeping in the dormitory at the West end of the corridor stated they did not hear anything during the night at all. They are only young children, about eight and nine years, respectively, and all members of the school staff state that they are beyond suspicion.\n\nEric SHORTING, who sleeps at the East end of the corridor, was next interviewed. He was questioned at some length, but could give no definite information. He said he heard nothing at all during the night in question, but slept soundly until morning. When he heard of the money being stolen from Miss HAUGEN, and of someone having been in Miss ANDERSON's room, he says he looked over his own things and found two boxes of Whiz-Bang .22 cartridges missing (shorts). The value of these cartridges is 25\u00a2 apiece, a total of 50\u00a2. Eric said he could not be sure they were taken Saturday night, but they were there a couple of days previously, and when he looked for them Sunday, they were gone. This boy was then asked whether he had seen any Indians around the school or down town in Birtle on Saturday, who might have been responsible. He replied that he did see one fellow that he thought was from the Roseburn Reserve (Lizard Point), but he did not know his name, being from Rolling River himself. This man was rather drunk, and he was wearing a red and white hockey sweater with the number \"11\" on the back. When Eric saw this man, he was on the main street of the town of Birtle, and was all alone.\n\nOther inquiries in and around the town of Birtle failed to reveal anyone who knew this allegedly drunk Indian, although several persons stated they remembered seeing him around. The only description was that he was a medium-sized Indian, very dark, and wearing a sweater with the number \"11\" on the back. As far as could be learned, this was the only Indian noticed in town on Saturday night.\n\n(See page 3)\nThe following day, 23-8-46, patrol was made by the writer and Capt. DAVIDSON to the Lizard Point Indian Reservation. Mr. A.G. SMITH, Indian Agent, was on the reserve this date, and the matter was discussed with him and with Mr. HENRY HILL, the farm instructor. The possibilities of some member of this farm having committed the offense was considered, particularly those Indians known to have hockey sweaters. After a full discussion of the matter, the name of Godfrey MARSHALL, Godfrey MARSHALL, was suggested as the most likely suspect. This man has rather a poor reputation, and he was known to have a hockey sweater, although the number of it was not known.\n\nPatrol continued to Rossburn, and the R.C.O. I/C Rossburn detachment was contacted in an effort to locate MARSHALL. Inquiries continued for some time around Rossburn, and patrol then returned to Russell.\n\nThe following day, 24-8-46, OpL MURRAY called this detachment from Rossburn with the information that MARSHALL had heard the police were looking for him, so had presented himself at the Rossburn detachment office. He told MARSHALL that it was the Russell police who were looking for him, and MARSHALL thereupon stated he would go to Russell and find out what was wrong.\n\nAbout 5:00 p.m., this date, Godfrey MARSHALL called at this office. He was wearing his hockey sweater, bearing the number \"11\" on the back. He was thoroughly interrogated regarding his movements in Birtle last Saturday night, but he denied all knowledge of the theft. He did admit being drunk in Birtle, but he says he went up the hill to the C.P.R. station and went to sleep there, and he did not remember being asleep near the school. He said he had only a couple of dollars in his pocket when he went to sleep, and when he woke in the morning in the station, he did not have any more, so he said he could not have stolen any and forgotten it. He did not go down town again on Sunday morning, but got on the train for Churchbridge, Saskatoon, and from there went on to Rossburn looking for work. He returned to Rossburn Monday night and heard the police were looking for him on Tuesday night, so came on in to see what was the matter.\n\nSubject then volunteered to accompany the writer to Birtle for the purpose of confronting any witnesses, and so settling once and for all, whether he was the one who stole the money. Patrol was made forthwith, and interrogation was continued all the way to Birtle, without result.\n\nWhen in Birtle, various witnesses were contacted downtown, and they stated this was the man who was drunk downtown on Saturday night. (See Sep. report this date under the heading of \"Godfrey MARSHALL, Non-Treaty Indian, Rossburn Man, Intoxication, Section 135, The Indian Act\"). Miss ANDERSON, however, at the Indian School, could not identify subject, and even said he did not appear quite as big a man as the one she saw in her room. She admitted, however, that he might be bigger to her than he was, under the circumstances, she could not identify him.\nThe Principal of the school, Mr. M.M. Moran, was also interviewed this date. He could not offer any information that would point suspicion at any particular person, but he did recall seeing an Indian walking East on the railway track on Sunday morning. He said it would be fairly early, around 6:00 a.m., or so, before he heard of the theft from Miss Haugh. He did not get a good look at the man, but he seemed to be wearing a red sweater under a top coat, and looked like a fairly good sized man.\n\n16. The Indian Agent, Mr. A.G. Smith, was again visited this date. He mentioned the name of another possible suspect, James Keewatinappo @ McQuaide. He said the last he heard of this Indian, he had gone to the Selagirth district, looking for work. Keewatinappo also wears a hockey sweater, and he is a fairly big Indian. In addition he has a rather poor reputation, and he attended the Birtle Indian School a couple of years ago, so would know his way around the building and would therefore be a very likely suspect. It could have been Keewatinappo that Mr. Moran noticed walking East along the track on Sunday morning, as Selagirth is just eight miles North-East of Birtle.\n\n17. Other inquiries this date failed to reveal any more definite information, and the whereabouts of James Keewatinappo could not be ascertained. Further patrols will be made whenever possible, and efforts made to locate this Indian and have him questioned. Mr. Smith has also promised to try and find out about it and notify this office as soon as he learns anything of value.\n\nS.W.I.\n\nD.D.: 25-9-46.\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe O.C. - \"D\" Div., RCMP., WINNIPEG, Man.\n\nForwarded 4-9-46, for your information.

With reference to the above, and further to the marginally-noted I have to report that no more information of any kind has come to hand. Inquiries have continued with all diligence; the complainant has been kept in touch with and various reliable contacts have been watching for any possible scraps of information, but without result.\n\n2. This offence, it will be remembered, occurred in the early a.m. of Sunday, August 25th, 1946. Someone, presumably an Indian, entered the Indian Residential School at Birtle, Manitoba, and wandered into a room where Miss Judith HAUGEN, a member of the staff, was sleeping. He stole a small change purse containing about $7.00 in unidentifiable cash. He then walked into an adjoining room, but the occupant, Miss Fay ANDERSON, awakened and frightened him away by screaming. The matter was reported by letter received here on August 27th, and inquiries were commenced forthwith. Various Indians of this and the Rossturn district, all possible suspects, were carefully interrogated, and were eliminated as far as possible. Inquiries have continued unabated since that time, but nothing whatever of value has been learned. It seems that all possible avenues of investigation have been fully covered, and there is now small chance of successfully concluding the case. The only thing stolen was a small change purse, which would no doubt be promptly thrown away, after removing the seven dollars cash which it contained.\n\n3. The complainant states that she appreciates the efforts which have been spent on the matter, but she does not consider it of any use to continue investigation any longer, particularly since there was nothing stolen which could be identified. The writer is in full agreement with the complainant's attitude, and in view of the facts of this case, as set out above, may we please be advised whether it will be in order to refer the file to the Crown Attorney, N.J.D., for his opinion as to closing it out.\n\nS.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nCharge: Indian Affairs.\nThe Presbyterian Church in Canada began its mission amongst the Indians in 1866 near the present site of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. An extensive work was begun on several reserves and churches and schools were built.\n\nWhen church union was consummated in 1925 a part of this task was undertaken by the United Church in Canada.\n\nAt the present time besides the work on the reserves we have two residential schools and one improved day school under the care of our Church - Birtle School, Manitoba; Cecilia Jeffrey School, Kenora, Ontario; and Mistawasis School, near Prince Albert, Saskatchewan.\n\n**BIRTLE SCHOOL**\n\n119 pupils enrolled, 63 girls and 56 boys, from the following reserves:\n\n- Mistawasis 25\n- Round Plains (near Prince Albert) 4\n- Rolling River 11\n- Elphinstone 14\n- Griswold 6\n- Valley River 1\n- Birdtail 15\n- Waywayseecappo 43\n\nIn the Birtle School the course of study as outlined by the Department of Education for Manitoba is followed and all subjects listed therein are taught. All grades attend for the full school-day period from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. as in the Provincial schools. With the full-day system almost all children are able to cover the work outlined in the course for the year in that time. Four pupils are doing two grades in the one year. The highest grade is grade eight. Some pupils have\nvoluntarily expressed their desire to return for further education but whether they will or not is yet to be known. In the great majority of cases the parents persuade them to stay home.\n\n**Special Subjects:**\n\nHousehold Science, which covers all phases of sewing and cooking, is taught to all girls over nine years of age. The four-year course outlined by The Extension Service Branch of the Department of Agriculture for Manitoba is followed. Each group receives one-half day per week of instruction and work and one evening per week. Near the conclusion of the term an Achievement Day is held in the school and all the work is displayed. The public is invited to the display and the articles are judged by a representative from the Extension Branch. Also articles are prepared for entry in the Indian Classes at the Brandon Exhibition.\n\nThe boys in grades 3 to 8, inclusive, spend one-half day per week and one evening in Manual Training. This is the first year that a full course has been given in this work. As yet the workshop is too small and only hand tools are available, which limit the type and kind of work being done.\n\nThe girls and boys take a keen interest in both Household Science and Manual Training, and spend a great deal of their spare time on this.\n\nGrades 3 to 8 each have two half-hour periods of physical training per week. Some of the classes are held in the auditorium and the others in the playrooms. In the warm weather they are held outside. Boys and girls are taken\nseparately, and the period is spent in teaching folk dances, tumbling, physical exercises and organized games.\n\nThe nurse has taken health classes with all grades each week through the term. The senior girls are completing a course in Home Nursing and the senior boys a course in First Aid. These are the courses outlined by the St. John's Ambulance Corps and the students are writing the examination as set by this organization. The representative of the Corps will be visiting the school before the end of the term to test the students in the work covered.\n\nSome vocal music is taught in each classroom by the teacher in charge. The children are very fond of singing. Six boys take violin lesson and there is a very good violin orchestra. They practise for fifteen minutes every day at noon. Twelve girls are taking piano lessons. Some from each reserve are selected; and each practises for half an hour a day.\n\nStaff:\n\nAt present we have thirteen staff members. We hope to have a full staff by the beginning of September. The members of the staff are all very co-operative and there are some outstanding leaders among them. They take a very keen interest in the school and its progress, get along with the children exceptionally well and work together harmoniously.\n\nChildren's Transportation:\n\nThe children from the Birdtail Reserve are brought to and from the school by their parents, and the cost of transportation of the children from all the other reserves is borne by the school.\nThe biggest item of transportation is the cost of bringing in the children from the Mistawasis and Round Plains Reserves. They are taken part way by train and the rest of the way by truck. This amounts to a considerable sum each year. Each year the Department allows our Society a grant to cover part of the cost.\n\nSports:\n\nWinter time is the real sport season for these children. The juniors enjoy sleigh-riding on the hills in front of the school. They have a number of hand-sleighs which were in constant use all winter. The rink was most popular with the seniors. Every boy had a pair of skates, as well as all the senior and intermediate girls who wished them. Every day all winter they were out either on the hill or on the rink with a supervisor. The boys took a keen interest in hockey and both the Pee-wee and Midget teams were successful in most games with white teams in the district. The Midgets won all matches.\n\nIn summer some football and softball are played. The little girls enjoy the swings but should have a few more. The little boys play a great deal in the bush near the school.\n\nAll the children look forward to a party each month. The juniors have their party from seven to nine in the evening which consists of games, supervised by one of the staff, followed by lunch. The seniors' parties usually start as soon as the juniors have left the auditorium for lunch. Theirs consist of contests, games, stunts and some dancing.\n\nJune brings the annual picnic and sports days each year.\nEvery Thursday evening a moving picture is shown in the auditorium. One teacher has qualified as an operator of 16 mm. projectors. Films are obtained from the National Film Board free of charge and a number from the Visual Education Branch of the Department of Education. These are both instructive and entertaining.\n\nFarm:\n\nThe Principal and Farm Manager strive to have the very finest of animals on the farm and the herd of cows is fully accredited. It is one of the best Dual Purpose herds in Manitoba.\n\nThe farm, including a quarter section owned by the Church, consists of approximately 880 acres. A great deal of it is waste land and much of it is hilly, rocky and slough. There are about 125 acres of arable land on the Church quarter and about 200 on the school property.\n\nMost of the produce of the farm is used at the school.\nJuly 3rd, 1947.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nSome weeks ago, Rev. Robert Johnston, D.D.,\nof the Presbyterian Church in Canada, presented, on\nbehalf of the Women's Missionary Society (W.D.), a brief\nconcerning the Indian schools under our care. At that\ntime Dr. Johnston was asked to procure certain informa-\ntion which you will find enclosed.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nNational Executive Secretary.\nOttawa, August 13th, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. McEvoy:\n\nEnclosed for your information are duplicate copies of a brief prepared by the Reverend Robert Johnston, D.D., concerning the work of the Presbyterian Church in Canada as it affects Indian education.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.L.

We are arranging to have our Educational Survey Officer, Major G.A.F. Clark, visit this school in September. You can expect to hear further from us in this regard upon his return to Ottawa.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss Frieda Matthews,\nNational Executive Secretary,\nWomen's Missionary Society,\nPresbyterian Church\nRoom 600 - 100 Adelaide St. West,\nToronto 1, Ontario.\nOttawa, August 25, 1947.\n\nMr. A. G. Smith, Indian Agent,\nBirtle Manitoba.\n\nWe have received your letter - file 15 -\nof 6th August. A copy has been sent to the Women's\nMissionary Society of the Presbyterian Church, who operate\nthe Birtle Residential School for the Department.\n\nAt the present time we have a great many\nrequests for the construction of day schools and due to\nbuilding costs and material and labour shortages, we are\nhaving a difficult time in having them constructed.\n\nWe will arrange for our Educational Survey\nOfficer, Major C.A.F. Clark, to visit Birtle in September,\nso that he can further investigate this situation. He will\nwrite you as to the exact time of his arrival.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAugust 28th, 1947.\n\nCol. B. F. Kenny,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am writing to acknowledge your letter of August 25th re the Birtle School. We are interested to know that Major C.A.F. Clark intends to visit the School in September. Would you be kind enough to send me the approximate date of his visit? My reason for asking this is that there is a possibility that I shall be going to Birtle either in September or October.\n\nThe letter you enclosed from Mr. Smith came as rather a surprise to us, although we had had a letter from our missionary on the reserve near Rossburn telling us of certain dissatisfaction amongst the Indians. The chief complaint seemed to be that Mr. Rusaw smoked a pipe before the children. The missionary was of the opinion that an ordained minister should be appointed as Principal. The problem at the present time when there are so many preaching places vacant would be to find a minister suited for this type of work. In concluding his letter the missionary said, \"Personally I have no fault to find with our School or its staff\".\n\nDuring this summer we have had some members of the Birtle staff visit us here in the office. They spoke very highly of Mr. Rusaw and of his tireless efforts to improve the school. You will also be interested to know that Miss Kenny, former senior class room teacher, is returning after a year's absence to resume her teaching at Birtle. Her work was of the best and I think that it speaks well for Mr. Rusaw when Miss Kenny is willing to become a member of the teaching staff again.\n\nHaving been on the staff of the Cecilia Jeffrey School, Kenora, some years ago and knowing something of the Indian characteristics, my sympathy is with Mr. Rusaw in his problem of keeping the Indians from loitering about the school. On the other hand, we have to remember that the present system of taking children into the residential schools is perhaps not the solution to the difficulties of the Indian people. The parents quite naturally become lonesome for their children and, having no special responsibilities around their homes on the reserves, they see no reason for not camping as\n\nIndian Affairs.

Rusaw, Birtle Res. School.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Smith and I spent the morning of Tuesday, Sept. 2, going over and discussing the school and school matters with the Principal.\n\nHe is keen and business-like and good with children. He does not, however, see the necessity of \"selling\" himself and the school to the parents. I advocated adoption of your suggestion of a circular to parents. I recommend that we suggest to Miss Frieda Matthews that she write to Mr. Rusaw telling him to be more gracious to parents, to make them welcome at the school, to supply them accommodation without a hint that it is irksome, to permit children to spend all Saturday with parents who visit, and to remember that a judicious distribution of loaves and fishes may work wonders.\n\nOne of the women on the reserve which\nwhich I visited shouted after us,\" We used to get a turkey dinner at the school when Mr. Curry was there!\"\n\nRepeated discussions with other parents who were withholding their children from school boiled down to the assertion, \"I don't like that principal\" for the reasons mentioned or implied above.\n\nI sympathize with Mr. Rusau. Many of my pupils used to say they liked school all right but didn't care for the principle of the thing.\n\nC.A.T.Clark\nWT8\nOttawa, September 12, 1947.\n\nDear Miss Matthews:\n\nEX'D.\n\nWith reference to my letter of the 5th instant, we have just received a communication from Major Clark in which he reports on his visit to the Birtle Residential School on September 2. Major Clark states that Mr. Rusaw is keen and business-like and good with children. Major Clark has given him some excellent advice regarding action that he can take to improve his relations with the parents of the children.\n\nMay we suggest that you communicate with Mr. Rusaw and urge him to be more gracious to the parents and make them welcome at the school.

I hope to be leaving for Birtle on Sunday, October 5th, arriving there in mid afternoon of the 7th. While there I hope to have an opportunity of going to one or two of the reserves. If in the meantime Major Clark has anything else he would like to report to me I shall be very pleased to receive it.\n\nI hope also to visit the Cecilia Jeffrey School at Kenora on my return journey, somewhere between the 14th and 17th of October.\n\nI think the idea of setting one day as a visiting day is very wise providing that they do not decide to stay for the whole week-end.\n\nThanking you for your letter, I remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nNational Executive Secretary.\nBirtle Indian Residential School,\nBirtle, Manitoba.\nOctober 22, 1947.\n\nTo the Parents of our Pupils:\n\nI feel certain you will be happy to learn that the school has settled down for another successful year. Most of last year's pupils are back with the exception of the graduates and a few whose parents do not seem to care whether their children obtain a fair chance to receive an education.\n\nWe have welcomed sixteen new pupils. Three of the older pupils have been admitted to the senior classes from other schools to take advantage of the high grade facilities we have here. One of our students is taking work in the high school in the City of Birtle with the object of obtaining his matriculation standing. If he does so, it will enable him to study for a profession if he so desires. It is hoped that more will take advantage of the same opportunity as they may become future doctors, nurses and teachers so urgently required on many of our reserves.\n\nAll the children are well and you may be assured that if your child is seriously ill at any time you will be notified promptly.\n\nOur Hallowe'en party will be held on Friday evening, October 31st and we invite you to attend this party and spend Saturday and Sunday regular visiting hours with the children.\n\nAs you already know, we have no regular accommodation for visiting parents who wish to spend the night at the school. Therefore, we ask your co-operation by not asking for more than previously.\n\nVisiting rules are the same as last year, namely Saturday afternoons and evenings until 10 p.m., and Sunday after Sunday school in the morning until 4:15 in the afternoon.\n\nSome complaints were made last year regarding the condition of the shed where the horses owned by visiting Indians are stabled. This building requires repairs and it has been suggested that the Rosshorn men group together and put in a few hours' work on it when they visit the school at the end of October. May I suggest that you do your share of the work on Saturday morning and make it more comfortable for your horses. I will endeavour to have materials and tools ready for the job.\n\nPlease feel free to write to me at any time and let us all co-operate for the progress and happiness of the children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nN.M.

The classroom teachers are Mrs. Kenny, Mrs. Deane and Mr. Frost. They all appear greatly interested in the children and are undoubtedly doing good work, especially Mr. Frost and Mrs. Kenny. All teachers are qualified.\n\nThe boys' supervisor is Mr. Woolen. He is also the vocational teacher. Mr. Woolen is a young man with a good personality and is well liked by all.\n\nThe school throughout was very clean. The dormitories were well aired. The beds neatly made and with ample bedding.\n\nMrs. McLeod is the kitchen matron. She is a splendid cook and the girls are receiving a good training. I believe the children are well fed.\n\nThe outbuildings have recently been painted and are in good repair.\n\nThe new root cellar has just been completed and is packed to the roof with potatoes, carrots, beets, cabbages and turnips. The vegetables are of excellent quality. The cellar is dry and cool and the vegetables should keep in excellent condition. This cellar is 16' x 20' x 7' high - I believe ample storage for a school of this size.\n\nThe cattle are now stabled. At present 10 cows are being milked. Mr. Rusaw, the Principal, keeps a fair number of hogs and all will be used for food at the school.\n\nPoultry is kept and on the day of my visit 115 eggs had been gathered. Turkeys are also kept but this year hatching conditions were poor and the undertaking practically a failure. A flock of ducks was raised and are doing well. I understand all surplus stock is used as food for the staff and pupils.\n\nThe yards about the school were tidy and I was told that the display of flowers in front of the school was admired by all who saw them.\n\nMr. Rusaw has worked hard and in my opinion operates a school which is a credit to the Department and the Church. Mr. Rusaw appears interested in the children and discipline is no problem.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa, December 19, 1947.\n\nMr. A.G.

The purpose of holding the meeting there is to better acquaint the ministers of Presbytery with our work among the Indian children. There would be about sixteen ministers and elders at this meeting, three of whom would be ministers who are working on the nearby Indian reservations.\n\nI am writing for information regarding the granting of permission to have a meeting of this kind at the School. We would not wish to do anything which is contrary to the policy of the Department of Indian Affairs, but we feel that this would be a splendid opportunity to increase the interest in the work being done at the School.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nFrieda E.

We have had complaints from various parts of the Dominion regarding the number of holidays and interruptions to classroom work at many residential schools and we are making an earnest endeavour to correct this situation.\n\nIn the June issue of the Bulletin we outlined the programme that we wish followed in all Indian schools during the academic year 1948-49.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

B. F.

W. Oliver Nugent, our Minister in Brandon, saying that the Indians on the reserves around the Birtle School were not happy about the Principalship. They have said that they will not send their children back to the school and are going to open a school on the reserves themselves and even hire their own teacher. I was glad to hear that the Indians were so prosperous. I am writing to you to ask if this would be in accord with the wishes of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nI am sending a copy of the petition given to Mr. Nugent by the Indians. I am not putting all the signatures on the copy but it is evidently signed by most of the Band - Birdtail Indian Reserve and the Waywayseecappo Reserve. You will note there the two complaints that they have.\n\nA year ago similar trouble arose and Miss Matthews went out and left them all very happy. They so expressed themselves. I fear that trouble has been stirred up again by one of the staff who is not now with us on the Birtle school staff. I have written Mr. Nugent telling him that I am writing to you and also that Miss Matthews will not be able to be at the school at the time of opening, and asking if he will do what he can to assure the Indians of our desire for the welfare of their children. I have also asked him to tell the Indians that we can assure them that these reports which they mention in their petition are not true.\n\nMiss Matthews will be visiting the school and the reserves the latter part of October. Would you let me know what the attitude of the Department would be in regard to the opening of a school on the reserve and I will let Mr. Nugent know what you say?\nWe are very well satisfied with Mr. Rusaw as Principal and are extremely sorry that any member of our staff would try to make trouble but, as I said, there has been a change made.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Mrs. Daniel) [Signature]\n\nTreasurer.\nSYNOD OF MANITOBA\nPresbyterian Church in Canada\n\nBrandon, Manitoba,\nAugust 7th, 1948.\n\nW.M.S.,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada.\n\nDear Miss Matthews:\n\nNo doubt you know the parents of the Indian children attending our school at Birtle are not very happy about the principalship. The enclosed petition signed by the parents of the Waywayseecappo Reserve mostly has been in my hands for a couple of weeks. I wondered what to do with it but now forward it on to you.\n\nThe Indians want to use the Church at Waywayseecappo for a school and evidently would go so far as to hire their own teacher - but of one thing they are sure they are not going to send their children back to the school at the end of August.\n\nI understand you are planning to visit out this way in October. We think it is too late and we would like to see you at the school when it opens. It is impossible for us to do much as individuals, as a Presbytery, or as a Synod except to try to smooth things over. However, the Indians come to us and say something has to be done.\n\nCould you possibly be present at the school opening - not only to inspect the school and see the children but also to interview the parents? Would you be good enough also to write to each of our missionaries - that they may have a \"document\" re your proposed visit, immediately? It puts our missionaries on the reserves in a very bad position.\n\nSometimes I think the matter will be brought to a head when the children do not return to school. If there is anything I can do for you and the W.M.S. I am at your service.\n\nIn the meantime, I am\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nsigned W.

A further report on the whole matter will be forwarded at a later date.\n\nDuring visits to the various reserves in the Birtle Agency, the Indians did express an opinion that the Principal of the Birtle Residential School should be removed. This appeared to me to be the usual Indian talk at this season of the year, when their children were due to return to school. There appeared to be no complaints of a serious nature and no definite complaint. Little notice was taken, as it was felt that the whole matter would subside as soon as the children returned to school. This would appear to be the case. This week, and the latter part of last week, 99 children returned to the school out of 112. That number were supposed to return to school after the holiday. Of those missing or who failed to return, two are to return on the 4th., two more are witnesses in a court case on the 7th., a subpoena having been issued. Four are to return from the Birdtail Reserve and will be brought in tomorrow, and a further four are to return from Prince Albert. One pupil is truant and has been missing since July; this matter is in the hands of the R.C.M. Police. In addition, five new pupils have entered the school; three from Rolling River, and two from Lizard Point. The Principal assured me that no difficulty was experienced in having the pupils returned. It is evident that if the Indians did complain, the matter is now entirely forgotten.\n\nA Band meeting was held on the reserve during the month of July. The Agent was not present, and from the information I have been able to obtain, the meeting was held by the Missionary, resident on the Lizard Point Reserve, and a teacher, Mrs. Deans, who was discharged from the school staff.\n\nAs previously stated, a further report will be forwarded at a later date when I am in possession of further details.

Three pupils attend High School in Birtle in grade nine and one in grade ten. Eight children of the Gambler Band are in attendance at Baldwin day School, combined white and Indian under the Manitoba Provincial Education Department.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI herewith submit a report on the Birtle Residential School and the Griswold Indian Day School.\n\nBirtle Residential School\n\nThe above school was visited on November 9th, and Mr. Rusaw, the Principal, appears to be a very capable man. The school was found very tidy, and the buildings very well cared for; all minor repairs have been taken care of by the Principal. The outbuildings, including the barn and chicken house, are in wonderful condition.\n\nThe pupils are getting a very good training in the care of livestock, raising chickens, etc. They are milking 15 cows, and have 300 hens and a few geese and ducks. The chickens are split into bands of 50 and two boys are in charge of each band for a certain period. The hens are laying well, and the school is getting an ample supply.\n\nThis school is very well staffed, and all appear to be of a superior type. There are three classrooms - 46 pupils in grades 5 to 8; 40 in grades 2 to 4; 34 in grades 1 to 2. The school is in need of cupboards and tables in the sewing room, as at present they are using makeshift tables and have not any cupboards whatsoever, for taking care of their clothes. Mr. Rusaw advised me that the estimated cost of the work is $400. However, if an amount of $200 could be allowed, the work could be started this year, and completed next year. Tables could be built and a few cupboards put in.\n\nA number of the pupils in this school are from the Mistawasis Band in Saskatchewan, where we have a good day school. No doubt these children are sent to this school owing to fact that the teacher at Mistawasis, Mr. Moore, is not competent. I see no reason why these children cannot stay at home and attend the day school, instead of being sent to Birtle. A number of their homes are close to the school, and from past experience, I know that most of the families would rather have their children at home - if a good teacher is provided.\n\nGriswold Indian Day School - (Oak River)\n\nThe teacher, Mrs. Spence, seems very capable. The classroom was in first-class condition, and\nthe children looked neat and clean. There are 27 pupils on the register and 25 were in class at the time of my visit.\n\nI do not consider the new desks supplied from the penitentiary, are going to be satisfactory. The workmanship seems to be poor and a number of the tops are already broken. They will have to be replaced with heavy plywood, and I have instructed Mr. Young to have this done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S.

Hamilton Esq.  \nSuperintendent  \nIndian Agency  \nPortage La Prairie  \nManitoba\n\nThe Indians of the Waywayseecappo, Rolling River, and Keesekoowenin Bands are very much upset about the dates set for the Christmas holidays for the children attending the Birtle Residential School. They leave school on the 18th inst., and return on January 2nd as January 3rd is a full day in school. They would not mind the children staying in school until the 21st or 22nd inst., and returning on January 3rd or 4th. They have no complaints about the length of the holiday, but as you know, New Years day is the big day for the Indians, and I suppose they have learned this from the Scotch.\n\nTo be in school for a full day on the 3rd of January, the children from the Rolling River and Keesekoowenin Reserves, will have to drive by team from 10 to 20 miles on Sunday, wait at a railway depot until about 2 a.m. on Monday morning, take the train for Birtle arriving about 4.30 a.m. The children will certainly not derive any benefit from their classes on Monday after a night like that. The children from the Waywayseecappo Band will have to drive from 24 to 30 miles by team on Sunday, the day after New Years.\n\nThe parents were very glad to have the children home for the Christmas season last year, and every one was back to school on time. Knowing the Indians, I feel sure that most of the children will not be back until the 3rd and 4th of January this year. On the 4th there is a good train in the afternoon which the children from Rolling River and Keesekoowenin Bands could take. The parents inform me that the children from Sandy Bay School do not return until January 7th, if that is so it will cause further dissatisfaction. Knowing the circumstances,\nI cannot blame the parents for grumbling.\n\nMr. M. Husaw, the Principal of the School informs me that he requested permission to change the dates to suit local condition, but the Department refused to allow it.\n\nA.G. Smith\nAsst. Indian Agency\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nAttention: Mr. Neary.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nThe enclosed letter is self-explanatory. These Indians are all pleased to have their children home. They are pleased with the length of the holiday. They only request that there be a slight change in dates due largely to train service and to avoid long hours of driving on Sunday, January 2nd.\n\nIf the children were kept until December 22nd, they could return on the afternoon train of January 4th. They would be in attendance the required days and they would be pleased that consideration to their request was granted. It would improve the relation between the parents and school. I understand, Mr. Rusaw approves this request.\n\nI was on these reserves during the past ten days and this matter was a constant source of complaint. I request this matter be reconsidered and if possible the request be approved.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nSuperintendent.\n\nAGH/JM\n\nc.c.

Hamilton,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nChristmas Holidays.\n\nReference your 8-10 of December 7.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter, the Department approves the changes in dates in the Christmas holidays as recommended by you.\n\nPlease advise me immediately whether any other residential schools in the area are likely to make similar requests.\n\nPlease advise your day school teachers of this change and have them tell the children. Then there will be no complaints received from Indians that the residential school pupils are receiving longer Christmas holidays than the day school pupils.\n\nBernard F.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Bethel Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1941, Manitoba.\n\nPrincipal: J. H.

CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet; paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Birch Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1941.\n\nPrincipal: G. W. Rockhart\n\nDated: October 27, 1941.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at this 27th day of December, 1941.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRep.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Birtle Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1941.\n\nPrincipal C.H. Lockhart\n\nDated January 10, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nBIRTLE, MAN.\n\nDated this 17th June, 1942\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended 19 .\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 19 .\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19 .\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Birtle Indian School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1942.\n\nActing Principal\n\nDated April 25, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Birtle this 11th May, 1942\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n\nReps.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return, the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Kirtle Indian School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: W. E. Smith\n\nDated: July 14, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Kirtle, Man.\n\nthis 27th July, 1942\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Battle Indian School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 17 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Birtle Indian School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Jan., 1943.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nBIRTLE, MAN.\n\nDated at this January, 1943.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Birtle Indian School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1943.\n\nPrincipal [signature]\n\nBIRTLE, MAN.\n\nDated January 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at BIRTLE, MAN.\n\nthis 14th January 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Birtle Indian School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1943.\n\nPrincipal R. Webb\n\nDated April 10th 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nA.J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Birth Indian School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 5th 1943.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Birtle Indian School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 8th 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReap.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Birtle Indian School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 13, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at BIRTLE, MAN.\n\nthis 15th Oct., 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet; paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Castle Gordon School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 1, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Castle Gordon, this 20th April, 1945.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of quarterly grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Birtle Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: P. Webb\n\nDated: July 10th, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Birtle this 17th July, 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Battle Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal M.

RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 16, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 463\nReq.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] Residential School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Bertha Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Jan. 4, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Bertha this 8th Jan., 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Birtle Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated APR 4, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nBIRTLE, MAN\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this APR 4, 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Birtle Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: M. W. Russell\n\nDated: July 2, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nA. G. Smith\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: BIRTLE, MAN.\n\nthis 17th July, 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Bettle Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Jan. 10, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant the quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Birtle Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Oct. 8, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: BIRTLE INDIAN AGENCY\n\nOCT 9 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM[No. I.A. 403]\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Birtle Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: Jan. 7, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] School for the Quarter ended 31st Dec. 1948.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated Jan. 2 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Redacted] this JAN. 7 1948.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Battle Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Battle Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: July 2, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Battle, this 2nd July, 1945.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Battleford Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 9, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at STERLING MAN\n\nthis 15th Oct. 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFound No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for whom grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..........................................................School for the Quarter ended.........................................................19......\n\nPrincipal..................................................................\n\nDated.................................................................19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at .................................................................this..............................................19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated Oct. 7, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Portage la Prairie, Oct. 11, 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging if No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated Oct. 15, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Portage la Prairie Agency OCT 19 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Wheatley,\nIndian Agent,\nOttawa, August 19, 1920.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nMr. Agent Wheatley, in a recent report on the Birtle Boarding School, states that the water supply to the school from the C.P.R. tank line gives sufficient water for all purposes, but that a filtering plant should be installed so as to insure a pure supply of water for drinking purposes.\n\nI am bringing this matter to your attention, as, in the interests of the health of the pupils and staff, a pure supply of water should be furnished. As improvements of this nature should be carried out by the church authorities, I shall be pleased to be informed as to whether it is their intention that this work be performed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Asst.

I have conferred with the Women's Missionary Society, and Mrs. Clark assures me that this matter will be taken up as soon as their Board meets after the vacation months.\n\nIn the meantime, we are trying to find out through the Principal of our School and through Mr. Agent Wheatley, just what is necessary.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/CMoG:\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

J. Jackson,\n\nInsp. Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, January 26, 1921.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nMr. Inspector Jackson, in a recent report on his inspection of the Birtle Boarding School, states that an implement shed is badly needed at this school. He states that every machine they have is outside, subject to every wind and rain. He also states that it would not cost very much to put up a rough shed now that lumber has taken a drop in price.\n\nIt is considered that, in the interests of the school and as a protection to the farm machinery when not in use, it should be properly stored from the effects of the weather. This matter is being drawn to your attention in order that you can take it up with the proper authorities of your church with a view to having storage facilities provided for the farm machinery.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Consequently, care should be taken in installing these boards and have them fitted in the frame in such a manner as will permit of expansion.\n\nIf at all possible, hyloplate should not be installed close to the stove, as, if so, it is subjected to very great heat which cracks the surface. Water should not be used to clean hyloplate blackboards.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will keep these instructions in mind and have the blackboards carefully installed on their arrival. You should also point out to the Principal that water should not be used for cleaning them.\n\nRegarding the teacher's desk, Mr. Commissioner Graham will be instructed to forward a desk from the supply which he has taken over from the Department of Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

It is thought that you might have one, in the stock which you have taken over from the D.S.C.R., which would be suitable, and, if so, I should be pleased if you would arrange to have a desk, which you consider would meet the requirements, shipped to the Principal.

The responsibility of the Principal for 40 Indian girls and 30 Indian boys as regards their morals, discipline, health and safety to say nothing of food and clothing is so great that I would not take the responsibility of the task without living with them, and sleeping within hearing of dormitories at night. To do otherwise would mean that I nominally had the responsibility while someone else had the burden of it. We are practically all on duty all the time.\n\nHowever, it is almost impossible for an unmarried man to fill the position and equally impossible for a man with a young family to live in the school. Since my girls are 14 and 16 years old, I may be able to do so. I leave this to the discretion of your Board.\n\nDo we need to enlarge the School? We have sixty-seven on our roll now and I have a list of children who are a little over six years on these reserves before me numbering 25 in all. They will get no education till we bring them in here and we certainly have no room for them under present conditions. We have had, since holidays, 10 cases of mumps and 3 cases of erysipelas and it is most difficult to isolate these. If we put them out in a cottage we would have to stay with them and this would require a couple more on the staff. Consequently, it has made a lot of extra work. We require a nurses' room and a sick room for girls and one for boys. Besides our dormitories and classrooms are already crowded.\n\nI have made a rough draft of an extension. It is difficult to get estimates until a definite plan is made and this would cost too much unless we had something definite that we proposed to build. These sketches fill in the hollow square at the back of the building and would give an extension 49 x 33 or better still we could extend the length to 60 ft. x 33.\n\nThe advantages of this would be that we would have only two outside walls to build - the roof would be flat - no front entrance to build, no interior stairs - is as close to our present heating system as any other part of the building - would not necessitate any change of our present sewer system - and would not interfere with the work of the school while in process of erection.\n\nThis would give us just about what we need and I think at the least possible cost. At present I could only make a guess at what it would cost but think it should be built and completed for between six and seven thousand dollars.\n\nWhile I have stated the needs and the best way of doing it and the probable cost you must consider these as only suggestions on my part. I do not want to assume responsibility of advocating or urging any of these.\n\nI will do my best to carry out the wishes and plans of any who may have charge of this work.\"\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nAt the meeting of the Executive of our Board held recently, it was agreed to ask that the Government erect a new wing to the Birtle Indian School, Manitoba, that will accommodate about twenty children. In your letter of August 20th, you intimate that the Agent at Birtle suggested that a residence be erected, apart from the school building, for the use of the Principal. Our Board quite approves of the erection of the residence but we feel that, under present circumstances, the immediate need is for a wing to accommodate more children and provide necessary hospital accommodation. I am enclosing a copy of a letter I have received from Mr. Pitts, the Principal, together with a rough sketch of the structure he has in mind. If possible, we would like to have this erected early in 1923.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Evidently he overlooked attending to the same.\n\nIt is regretted that there has been delay in dealing with the foregoing, and I may say that in order that the regulations may be observed it is necessary for you to submit receipts supporting the following items, namely:\n\n*October 30.* Paid H.

It may have been necessary for a woman to have accompanied the patient but in the absence of explanation it would appear that the woman attendant could have transacted necessary business in addition to taking charge of the patient, thereby saving expense.\n\nWhen you have complied with the foregoing requests, no time will be lost in the issue of a cheque in your favour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

In a couple hours notice the head nurse and I got her ready, arranged for the fast train to take us on and had her in the hospital in the morning. She was a stretcher patient and we rode in the baggage car with her. We went at great inconvenience to ourselves and left our work and rode on the train two nights without sleep to save expense. We made no charge for our time. I have been out of this $74.25 (part) since last Aug. It's no part of our work to do this kind of thing except as we do it for charity sake.

We feel that we are not equipped for this part of our work as we should be; our horses, harness, and machinery are getting old and worn out, and should be replaced with new ones.\n\nWe require this Spring, a team of heavy horses, a set of heavy harness, a cultivator, a seed drill, a walking plow, grain binder, and mower. We are handicapped in our work as compared with schools that have Government owned equipment.\n\nIn our annual report to the Department this year the Church had contributed over $7000.00 to the support of this school for the year, for salaries, clothing etc., in addition to what the Government had paid, and the farm produced.\n\nAs we require other improvements to buildings fences, and stock, we feel that we can hardly ask the church to buy this part of the equipment that we require.\n\nWe sincerely hope that the Indian Department may be able to help us out, in purchasing this farm equipment for us.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"F.E.

This practice is departed from only in the most urgent cases.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. F. E. Pitts, B.A.,\nPrincipal, Indian Residential School,\nBirtle, Man.\nToronto, Sept. 11th, 1923.\n\nDear Dr. Edmson:\n\nAs I am not well enough to come to your office, am sending on a few lines for your consideration re our Birtle L. B. S. You are aware that the Dept. were ready to build a wing for dormitory accommodation and were to go on with the work during summer. Our Principal Rev. Mr. Pitts, is feeling keenly that this work has been held up by dept. as he has over 70 children in residence now with 25 more ready to come in - one hundred pupils for Birtle without any trouble.\n\nI have considered the matter over carefully and do not think that union between the two churches should make any difference between Birtle and Portage for each could guarantee at least 100 pupils which would give them industrial standing. Both are situated most favorably to carry on separately and become industrial. If present improvements could be carried out at Birtle so that the School could be ready for Aug. 1st, 1924, there is nothing to stand in the way of our bringing Portage and Birtle up to Government Standard. Even now I claim we are industrial in all but name and extra grant and have ascertained that schools, not any larger, in other denominations, are receiving Industrial grants. We should have two schools in Manitoba - as our largest Indian work lies there - then our C. J. - this is in Northern Ontario - could be moved to a district in the Lake of the Woods perhaps near to Kewadyro. We could easily have 150 pupils here at a point near to the railway location to be decided by Church and Govt. Now, what I wish you would do right now, is to ask the Dept. to go on with Birtle repairs, putting the foundation this fall and completing the job next spring, so that the school would be ready for 100 pupils next Aug. If the work is not begun this fall it could not be completed in time for August opening.\n\nAs far as I can remember it is the first time we have asked the dept. for any money for our Birtle L. B. S. and have expended large sums of money both at Birtle and Cebalis Geoffrey Schools. We know that the Dept. should help us at this point or buy out the schools at an early date. We wish to continue in the work and feel justifiably proud of our share in Indian work but it will take the heart out of our workers if we cannot provide them with adequate room for all the children in their respective districts - Kindly go into this matter with Deputy Scott at the earliest moment possibly.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\nSigned Adelaide Clarke.\nSec.

F. E. Pitts, the Principal at Birtle.\n\nThe application we made in the first place was for a swing to the present building that would make it possible for us to have a pupilage of 100 at this institution. Commissioner Graham, when he was here, thought it would be better to turn the present class rooms in the building into dormitories and build a separate class room not far from the main building. We are quite willing to accept the suggestion of Mr. Graham. Mr. Pitts estimates that it would cost about $2000 to turn the present class rooms into dormitories and to add another story. Then in addition there would be the erection of the class rooms. The amount of $4000 that was suggested for the work at Birtle will not be sufficient. I hope the Department can provide us the necessary accommodation at Birtle this summer. If improvements are to be made in the main building, work should be commenced as soon as the children go on vacation. If you would prefer to have our Principal, Mr. Pitts oversee the work, I think he would be willing to undertake the responsibility. If the separate building is to be erected for class rooms, work should be started on this immediately in order to be ready for the Fall term.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/EB\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am informed that you have recommended altering the present classrooms and adding a story to that portion of the building, so that more dormitory space would be available. A separate building of two classrooms would then be required.\n\nFunds are available for some building activity at this school and the Department has promised to provide a two-roomed school building and has offered a grant of \u00a32,000 for the alterations and addition to the main building. A new building should be undertaken by the Department, but the alterations can be left to the Principal.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will communicate at the first opportunity with the Rev. Principal, with a view to determining the exact requirements. You may then arrange for the erection of an outside classroom building. The Indian Agent and the Rev. Principal can oversee the work. No unnecessary expenditure should be incurred, but it is my wish that a good, substantial frame building be erected.\n\nIn the summer the alterations and additions to the back of the main building can be undertaken and you should ask the Principal to submit a list of the materials that he will require. He is prepared to undertake the supervision himself and, as this is a church-owned building, I consider it advisable to leave the work largely in his hands. He should be given to understand that you will provide materials and certified time sheets for labour up to \u00a32,000.\n\nWhen purchasing materials and engaging labour, please be guided by the regulations which govern public expenditures.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

No. 106-1-5, informing me that you had been discussing with the Presbyterian Church authorities the advisability of providing more accommodation at the Birtle Indian School.\n\nI note that it is your intention to make a grant of $2000 for alterations and addition to the main building. You have left entirely to the Church authorities the matter of the spending of this $2000. I do not think this is safeguarding the interests of the Department; however it is not for me to criticize.\n\nI do not think it is fair to ask me to be responsible for a building program in the West, and then tell me I can hand the work over to our Indian Agents and Principals of Schools. This is, to my mind, unreasonable, and it is just the opposite of my understanding with the Department, when in Ottawa.\n\nI am now preparing a report, which shows that over $50,000 was actually wasted at Elkhorn, through carrying on work in this manner. There was a deliberate waste, tearing down construction that should never have been touched; ripping up floors which were in perfectly good repair; replacing engines which would not have been replaced. All of which is accounted for by the fact that the man in charge of the work was getting ten percent on material and labor. If we are going to continue work in this way, we might as well cancel all arrangements that were made while I was in Ottawa. I will not take responsibility for the building program, if the Department say who I am to delegate this work to.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nD. C.

In his letter of the 23rd ultimo it is stated that the building without a basement can be completed for $4,000 and I take it that this will not include the cost of a furnace, piping and registers.\n\nI have examined the plan which Mr. Graham enclosed and I am of the opinion that two large cloakrooms are unnecessary in the case of a classroom building for a residential school.\n\nThe pupilage at Birtle is 95 and at Round Lake, 75. At these schools seating accommodation in two classrooms for totals of 70 and 60 pupils, respectively, is all that is required, in view of the half-day system. Of course, a larger classroom than is required is not a bad fault, except that it has to be heated.\n\nMr. Graham evidently intends to use the same plan for the Birtle school. At this institution the expenditure for this building was to be as low as possible. No amount was stipulated.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, June 6, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your No. 304-31A of the 23rd ultimo, enclosing a blue print of a two-roomed classroom building which you propose to erect at the Birtle and Round Lake Indian Residential Schools. After a careful examination of the plans, the question arose as to their special suitability for these institutions. It should be remembered that the papilage at Round Lake is 75 and at Birtle, 98, and in view of the half-day system, seating accommodation for 60 and 70 pupils, respectively, would appear to be ample. Further, considerable space is taken up with cloakrooms, which are large for classrooms at residential schools.\n\nIf suitable plans are prepared for each school, I have no doubt that you can complete both buildings for $8,000, as I was led to believe from your telegram of the 13th ultimo that an appropriation of $4,000 was all that was necessary for the purpose at Round Lake.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Dr. Scott, in his reply May 10th, sent me a copy of his communication to you in regard to this. I saw Mr. Pitts at the meeting of the General Assembly in Owen Sound and he stated that he had received no word from you.\n\nI have another communication from him today in which he intimates that you have not as yet written him. I will be glad to know where the matter stands. Is the work being held up? If so, for what reason?\n\nWhen I saw Mr. Pitts, he intimated that the $2000 would hardly be sufficient to overhaul the present building and turn the class room into dormitories. I conferred with our W.M.S. in regard to this and they expressed a willingness to augment the $2000 by $1000 or more if need be, so that an extra story might be added to the building.\n\nIn Mr. Pitts' letter he refers to the fact that Mr. Ferrier of the Department is going to visit the school shortly. I hope that all work and plans will not be delayed until after his visit. If the school and the dormitories are to be ready by September, plans should be under way immediately. I sincerely hope the necessary accommodation will be provided during the summer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEnc. l\n\nJHE/RG\nDuncan C.

You were good enough to send me a copy of your letter to Mr. Graham dated May 10th. In that you asked him to \"communicate at the first opportunity with the Rev. Principal with a view to determining the exact requirements\".\n\nFrom a communication I have from Mr. Pitts today, apparently the only word he has received is from the Indian Agent, who has informed him that Mr. Ferrier is to visit the school between June 25th and July 20th. As the children will then be away, his inspection must be for the purpose of looking into the matter of the building, but if he has to report before the work is started, it seems to me that it will be out of the question to complete operations during the holidays; and it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to make alterations in the building with the children present.\n\nI hope nothing has occurred to hold up the building operations at Birtle again.

Graham,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn discussing with Mr. Doig, contractor on the school building in process of erection, the ventilation of the school rooms, I find that instructions and specifications are very indefinite as to the flues and the openings into those flues from the class rooms. Please let us have instructions as to how these are to go in.\n\nI note also from the plan that there is no inside entrance to the basement or furnace and in order to make a fire one has to go all round the building.\n\nSince the agent and Department complained about the overcrowded condition of the class-rooms we had before with seventy children I fear that these rooms with very little more floor space and lower ceiling will not make room for ninety we are counting on.\n\nWork is going slowly on the classrooms. We will have the residence ready for Aug. 5th but they have only part of the footings in for the cement wall and have not yet placed the forms for the wall. I am hoping it may go faster when they get at the wood work.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF. E. Pitts\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter dated the 19th inst., and note your remarks with reference to the Plan of a two-room classroom in process of erection at your school.\n\nWith reference to the ventilation system the plan provides for a ventilation flue in the chimney with a foul air vent in each class-room. This plan has been explained to Mr. Mazenby who will see that the contractor carries out the work in connection with the erection of this school in accordance with the specifications.\n\nWith reference to the accommodation which this building will provide, I may say that the class rooms provide for 82 pupils according to the Provincial Government regulations. We are building a school in Manitoba and using a Provincial Government Plan. The size of the building is 24x40 with a 10' ceiling, and the Government authorize a pupilage of 41 for this building. The school we are building for you is exactly double that size, being 40x48. It is considered that this school will provide ample classroom accommodation for an Indian Residential School with a pupilage of 100, in view of the half day system in vogue in connection with the larger pupils, and I see no occasion for worry in this connection.\n\nRev. F. E. Pitts, Prin.\nBirtle Boarding School,\nBirtle, Man.\nconnection.\n\nWith reference to there being no inside access to the furnace cellar, I would point out that the original plan provided for using a heater in the classroom, and the furnace was an afterthought. It seems to me that there should be very little hardship incurred through having to obtain access to the furnace room through an outside door as, after the morning fire is started, there should be very little firing to do during the day, especially when coal is being used for fuel.\n\nBefore deciding on this Plan I gave the matter very careful thought, and after viewing several plans, concluded that his would be most suitable for your purposes and I feel sure that it will meet your requirements admirably.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner\nBirtle, Man.\nJuly 28, 1924\n\nMr. W.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYours of 24th inst. to hand. I note its contents and the underlying rebuff at my interfering with the building operations. Please note that in Dep. Supt. Gen. Scott's letter to you of May 10th he asked that the Agent and I oversee the building of the school rooms.\n\nI regret that I am in a position where I need to point out to you the absolute impossibility of the school rooms you are building. I am aware that the Ottawa offices have approved your plans and that you have taken them from the Manitoba Provincial plans. I have taken considerable time to study out why any architect would use such a ventilating system. When I got your letter of above date I saw at once where the mistake was likely made. You have taken an architect's plan for a one room school with windows on opposite sides and as you state in your letter have doubled it, thus making rooms with windows on only one side. This leaves no draught of air across the room. Even with the farthest window open the draught between that and the ventilating flue leaves more than half of the room (diagonally) untouched.\n\nThe specifications call for balanced sashes, but the bill of material made no provision for sash cords and weights and I understand you have refused to put these in, which very much increases the difficulty of ventilation.\n\nI cannot be responsible for putting the pupils or teachers in these rooms unless you ventilate properly. If you do not care to look into the matter now while they are being built I will submit the plans to the Inspector at Ottawa.\n\nI wish to point out in this connection that two years ago you wrote me that our number of pupils allowed was cut down from 75 to 70 and afterwards to 65 because of the overcrowded condition of the class-rooms and dormitories.\n\nThe two class-rooms we then had, had an air space of 21456 cubic ft. The new class-rooms have an air space of 14700 or one third less than the old ones. Besides we had class-rooms with windows on both sides, and all of these windows had transoms.\nabove that were easily worked, both the top and bottom sashes had pulleys and balanced weights. Besides we had the ventilating flues in the chimney.\n\nOur reasons for asking the Department to help us enlarge was first that our number should not be cut down and secondly that we should be able to take in 100 pupils.\n\nYou have all the facts as I see them. I am acting in the interest of the school and I expect you to treat it accordingly.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) F. E. Pitts.\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner Indian Dept.,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have gone carefully into the plans and specifications for this school of two rooms also the correspondence and fail to understand the criticism from your correspondent at Birtle, dated July the 28th, 1924.\n\nThe design in every way is a standard type, evolved after some twenty years experience here, spent in planning and equipping school buildings, under western conditions.\n\nThe size and cubic contents of each room, the lighting, heating, ventilation, details of elevation and equipment are in close conformity to regulation and in consequence are absolutely authoritative.\n\nThe building was designed by me for a two room school and not adapted from a one room school as suggested, and the only change made was to substitute basement furnace heating instead of the original stove heating in classrooms, which I consider an improvement.\n\nAn air space of 21456 cubic feet for two class rooms referred to in your correspondent's letter is wasteful, not only on construction cost but in annual expenditure for winter heating. For the same reason any change in the size of ventilation flue shown would undoubtedly be detrimental as same is accurately proportioned to move a certain quantity of air at a given velocity at a certain temperature condition, both interior and exterior of the building. The windows are intended to open fully at top and bottom by opening sashes, balanced by weights or spring balances - either would meet with my approval, the latter having the advantage of tighter and therefore warmer construction in wintry weather.\n\nI do not propose at this stage to go closely into the details involved or reasons why\u2014for instance\u2014the room is 22.6 wide, no more and no less\u2014or why the vent and smoke flues are 12x12 or 13x13 (brick and half) and so on ad infinitum, but I do take here and now strong exception to such a line of unreasonable criticism as has been displayed in this instance.\nYour correspondent would be well advised to acquire some knowledge of a highly technical and specialized subject before taking the responsibility of committing his criticism to the written word.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. H. Curtin\n\nJHP/PBH\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th inst., regarding the new class-rooms at the Birtle Boarding School. I have carefully noted what you say regarding this building and it is quite evident to me that you are not familiar with the situation.\n\nIn the first place you complain of the capacity and quote me as having written to you instructing you to cut down the pupilage from 75 to 70, and afterwards to 65 because of the over-crowded condition of the class-rooms. Will you be good enough to show me a copy of such a letter. My files here do not show that any such letter was written to you by me.\n\nYou state that you have 21456 cubic feet of air space in your old class-room, this being the case the air space would be sufficient for over 140 children, so it is hardly likely that I would write to you and ask you to reduce the number from 75, however, I would be glad to have the letter which you say I wrote to you.\n\nWith regard to the present air space provided you seem to be unnecessarily alarmed. There is an air space of 6,750 cubic feet in each room. This provides for a pupilage of 90 with two class-rooms, and if we are to have the half-day system you have air space capacity for 180 children, and as you are not likely to ever have more than 100 children present you have more class-room space than you will ever use. This is in accordance with the regulations of the Provincial Government.\n\nRev. F.J.Bitta, Prin.,\nBirtle Boarding School,\nBirtle, Manitoba.\nIt appears to me that your remarks with regard to this are uncalled for.\n\nWith regard to the windows; you have no grounds for complaint. These windows are being fitted with spring sash balances and provide for opening the windows both at top and bottom.\n\nWith regard to the ventilation of this school. I would point out to you that all modern and up-to-date schools have windows on one side. The ventilation is the same as provided in schools for white children. I would like to see a school building in your province that has windows on the opposite side, or hear of one that was built in the last five years. It is not being done.\n\nI have dealt with all the matters brought up in your letter except that portion in which you say that you note the underlying rebuff at your interfering with the building operations. If I have any rebuff to give I will do so up and above board and not write between the lines as you suggest, and my advice to you is to be just a little more guarded in your statements and suspicions when writing to me in the future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., August 1st, 1924\n\nDear Mr. Pitts,\n\nI am enclosing herewith for your personal perusal a letter that I have received from Mr. Pitts, Principal of the Birtle Boarding School.\n\nI have no desire to be drawn into any controversy with Mr. Pitts or Dr. Edmonson of Toronto over this matter, but you will see from the letter that Mr. Pitts is displeased at not being given charge of the work at the Birtle School.\n\nIn the first place I did not think he was capable of undertaking this work and in the second place I do not see how I could be held responsible for the work if I did not have the privilege of engaging what, in my opinion, was a proper man. As there was no comparison between the qualifications of Mr. Lazenby and Mr. Pitts, and you know as well as I do that two men cannot boss one job, I put the work in the hands of the proper party, viz:- our own officer.\n\nIn reading Mr. Pitts' letter you would think that the plans that I sent to him were far from being what they should. On the contrary, the School Plans were the very latest and most up-to-date. The ventilation system is in accordance with the Provincial Government regulations. The windows are hung with fixtures the same as are used on all modern school buildings. The air space provides for a pupilage at one time of 90, or in other words allowing that only one third are absent at other occupations it would provide for a school of 120. If we adopt the half-day system it would provide for 180 children, still he thinks that he is cramped for room.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMr. Pitts says that I had correspondence with him, recommending a reduction of the pupilage in the school from 75 to 65 on account of inadequate air space in the class-rooms. This is not true. If he has 21456 cubic feet of air in his class-rooms he has room for 140 children; this is more than he ever will have so that I think he is mistaken in this. He may have had a letter from the Department about reducing the pupilage, but it was not on the ground of over-crowding of the class-rooms.\n\nWith regard to his complaint about the ventilating system. This is modern and adequate in every way and there is no ground for complaint here.\n\nNow, Mr. Scott, I think it is unfair that this man should write to me a letter such as he has. He undoubtedly will take this matter up with Dr. Edmison. I have been led into this thing quite innocently. He is sore because the work has been handled as it has and I do not think that a matter of this kind should be passed over. I think a severe reprimand is coming to Mr. Pitts from the Department.\n\nI took the trouble after getting Mr. Pitts' letter to consult with Mr. Punton, Architect of the Regina Public School Board, and I am enclosing herewith a copy of his letter for your guidance. I would be glad if action could be taken to straighten this matter out because it is only going to grow from one thing to another if something is not done.\n\nI am enclosing two letters which I have written to Mr. Pitts so that you will have the correspondence before you to date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, August 6, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your No. 201-11A of the first instant, enclosing copies of correspondence you have had with the Rev. Principal of the Birtle Indian Residential School, relative to the classroom which is being erected at that institution.\n\nI do not anticipate any further controversy in this connection. The erection of the building is being undertaken wholly by Department officers. The principal has criticised the plans and you have had directed an answering communication. You have already advised Mr. Pitts to be more guarded in his correspondence and I believe additional action is unnecessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Mr. Pitts, Principal of the Boarding School at Birtle, in reply to a letter which I wrote to him on the subject of the pupilage for his school.\n\nMr. Pitts informed me in a previous letter that the class-room of the present school had a capacity of 21456 cubic ft. and that in the face of this he was told to reduce his pupilage to 65. In reply to this letter I stated that there must be some mistake, as I never told him to reduce his pupilage from 75 to 65 for the reason that the class-room did not provide the necessary space, nor do I believe the Department authorized him to reduce it on this ground. 21456 cubic ft. would provide, under Provincial regulations, for about 140 children.\n\nIf the Department took exception through the reports received from Mr. Ferrier and from Nurse Martineau, it was on the grounds, I think, of dormitory space, and had nothing to do with the class-rooms.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nWill you kindly look into this matter and let me know just what the Department did object to, as Mr. Pitts is criticising the capacity of the class-rooms that are now being built, which provide for more children than he will ever have at the school.\n\nI am now in receipt of another uncalled for letter from this gentleman, and this has all been caused by giving him to understand that he would have supervision of this work. Had you told me specifically that he was to do the work it would have been a different matter, as it is now nothing that I can do will please the man, and I do not propose to take insulting letters from him. I hardly think it is the intention of the Department that I should. I have asked you in a previous letter to see that this sort of thing ends.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, Aug 12, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your No. 201-11A of the 8th instant, with reference to the Birtle Indian Residential School. In reply I have to inform you that in 1922 I had some correspondence with Dr. Edmison, regarding the crowded conditions at the school. Upon the assurance of the Doctor that the principal had provided more dormitory space, it was decided not to reduce the pupilage from 75. A few weeks after this decision had been reached, following a report from the medical officer for the school, the question was again raised and it was found that there was a total of 29,620 cubic feet of air space in the three girls' and two boys' dormitories. This indicated that the pupilage should be limited to 60. The average attendance for the September and December quarters of that year was 60.3 and 61.5. In 1923, when the average attendance increased somewhat, no action was taken, as the question of providing more accommodation was being favourably considered.\n\nUnfortunately, the unsatisfactory classroom condition was coupled with the question of the overcrowded dormitory. Mr. Ferrier, in his report in 1922, drew attention to the fact that there were too many pupils in the classroom and that a second room and teacher were necessary, unless the half-day system was to be adopted. His criticism was based upon the fact that there were too many pupils for one teacher and not upon the air space provided.\n\nYou may inform Mr. Pitts that the Department considers two classrooms, accommodating 30 pupils each, are sufficient in the case of a residential school with a pupilage of 90.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nCommissioner's Office,\nRegina, Sask., Aug. 8, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI beg to submit herewith a report on the building operations that are being carried on in the three Western provinces under the direction of this office.\n\nI would deal with the different works as they appear on the list submitted to me from your office.\n\nBirtle\n\nThe double class-room at Birtle is well under way and will be completed in the early Fall.\n\nYou will see from this report that the work is well advanced and will be completed in good time this Fall.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

Has the principal enough of these on hand? If not, he should requisition for same if they are absolutely required.

The Principal is, I believe, a good all-round man and he has a splendid wife. He appeared to be more of an idealist than a practical type. The farm is 3 miles away and is not very productive and the garden at the school has not been of great value. The grounds were not in very good shape. More outbuildings are needed and also some agricultural machinery. There was some talk of applying for a filter for the water supply, but I advised the Principal to have the water analyzed first.\n\nThe alterations to the main building were nicely started and they were excavating for the new classroom building.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

As nothing further was done about it, the Agent spoke to the nurse about it when she was here in May.\nShe put it in her report expecting that the Commissioner would arrange to have this work done.

Principal of the Indian Residential School at Birtle with reference to the re-decorating of the interior of that institution arising out of the report of Travelling Nurse, Miss A.G. Brandon, who was at the school in June last.\n\nI visited this school about two years ago and noted how dull the interior was on account of the color and character of the paint used, and it was the intention at that time to insert an item in the Estimates providing for material for re-decorating. This was not done either that year or the following year, and the same conditions still prevail.\n\nFigures showing the surface to be covered indicate that the cost of the material required will approximate $200.00, and if the Department will consent to provide this amount I would recommend it, but the Church authorities should undertake to bear the cost of the labor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

The surface is composed of ground slate.\n\nThe reverse side of LITHOPLATE is thoroughly treated with a protective coating of mineral oil.\n\nLITHOPLATE is a perfect blackboard. It is durable. It does not warp, bulge or curl. It can be used anywhere and be put up by any one. It requires no special care. No dusting or brushing; no washing is unnecessary. The surface is very hard, pliable and non-porous.\n\nIt will not scale, peel, crack, become shiny or reflect the light. All kinds of crayons glide easily over its smooth surface without leaving marks and little dust. The crayon marks are easily, quickly and perfectly erased.\n\nWhere Lithoplate is Used\n\nLITHOPLATE is used on any kind of wall, stone, brick, plaster, rough boards, etc., where studding. LITHOPLATE is also used for portable blackboards.\n\nLITHOPLATE is affected by climatic conditions and is successfully used in all parts of the world.\n\nHow to Order Lithoplate\n\nAfter deciding the widths and heights wanted, measure exactly the length of each space to be filled and send us a separate message for each space. For example: one LITHOPLATE blackboard 3\u00bd feet by 9 feet, 4 inches; one LITHOPLATE blackboard 3\u00bd feet by 3 feet, 2 inches, etc. We cut LITHOPLATE to any specified length, but fractions of a foot are charged for as a full foot.\n\nSelect Your Sizes\n\n(Made in Black and Dark Green)\n\nThe stock widths of CAXTON LITHOPLATE are 3, 3\u00bd and 4 feet.

If so, we do not contemplate supplying any desks to this school. Your name is on our list, and when asking for quotations for desks for schools in the prairie provinces, you will be given an opportunity to quote.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWestern Seating Co.,\n179 Bannatyne Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward herewith, Agent's Report respecting Birtle Boarding School for the months of December 1926 and January 1927.\n\nWith further reference to my report for the month of January, I beg to draw the attention of the Department to a matter that I feel should be given immediate consideration, which is as follows:\n\nIn the cupola at the top of the main school building, is a water tank having a capacity of 40 barrels to which are attached the fire hose through a stand pipe. This tank is supported on the top floor, on four 6\" X 6\" timbers; below this, the weight is supported by the partitions. For some time past, all the floors directly beneath the tank have been sagging, with the result that doors &c.; are all out of shape. The weight could be taken off by emptying the tank of water, but if this were done, the school would be without fire protection.\n\nThere may be no immediate danger of the supports of the tank giving way, and yet there may be, therefore, for the sake of the safety of the pupils, and others in the school, I beg to recommend that the building should be examined by a competent building inspector.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.G. Domenby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Ass't Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, February 16, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, drawing the attention of the Department to the condition of the supports to the water tank in the Birtle Indian Residential School. As this building is owned by the church authorities, I have to request that you will arrange with the principal to obtain the services of a competent builder, or architect, to examine the supports to the water tank and submit a report as to what action he would advise be taken to remedy the present condition. When this report is received, it should be forwarded for the consideration of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nPercy G. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nMr. P.G. Lazenby,\nSup't Indian School,\nBirtle.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Water Tank in Indian School.\n\nI beg to submit the following Report as requested by Rev. R. Paterson.\n\nThis tank is said to contain 1600 to 1800 gallons of water and will weigh 8 to 9 tons. The tank is located above the roof and is supported on 4x6 in. posts at 5 ft. centers extending down to and resting on the flooring of the upper floor. The joists of this floor are carried by two 2x4 in. stud partitions 3' 6\" apart through First and Second stories and resting on the First floor joists. This floor is carried by a beam in the Basement which rests on one wooden post and a very defective concrete wall. The posts carrying the tank do not rest on the partitions but the load is carried to the partitions by the top floor joists.\n\nWhere posts rest on flooring there is a settlement of nearly 2 inches and this settlement continues to Ground floor and doors in partitions are badly out of square.\n\nThe post in Basement has rotted entirely away from its bearing on the footing and does not in any manner support the Basement beam under floor joists, the entire load of floors and tank being taken by this defective concrete wall.\n\nI have already instructed you that this post should be made good at once by cutting off the decayed portion and replacing this with a solid end wood block on stone footing, care being taken to provide strong temporary support under floor when doing this work to prevent any accident as I do not consider this wall safe.\n\nAn alternative would be to put in an entirely new post.\n\nI would also recommend that the 6x6 in. posts carrying tank be continued through to basement to take the entire load of the tank off the floors and partitions. These should be continuous and be strongly braced at joints in floors.\n\nI do not consider it would be advisable to attempt to raise the floors to level them as it would without doubt break or loosen the plaster and probably create more trouble than would be justified. The doors could be taken out and made square with little trouble.\n\nI trust the above will be clear to you and if I can be of any service to you please advise me.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nW.H. Shillinglaw\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 2)\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No; 106-1-5 dated February 16th 1927, referring to the supports to the water tank, in the Birtle Residential School, and in reply thereto, to advise that as this school building is being taken over by the Presbyterian Church, I took the matter up with the Rev; Robert Patterson of Brandon Man; he being an official of the Presbyterian Church in connection with that Church's Missions. Mr Patterson agreed that the matter of the water tank supports should be locked into without delay, and suggested that Mr W.H. Shillinglaw, Architect, of Brandon would be the man inspect these supports.\n\nMr Shillinglaw arrived at Birtle on the 8th April. I met him at the station and took him down to the school. He examined the supports of the tank, thoroughly from top to bottom of the building, and I have to-day received his report and recommendations in connection therewith, the original copy of which is attached to this letter for your consideration.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Ass't Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, April 27th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, relative to the condition of the supports to the water tank in the Birtle Indian Residential School, and enclosing the report of Mr. W. H. Shillinglaw, Civil Engineer of Brandon, setting forth his recommendations as to the repairs required.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange with a competent contractor to have the repairs required to the water tank carried out and have it placed in a safe condition. For your information I quote herewith from the report of Mr. Shillinglaw as to the work he would advise be carried out:\n\n\"The post in basement has rotted entirely away from its bearing on the footing and does not in any manner support the basement beam under floor joists, the entire load of floors and tank being taken by this defective concrete wall.\n\nI have already instructed you that this post should be made good at once by cutting off the decayed portion and replacing this with a solid end wood block on stone footing, care being taken to provide strong temporary support under floor when doing this work to prevent any accident as I do not consider this wall safe. An alternative would be to put in an entirely new post. I would also recommend that the 6x6 inch posts carrying tank be continued through to basement to take the entire load of the tank off the floors and partitions. These should be continuous and be strongly braced at joints in floors. I do not consider it would be advisable to attempt to raise the floors to level them as it would without doubt break or loosen the plaster and probably create more trouble than would be justified. The doors could be taken out and made square with little trouble\".\n\nP. G. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nIt is considered that the alternative scheme recommended by Mr. Shillinglaw would be the best method of having the work done. Every precaution should be taken to see that no damage occurs to the building when the work is being carried out, and it may be necessary to empty the tank while the repairs are being made. The work should be carried out in accordance with the recommendation of Mr. Shillinglaw, and the cost should be kept down as low as possible. You should obtain prices, if possible, from a number of contractors, and have the repairs made by the one who will perform the work satisfactorily and at the lowest cost. Only the work absolutely necessary as mentioned by Mr. Shillinglaw should be performed. When this work has been completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nThe voucher for $35.30 in favour of Mr. Shillinglaw is being returned herewith. If you will refer to my letter of February 16th, last, you will note that the Department's intention was that the school management would get the expert's report. If the school management would look after this cost, the Department expressed a willingness to make the repairs necessary. If this was the way you explained the matter to the Rev. Principal, I feel that he should be responsible for Mr. Shillinglaw's fee. If he thought that the Department was to undertake the entire expense, you may return the voucher to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF REV. H.B. CURRIE,\nPrincipal, Indian Residential School,\nBirtle, Man., dated 27th May, 1927.\n\nOriginal on File 106-1-1.\n\n\"I will admit the layout of this school makes it hard to work in to advantage. At the same time, any honest attempt to look after the school would certainly improve conditions. The school itself has been built in sections at various times. The layout is bad. I never found so many narrow dark halls and steep winding dark stairs in one building before. This school is simply a fire trap and a germ breeder. Very many of the toilets have no means of ventilation save into living rooms and dormitories, and the sooner this school is \"scrapped\" and a new one erected the better, for certainly this school is no credit to the Church or the Government.\"\n\n\"After that, believe me, I am not going to let the matter of a new school for Birtle drop, so you may begin now to draw up the plans for a hundred and twenty-five pupil school and provide for same in the estimates next submitted to Parliament.\"\n\n\"To carry this out here at Birtle, two things I require. First is a scale to weigh my pupils. There is none at the school.

All the red ink lines together, show Mr Duff's scheme for carrying the supports directly beneath the weight, to the basement.\n\nIf, however, this is done, the posts marked \"Post 1\" and \"Post 2\" on the sketch, (that is, 2 posts in each case, 6' apart) will come down through those rooms several feet from the wall, almost in the middle of the room on the first floor above the basement.\n\nThe cost estimated for material and labour to carry out this scheme, is stated by Mr Duff to be about $250.00.

Owing to corridors not coming directly under, and in line, it would be necessary to run girders at the floor joists to bring posts in line with corridor partitions on the south side. The North posts could be brought down through to first floor where it would need to be girdered over to avoid the furnaces. An iron post could be used here. All posts should sit on a cement base. There would be a great deal of ceiling torn away, and some partition plaster with lath need removing and replacing.\n\nAn estimate of the cost for material and labour to complete this job, would be about $250.00\n\nA.H.

Mr. Currie had just arrived one week before my inspection, with the result that as yet little change had been made.\n\nIn my last report, I described the school fully, so will not go into details. However, I feel something should be done to improve conditions in the boys' basement, which is used as a playroom. The ceilings are very low and the walls are badly broken, also the cement on the floors, in fact, the whole place presents a very dilapidated appearance. The entrance to the toilets open off this playroom and the whole place has a very offensive odor. The girls' basement is little better.\n\nThe laundry work is done in another part of the basement, and adjacent are rooms at one time used as toilets. From these also there is a slight odor, although Chloride of Lime is used extensively. The laundry is small and very cramped. All the work for about 100 people is done by hand, there being no power machinery of any kind. Miss Muir is in charge of this department and does very good work in spite of her handicap for room and Indian Commissioner.\n\nREGINA.\nInspector Hamilton's Report on Birtle Residential School.\n\nMiss Ferguson is in charge of the kitchen, which is in fairly good condition and well lighted. I doubt if she has given this work much consideration, but I believe this department will improve with the new principal and matron in charge, as they are giving close supervision of what food is provided and the manner in which it is being served.\n\nMiss Otten is the sewing teacher, and the work appeared to be carried on quite satisfactorily. The girls were busy mending and the discipline was good.\n\nMrs. Currie is now matron and, I believe, found things in a very untidy condition, in fact, she claimed the place was dirty. I saw some of the medicine cupboards, as they were left, and must say that they were certainly far from being clean. Apparently Mr. & Mrs. Pitts let things slide very badly before leaving.\n\nThe senior class-room was in charge of Miss Bradly. This work had been carried on by Miss Fleming, but on account of sickness, she was obliged to resign. Miss Bradly is not sure of remaining longer than the holidays. She has only been there since April 1st, but, I believe, is a good teacher and would make a success should she remain. This term's work has been badly interrupted and I feel little progress made. The children were clean and tidy, and the class-room well ventilated and clean. There are 17 boys and 27 girls on the roll.\n\nMiss Thorp is the junior teacher. She is doing good work and I regret to say, she informed me she would be leaving at the end of June. Miss Thorp is an exceptionally good junior teacher, and any school would be fortunate in securing her. The pupils are quite responsive.\nInspector Hamilton's Report on Birtle Residential School.\n\nresponsive and read well. Although the progress in this department is necessarily slow, due to learning the language, yet I feel that these children have done well and that progress certainly has been made. The class-room was clean, and the children were tidy. In the junior room there are 28 girls and 14 boys on the roll.\n\nHEALTH.\n\nThere were 57 girls and 31 boys enrolled at this school, making a total of 88. Of this number\n\n- 2 were in the Regina hospital,\n- 2 \" \" File Hills \"\n- 2 \" \" Birtle \"\n- 4 at their homes sick,\n- 2 sick in bed in residence and\n- 2 recently died.\n\nThis is a serious matter for such a small school. Before I left this agency, eleven other boys and girls were operated on for the removal of tonsils. A great deal of sickness has occurred at this school during the past year; whether it has been due to lack of care, I am not prepared to say. However, I might add that when I called at the school on leaving the agency, nearly two weeks after this inspection, the principal very gladly informed me that no children were in bed and that the health, in general, appeared much improved.\n\nNo hot water is available upstairs for bathing, except what is carried by hand. A tank could be placed in the kitchen and attached to the range, which would supply some water at least. Warm water in abundance should be available for keeping these children clean.\n\nThe toilets in all the dormitories have no ventilating windows; any odor therefrom escapes into the dormitories. Some outside ventilation should be provided.\n\nThe floors\nInspector Hamilton's Report on Birtle Residential School.\n\nThe floors in the stone part of the school have sunk a little, due, partly at least, to the arrangement of the water tank in the tower. This is a difficult matter to remedy, but, I understand, is being reported on by the Agent.\n\nThe outside work is in charge of Mr. E. Newsham. The cultivated land is situated about two miles from the school residence. This land is very dirty and certainly better farm methods should be enforced. Mr. Currie, I believe, will endeavour to do this.\n\nAt present, about 10 milk cows are kept and these are of very poor type. The milk supply is not sufficient. The principal realizes this and is very desirous of obtaining some good milk cows as soon as possible. These children need milk badly.\n\nThe barns and outbuildings are poor; in fact the cow barn is of little use and no doubt before good results can be obtained with dairy cattle, a new barn will be necessary.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nI beg to enclose herewith a report on the Birtle Residential School, which was inspected by Mr. Hamilton.\n\nThe report deals to some extent with the condition of the buildings, and it seems to me that the Department will be called upon to make a thorough overhauling, and I would suggest that a builder accompany one of our officers, go over the whole thing and make a report. I expect to be in Birtle myself within the next six weeks or so, but if I have your authority to go ahead and employ an expert, a report will be made. I would also like to have your authority to fix the walls and floors of the playroom, so that action could be taken while I was on the ground, or an officer of the Department. The outbuildings are apparently beyond usefulness.\n\nAnother feature of the report is the large number of children at this school who are unhealthy. There are a lot of children in the hospital here, also at Pile Hills and Birtle. I am just wondering if the Doctor is particular in his examination when admitting the children.\n\nWith reference to that portion of his report referring to the hot water supply, it seems to me a heater would not be sufficient to meet requirements; it would require a special jacket heater.\n\nHere, as at many other schools, there is complaint about not having sufficient cows of a good type. It is most important that good milk should be supplied in large quantities to the children. For some reason or another.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nreason or other, it seems almost impossible to get the school authorities to realize the importance of milk. The cows here are of an inferior type and the chances are that four good cows will give as much milk as ten inferior ones. However, when I speak to the school authorities about matters of this kind, the complaint is that they have not sufficient funds. I am pleased to state that at File Hills and Lebret Schools, where they have good herds, the children get an ample supply of good wholesome milk.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nJuly 7, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 201-11 of the 29th ultimo, enclosing Mr. Inspector Hamilton's report on the Birtle Indian Residential School. You may arrange to repair the walls and floors of the playroom and you might let me have, at your convenience, an estimate of the cost of putting the building in good condition. You should also make a definite recommendation regarding a jacket heater for the hot water supply. The Department is already in correspondence with the Rev. Principal concerning milk cows and, at a later date, there will be a further communication for you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M.

Currie, Principal of Little Red River Boarding School has written to me, in regard to the condition of the bed pillows in Little.\n\nThe government nurse, on her visit to the School, stated Mr. Currie arrived, recommended that the present pillows be turned as they considered them most unhealthy. The health of the children in Little has been poor and we wished to make an effort to remedy this.\n\nMy reason for writing is to say if the Department would supply the School with\n95 pillows and 90 pair of single bed blankets\u2014there are very few blankets in all total. Mr. Currie expects to have 90 pupils enrolled. James Scott has also requested this request should be addressed, but you will kindly correct me if James Scott might be addressing you.\n\nThere has been much worry over Mr. Currie's report on sanitary conditions in this school.

I note that the pillows in the children's dormitories are in an unsanitary condition and should be destroyed. While it is true the Department expects a school management to make replacements of this kind when necessary, in this instance I am pleased to state that the pillows will be purchased by the Department if you will instruct the Rev. Principal to requisition to the local Indian agent. I regret that the school or your Society will have to look after the new blankets that are required.\n\nI may say that the Department has been in correspondence with the Rev. Mr. Currie over the general conditions at this institution and we will cooperate with him in whatever remedial action is considered necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMrs. Helen M. Strachan,\n12 Meredith Crescent,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nBirtle, Man., 27 July 1927\n\nHon. Sirs,\n\nI wrote you the last week of May, shortly after my arrival at Birtle, re the first impressions that I had of Birtle School. Time has only confirmed those impressions. Today with some little experience I can say it is nothing short of criminal to maintain pupils amid such surroundings. Conditions must be improved immediately, or the school should be closed. If the Provincial and Dominion Health Departments were familiar with conditions, I am very sure drastic action would be taken. Three pupils have died in the past six months. And fifty % of the pupils were in need of medical treatment when I arrived in May. Four pupils are still in hospital, three are on the Reserves on sick leave, (six of the above I have not seen yet). If I can correctly read records, this condition is not a new one, and very largely, someone is responsible.\n\nI am most ready to co-operate with the Department in changing the conditions and removing as far as possible the causes of so much illness and deaths.\n\nWith this in view I venture to offer the following suggestions. First a new School is what should be provided. But in the meantime the following should receive immediate attention,\n1. The Filter Tank. The filter tank is not properly working, the trap in chamber two is off completely, and the stench from the tank comes up the waste pipes and fouls the air in the residence, indicating the traps on the waste or soil pipes is defective. Another cause of foul air in the residence is that every toilet in the school ventilates right into the living rooms.\n\n2. The Laundry. All the laundry work is done in the basement where no sunlight ever penetrates, and very little fresh air. The room itself is small, low ceiling, dark, all the work is done by hand, to do the work under such conditions the laundry is in constant use, and no girl living can day after day work in such surroundings and be healthy.\n\n3. The Heating Plant. The furnaces are old, out of repair and while may have performed the work satisfactory, that they were originally intended to do, the school has since been so much added to that at present they are quite inadequate. The present winter cannot be faced with the furnaces as they are. First they are not safe. Some time ago a fire was started, the steam gauges are gone, and there is no means to indicate what steam pressure you are operating under. And in a fifty degrees of frost temperature, one is very liable to push the furnace, even beyond its endurance, especially when circulation is poor and the residence is not...\ncomfortable. Last winter five cars of coal was consumed and several extra tons were secured, beside much wood. In spite of the fuel consumption, the building could not be kept comfortable, so I am informed. If a new heating plant is not installed this one should be thoroughly overhauled. With the nature of the water we use I believe the piping must be corroded to such an extent that circulation is almost impossible. This phase of the work cannot be neglected nor even delayed. And while on the subject of heating perhaps at this point will be the best place to say provision should be made for a supply of hot water. All the Laundry water is heated on a kitchen stove in the laundry room. And there is not hot water in a bath room in the school. Every bit of hot water required for bathing 90 pupils and the Staff has to be carried from the kitchen up to the bath rooms, up one or two flights of stairs, in buckets.\n\n4. Drinking Water,\n\nThe only water available is pumped up from the Birdtail River. It is a dark dirty water, the drainage from the whole country side, dead animals occasionally come floatation down, they get held up on a bar or brush and decay in the river polluting the water. And in our own particular case, all the drainage from our own filter tank drains into the river, and five hundred yards or less, down the river is the intake where our domestic supply is pumped up from. This we use for drinking cooking and all purposes.\nI am sure there are many sources of supply, where good water might be had with a reasonable outlay, I am ready to point out the source when you are ready to consider the matter.\n\nThe only place the boys have for play or shelter, when not in school or at work, is a basement room 24 by 18 feet seven foot ceiling, opening off the furnace room on one side and a toilet on the other side. This room the Sun never shines in, and there is no provision for ventilation, the two small windows and door must be kept shut in zero weather to keep your water system from freezing. The wonder is not that 50% of the pupils are sick, rather that 50% are well. Boys cannot be good, and cannot be well, herded like stock, and positively my stock in Alberni had better quarters than my pupils have here.\n\nThere is carpentry repairs, painting and kalsomining and what not to be done. But I do want immediate action taken on the five major matters above outlined. Our Gas light certain winter months runs to $65.00. I do not consider it a safe light where children are. Lighting matches continually, putting lights on, and the danger of gas not properly turned off and leaking into the room, A lot of money can be spent here and when you are finished you only have a makeshift. A new school is the only wise move, and if you will promise it for to be started.\nBirtle, Man., 192\n\nat an early date much of the repair expenditure might be avoided, I notice by old correspondence that you were at one time ready to take action on the Water question, but apparently it was blocked by a former Principal, in the face of strong representations, made as to its necessity. This plant might be provided now and will meet the need of the new School as well, if provision is made to have it of ample capacity.\n\nTrusting you will not let the above matters drag as we should have them completed before the cold weather sets in, and a couple of months soon slips by.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH. B. Currie.\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward herewith a letter addressed to the Department, written by Mr H.B. Currie, Principal of the Birtle Indian Residential School. Mr Currie brought this letter to me last night, and asked me to transmit it to the Department with any other comment I might make personally regarding its contents.\n\nWith regard to the residential building; it is, and has been in the past, my contention that it is practically impossible to keep children healthy, while living in it. There is not a toilet in the building that has a window in it, nor any other means of ventilation; entrance to those on the upper floors is directly from the dormitories, and there is always a peculiar, musty odor in the building.\n\nTo Mr Currie's remarks concerning the Filter Tank, and the Laundry, I have nothing to add, as he has covered these matters very well.\n\nRegarding Mr Currie's statements under the heading of \"The heating plant\", it will be noted that he says that the steam gauges are gone. These however were on the boilers last winter, and were in operation. Where they have gone to, I am at a loss to know. Mr Currie also mentions that \"a fire was started some time ago\"; this fire, however was not started from the furnaces. The fire occurred on February 4th 1925, and in this connection I beg to refer you to my letter to the Department, No; 15 dated 13th February 1925; Departmental letter No; 106-1-1 dated 13th February 1925, and my reply thereto No; 15 dated 17th February 1925. Since the school building was added to in the summer of 1924, the present furnaces have been somewhat inadequate to heat the building, though this may be due in some measure, to the fact that some of the main steam pipes have lost considerable portions of their asbestos insulation. There is, as Mr Currie states, no hot water system in the building, which means considerable labour when bathing the pupils.\n\nWith regard to drinking water, I may say that on more than one occasion, I suggested to Mr Pitts, Mr Currie's predecessor, that he should send a sample of the water to the Manitoba Agricultural College.\n\nThe Ass't Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.;\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nCollege for analysis, but this was never done. I made the same suggestion to Mr Currie, a day or two after his arrival at Birtle, and he informed me last night that he had written to the College for a proper container for mailing a sample of the water. The entire water supply for the school, is obtained from the C.F.Railway water tank at Birtle station, which is pumped from the Bird Tail River.\n\nRegarding the school lighting system; this is acetylene gas, obtained from the Birtle town gas plant. This is expensive lighting, and there is, of course a certain amount of danger attached to it, especially where there are children. The only way to remedy this, would be to install an electric lighting plant, but in my opinion, the building is not worth the spending of much money on.\n\nThe original school building, erected over thirty years ago, was probably adequate for the requirements as they were then, but that building was not designed in such a way as to facilitate additions being made to it, and the lay-out of the building as it is at present does not lend itself very readily, if at all, to effective improvements being made, from a health standpoint.\n\nI have today consulted Dr P.W.Head, the Medical Officer for the school on the matter, and shown him Mr Currie's letter. His comment was \"I can back up every statement made in Mr Currie's letter.\"\n\nI beg to respectfully suggest to the Department that the school should be inspected by an official of the Manitoba Provincial Department of Health; and also by a competent architect or building inspector, who could determine the feasibility or otherwise of making any improvements to the building. If these two inspectors could make their inspections together, and consult with one another, while at their work, a better understanding could probably be arrived at.\n\nI should be glad to be advised by the Department, after their due consideration of these matters, what action, if any, should be taken.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 3rd, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 15 of the 28th ultimo, enclosing a communication from the Rev. Principal of the Birtle Indian Residential School with reference to repairs and improvements at the institution. So that you will be informed concerning the action being taken by the Department in this matter, I am enclosing a copy of the Deputy Superintendent General's letter of today's date to Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham, Regina. Please inform Mr. Currie.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. G. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nAugust 3, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nWith further reference to your No. 201-11 of June 29th, last, I have to inform you that the Department has received a rather discouraging report from the Rev. Principal of the Birtle Indian Residential School. It is his opinion that a new building is what is required and that, even if considerable money is expended in repairs and replacements, the old main structure will never be satisfactory.\n\nIt is reported that the filter tank is not working properly. It is possible that reference is made in this connection to the septic tank. It appears that there is no ventilation from the toilets, that the laundry room is wholly unsatisfactory and that the heating plant is not adequate for the enlarged building. In this last connection, the Principal refers to an outbreak of fire in 1925, but the Agent's report at the time stated that the fire was not caused from the furnaces. It appears that there are no steam gauges on the boilers, and that there is no provision for heating water. It may be possible to ventilate a few of the toilets, and, in this event, the others should be kept closed.\n\nThe Principal reports that the water supply is most unsatisfactory, as there is grave danger of contamination. I understand that he has sent a sample to Winnipeg for analysis. Mr. Currie is of the opinion that it might be well to discontinue using the C.P.R. water tank, and secure their supply from another source.\n\nYou have already received authority to repair the boys' playroom, and you are to estimate the cost of the carpentry repairs and a hot water heater. It might be advisable to take an expert to Birtle at the first opportunity with a view to determining what should be done regarding the questions raised by the Principal's report. Some time ago Mr. Lazenby received instructions regarding\n\nM. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nbetter supports for the water tank, which was causing apprehension. As you have already been informed, we are in correspondence with the Principal regarding a better supply of milch cows.\n\nI believe that it would be well for you to personally visit this school, and, if an expert accompanies you, then a definite recommendation as to what is necessary will be expedited. You should bear in mind that this school is not our property, and that the Church authorities are primarily responsible for remedying conditions. In fact, there are no funds provided this year by Parliament for costly improvements at this institution. Upon receipt of your report, I shall communicate with the Church authorities.\n\nYours very truly,\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Sirs,\n\nSome considerable time ago I wrote you re certain necessary repairs at the Birtle School. So far my letter has not been acknowledged and no move to make the repairs are under way, so far as I am aware.\n\nIt is likely to be less than a month before we will require a fire in the furnace. And I will not take the responsibility of using this furnace in its present condition. If you will not undertake this work kindly advise me and I will see if the Church will do anything. It is certainly beyond my financial resources, in magnitude.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.B. Currie\nOttawa, September 8, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, with reference to repairs that are urgently required at the Birtle Indian Residential School. May I point out that your earlier letter, which you state was unanswered, was forwarded by Mr. Indian Agent Lasenby, and on the third ultimo I wrote to him, enclosing a copy of the Deputy Superintendent General's letter of that date to Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham, of Regina.

Limited.\n\nManager.\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sirs,-\n\nOn behalf of the Council Executive of the Women's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, I am writing you in regard to Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nI know that you have been informed both by Principal Currie and myself about the condition of that School, but my object in writing now is to ask if the Department will not take some action in regard to the building. We have all, as far as our Society is concerned, come to the conclusion that to spend any money either on the building or on furnishings and supplies, is putting good money into bad.\n\nWe are, as an Executive, desirous that any Institution under our management should be a credit to our Church. Of this Institution we are ashamed.\n\nWe appointed some new members of staff this fall, two have already sent in their resignations owing to conditions in the School, the other members are I know living under very poor conditions and to the detriment of their health.\n\nThis summer a convention of medical men was held in Brandon. Some Ontario doctors were present and were taken by one of the Brandon doctors out to see a case in Birtle School which had attracted some special attention. One of these doctors took the trouble on his return to come to the office and give us his opinion of the School. It was that it was a little better than a poor stable. Also that the children committed to our care were in poor health, and the sanitary conditions in the School were very bad.\n\nThe Department will know from your nurse in what a state she found the pupils.\n\nWe therefore would respectfully ask if you would include in your estimates a sum for building a new School at\nBirtle, at as early a date as possible.\n\nOn behalf of our Society, we promise our fullest and heartiest co-operation.\n\nOn behalf of Council Executive,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Wm.) William W. Strachan\nSeptember 21, 1927.\n\nDear Mrs. Strachan:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to general conditions at the Birtle Indian Residential School. I have noted your request that a new main building be provided for this institution at an early date. In reply I wish to point out that the Department has seriously considered the replacement of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, and it was the intention to ask Parliament for an appropriation in this connection at the next session. If you are satisfied that such action should be taken, it is possible that the replacement of the Birtle School would have to stand for the time being.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMrs. D.

But we would earnestly request, that the sum needed for the replacement of the Birtle Indian School might be placed in the estimates for the year 1929, as it is so urgently needed.\n\nOn behalf of the Council Executive, I am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMrs. D. Strachan,\nEducational Secretary,\nPresbyterian Women's Miss. Society,\n103 Harland Smith Bldg.,\n320 Bay St., Toronto 2, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward herewith my report respecting Birtle Boarding School, for the month of September 1927, and as supplementing that report, I beg to state that the school was visited on the 20th instant by the Deputy Superintendent General, the Indian Commissioner, and Dr Corbett of Regina. These gentlemen made a thorough inspection of the school building, and were anything but favourably impressed. The Deputy Superintendent General advocated making several changes, namely closing up the part of the building that had been used as a boys' play room, using one of the rooms in the class room building for a dormitory, and making one of the dormitories into a play room; also getting the laundry department out of the basement into one of the small cottages to the east of the main building.\n\nThe Principal later thought out another scheme, which would do away with the necessity of using a class room for a dormitory, and that was to use the pupils' dining room for the girls' play room between meals, and close what had been the girls' play room in the basement, for the boys' play room. To do this, all that would be needed would be a partition with a door in it built across the hall to separate the girls' and boys' play rooms. This door would be kept locked, of course, except when it was necessary to admit the boys to the dining room for meals. The school work can then be carried on in the class rooms as usual. It is hoped that this change will have the approval of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nWith regard to the laundry, I beg to report that some delay has been experienced in getting one of the cottages fixed up for this purpose, owing to the school farming instructor being ill, necessitating the Principal attending to the farm work personally, and no carpenters being available. However, there will be a carpenter at the\n\nThe Ass't Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.,\nschool on or about the 10th October to fix up the cottage. The Principal has also made arrangements for a part of the laundry work to be done in town, as instructed by the Deputy Superintendent General. Proper arrangements have also been made with regard to the toilets.\n\nIt will be noted from the attached report that there are 92 pupils as shown on the roll, but there are only 87 in residence, the rest being in hospital excepting one girl, who is being discharged, and is now on the reserve.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Izanby,\nIndian Agent.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nDon't understand laundry in Cottage. Write me about the laundry.\nOttawa, October 15, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 15 of the 8th instant, with reference to improvements at the Birtle Indian Residential School. The Principal's scheme to use the pupils' dining room as a girls' playroom between meals and put in a partition between it and the room that is now being used as a boys' playroom is approved. A properly certified voucher, in duplicate, covering the cost of the partition with door, should be forwarded when the work has been satisfactorily completed.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General does not understand the scheme to fix up one of the cottages as a laundry. You may remember that he authorized the school management to send their washing to a steam laundry and to forward the bills to the Department for payment. Please let me know why this proposal was not given favourable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nP. G.

The furnaces are old, and the lighting gas\u2014requiring a constant lighting of matches. The halls are narrow, stairs crooked and a combination that would be hard to remedy, and only adds to the necessity of constant watchfulness.\n\nWe have fire hose attached to stand pipe\u2014in basement on ground floor, and on second floor.\n\nThere is a triangle fire alarm on ground floor.\n\nThere are four John-Manville powder fire extinguishers.\n\nThere are four Gardner liquid fire extinguishers.\n\nThere is one fire escape that serves very well, the Senior & Intermediate girls dormitories, also the Boys two dormitories.\n\nThe Junior Girls dormitories is the one that would be a fire trap were the stairway on fire. The windows and a ladder would have to be used to escape, and a suitable ladder is not available and should be provided at once.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, relative to the fire equipment on hand at the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to the providing of a suitable ladder from the junior girls' dormitory, I beg to say that if you consider this type of fire escape suitable you may arrange for the purchase and installation of a ladder of the required length. Would it not, however, be more suitable to install a sliding pole. This pole could be so arranged that the descent would be broken by a balcony. If you would prefer a sliding pole rather than a ladder, you should obtain prices for the supplying and installing of same, and submit the prices received for the consideration of the Department. I shall be pleased if you will give this matter your early consideration.\n\nRelative to a refill for the 5 gallon pump tank Pyrene extinguisher, we are informed that water makes a satisfactory refill, provided it is not used in putting out fire occasioned by burning oil, gasoline or where electrical equipment is installed. If, however, you require a freeze-proof solution, you may place an order for a refill for this extinguisher with the Pyrene Manufacturing Co. of Canada Ltd., 1197 King St. W., Toronto, Ont., and forward their account, in duplicate, which you should certify and send to the Department for payment. Should you require refills for the 4 Guardene extinguishers, you may also place an order with the above firm. I am enclosing herewith for your information a pamphlet showing the different types of Pyrene extinguishers and giving full particulars regarding their use.\n\nShould you obtain a ladder for use from the junior girls' dormitory instead of a sliding pole as suggested, you should obtain an account, in duplicate, which you should certify, and forward to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The dining room, while still being used as such, is also utilized as a girls' play room between meals, and what was formerly the girls' play room in the basement, and which is in good shape, is now being used as the boys' play room, so that the boys are still sleeping in the dormitory as they were when we were there. A partition with a door in it is being built across the hall, in order to separate the boys' play room from the girls'.\n\nRegarding the laundry; one of the small cottages that we saw East of the main building is being fixed up for laundry purposes, and some of the laundry will be done in the town. You will remember that when we were there the Principal was of the opinion that the laundry could all be done at the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C.

We would supply the necessary baskets for shipping purposes, and would pay express charges one way. We believe this would make the actual cost of the laundering low.\n\nWe might be able to give you a special straight rate, but in order to do so, would have to have a sample bundle or two, of the class of work to be done. Also we can give you a special rate on flat pieces, such as bed and table linen. If we have not made ourselves entirely clear, we should like to have you send us a bundle or two, as suggested above, and we will write you more fully.\n\nWe are anxious to have the work, and can assure you that the best prices under the circumstances, will be cheerfully made. May we expect to hear from you by return.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRumford Laundry L.\nS'gd Geo W Butler\nManager.\n\nP.S.

We agreed to allow you a discount of $40%, which brings the charge due us down to $32.45 net. We understand that the work sent in to us would be a fairly representative weekly shipment, and if this is so, we would offer to do the laundry work for your institution for a flat rate of $30.00 per week, if shipped all in one consignment. We think you will agree that to get this amount of laundry work done would be a good thing for your institution.\n\nThe express charges, of course, would have to be taken care of by you. We have a large plant here, and work of this nature would help fill in some of the slack times we have during the week, and which is the reason we are offering to do it at the flat rate.\n\nWe trust that you will find this quotation satisfactory, and that you will forward the laundry work to us weekly for our attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRumford Laundry L.\n\nS'gd Geo W Butler  \nManager.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No; 106-1-5 dated October 15th 1927 regarding the changes being made at the Birtle Residential School.\n\nWith regard to the laundry work of the school, as mentioned in the last paragraph of your letter, I beg to state that I immediately took the matter up with the school Principal. The Principal wrote to the Rumford Laundry at Brandon Man; asking what their rates would be for doing the school laundry work. A copy of their reply is attached hereto.\n\nA sample bundle was sent to the Rumford Laundry, and has now been returned. The cost, at their list price was $54.07, less a discount of 40%, making the net cost for the work $32.45. The express charges one way amounted to $4.77, making the net cost $27.68;\n\nThe Principal had paid the express charges both ways, $4.57 to send the package to Brandon, and $4.77 for returning it; but as the Company agreed to pay charges one way, $4.77 should be deducted from the account which they rendered, of $32.45, which makes the account $27.68, net.\n\nIn their letter, enclosing the account, the Rumford Laundry L'td have agreed to do the laundry work for the school, for a flat rate of $30.00 per week, if shipped all in one consignment, all express charges to be paid by the school. A copy of this letter is also attached. At this flat rate of $30.00 per week, plus shipping charges, the school laundry work would cost practically $40.00 per week, which works out at about .45\u00a2 per pupil per week.\n\nThe Principal has been having some of the work done by -\n\nThe Ass't Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\ndone by a woman who lives near to the school. This woman charged 60\u00a2 per dozen for small articles, and 75\u00a2 per dozen for large articles. For overall and such like articles she charged a little more. The work done by the Rumford Laundry company was in every way excellent.\n\nWill you please advise me if the Department approves of the acceptance of the terms stated by the Rumford Laundry Company in their letter of November 19th?\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazebny,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 26, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 15 of the 21st instant; with reference to laundry at the Birtle Indian Residential School. I note that it will cost approximately $40 per week if the laundry is sent to a steam laundry. In view of the amount of expense entailed in this proposal, I have to request that you will comment fully on the principal's scheme as mentioned in your letter of the 6th ultimo. If one of the cottages can be fixed up for laundry purposes and the proper equipment provided, it might be more satisfactory. Please let me have an immediate report in this connection, with estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nP. G.

In addition to this, a plain 6 hole cook stove without high back would be required for boilers. The stove should have a water front in the fire box, to attach to a range boiler which would also have to be purchased. A suitable range, with water front could be obtained for about $65.00, and a range boiler with stand and connections would cost about $15.00. Two power washing machines should be purchased also. At present there are three hand operated washers at the school, two of which are in very poor shape. On making local enquiries I was only able to get a price on one \"Maytag\" washer. This is an American made machine, with a small gasoline engine directly underneath the tub. I have one of these myself and can state from experience that it gives good satisfaction and does very good work. The regular retail price of this machine is $135.00, but I can procure one only, locally, for $95.00. I understand that the Maytag people have ceased producing this type of machine now, and replaced it with a new type, the retail price of which is $225.00. One of the local hardware dealers informs me that there is a power washer made in Ottawa by the Conners Company, and the Dowswell Co; of Hamilton also manufacture power washers, but I could get no information as to prices of these machines.

This is just what 12\u00bd weeks washing would cost, if done at the steam laundry.\n\nI may say that the prices mentioned of the range with water front, the range boiler and stand with the necessary connections are taken from the catalogue of the T.Eaton Company, Winnipeg.\n\nIf the Department approves of the foregoing scheme, and expenditure, will you please advise me.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Hazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nDecember 12th, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Lasenby:\n\nI have your No. 15 of the 3rd instant, with reference to laundry proposals at the Birtle Indian Residential School. You may alter the cottage at an approximate cost of $60.00; purchase a suitable range and boiler at a cost of $80.00; and buy the power washer which you recommend and which can be obtained locally. I have directed Mr. Ferrier to purchase a second washer from the Connors people of this city and have it shipped to the school from their Winnipeg warehouse. In the meantime, the laundry from the school should be sent out so that there will be no inconvenience until the new equipment is available.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

It is understood that the price of this machine will be $205., f.o.b. Winnipeg. This machine should be shipped to the Indian Residential School, Birtle, Man.\n\nYour account, in triplicate, with freight receipt attached, should be forwarded to the Indian Agent at Birtle, who, upon receipt of the washer, will certify to it and send it to the Department for payment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.

They will prepay freight and will let you have the account, in triplicate, with freight receipt attached. When the washer has arrived, if in satisfactory condition, you should certify to the account, in duplicate, and forward it to the Department for payment.\n\nThis machine is equipped with gas engine and an exhaust pipe extension is, I believe, all that is required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward herewith Voucher No; 7974, amounting to $175.00, for a steel range and a motor washing machine, for the Birtle Indian Residential School laundry, the purchase being authorized by the Deputy Superintendent General's letter dated December 12th 1927.\n\nIn connection with the steel range, it was originally intended to buy a cheaper stove and a separate range boiler, but the range that has been purchased, has a boiler attached to it of fairly large capacity, and the range itself is a much better one for the purpose, than the one I first figured on purchasing, and the cost is the same.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Ass't Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nNOV 17 1927\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to report that when at the Birtle Agency recently, I visited the residential school, as instructed, with a view to noting what had been done towards carrying out the suggested improvements in the building.\n\nThe playroom, formerly used by the girls, has been turned over to the boys. A partition has been put in the hall leading to the outside entrance of this building so that the boys have direct access to their playroom from the outside and cannot gain access to the rest of the building from this entry. The dining room is now being used as a playroom for the girls and the arrangement appears to be working very satisfactorily.\n\nOne of the old cottages is being fitted up as a laundry and a water conveyer pipe has been put in. The work in this building has not been completed and it is not expected that it will be fit for use during the severe weather. In the meantime the laundry work has been done by a woman in Birtle and when I was at the Agency the Principal received an offer from the Humford Laundry Co., in Brandon, who quoted a forty cent reduction from off their regular list prices and also agreed to pay the express charges one way. He has sent a trial shipment to them.\n\nThis building, as you know, owing to its narrow and intricate passages would be a death trap in case of fire. It would be impossible to make an escape, if a fire were in progress, through the passages and entrances. The present fire escape is at the back of the old building and consists of\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nFIRE PROTECTION (Cont'd.)\n\nconsists of an iron platform and an iron stair leading to the top of a lean-to from which there is a drop of over 6 ft. to the ground. The small boys can get on the fire escape direct from their dormitory; the big boys have to pass through the hall to the small boys' dormitory. The girls have to pass through the matron's room in order to gain access to the fire escape. The latter arrangement is not satisfactory.\n\nWith reference to fire fighting equipment, they have a 40 barrel tank in the attic with a stand pipe and new linen hose on each floor. In addition to this, they have four 2\u00bd gal. fire extinguishers, four of the small Johns Manville extinguishers, and one 5 gal. pump tank. The Principal informs me that he is having weekly fire drill but does not turn the water into the hose as the linen hose, for the first few minutes, leaks a certain amount and makes a mess in the building. There is no fire escape from the dormitory in the north wing. This is a comparatively new addition to the school. In taking the matter up with the Principal, he informed me that he had authority to put in an escape and will do so at once. I gave him the necessary information as to where he could secure a pole fire escape, which was thought to be satisfactory.\n\nCONDITION OF BUILDING.\n\nThe building, as you know, is a very old one and should be replaced. This applies to the barns and out-buildings which are old and in poor repair. The only decent building in connection with this school is the classroom which is quite new and a good building.\n\nWhile I found the interior of the building clean and well kept, there was a very noticeable smell of sewer gas and in some of the rooms it was very objectionable.\n\nThis gas\nCONDITION OF BUILDING (Cont'd.)\n\nThis gas is backing up from the septic tank, which is evidently not working satisfactorily or else the traps may be defective.\n\nThe building is heated with two steam furnaces. These furnaces are very old and leaking. I noted that the furnaces are not provided with steam gauges and I could not find any information as to when they were last inspected or whether they had ever been inspected. The Principal, who has a certificate as an engineer, appears to be afraid of these furnaces. There is no doubt that they are very old and should be inspected. Their safety at the present time is in that they have several leaks which may prevent the pressure from getting too high.\n\nFARM.\n\nA farm, consisting of 160 acres 2\u00bd miles distant from the school, is operated. They had 90 acres in oats which was reported as being a poor crop; I did not see it. Their garden, however, produced 3,000 bus. of potatoes, as well as roots and other vegetables.\n\nTheir stock consists of 16 cows, 5 calves, 26 hogs, 6 work horses and 2 drivers. They are milking 8 cows at present and will have other cows freshening during the winter which will keep up their supply of milk. Their stock I found in splendid condition.\n\nPUPILAGE\n\nThere are 91 pupils enrolled; of these 5 were absent on account of sickness. The children have been very healthy and they have had none in the hospital for six months. I was present when the children were having their evening meal and noted that their food was ample and wholesome. The meals consist of the following:\n\nBreakfast\nPUPILAGE (Cont'd.)\n\nBreakfast\nPorridge with milk and brown sugar,\nBread & butter with fruit or Peanut Butter.\n\nDinner\nMeat and vegetables with raisin biscuite and apples.\n\nSupper\nMeat or soup with fruit and bread and butter.\n\nMilk and tea are provided for drink at each meal.\n\nThe Principal of the school, Mr. Currie, and his wife, who acts as matron, impress me as being very practical and capable people for this position. I believe they have the interests of their pupils and of their work very much at heart. Considering the condition of the building, it is kept in remarkably good shape. This is a difficult building to keep clean and tidy.\n\nI may say that when visiting the Waywayssecoppo Reserve the Indians there informed me that they had held a meeting amongst themselves and had passed a resolution agreeing to set aside a half section of land in the north east corner of the reserve in close proximity to Bird Tail Siding, and they are very anxious to have the school located closer to their reserve than the present location.\n\nThe foregoing report is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Marison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to forward herewith a report on the Birtle Indian Residential School, which was inspected by Mr. Murison during the month of November.\n\nAs you had a report on this school by Mr. Hamilton in June, and visited it yourself personally in September you will have a pretty good idea of the conditions existing there. It seems to me that nothing can be done to improve matters, and that the only solution is a new school. I intend going to Winnipeg shortly and will ascertain from the Provincial Government if they are prepared to dispose of their Experimental Farm at Birtle. You will remember we learned while at Birtle that this might possibly be procured. I have been going to do this but time has not permitted of my getting to Winnipeg.\n\nTo put in new boilers and spend thousands of dollars on this school seems to me to be impracticable. It is not so bad in the summer but it is very unsatisfactory and dangerous during the winter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nJanuary 7, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 201-11 of the 29th ultimo, enclosing Mr. Inspector Murison's report on the Birtle Indian Residential School. The physical equipment at this institution is certainly unsatisfactory. Whereas the property is church-owned, the responsibility for this condition is not largely ours. The future of this school must be given serious consideration.\n\nI regret that I cannot see any possibility of securing funds for a new farm and for new buildings in the early future. I hope to replace the other Presbyterian Indian Residential School - Cecilia Jeffrey - during the coming fiscal year and this means that major improvements at Birtle will have to stand for the time being.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the Birtle Indian Residential School, and I note that you cannot see any possibility of securing funds for a new farm and for new buildings in the early future, that you hope to replace the Cecilia Jeffrey school during the coming year and that major improvements at Birtle will have to stand for the time being. In this connection I merely wish to make it clear that no amount of money spent on the existing buildings at Birtle will make a satisfactory improvement. The school is not well located and it would be a mistake to spend money on it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

There was some delay in getting this laundry going after receiving the necessary authority to make the change owing to the inability to get the labour for the cottage work.\n\nAt the instigation of Mr Inspector Murison, who inspected the school in November last, a Slide Pole Fire Escape has been installed.\n\nThe work in both class rooms is divided into half days; in the primary room, Standards 1 and 2, are taken in the mornings, and Standard 3 in the afternoons. In the senior room, Standards 4 and 5 are taken in the mornings, and 6, 7, and 8 in the afternoons.\n\nOne of the pupils, James Cote, of the Pelly agency got his right arm broken this month, but this is now progressing well towards recovery.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Ass't Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\nOttawa, March 6, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Elliott:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, with reference to the Indian Residential School at Birtle, Man. There is no provision in the current Estimates for the rebuilding of this school. I am forwarding, at your request, a copy of the Estimates. You will note that, as far as Indian Education is concerned, there is but the one item.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWilliam Elliott, Esq.,\nGalt,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nBirtle, Man. 11 Mar. 1928\n\nDr. Duncan Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nof Indians, Ottawa.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nAs the Federal Budget has now been before the House for some time, you will soon know if the appropriation for our new school will be available for the present year's building. I wish to know this just as soon as the information is available as it will materially affect my plans for the coming year along several lines.\n\nIn view of my experience during the past few months, I feel like asking you to press the matter of securing us a new school during the present year.\n\nThe changes we have made, in new playroom for the boys\u2014change of Laundry to Cottage\u2014and an adequate milk supply\u2014have materially benefited the health of the pupils. We have had a few colds and coughing at the present time, but the health of the pupils has been good. You will be pleased to learn we have had no serious...\nBirtle, Man.\n\nIllness since last July - The cows you gave us the money to buy are proving real producers. Recently two of them have freshened and are giving over 35 and 40 lbs each per day. We now have over a pint of milk per day for each pupil, and members of staff - all milk is used whole. Butter so far is purchased. The two new power washers you secured for us work satisfactorily - and handle the heavy end of the laundry work.\n\nThe heating plant is the one thing that I cannot help worrying about. I have been able to keep the residence fairly comfortable - but at an excessive cost; I do not get results from the fuel consumed. I am on my sixth car load of coal now, and will require one more car yet to put us through. That is we have used 197 tons, but we through, that is we have used 197 tons, when the present supply is used up and another car that will be required, will be about 33 tons more or a total of 230 tons. Most of these has cost me $10 a ton, so the season's fuel is over $2000.00 for Coal - we use considerable wood also - at least 50 cords. This makes a decided tax on our finances. One car of Coal I have not yet paid for - would it be possible for you to arrange for payment of same? I will enclose the account.\nTo keep the building comfortable, the furnace requires constant attention. I have never gone to bed before twelve or one o'clock all winter. During severe spells I stay up till after four and sometimes until my farmer comes on duty at six. The furnaces are not safe, and I cannot forget that over ninety are asleep, under my care. I am a licensed Steam Heating Engineer and while others that might know less about conditions, might take chances, I cannot do it. And for the safety of my pupils during the winter 1928-1929 I would urge that no effort be left unused to secure our new School for Birtle in 1927.\n\nI know you will do all you can for us, and I felt it might strengthen your position to have the result of my observation and experience during the present firing season.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.B. Currie.\nMarch 23, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Currie:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant and am very pleased to learn that the recent changes and improvements at the Birtle Indian Residential School have materially benefitted the health of the pupils. I am convinced you are doing your best in a difficult situation, and the fact that an experienced principal is in charge at present is a matter of much satisfaction to the Department and to me, personally.\n\nThe chief needs in connection with Presbyterian Church Indian educational work are new buildings at the Cecilia Jeffrey and Birtle Schools. Cecilia Jeffrey has always had precedence and I am happy to inform you that funds will shortly be available for the initial capital expenditure there. There must inevitably be a delay before a new building can be provided for the Birtle Indian Residential School. This means carrying on for the time being or the alternative, which would be to close the school. After all, the first considerations are the pupils' health and safety, which are at present in jeopardy.\n\nThe first question to be answered is: can the activity be continued in the present building if special assistance is given by the Department? I could arrange to appoint a competent night watchman for the winter months and could favourably consider meeting special expenditure, made necessary by unsanitary or other unsatisfactory conditions. If you feel that the school should not be kept open, even with special assistance, I believe you should lay the facts before the church authorities.\n\nI am returning the account for a carload of coal. Expenses for fuel are purely current in character and, as such, will have to be met by the per capita grant or other earnings. Rest assured, however, that I am prepared to help in other ways.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. H. B. Currie,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBirtle, Man.\nOur Birtle Indian School at the present time is lit by gas, manufactured in and by the town of Birtle, from Carbide, and piped to the school, and sold to the school at $2 per 100 feet.\n\nThe town of Birtle is discarding their Carbide Plant as it is worn out. At the present time the Town of Birtle is erecting an electric plant, Oil Engine for power. This Electric plant is supposed to be ready for operation in two or three months\u2014after which the gas Plant will be discarded.\n\nThis puts our School in the position that we must wire our building for electricity or go back to Coal Oil lamps. I do not like the latter\u2014and have not the money to wire the building\u2014Will the Department consider the wiring of the Building\u2014we only wish the cheapest exposed wiring as we hope it will.\nonly be required until the fall of 1929 when we are expecting our new school will be ready for use. The expense for this wiring may run up from $300 to $500. But this is only my own supposition, and if the Dept. are ready to consider doing the work I will secure definite prices for your consideration. Or your agent Mr. Layton will perhaps be able to do the work better.\n\nOur work is going along remarkably well, and I am pleased with the progress under present conditions.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.B. Currie\nOttawa, June 21, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, informing the Department that it will be necessary to arrange for a change in the lighting system at the Birtle Indian Residential School. It is noted that the town of Birtle, from which the present system for the lighting of the school is obtained, is changing from the carbide plant to an electric system which, it is expected, will be ready for operation in about three months' time.\n\nI have to request that you will forward an estimate of the cost of wiring the school buildings for electricity. You should give details regarding the cost of the material, including wire, fixtures, etc. The work should provide for proper installation at all points and be safe from any fire danger. Please state, also, how you would propose that the work of wiring the building and connecting the system up with that of the town should be carried out. When we have this information, consideration will be given to the providing of the funds necessary for the purpose.\n\nI am pleased to note that the general work at the school is progressing favourably.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

J. Crickshank, Birtle Town Electrician. Mr. Crickshank's estimate is $300.00. Made up as follows: Material $200.00; Labor $100.00; and covers the following supplying and installing all material except 5 Dog Lamps. The wiring will be encased in rigid conduit throughout the building\u2014except in attic and furnace room where B & X Cable will be used. All lights to be drop cord and socket, only two switches to be supplied\u2014for furnace room and gymnasium (in basement). The town of Birtle will bring the light up to our property\u2014we are about 500 feet from the road\u2014might have to erect two poles.\n\nVery Poor Copy\non our own property\u2014and connect up from the Road to the School with wire. For this linking up\u2014Supplying 5 Dog lamps and possibly an extra switch or two I think another $50.00 should be added to Mr. Erickson's $300.00 estimate.\n\nOr for the complete installation $350.00. I think the estimate is most reasonable and I trust that at an early date, the work may be approved.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.B. Currie.\nOttawa, July 21st, 1928.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, informing the Department of the quotation which you received for the wiring of the Alberni Indian Residential School building for electric supply.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure of approximately $350 in having the wiring as mentioned by you carried out. You should see that this wiring is carried out in a satisfactory manner, that proper insulation is installed and that all danger of fire hazard is eliminated.\n\nWhen the work has been completed to your satisfaction, you should obtain an account, in duplicate, stating in detail the work performed. This you should hand to Mr. Agent Lasenby, who is being informed of the authority granted you to have the wiring carried out, and who will certify same and send it to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Currie, Principal of the Birtle Indian Residential School, to incur an expenditure not exceeding approximately the sum of $350 in wiring the school building for electric light. It is necessary to arrange for a change in the lighting system, as the town of Birtle, from which the present system for the lighting of the school is obtained, is changing from the carbide plant to an electric system which, it is expected, will be ready for operation in about three months' time.

Currie Orr, Esq.\nArchitect for the Dept.\nOttawa - Can.\n\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nI am returning one set of the plans you sent of the proposed Indian School, Birtle.\n\nI wish to offer the following suggestions based on my experience in the Church School at Alberni, burned in 1917, the new Government School completed at Alberni in 1920, and the present Indian School at Birtle. My first suggestion, and this would necessitate a change of the whole proposed plan, would be a detached Class Rooms or Class Rooms in a wing by themselves. This suggestion I made to Dr. Scott when he was here in 1927. And my experience in the three above schools convinces me that for in the main building and to have the Class Rooms in the Recreation Room under the Class Rooms, that there is so much noise in the Recreation Room that it disturbs the pupils in the Class Room. The Recreation Room is about 30 feet wide, necessitating a row of strong pillars down the centre often used by pupils at play and perhaps sometimes on purpose. We found it allow the pupils to use the Recreation Room during school hours that Class Room work was so disturbed that almost daily the Class Room teacher had to send the Class Room to speak to boys that started to play all right but gradually in excitement got boisterous again about once a week the dormitories above the Class Room.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nwere scrubbed and the moving of the beds across the floor caused too much noise in the Class Room. Again Class Room Pupils coming out and going into Class Room at 9 am. Recess in morning - noon out and in; recess at 2.30 p.m. and at 4 p.m. Made a lot of noise in the residence especially noticeable when sick pupils were in the School. The detailed Class Room or in an adjoining wing for School only would largely overcome this.\n\nOn the Basement Plan where the heating plant is about on the same level, the steam radiators have to be hung on the ceiling to get proper drainage for condensation water. Special extra radiator surface should be provided. The Basement was always very degrees colder than the rest of the house and to make the Basement comfortable the rest of the house was to heat. This applies particularly to the Bath Rooms off the Boys and Girls Recreation Rooms. These Baths appear to be the principal baths for the pupils - and they were so cold it was almost impossible to use them, also they were not conveniently located for these reasons. No Clothing Store Room is near for the clean clothes and it is far from the laundry for the dirty clothes. But these matters were less important, but being too cold was a chief objection. But as a preference I would suggest the main Bath Rooms be near Dormitories. The general arrangement of your Basement floor is good. One door from the kitchen, on the left hand side, out into the Boys yard should be added so that boys would not have to carry kitchen refuse out through the girls yard - as would now have to done unless it were taken away out through the boiler Room or through dining Room.\nThere is no provision in the basement for dairy room or cold storage. Of course you may have in mind other provision for these\u2014some place in building\u2014not on ground floor\u2014a disinfecting room should be provided. This is quite important, to disinfect bedding after illness, also we receive considerable supplies from women's church societies that provide us with boxes of clothing. All such second-hand supplies should pass through the disinfecting room before being put into use, as one never knows what disease germs they may contain.\n\nAs far as possible, for Manitoba, keep all water pipes away from outside walls.\n\nGround Floor\n\nSwing doors should be put on one end of the main hall on ground and first floor, to avoid drafts.\n\nIf present plan with class rooms in main building is used, the ground floor is about all one could wish.\n\nFirst Floor\n\nI see no provision for fire escape from the boys' and girls' dormitories, on each end of building.\n\nOne suggestion re this floor is that the bed-room between girls' infirmary and girls' dormitory bath-room be discarded and about five feet more added to the pupils' bath-rooms on this floor. This would mean shifting infirmary quarters about six feet to the right hand.\n\nSo far as I can gather there are no outside sleeping balconies\u2014might such be provided.\n\nThe dormitories are quite large about 52 x 28 feet.\nI am inclined to favor small dormitories, you can make better division of your pupils, especially for your Jr. pupils\u2014and your very little ones. Here there is a small dormitory for 8 Jr. girls, and I like it well. The small dormitory requires more supervision, but is better for the pupils.\n\nSecond Floor:\nThis floor is all right but for toilet provision. This would have to be installed, and I think it would be easy to put in as the plan shows. Bath rooms on the first floor. A bath tub here might be unnecessary\u2014but the toilet and bowl & slop sinks are necessary.\n\nPerhaps no one item, in a Manitoba School, is as important as an efficient, economical heating system.\n\nI have read considerable on construction, It is a line I am interested in and had some practical experience, and am anxious that the new Birtle School will be such that it will serve as model for your future buildings\u2014serve as model for your future buildings\u2014serve as model for your future buildings\u2014serve as model for your future buildings\u2014\n\nIs this suggestion any good Mr. Orr, discard the second floor, only have basement, ground & first floors, use Class Rooms I have marked.\nOne and three, in lieu of the dormitories on the Second Floor, Extend Class Room No. 1 to dotted line, to increase size of dormitory. Add toilet in No. 1 Class Room to connect to waste from Bath Room on First floor. Class Room No. 2 to be used as Clothing Store Room, and disinfecting Room. Entering Store Room from dormitory and disinfecting Room from Store Room. The toilet in No. 3 Class Room to connect with Waste pipe from Bath on First Floor.\n\nThis uses the Class Rooms, takes children from Second Floor, making it safer in case of fire \u2014 easier to cope with fire in case of accident, the high building requiring greater pressure to reach with water, and necessitates providing other Class Rooms in lieu of the present top or Second Floor.\n\nI trust the Estimate for our School meets with no opposition, in Parliament, that the site may be procured at once and the tenders called for the building just as soon as the money is assured \u2014 so that an early spring start may be made yours faithfully,\n\nH.B.

Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn the fall of 1928 I was instructed to engage a Fireman-nightwatch man during the firing season. I secured Mr. O.V. Johnson at $60.00 a month. He started 1 Oct 1928, and I will inform him today that we will not need him after the end of April. That will be seven months at $60.00 a month, $420.00. I have been paying him at the end of each month. He has been very faithful to duty and having had considerable experience on steam ships was able to render efficient service.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.B.

And the deal of the Demonstration Farm, Birtle, having apparently fallen through. I have two other sites in view. Both as near Birtle as the Demonstration Farm. Both have the four most important requirements, namely, Site, Water, Drainage and Agricultural land. I would like to have consideration given to them before any decision is made. In one letter Mr Graham mentioned that possibly a site on the Way Way See Cappo Reserve might be used. I think this is an undesirable location. Also one that would lend itself to constant opposition from the Rolling River and Elphinstone Reserve Indians. They have on several occasions gone on record as being opposed to the school going there. And expressed themselves that they will not send their children there.\n\nI know you will do all you can to advance or get the school under way soon. I would much like to know what steps are being taken, I certainly am much interested to see the new building ready in Oct, 1929. It is no pleasant\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe have been advised that you are contemplating the erection of a $250,000 Indian School at Birtle, Manitoba.\n\nConcerned as you are with construction, undoubtedly you are familiar with the uses of Copper, Brass and Bronze products and with their merits as building materials. We would appreciate your consideration of these metals for the projects in which you are interested.\n\nCopper, Brass and Bronze are well suited for those parts of buildings where deterioration first shows itself, namely roofing, sheet metal work, plumbing, hardware, lighting fixtures, and screens. Short-lived materials cause much damage by failure. Repairs and replacements necessarily follow. Yet many persons still believe it is economical to save the small difference in price between corroding materials and Copper, Brass and Bronze for these purposes. At the same time they demand the best in lumber or brick.\n\nWe are enclosing a partial list of our publications. You will see they include both technical and non-technical books. Copies of any or all are available to you at any time. May we send them?\n\nThe services of our Research Department and our Building Service Department are also at your disposal without cost or obligation in the solution of any problem which may arise in connection with the use of metals in building construction.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCopper & Brass Research Association,\n\nManager. William A. Willis\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 2)\nApril 25, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Currie:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to the building programme for the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nA few days ago, Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham's recommendation, that a site be selected on the Waywayseecappo Reserve, was approved and Mr. Graham was requested to have you accompany whatever officer made the selection of the farm and building site. I believe the opposition you anticipate from the other Indian reserves would be but temporary, and, if necessary, the Department would enforce the compulsory clauses of the Indian Act. The Waywayseecappo Reserve, from the Department's standpoint, has many advantages. There would be practically no expenditure for the site and farm. It would be on the line of railway which has direct railway connection with the Keeseekoosein and Rolling River Reserves. Further, excellent agricultural land can be secured. I may add, however, that no definite decision will be made until after the Department receives Mr. Graham's report.\n\nConcerning the changes in the Architect's plans, I have asked Mr. Orr to correspond with you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. H. B. Currie,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBirtle, Man.\nApril 29, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Currie,\n\nReferring to your inquiry regarding the plans for the new Birtle School I beg to say that I have incorporated most of your suggestions in the plans. As soon as they are complete I will forward you a copy.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nRev. H. B. Currie,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Res.

I did not make a report for the month of August, as the pupils and staff were just getting settled into routine work after the close of vacation, and the returning of the pupils.\n\nThe pupils returned to school after vacation this year, much more promptly than in any previous year in my experience, and without any having to be brought back.\n\nI was in the class rooms at 4 p.m. when the school was dismissed, and two boys commenced to sweep the rooms without the use of anything on the floor to keep down the dust. I recommended to the Principal in the evening, on my second visit to the school, that Dustbane, or some such preparation should be used, for the sake of the health of the children, and he said that he would see that this was done.\n\nThe heating system in the main building is in very bad shape; in fact, in my opinion it is a danger, and someone will need to be on duty 24 hours of the day looking after it this winter. This, I understand, will be the case. I impressed upon the Principal, the importance of fire drill, especially at this time of the year, and the heating system being in its present poor condition.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nThe Ass't Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department agreed to provide the school management with the funds required to pay for his services.\n\n**Total:** $420.00\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nForm 52.\n\nAgent.\n\n---\n\n**Indian Affairs.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, relative to the payment of the services of a fireman and night watchman at the Birtle Indian Residential School for a period of 7 months, October 1st, 1929, to April 30th, 1930, at $60 per month. A cheque to the amount of $420 in payment of these services will be sent you in due course.\n\nI have also the accounts which you submitted covering the cost of erecting stock shelters to the amount of $107.47. In this connection I would point out that these accounts are required in duplicate. If you have paid the firms for supplying the material, etc., the accounts should be marked \"Paid\" and certified by you as follows: \"Goods received. Prices charged fair and just\", in which case the cheque would be sent you covering the expenditure. If, however, you have not settled the accounts, they should be forwarded in duplicate and certified as above, and payment would be made direct to the individual firms. It is noted there is no account covering the cost of the windows, and this should also be forwarded in duplicate, properly certified. A certified voucher, in duplicate, should also be forwarded covering the cost of the labour. I am returning the vouchers which you forwarded in order that the above requirements can be carried out. When these accounts are received in proper order, payment will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. H. B. Currie,\nPrincipal, Indian Res. School,\nBirtle, Man.\nEXTRACT from Report of P. G. Lazenby, Indian Agent, Birtle, Man., for the Month of February, 1930, on the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nOriginal on File 106-1-7.\n\nRecommend that the classrooms' walls and ceilings be kalsomined white to brighten them. The cost would not be great, as blackboards & windows occupy most of the wall space.\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward herewith my Reports respecting the Birtle Indian Residential School for the months of February and March 1930.\n\nIt will be noted that under the heading of \"Suggestions\" on the report for February, I have recommended that the walls and ceilings of the class rooms be Kalsomined white. These walls and ceilings have never had anything done to them, since the class room building was erected in 1924; and the walls and now dirty, and, I should imagine, would tend to have a depressing effect on the pupils.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.J.

The price of this brick is a little more than we had been quoted on the Medicine Hat brick, which is being used at Lestock and St. Paul, but the makers have reduced the price to the same level in order to get business. If they are satisfactory we would like to use them.\n\nThe brick we have sent is an average sample. They vary a little in colour, some being a little lighter and some a shade darker so that you can get the usual tapestry effect.\n\nAs we cannot definitely settle window sizes until we know how the face brick will lay up, and as this varies with the make of brick, we are unable to give the mill a decision until the brick are decided on.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRe: Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nI made another visit of inspection to Birtle on July 30th, and while there telegraphed you that I advised an increase of the footings from 26\" to 32\", and I am in receipt of your reply saying that you approve of this.\n\nWhen the excavation was started the foreman found that he could not get a plow into the ground in order to use fresh air to take out the earth; there was a solid rock and boulder formation to a depth of about five feet or somewhat less. The only way to successfully overcome this was to put a large steam shovel to work, and the shipping of this from Winnipeg took about a week. When I arrived last Wednesday they had the main excavation out and expected to finish with the shovel on Saturday. Below this hard formation we ran into light clay which I thought would be better with a slightly wider spread of footing. I enclose one or two photographs to show the material excavated and the shovel at work, also a view of the property with the site indicated.\n\nClaydon Ltd., have ample equipment on the ground to put the job through quickly; the bunk houses and cook houses are up and things are moving along in a business like way.\n\nI drove out to the sand pits with the foreman and examined the sand they intend to use. This is quite good.\n\nI enclose herewith my account to the end of July on this job. You will note that I have to leave Punnichy at 3.50 a.m. and return the next morning at 3.30 a.m., making a full twenty-four hour trip.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to the first paragraph of my letter to the Department under date of the 5th June last, regarding the necessary outbuildings for the new residential school at Birtle, I beg to state that the barns &c; available at present for the sheltering of the school stock are entirely inadequate, and recently a large portion of one of the inside walls of the barn, which is built of stone, collapsed.\n\nAs it is now only a matter of about three months until it will be necessary to house the cattle, I would urge that the erection of the outbuildings be expedited as much as possible.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

No Upkeep Expense\n   For years we have supplied the major requirements of some of America's foremost business institutions. Units purchased ten, fifteen or twenty years ago are still in active service and going strong. Absolutely no upkeep expense has been, not the exception, but the rule.\n\n2. No Replacements\n   Your replacement problem will be definitely solved by gradually replacing less sturdy equipment with UHL Steel Industrial units. On new or installed units you can safely disregard the question of replacements altogether and capitalize on UHL Steel Industrial Units. During all the experience of a quarter of a century the question of replacement of UHL Steel Units never has existed as a problem with us, nor will it with you.\n\n3. Built To Last a Lifetime\u2014AND IT DOES!\n   Built like a bridge, of cold rolled steel, hundreds of thousands of UHL Steel Industrial Units are today rendering staunch service after many years of the harshest conditions and severe abuse. Ask any user listed on page 1, or let us furnish you with additional names of manufacturers who without exception have been continuously satisfied. The inherent quality of UHL Steel Industrial Units justifies our challenge that they are built to provide a longer life of useful service than any other similar equipment.\n\nFor The Cafeteria\nStill in active use after years of the heaviest strain, UHL Steel Cafeteria Tables and Chairs are today proving their durability and desirability in hundreds of industrial and school cafeterias. Of the chairs illustrated our No. 156 is especially popular, not only in industrial cafeterias, but for general utility purposes. It will outwear any other chair on the market.\n\nSteel Shop Stools\nAvailable in three different heights, with four different types of seat, and (if desired) your choice of three different types of back support. Feet are of steel, dome-shaped. Leather-topped feet can be had if specified. The experience of hundreds of great industrial institutions conclusively proves that these Steel Shop Stools provide the most economical seating for machine operators, bench workers, or wherever stools are required.\n\nThe Toledo Metal Furniture Company, Toledo, Ohio\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 13th August 1930.\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 11th August, 1930, from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, stating that the same being necessary, tenders were called for the proposed new Birtle Indian Residential School, in the Province of Manitoba, and that the following tenders were received:\n\nMacaw and MacDonald, Winnipeg, Man., $155,000\nS.

I wish to draw his attention particularly to this clause so that there will be no misunderstanding when it comes to the issuing of the final certificate on the contract.\n\nAny requests for changes in the plans and specifications for extra work should be forwarded to the Department by you, to which should be attached your comments and recommendations.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nMr. Swan, Esq.,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nAugust 14, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of August 2nd requesting the preparation of the necessary plans for the water supply and sewerage disposal systems for the new Birtle Indian School, and also requesting an estimate of the cost.\n\nSome three weeks ago I wrote the Canadian Pacific Railway Official in charge, Winnipeg, asking if they were prepared to enter into an agreement with the Department of Indian Affairs to pump water to the new Indian School at Birtle, and if so, upon what terms. Although I have received no official notification as yet, I understand that the Railway will agree to do the pumping for the new school from their existing pumping plant.\n\nOne of our Engineers is now at Birtle laying out tentatively, the location of the elevated water tank, necessary pipe lines, drains and septic tank. Upon his return the necessary plans will be prepared with recommendations for your approval or revision. As soon as definite word has been received from the Canadian Pacific Railway, I will enlist their cooperation as to the proper method of laying out the piping and valve systems necessary from their pipeline to the school tank. There may be some delay in the installation of the water system but I hope to be able to forward to you next week, plans covering the construction of the septic tank and drain pipe from the school, so that at an early date construction may commence on this portion of the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.

Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nRe: Indian School\nBirtle, Manitoba\n\nOur plumbing and heating contractors, Messrs. Ballantyne & Whetmore have raised a point about the location of the chimney with reference to the breeching. They point out that the boilers as now specified for the Indian School have the take off for the breeching at the back of the boiler instead of from the front as formerly. This increases the breeching length very much, and the Vulcan Iron Works are also joining in the argument that the excessive length of the breeching will offset to a certain amount the height of the chimney.\n\nIn addition to this, it is claimed that the passing of the breeching across the line of the steam mains over the top of the boiler will not be a very good arrangement. They, therefore, wish to have you consider the moving of the chimney to another location.\n\nEnclosed you will find a cutting from one of your mechanical drawings showing a suggested location for the chimney. If you decide to follow this suggestion, kindly indicate your wishes when wiring by saying whether you prefer location #1 or #2 as mentioned on blue print. We are pouring footings now, and before finishing up in the boiler room would like to have a word from you about the above matter.\n\nMessrs. Ballantyne & Whetmore are prepared to build according to plan if insisted on, but as they make this suggestion for the good of the job we invite your consideration of it. An early wire in answer to this letter would be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRe: Birtle Indian School.\n\nSince my report of Aug. 2nd., I have made two trips to Birtle the last of which was yesterday.\nI find that the work is going along very well, and that materials are being delivered as required.\nThe foundations are all in and most of the basement walls.\nThe contractors have a rock crusher on the job and are crushing up the boulders for the crushed stone.\nThe brick and tile are being delivered in large quantities, and yesterday I had a corner set up so that we could arrange for the best joint with the \"Rug-Tex\" National Clay Products brick which I understand you approved for the face.\nThe steel is on the job, and is being supplied by the Dominion Bridge Co. of Winnipeg. In this connection, and appos of our little trouble with the Winnipeg Bridge Co. on the Muscowequan school, I might mention that I noticed some of the small angle irons for the window openings were stamped Illinois which certainly does not look like Canadian material.\nThe Dominion Bridge claim that all steel sections up to 10\" I beams are rolled in Canada, but they have 8\" I beams on this job that are marked Illinois.\nWill you please let me know by return what floors you want in the principal's residence? I told the foreman that I considered that some of them would be wooden floors.\nIf you intend to have linoleum in the corridors, classrooms, and dormitories it would be necessary to know soon so that provision may be made for the difference of \u00bc\" in levels of finish concrete.\nI am of the opinion that more blackboard space should be provided in the class rooms.\nThe waterproofing of exterior of concrete walls has been done and weeping drain laid; back-filling is now going on.\nI am assuming that you wish me to continue these inspections until advised by you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nAugust 26, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 20th with regard to the new Indian Residential School at Birtle.\n\nWith reference to the linoleum it is not the intention to place linoleum on any of the floors in the building with the exception of the corridors. All the floors in the Principal's residence are to be of concrete the same as other portions of the building.\n\nIt is desired that you continue to make whatever inspections you think necessary of this building to see that it is erected in strict accordance with the plans and specifications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.

The kitchen and laundry drain pipe from the school will be placed in the same trench as the sewerage pipe from the school, and the overflow from the septic tank will outlet into the drain from the school immediately below the tank. The stony nature of the ground renders excavation comparatively expensive and it will be noted that the estimates are somewhat higher than the costs at some of the other schools, where a similar system was installed. I am having drawings made of the septic tank that is proposed to install and in due time prints will be forwarded to you.\n\nI have today been informed by the Canadian Pacific Railway that they will perform the pumping for the new Birtle School at a rate of .25\u00a2 per one thousand gallons\u2014the Department of Indian Affairs to defray the costs of all connections to their existing pipe line. Basing the water consumption of the school at an average of 5,000 gallons per day, this would make the daily cost about $1.25, which would appear to be more economical than any system of pumping that the Department could install themselves. If you consider such an arrangement satisfactory, I will proceed with plans and estimates covering the installation of the water supply system. There are many points in connection with the water supply installation that will require consid-\n\nA. F.

In the meantime I would recommend that the construction of the septic tank and the laying of the drain from the school be proceeded with and arrangements made to have this work done by the Contractor on a cost-plus 10% basis. With the present contractors on the job at Birtle, I would consider that very close inspection is necessary on all extra work to be performed.\n\nHoping to have a reply from you in the near future, I am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing District Chief Engineer.\n\nEnclos.\nSept. 4, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI am returning herewith your copy of the contract for the new Birtle Indian Residential School, duly signed by the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

William Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRe: Birtle Indian School.\n\nI have this morning returned from Birtle where I have investigated the complaint about the concrete. I find that the concrete basement walls are now finished, and that they are a good average job of concrete, and above the average for foundation walls. In stripping there were several places where the corners of piers had been knocked off, but not enough to make any structural difference. I chopped into the wall in several places, and also tried to drive 2\u00bd\" nails in. In no case could I get a nail in half way before it would bend over. Under separate cover I am sending you a piece of the concrete which I chopped from the wall. I am sending this because of all places tested this appears to show the least amount of crushed rock, being a piece where some of the smaller stone had accumulated. It might be interesting to have this tested for compression. As mentioned in previous reports the contractors are crushing the stone on the job, using the field stone taken from the excavation. I have sent a sample of this, taken from the crusher, with the concrete, and I have also enclosed a sample of the coarse sand which I had them mix with this.\n\nI am interested to learn from whom the complaint about this work came, and to know if they have any real knowledge of building construction or not. It is very easy for a person to state that a piece of work is bad, but quite another matter to say why and to show how it should have been done. Of course I have only been on this job about once a week, but I believe from my own observations that the Department are getting a very reasonable grade of work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nSept. 5, 1930.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHon.

I sanctioned the change to that side of the store room but with the door still in the store room on account of coal dust. I also thought that a door into store Rm. at foot of the side entrance steps would be allowed.\n\nThey very much want to have eight of the wash basins taken from the basement and placed in the present clothing stores on dormitory floor, to save the children making a trip down to the basement to wash and then back up again to complete dressing. This awaits your approval. I think it would be a good idea to do this and to carry the partitions over enough so that the fire escapes open into these wash-rooms. There will be no change much on the plumbing as the stack up to the top lavatory in dormitories will take care of these basins.\n\nI have not yet heard what floors are wanted in the principal's residence, but would suggest birch for living rooms and edge grain fir for bedrooms. Kitchen could be linoleum.\n\nI would much appreciate a reply by return on these.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It will be noted that this septic tank is practically identical with the septic tank installed at the new Indian School erected one year ago at Brandon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing District Chief Engineer,\n\nEncs.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSept. 11th 1930.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRe. Birtle Indian School.\n\nOn my arrival at Birtle yesterday I found Mr. Henderson just starting his duties as superintendent of construction. We went over the job together and discussed the various points that had come up since the work was started. Mr. Henderson had received no instructions except the telegram from your office, but we assumed that he would be taking charge, and that it would not be necessary for me to make any further trips.\n\nI am enclosing progress photos showing the work a week ago, but since then the concrete slab has been run on the main building at ground floor level, and the rear wing built up and steel joints on ready for concrete. The heating boilers are on the job, and the plumbers have most of the underground pipes in.\n\nIt is now becoming very imperative that the contractor should know where the water supply is coming into the building, where the electric power supply is coming in, and if a meter room or switch board is to be provided for, if the washrooms on dormitory floor are to be provided, and if laundry machinery is to be electrically driven or an engine provided.\n\nThe contractor is going ahead and only providing for linoleum on the corridors.\n\nIn taking up the matter of the steel angle irons with the Dominion Bridge Co., they inform me that they shipped from their Winnipeg stock in an effort to rush the order, and some of the angles were rolled in the U.S.A. As we have had to use some of these to proceed with the work I have dropped the matter.\n\nFrom now on I am assuming that all correspondence in regard to this job will go direct to Mr. Henderson at Birtle.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nHon. Thomas G. Murphy,\n\nWith reference to the concrete work in the new Birtle School on receipt of your telegram I instructed Mr. Swan, the Acting Inspector of Construction, to proceed at once to Birtle and submit a report on the concrete work for this building.\n\nThe following is the report received from Mr. Swan dated August 28th:-\n\n\"I have this morning returned from Birtle where I have investigated the complaint about the concrete. I find that the concrete basement walls are now finished, and that they are a good average job of concrete, and above the average for foundation walls. In stripping there were several places where the corners of piers had been knocked off, but not enough to make any structural difference. I chopped into the wall in several places and also tried to drive 2\u00bd\" nails in. In no case could I get a nail in half way before it would bend over. Under separate cover I am sending you a piece of the concrete which I chopped from the wall. I am sending this because of all places tested this appears to show the least amount of crushed rock, being a piece where some of the smaller stone had accumulated. It might be interesting to have this tested for compression. As mentioned in previous reports the contractors are crushing the stone on the job, using the field stone taken from the excavation. I have sent a sample of this, taken from the crusher, with the concrete, and I have also enclosed a sample of the coarse sand which I had them mix with this.\n\nI am interested to learn from whom the complaint about this work came, and to know if they have any real knowledge of building construction or not. It is very easy for a person to state that a piece of work is bad, but quite another matter to say why and to show how it should have been done. Of course I have only been on this job about once a week, but I believe from my observations that the Department are getting a reasonable grade of work.\"\n\nDuncan Scott\n\nIndian Affairs.

Murphy,\n\nWith reference to the new Birtle Indian Residential School it will be necessary to provide a sewage disposal system for this building.\n\nMr. Gow, Acting District Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water Power Branch, at the request of the Department, has prepared a plan of a septic tank that will meet the requirements of this Institution. The estimated cost of installing the septic tank, laundry and sanitary drain from the school to septic tank and the combined drain from septic tank to disposal field is approximately $2,382.00. Mr. Gow has recommended that this work be carried out by Claydon Co. Ltd., the contractors for the building, on a cost plus ten percent basis. Will you please advise me if this arrangement will be satisfactory.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I replied to their first letter that the erection of these buildings would not in all probability be contemplated for some considerable time.

Gow, Acting District Chief Engineer, making application for plan of location for these buildings also plan for water-mains and sewerage required for the new buildings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDavid Henderson, Esq.,\nInspector of Construction,\nBirtle Indian Res. School,\nBirtle, Man.\nWINNIPEG MAN. Sept. 19, 1930\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs.\nLegislative Buildings,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention Mr. Gurney Orr\nArchitect.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have had the privilege of submitting a quotation to a contracting firm in Winnipeg on the equipment you propose installing in the Indian School barn at Birtle, Manitoba. In taking off this specification we had an opportunity of examining the plan and we would respectfully submit the following suggestions as an improvement in regard to the layout of the four pens at the end of the building. According to the plan as it now stands the gate is placed in the centre of the front opening out on to the alley way, providing for a manger on one side, 4' in length and provision at the other side of the gate being made for a Water Bowl only.\n\nWe are of the opinion that the proper place for these Water Bowls would be in the cross partition and the attached pencil sketch will help to illustrate what we mean. The Water Bowl for one pen is set in the opposite pan and a large opening provided to allow the animal to drink through. We can supply Water Bowl Shields to protect the Water Bowls and keep rubbish and other matter from getting into the Bowl from the pen in which it is situated. We have found from experience that this is the most satisfactory method of placing Water Bowls in pens.\n\nThen by hanging both pen gates on the post at the centre of the pen front, this will permit of you using an 8' manger instead of 4' as on the present plan. This type of installation is if anything more rigid, owing to this corner post going further into the concrete and the lower bars of the gate frame, as illustrated in our barn book on page 162, will extend across both the gate openings and being embedded in the cement will still further strengthen these two gates.\n\nWe might add that the changes suggested will in no way add to the cost of these pens but will on the other hand mean added convenience on account of the gates swinging to the centre points in both cases and prevent to a large extent any chances of the animals crowding over.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 2)\nin behind the gate when being let out and possibly having an animal jammed in the gate way. We respectfully submit these suggestions for your approval and as we understand the work is going forward at once we can, if necessary have a blue print prepared for you here, embodying these changes and will be glad to hear from you by wire collect if you approve of our suggestion.\n\nThe accompanying pencil sketch shows at the left hand side the suggested change, while the drawing at the right indicates the layout as shown on your present plan. We would respectfully suggest that an 8' Stanchion Panel for each of these pens, using an 18\" manger outside of the pen, would be a decided addition to this equipment. It would allow greater space in the pen and be more convenient and economical for the feeding of the animals. This Stanchion Front is illustrated on page 152 of our barn book with an explanation of their construction on page 153.\n\nIn case you have not the latest issue of our barn book one is being sent you under separate cover.\n\nWe thank you for the opportunity of quoting on this job, for which we hope later to supply the equipment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBEATTY BROS.

F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have had a second visit from Rev. D. J. Graham, Deputy Principal, at Birtle. He is well pleased with progress being made.\n\n(1) Re Laundry Walls.\n\nRev. D. J. Graham asked if walls will be plastered and suggests that the walls should be done with cement. He also thinks that boy's and girl's recreation rooms should be similarly done in cement. As this will cost no more I await your approval of same.\n\n(2) Re Plan of Dairy.\n\nRev. D. J. Graham noticed that workmen have to pass through dairy to get to pump room and asked what could be done to overcome this. I showed him that stair down to boiler room could be moved forward four or five feet; landing extended; door cut through wall into pump room; door between dairy and pump room closed up; same door being used. I found that the form work for stair is constructed and have stopped concrete pouring until you consider these suggestions.\n(3) Re Rear Entrance to Boiler Room.\n\nElectric light is shown in vestibule. I suggest that it would be more serviceable to have another fixture outside above door for the convenience of the fireman at night.\n\n(4) Re Veranda Roof of Balcony to Boy's Class Room.\n\nNo rain water down pipe is shown on plan to take charge of rain water on this veranda roof. As this is a small balcony I suggest that a two inch galvanized down pipe on roof down corner and discharging into Weeping Tavern could be used.\n\nThese suggestions I mention for your consideration and approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDavid Henderson,\nClerk of Works.\n\nDH/MC\n## TRADES SUMMARY\n\n**Indian Residential School**\n\n**Bingie, Manitoba**\n\n| Description                                      | Amount     |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Excavation and Concrete                          | $12,691.00 |\n| Masonry and Brickwork                            | $32,503.00 |\n| Carpentry                                        | $4,210.00  |\n| Cut Stone and Setting                            | $9,800.00  |\n| Structural Steel, Joists & Reinforcing           | $17,452.00 |\n| Miscellaneous Iron and Steel                     | $4,210.00  |\n| Millwork and Glass                               | $7,300.00  |\n| Hardware                                         | $700.00    |\n| Roofing and Sheet Metal including Lavatory Partitions | $4,000.00 |\n| Plumbing and Heating                             | $19,295.00 |\n| Electric Wiring                                  | $2,825.00  |\n| Window Blinds                                    | $300.00    |\n| Painting                                         | $2,100.00  |\n| Plastering                                       | $9,744.00  |\n| Laundry Machinery                                | $2,770.00  |\n\nTotal: $130,000.00\n## TRADES SUMMARY\n\n**INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL**\n\n**BIRTLE, MANITOBA**\n\n| Description                                      | Amount     |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Excavation and Concrete                          | $12,691.00 |\n| Masonry and Brickwork                            | $32,803.00 |\n| Carpentry                                        | $4,210.00  |\n| Cut Stone and Setting                           | $9,600.00  |\n| Structural Steel, Joists & Reinforcing           | $17,452.00 |\n| Miscellaneous Iron and Steel                     | $4,210.00  |\n| Millwork and Glass                               | $7,300.00  |\n| Hardware                                         | $700.00    |\n| Roofing and Sheet Metal including Lavatory Partitions | $4,000.00 |\n| Plumbing and Heating                             | $19,295.00 |\n| Electric Wiring                                  | $2,925.00  |\n| Window Blinds                                    | $300.00    |\n| Painting                                         | $2,100.00  |\n| Plastering                                       | $9,744.00  |\n| Laundry Machinery                                | $2,770.00  |\n\n**Total:** $150,000.00\nSeptember 19, 1930\n\nR. Guerney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Indian School\nBirtle, Manitoba\n\nReplying to your letter of September 17th we enclose herewith our Trade Summary showing how our contract is made up.\n\nWe are rather short handed in the office for a few days, and the writer also expects to be away from the city returning possibly the end of next week. The detailed estimate, as requested, will be attended to as soon as possible after that time. We trust, however, the Trade Summary enclosed will be of some service to you in the meantime.\n\nSometime ago we wired the Department about getting in sewer and water service. To date we have not heard anything about it. The water supply will be difficult to obtain as soon as the frosty nights set in. In the meantime we have a thousand feet of pipe line from the railway water tank, but as soon as the nights are frosty, and this may occur any time, we shall probably be in trouble with it. Is it possible for a permanent water supply to be attended to without further delay?\n\nThe plumbing and heating contractor has taken some plant on the job which need electric current. We shall also need temporary lights. We have been trying to get some local information as to the running of a supply line, but were not successful in getting anything done. May we ask if this can be attended to at an early date, as it will be impossible to open School without it, and we would certainly appreciate the use of both water and light as early as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnc.\nSept. 15th 1930.\n\nF.H.

You will note that we have to cross over the twenty-six inch I-Beam. This I-Beam is three inches clear of the bottom of concrete slab. I take it to be that this duct will pass along hard-up to bottom of I-Beams which means two feet five (2'5\") or two feet six (2'6\") below ceiling. This will make it about a foot above the head of the door frame.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear if this is satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDavid Henderson,\nClerk of Works.\n\nDH/MC\nSept. 23, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 28th ultimo with reference to the water supply and sewerage system for the new Birtle School, I would ask you to kindly obtain prices for the installing of the septic tank and drainage system from Mr. H.

Radiator shown is down below ground floor level. To overcome this we would have to vent this radiator and connect to Wet return. Mr. Swan, on visit today, suggested increasing width of vestibule at floor level by forming a six inch ledge taking six inches off width of parlour, three inches off office and three inches off Principals room to make up other six inches.\n\nSteam-fitter informs me that shipment of radiators are on the way. I suggested to put wall radiator against present wall at floor level without enlarging vestibule but steam-fitter informs me that they have no wall radiator coming.

Gurney Orr Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Orr;\n\nRe: Birtle Indian School.\n\nOn Tuesday the 16th I received a telegram from Mr. Gow of the Dominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau, asking that I meet him in Birtle to discuss the water supply for the School. On Friday we met there and went over the matter at some length. The actual scheme for the water supply I need not go into here as Mr. Gow will undoubtedly have sent the Department a full report. What I do want your approval of is the using of certain rooms and the consequent changes in part of basement layout. To show this more clearly I have outlined the basement plan and indicated in red the portions that will be effected.\n\nWith the proposed scheme it will be necessary to house a pressure tank, a chlorinator, a filter (similar to Gordons) and pump. These can well go into the rooms marked as Dairy and Pump Rm., and we could place the Dairy in some other place; maybe in one of the two suggested places indicated on my sketch. May I mention in this regard that for the way in which they use this room it would be more convenient next to the Kitchen or Dining Rm.\n\nIf you adopted suggestion No. 2 on the plan it might be as well to eliminate the corridor into the Dining Rm.\n\nI see no real hardship in having to take the domestic coal down the rear entrance and into room indicated in suggestion No. 1. This will be carried into the kitchen in scuttles.\n\nI am sending a copy of the enclosed sketch to Mr. Gow and also to Mr. Henderson on the job.

Birtle Indian School\n\nOn Tuesday the 16th I received a telegram from Mr. Gow of the Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau, asking that I meet him at Birtle to discuss the water supply for the School. On Friday we met there and went over the matter at some length. The actual scheme for the water supply I need not go into here as Mr. Gow will undoubtedly have sent the Department a full report. What I do want your approval of is the using of certain rooms and the consequent changes in part of the basement layout. To show this more clearly I have outlined the basement plan and indicated in red the portions that will be affected.\n\nWith the proposed scheme it will be necessary to house a pressure tank, a chlorinator, a filter (similar to Gordons) and pump. These can well go into the rooms marked as Dairy and Pump Room, and we could place the Dairy in some other place; maybe in one of the two suggested places indicated on my sketch. May I mention in this regard that for the present way in which they use this room it would be more convenient next to the Kitchen or Dining Room. If you adopted suggestion No. 2 on the plan it might be as well to eliminate the corridor into the Dining Room.\n\nI see no real hardship in having to take the Domestic Coal down the rear entrance and into rooms indicated in suggestion No. 1. This will be carried into the Kitchen in scuttles.\n\nI am sending a copy of the enclosed sketch to Mr. Gow and also to Mr. Henderson on the job. Will you wire both of them your decision in the matter of changes so that the least amount of delay may occur?\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n(W. Swan)\n\nIndian Affairs.

They wrote me today that as far as the sound systems are concerned, they have the contract for the building from your Dept. at Ottawa, but there is no sound system equipment specified for the above building. They say they have no control over installations of this kind. So I again ask you whether you have the intention of equipping this building with a sound system as we are specialists and would be in a position to give you plans and specifications, also prices for an installation of this kind if you wished.

The Canadian Pacific Railway Company maintains a pumping plant on the creek bank and pumps water to their water tank adjoining the railway nearly one mile distant. The pumping plant is modern, efficient and when traffic is heavy about 80,000 to 100,000 gallons of water are pumped daily, the tank being filled at least twice daily. The new school is located approximately 1,600 feet from the railway water tank. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company has agreed to supply water for the new school upon the following general terms:\n\n(1) The water supply to be drawn from their water tank and not from their pipe line.\n\n(2) The water supply pipe connection to the pipe line to the school to extend at least 7'-0\" above the bottom of their water tank so that at no time can the school drain the railway tank.\n\n(3) The water supply to the school to be metered and water used to be paid for at the rate of 25 cents per 1,000 gallons.\n\n(4) The meter to be supplied by and installed at the expense of the school and all pipe connections to the water tank are to be made at no expense to the Railway Company.\n\n(5) The Railway Company does not accept responsibility for any deficiency in the water supply.\n\nPurity of Supply.\n\nThe water will require to be filtered and chlorinated for domestic use.\nPROPOSED WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM\n\nGeneral.\n\nThe following elevations are to be noted,\n\nElevations being to sea level datum:\n\nConcrete base of C.P.R. water tank ........ 1707.25\nBottom of water tank ....................... 1725.25\nMaximum water level in tank (full) ....... 1740.25\nOutlet to school pipe line ................. 1732.25\nBasement floor of new school .............. 1694.00\nWater services in basement of school ...... 1697.00\n\nWith the water level in the water tank standing at elevation 1732.25 there would be a 35.25 foot head, less loss of head due to friction in the pipe line, on the water services in the basement of the school, so that if other conditions permitted a gravity water supply would be possible to the water services in the basement of the school where it is estimated 75 percent of the water supply will be used. Unfortunately there are other conditions that do not permit of a dependable water supply in the basement under the gravity system. When the water level in the railway tank drops below elevation 1732.25, as it will probably frequently do, no water is available for the school pipe line and as a short time would suffice to drain the water in the pipe line the school would be without water until such time as the Railway Company again filled their water tank. The domestic water supply must be chlorinated and to operate efficiently there must be a water pressure of at least 20 pounds per square inch on the feed pipe to the chlorinator and this pressure is not obtainable with a gravity system. There is apparently no necessity for chlorinating the water supply for the laundry or toilets and it is possible to\nsupply these services in the basement by gravity, except during those intervals when the water supply in the railway tank drops below 1732.25. I would, however, point out that the only advantage of a partial gravity system would be the considerable saving in pumping costs, but that this saving would not compensate for the inconvenience caused by lack of water supply for a few hours every now and then. Accordingly, I would recommend that the whole water supply for the school building be supplied through a pressure tank system. To ensure that the school would always have a day's water supply available it will be necessary to install a 5,000 gallon tank in the immediate vicinity of the school and preferably underground.\n\nProposed Installation.\n\nThe proposed installation for the water supply to the new school is as follows:\n\n(1) A 3\" meter to be installed in the enclosure under the Canadian Pacific Railway water tank.\n\n(2) 1,650 feet of 2\u00bd\" wrought iron pipe line running from the water tank through the meter to a 5,000 gallon storage tank.\n\n(3) A cylindrical storage tank 6' 6\" diameter and 25' 0\" long, capacity 5,000 gallons and designed for a working pressure of 20# per square inch, heads to be 5/16\" plate, flanged and dished, shell 1/4\". The tank will be equipped with 11\" x 15\" manhole and all seams stitch rivetted and electrically welded. This tank will be placed 5' 0\" underground and immediately adjacent to the rear of the pump and boiler rooms.\n(4) One 1,500 gallon per hour self-oiling Typhoon pump, motor driven and mounted upon the same base as the 3 H.P. motor. The intake will be directly from the 5,000 gallon storage reservoir.\n\n(5) The discharge from the pump will be through a short length of piping to the water filter, (similar in design and capacity to the filter in the Gordon School, Saskatchewan.\n\n(6) From the filter the discharge will be directly into a 1,200 gallon pressure tank. This tank will be 4' 0\" diameter and 16' 0\" long and similar to the tank installed in the Brandon School. The pressure range in this tank will be between 50 and 100 pounds, which range is sufficient to meet all requirements.\n\n(7) A small motor driven air compressor will be installed to maintain an adequate air pressure within the pressure tank.\n\n(8) The discharge from the pressure tank will lead through the chlorinator. This chlorinator will probably be similar to the one in operation at the Cecilia Jeffrey School at Kenora. If it is so desired the water supply for the toilets and laundry room need not pass through the chlorinator but might be taken directly from a second outlet connection from the pressure tank.\n\nWater Supply for Farm Buildings\n\nThe farm buildings will probably be located about 500 to 600 feet from the school and on slightly higher ground. It is proposed to lay a 1\u00bd\" pipe line from the 5,000 gallon storage tank to the cattle barn with 1\" piping from this line to other buildings. There will be\nsufficient pressure to ensure a gravity system to these buildings during the greater portion of the time.\n\n**Fire Protection**\n\nThe stand-pipes in the school will connect with the pressure tank system, giving a very limited amount of fire protection.\n\n**Estimates of Cost.**\n\n| I. - Meter.                                      |        |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 3\" Empire meter P.O.B.

Swan, of Punnichy, Saskatchewan, at Birtle, this meeting being arranged at my request in order that I could discuss with him the most suitable water supply system for the school. This report being forwarded conforms very closely to the scheme discussed and decided upon at the meeting between Mr. Swan and myself. There will probably be some alterations that you will desire made and it may be possible that we will not be able to follow out the proposals as outlined in this report.\n\nThere will be considerable excavation work to be done in connection with the water supply and sewage disposal plants and I would strongly urge that the work on these two systems be not delayed. This work I believe could be most economically done by the present contractors building the school, either on a cost plus 10% basis or on a cost plus a fixed sum. Personally, I prefer the latter alternative.\n\nWe are hoping to have made available for the water supply installation the two rooms shown on your school plans as pump room and dairy room. I understand that Mr. Swan has written to you with reference to having these two rooms made available for the water supply installation. The estimates included in this report were based upon the assumption that these two rooms will be made available for the water supply installation.\n\nI would appreciate having your views on the proposed lay-out and if it is your desire to have this work done under the direction of this office I would appreciate have authority at as early a date as possible to have the work put under way.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.

E. Stead at Neepawa, and Mr. William Dalton of the same place, and that when prices have been obtained, to arrange to have the work started immediately by the party quoting the lowest price.\n\nFurthermore, with reference to the Water Supply System for the building, that when the plans are completed for this work, to obtain prices from the above mentioned parties and forward them to the Department, and await further instructions.\n\nI also wish to acknowledge receipt of your telegram of September 26th as follows:\n\n\"Reference my letter twenty third offer installation sewerage system Birtle School to William Dalton on proven cost plus ten percent basis, if he declines work offer to H.

Signed \"A. F. MacKenzie\".\n\nI wish to advise you that as instructed in your telegram, under date of September 26th, Mr. Dalton has been instructed to proceed with the installation of the Sewerage System for the Birtle School. In order to assist him in getting this work under way, and to secure the cooperation of the General Contractors at the school, I have detailed an Engineer from this office to accompany Mr. Dalton to Birtle, and to spend a few days there before turning the supervision of this work over to Mr. Henderson, Clerk of the Works.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nI may say that the detailed plans, showing the installation of the Water Supply System for the School will be forwarded to you tomorrow. No action has been taken whatsoever in obtaining quotations for this work from Mr. Dalton or Mr. Stead, nor is it proposed to do so in view of your telegram of September 27th. I am very strongly of the opinion that the installation of the Water Supply System should be let to the General Contractors of the School, inasmuch as the installation involves considerable alteration in the space allotted for the Water Supply Installation, and also for the plumbing of the building itself. The letting of this work to any other contractor involves considerable extra expense and also other complications.\n\nI would like to point out that the estimates already forwarded you, covering the installation of the Water Supply System, were based on the expectation that Clayton Brothers would be given this work on a cost plus ten percent basis, or cost plus fixed sum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.C. Dew\nActing District Chief Engineer.\nOctober 3, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI am today forwarding you, under separate cover, duplicate prints of a plan showing the proposed layout for the water supply system at the new Sirtle Indian School. This proposed layout shows what is considered essential for a dependable water supply in the School, and of course, the final location of equipment is subject to change if the arrangements, as shown, do not fit in with the general scheme of piping and plumbing within the building.\n\nNo attempt has been made on this plan, to show all fittings, such as check valves, globe valves, safety devices and etc., as we must be more or less governed by the suggestions of the mechanics superintending the installation of the chlorinator, filter, pumps and other machinery, as to the necessity and proper placing of these fittings.\n\nI have not had a plan prepared to show the proposed connection of our pipe line to the Canadian Pacific Railway's tank; inasmuch as it is proposed to have the Canadian Pacific Railway make this connection themselves, and install the meter in the enclosure under their water tank. At a later date, when the details of this connection have been ascertained, a plan will be prepared to show the details covering this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. R.

I am making a long box, built from two inch plank, six inches deep inside and twelve feet wide covered with two inch plank top, and all covered with Concrete leaving two man-holes, one inside front wall, the other half way down to boiler room so that same pipes could be disconnected and drawn out at boiler room in case of leak.\n\nNote: These two returns will pass through Concrete Stair leading down to boiler room, also door as shown at first riser. I will branch off here across Corridor and through room marked Store and into boiler room. The trench in Store could be covered up with Iron Grading, removable.

She drew my attention to two cross walls marked Vestry that no door is shown from Vestry on to platform. She thinks that a door from off platform to Vestry should be in each wall at rear. She thinks this is very inconvenient.\n\n(2) She drew my attention to Partition Wall between Kitchen and Dining Room of Principal's Residence. She thinks that a door should lead from Kitchen to Dining Room through this wall.\n\n(3) One door which could be dispensed with is in Large Stores in Basement. It has been suggested to put Stores where Staff Dining Room is and only one door will be necessary off Corridor next Kitchen, other door could be cut into wall between Kitchen and Dining Room, which would involve no extra expense.\n\n(4) Re Servery off Dining Room:\n\nShe thinks it is necessary to have a Service Opening, with sliding shutters, through wall between Servery and Dining Room. As Service Servery is\nbeing lined with White Glazed Brick it is necessary that we have an early reply, so that contractor can complete this wall.\n\nMr. Johnson, Assistant Engineer, Dominion Water Power Branch was here Wednesday and Thursday of last week Re Sceptic Tank. The work on this Tank commenced on Thursday afternoon.\n\nRe Plastering.\n\nI beg to draw your attention that no Angle Metal corner Beads are specified for Sharp Angles.

I also approve of your suggestions re the changes in the high pressure boiler.\n\nYou may arrange for the connecting up of power to the building with the Hydro system.\n\nWith reference to the Rev.

It is not considered that a detail is necessary as the fireplace is to be perfectly plain design with wood shelf on top. The fireplace is to be equipped with regular damper.\n\nWith reference to the radiation in the front vestibule it will be satisfactory to carry out Mr. Swan's suggestion or if arrangements can be made to install wall radiator same will be approved.\nThe cork insulation in the cold storage should be installed as provided in the specifications and I approve of your arrangement with regard to the doors.\n\nRegarding the cupboards, lockers, tables, etc. required for this building I would ask you to kindly consult with the Reverend Principal and forward to the Department rough sketches showing all equipment that it is suggested being built into the building. When this information is received you will be further instructed.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th you may arrange to have the doors provided from the vestries to the platform. You may also arrange to have a door provided between the kitchen and dining room in the Principal's residence. It is noted in paragraph 3 of your letter that one door can be dispensed with in the stores in the basement.\n\nIf the construction work is not too far advanced you may arrange to have a service opening provided between the servery and the dining room.\n\nWill you please instruct the contractor to provide metal corner beads where required in the plastering.\n\nYour suggestion regarding the trench for steam mains in the basement corridors is approved.\n\nThe Department accepts the price quoted by the contractors for the changes in the dairy as submitted in your letter of the 9th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

He has asked me to supply him with sketches of sizes on Implement sheds and Piggeries. This matter I am taking up with Mr. Lazenby and Mr. Graham as Colonel Mullins informs me that he thought no appropriation was taken out for the Implement sheds and Piggeries. He was to set in touch with Mr. Wurnby, Minister of Department of Interior.

It is necessary that a four inch vitrified tile drain be carried through each barn down into gully. Cow barn and horse barn will require eighty-six (86) feet of four inch vitrified tile. These drains, I am figuring to sink five feet deep. This is independent of Mr. Doig, contractors contract. I have asked Contractor Doig to submit estimate to put these drains in but leave this matter for your further consideration. It is necessary that these drains be put in before severe weather sets in, as barns cannot be used without drainage. An early reply will oblige.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDavid Henderson,\nClerk of Works.\n\nDH/MC\nBirtle, Manitoba,\nOctober 15th, 1930.\n\nA. F.

These buildings have been laid out different to Mr. Swan's and Mr. Gow's plans. The cow barn runs East and West, horse barn North and South, higher up and 150 feet East of cow barn. Your wire was shown to Mr. Gow on visit here today, cow barn is alright for water supply, horse barn being elevated four feet higher no water supply is called for.

F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Cow Barn & Horse Barn:\n\nI beg to draw your attention to Hay Loft Door for hay carriage, this door is called for six feet wide.\n\nI have had visit of Mr. Graham, Mr. Curry, Mr. Lazenby and Mr. Newsham, farm instructor, and all think this is a mistake for a six foot door. I have ordered H. Doig, contractor to make these doors eight feet wide for taking in hay.\n\nRe door entering cow and horse barn.\n\nThese are specified six feet wide. These gentlemen think one door of cow barn should be sliding door hung on tract, likewise more suitable in place of hinged doors in two halves. When unloading hay these doors cannot be opened or folded back to gable and they think it is only right that sliding doors be hung on one end of cow barn.\n\nI await your approval to this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDavid Henderson,\nClerk of Works.\n\nDH/MC\n\nIndian Affairs.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Horse Barn.\n\nNo water trough is called for. We have decided to place water trough on East end of cow and horse barn, outside for horses to drink, about nine feet long with water supply pipe passing through gable into trough with shut off valve inside to stop from freezing. This should be a metal trough. Contractor Doig has submitted an estimate of $30.00 for a trough nine feet long. I will be pleased to have your approval of same.\n\nRe Box Stalls in Cow Manger shown in these box stalls. They are not adapted for calves. These mangers call for Concrete mangers, low down. Mr. Graham, Mr. Curry, Mr. Lazenby and Mr. Newsom think that an ordinary trough about nine feet long across steel partitions dividing both box stalls similar to an ordinary wooden horse trough. You will note that plan shows door into stalls in centre of stalls. These doors are placed next cross partitions, which is as Beatty's standard fixtures call for. We are allowing three feet for door to swing in with a nine foot trough leading back to North and South. If there is a difference in troughs Concrete Mangers could be deducted from wooden mangers.\n\nRe Cow Barn. Plan shows front elevation of hay loft doors. We have no rear elevation of these gables. These men desire the two lower doors on one end and dispense with the hay loft door above as they only use one door for loading hay into loft, and peak\nof roof overhanging gable for carriage could be cut off and gable carried up plain. I have authorized an eight foot door to be made for loft and await your approval before these authorizations are carried out.\n\nRe Cow and Horse barn.\n\nI will be pleased to know what colours you will be painting sidings of these barns and also what colour for roof.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDavid Henderson,\nClerk of Works.\n\nDH/MC\nBirtle, Manitoba,\nNovember 21st, 1930.\n\nA.

Contractor Doig submitted an estimate of $30.00 for metal trough, also on Nov. 10 I wrote re Mangers for calves. Suggestions were made by Principal Curry for a wooden trough and box stalls for calves in place of mangers called for and position of same to be changed, also I wrote re colour to paint barns.\n\nOn Nov. 10 I wrote re hay loft doors. Plans on elevation shows six feet doors, these have been increased to eight feet wide. Still await approval.\n\nOn Nov. 10 I wrote re doors entering barns. Principal Curry would like one sliding door on tract to cow barn and horse barn. I may state that these doors are made. As these doors swing outwards they will stand in the way when putting hay in the loft. These two half doors could be put together with flat plates top and bottom with bolts to overhead tract.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDavid Henderson,\nClerk of Works.\nDec. 21st, 1930\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Burns has spoken to me about occupying the Cattle barns and as the barn will be ready this week except for the painting which couldn't be done satisfactory this weather, I suggest if arrangement could be made easy to take over the barns and hold back $500.00 for the painting on the other barns. It would be quite satisfactory to us.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nH.M. Doig\nBirtle, Manitoba, 1 Dec. 1930\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa - Can.\n\nHon Sirs -\n\nThe new cow barn at Birtle Indian School is about finished - (Silo & painting yet are not done) also a few doors to hang and windows to place. But it should be ready by the time I hear from you.\n\nNow our stock is all huddled up in broken down, unsanitary quarters and we would like to use the new cow barn at the earliest possible moment. I have spoken to Mr. Doig, the Contractor. He thinks it unlikely that he will be able to do painting until spring - But otherwise his work can be finished in very short time. He is willing that we begin using the new Cow barn at once.\n\nAnd I am writing to ask your permission and I am writing to ask your permission to do so - I think you should have Agent Layenby or some one else look it over and satisfy yourselves that the building is as required - as per plans & specifications, and if so kindly advise that we might start using same at once.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.B. Currie\nDEC. 5, 1930.\n\nSIR,\n\nA letter has been received from Mr. Currie, asking that he be allowed the use of the new barns at the earliest possible date.\n\nI understand that these buildings are practically completed, with the exception of painting, which will have to be left over until the spring. Kindly arrange with the contractor to allow Mr. Currie to use these barns as soon as the interior is completed.\n\nIt will be satisfactory, when all the work to be carried out at the present time, is completed to issue a certificate for same, holding back sufficient to complete the contract.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

You specified boiler room and laundry to be done in Black Japan, this is alright. You also say \"and as directed in other parts of the building\" I understand that plumbing pipes will be painted to match walls and ceiling of rooms throughout building.\n\nWith reference to hot water pipes and heating pipes I deem it advisable that these be done in brown as these pipes will not keep their colour, as a rule in the past I have had all hot water pipes etc done in brown for this purpose.\n\nI also note that bath rooms, lavatories, and corridors are specified to be enameled four feet high with Ivory finish but nothing specified for bedrooms, dining rooms, staff dining room, basement rooms and chapel. I would like to know if these rooms are to be enameled four feet high and done in similar manner. The recreation room walls have been plastered in Cement Finish, what colour required for these rooms. The Kitchen walls are enameled brick.

Dalton, of Neepawa, Manitoba, covering work done at the Birtle Indian Residential School; also accounts and pay-lists are enclosed, in triplicate.\n\nThese accounts are as submitted by Mr. Dalton, except that I have only allowed for him $1.12\u00bd per hour for time spent by him on the work, instead of $1.50 per hour as submitted by himself, and the 10% profit upon his own wages has not been allowed. There is still an outstanding account amounting to approximately $125.00, which will be forwarded to you as soon as received here properly receipted.\n\nI have had some discussion with Mr. Dalton over the rate of pay to be allowed him for the time spent on the work by himself. Mr. Dalton considers he is entitled to $1.50 per hour. The question of any payment to Mr. Dalton for supervision of the work did not arise at the time the contract was given to him. However, I consider that $1.12\u00bd per hour is a fair allowance for Mr. Dalton's time.\n\nI may say that the work was done in a satisfactory manner and that the accounts as submitted to you are considered fair and just, and I would request that a cheque for $182.82, made payable to the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Neepawa, for the account of W. H. Dalton, be forwarded to me as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing District Chief Engineer.\n\nEncs.\n\nE. A.

It is our intention to raise this old building and clear the ground. The suggestion as to how it might be used is so vague that it is difficult to deal with that aspect of the case, but I would be opposed on general grounds to maintaining this building, and it would hardly be in the interests of our work to have another institution in such close proximity to the school. Then the question arises,- why should the Dominion Government make a present of this building to the town of Birtle? It would be certainly very unusual. I am afraid the local people have not given this matter very careful consideration.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Up to date, Mr. Henderson has sent us a copy of the certificate, and we are wondering if the sending to us of what appears to be the original, is a new departure with the expectation that we will forward same to you.\n\nWe are, therefore, enclosing certificate, and would ask you, if none other has been received from Birtle, to kindly help facilitate the movement of the cheque through the office, so that we may receive it before the end of the current year. We would especially appreciate having it before the commencement of 1931. We would like to give our sub-contractors the benefit of all payment possible during the current calendar year.\n\nThe plastering is about completed, and we expect to start finishing right after Xmas.\n\nWishing you the Compliments of the Season, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnc.

Principal Curry wished a wooden trough twelve feet long braced along North and South wall for these calves and contractor Doig submitted his estimate but on Saturday on visit of Beatty Bros representative, he suggested converting two of the four box stalls for calves and putting up a combination steel rail across these two small stalls. This matter was discussed with Mr. Curry and he wishes to use this eighty dollars towards the expense of two combination stalls, as per contractor Doig's enclosed estimate. Mr. Curry is anxious to get a combination manager in place of wooden trough which will make a difference of sixty dollars extra.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Birtle Indian School\n\nThe finishing work at the School is being pushed with the expectation that all items of work under our contract will be completed in two or at the most three weeks from this date.\n\nDuring the last month there has been some conversations at Birtle which I think have reached our foreman from Mr. Henderson that in all probability there will be a number of interior fittings, etc., to be made. We would be very glad to be favored with the order for this work. It can be done now most economically, and in view of the number of men we have on the job can be completed very rapidly.\n\nI saw Mr. Curry yesterday, and was told by him how anxious they are to get out of the old building owing to its dilapidated state. We should be very pleased to co-operate to this end.\n\nMr. Curry, and some ladies who were looking over the School, mentioned very insistently to us the desirability of having the concrete floors painted. The floors are very good, but there is no question about there being a certain amount of dusting if they are not painted. May we suggest that the floors and the cement base be given one or two coats of suitable paint?\n\nThe finish of the corridor floors is \u00bc\" below that in the room, as a preparation for linoleum. May we have the order?\n\nThe platform of the Chapel is at present only 7\" above the main floor of the room. I was asked about the possibility of raising the platform in the Chapel by about a foot, and was requested to take this point up with you. Provision for entry into the rooms at the side of the platform can be made by either alternates.\nas shown on enclosed sketch.\n\nWe would be very glad to receive an order for any or all of the above mentioned items. We will give them careful and economical supervision and carry out the work for cost plus 10%. We would especially appreciate receiving an order for all the farther incidentals required around the building. We have, as you must be aware a very close price, and if this work is ordered it can be done without increasing the heating cost prior to it being taken over by the Government.\n\nAll other work around the building, such as sewer, water works, etc., which are usually made additions to the work of the General Contractor, have been awarded to outside parties, and we would, therefore, have a double appreciation in being allowed to finish off all other items of work.\n\nTrusting we may receive a favorable reply, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnclosure\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nBirtle, Manitoba.\n\nas any kind of outdoor work can be undertaken. And as the appropriation will not yet have been passed by Parliament. Also at that time of year horses cannot be secured to as good advantage as now. In view of our having so much extra work before us this year, would you give your approval for the purchase of this four horse team now or when same can be secured to advantage. I am not sure what Mr Lezenby's estimate for same was, but at this season good sound young horses can be had from $75.00 to $100.00 each, with harness for the four horses not to exceed in all $500.00\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH. B. Currie\nAs cement floors appear to be never free or dust, unless covered with linoleum or treated. Would it not be wise to have all uncovered cement floors painted? I believe the painted floor would be much more sanitary, it cannot be healthful to be constantly breathing a dust laden air. In addition the paint would add much to the appearance. I wish you would give this matter your consideration.\n\nAs the school is so near completion I think you might arrange to have the furnishing begin to arrive by the end of January. Then as a room is finished our Staff could begin to get things placed. As the floors are all cement, seats in the Class Room will have to be all screwed to a (two by four) under the feet of the seats. This will keep them in line and from shifting.\n\nThe platform in the Chapel is only about seven inches above the floor. If this platform were raised another foot it would make a great improvement.\n\nWill an engineer or fireman for the heating plant require to have a Second Class Certificate or would Third Class be sufficient? Also is it the intention of the Department to supply the Engineer or is the School/for Church to make the appointment?. We have many good applications for the position already.\n\nWhen Agent Lazenby sent in his estimates for 1931 I believe there was included in same, application for a four horse team, and harness for same. As this team will be needed early in the spring, just as soon\nHon. Sirs,\n\nThe new school under way, is rapidly nearing completion, from my best observation, I believe the Contractors, Claydon Construction Co., will finish their contract within three weeks. But there remains much work to be done, in the way of extras, or furnishings, such as built-in cupboards, wardrobes, pupils dining room tables, benches, shelving and a great deal of such equipment. In my mind this work should be under way right now. This extra work might be done while the building is in the contractors hands. As soon as the Contractors finish we will have to take the building and keep it heated, while this extra work is being done. Where extra work is put under way now it will be finished about the time the Contractors finish what is required of them. If this extra work is let to the Claydon Construction Co., all they will require is a few extra carpenters.\n\nWorking in conjunction with what is now employed. I am very satisfied with the work the Contractors are doing, they appear to select good men for each part of the work. Also the material used appears good dry first class quality. Most certainly that is the necessary material for Cupboards, wardrobes, tables, benches and even shelving, otherwise after drying out it shrinks, twists and looks unsightly. I have observed that when work is done with lumber out of the local lumber yards it dries out afterward. Their lumber may be just as good, and at some time has passed through the dry kill. But after months in the open sheds expands with moisture from the air, later contracting when exposed to heat.\nBirtle, Manitoba,\nJanuary 20th, 1931\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Cow Barn Ventilation\n\nVentilation throughout this barn has been carried out as per plan and sections. I wish to draw your attention to the fact that present ventilation in cow barn is not proving satisfactory. Cow barn is fully occupied with cattle and has been sweating for the last three weeks and ceiling is wringing wet throughout and doors are swollen. I feel that a change in ventilation is necessary. I think if the metal ducts passing along on the under side of floor between joists has a hole cut on both outside walls and a louver put in on outside wall at floor level would give more satisfactory results. Unclosed ventilation going up rafters do not seem to act properly. I think a louver on outside of frame\nat ceiling level would act better or boxes two feet square carried straight up through hay loft. These boxes would require to be about five feet at each side of centre of barn to allow for hay carrier. This would mean that these ducts should be carried straight across and louvers at each side. The metal boxes only go half way across but balance could be done with V-Joint ceiling at bottom of joist to close place up.\n\nPrincipal Curry is very much disappointed in this ventilation for this barn. I awaited three weeks to see how this ventilation would act and would be pleased to have your reply to same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDavid Henderson,\nClerk of Works.\nJanuary 17th, 1931\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nAs proposed by Mr. Henderson we beg to quote you the following Beatty Fixtures to be installed in the cow and horse barns:\n\n**In Cow Barn:**\n\n1. all steel Manure Carrier Bucket, track, swivel hangers, steel swing pole and everything complete for the sum of $149.60\n\n**In Horse Barn:**\n\n36 harness hooks, 1 blanket hook 2 implement hooks and 80' steel manger cap, installed complete for the sum of $88.80.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(H.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPrincipal Curry is very much disappointed that he is not receiving his steel manure carrier bucket in cow barn. I informed him that I would get prices and submit same to Ottawa for approval. I also enclose a copy of Contractor Doig's estimate for this work. You will note that he also requires harness hooks, implement hooks and manger caps to stop horses from chewing top end of manger.

The plastering is completed, and the interior finishers are at work. On instructions from the Department, I spent some time at the school compiling a detailed list of the furnishings that will be required. Mr. Rose, of the Dominion Water Powers Reclamation Branch at Winnipeg was at the school in connection with the installation of the water system. The system was tested throughout and all leaks and other defects were remedied. The Chlorinating plant, however, is not yet in operation, as it was thought advisable to leave this until some person had been employed to take proper charge of the work. The two barns are completed, and the cow barn is in use.\n\nP. G.
