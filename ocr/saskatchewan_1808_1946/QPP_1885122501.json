PETER'S, QU'APPELLE\n\nWill be held at Mr. McKeown's Hotel, Town of Qu'Appelle, on MONDAY, DEC. 28, 1885.\n\nPersons desiring to be nominated for the office of alderman, for the purpose of nominating seven aldermen, are requested to present their names to the undersigned at the office of the Secretary of the Council, Town Hall, Qu'Appelle, Dec. 17th, 1885.\n\nNOTICE\n\nThe undersigned hereby give notice that the North-West Central Rail Road Company, Limited, has been incorporated under the laws of Canada, and is now doing business as the North-West Central Rail Road Company, Limited, and is entitled to receive all the benefits of the Act of Parliament of Canada, passed July 13th, 1885.\n\nToronto, Nov. 20th, 1885.\n\nJAMES BEATTY,\nPresident of the N.W.C.R.C.\n\nAVIS\n\nA VIS is hereby given to all persons who may desire to purchase the land situated in the Township of Qu'Appelle, near the town of Qu'Appelle, which is being sold by the North-West Central Rail Road Company, Limited, at public auction, on December 28th, 1885, at the town hall, Qu'Appelle.\n\nMrs Stone & Murdock\n\nThe Qu'Appelle Skating Rink\n\nThe Largest and Best Ice Rink west of Winnipeg, for skating and hockey.\n\nJOHNSTON & GORRELL,\nQu'Appelle, Dec. 28th, 1885.\nMR. G. B. Laycock has just put in under indictment against him by sending us the Apalachee Pioneer, the hire number of which was published on 1 July last. We are informed that Mr. Laycock is also in the same boat as Mr. Mitchell. We may say that he must have been very much mistaken if he thought that by printing this paper he could escape the law. As Mr. Mitchell can produce the evidence before the court, no doubt Mr. Laycock will be found guilty and punished accordingly.\n\nIn conclusion, we would urge upon all our readers the utmost caution in reading newspapers, especially those from distant places, and to make sure they are authentic before believing anything printed therein.\n\nPublisher's Notice\n\nOUR RATES\n\nSubscription rate, $1.00 per annum, payable in advance.\n\nSubscription price, $1.00 per month, payable in advance.\n\nBusiness card, $25 per month, payable in advance.\n\n\"LEADER\" NOT LEADING\n\nThe regular leader of The Leader previous to December 10th would form the impression that the paper might come to be a champion of the interests of the settlers in the Northwest, but on reading the issue of that paper of the above date, he must have turned it over several times and must feel it is not leading by any means. Having satisfied himself on that point; his preconceived ideas of that paper as the advocate of the people's interests, must have been rudely dispelled. In preparing their address in reply to Lieutenant-Governor's speech, the Northwest Council gave expression to certain sentiments held almost universally by the settlers in the province. While desirous of doing so in an exclusively vigorous manner, they must have realized that such a course must necessarily lead to serious complications growing out of the present uncertain state of affairs. Not only must their words cut deep into the heart of many who do not agree with them, but their actions must also be watched with suspicion. The regular readers of The Leader will notice that in its recent issues there has been a noticeable change in the style of writing. Instead of the usual dull and tame articles, we find now fresh and vigorous expressions which cannot fail to attract attention. The reasons given for these changes are not clear at this juncture, but they seem to indicate a new spirit prevailing among the editors of the paper.\n\nCorrespondence\n\n[For want of time and space the following letter was not held over until this issue.]\n\nMAGISTRATE'S COURT\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nSir: Permit me through the medium of your journal to reply to Mr. Vodina's article of the 26th ultimo, under the signature \"A Voice,\" so far as I am concerned at the last examination. It seems that the witnesses were made to swear before a Justice of the Peace that they had seen me in company with the said Mr. Fisher, and I believe that if I had been there it would have been more proper to have had both of us sworn as witnesses rather than to have sworn separately.\n\nMR. G. B. Laycock has just put in under indictment against him by sending us the Apalachee Pioneer, the hire number of which was published on 1 July last. We are informed that Mr. Laycock is also in the same boat as Mr. Mitchell. We may say that he must have been very much mistaken if he thought that by printing this paper he could escape the law. As Mr. Mitchell can produce the evidence before the court, no doubt Mr. Laycock will be found guilty and punished accordingly.\n\nIn conclusion, we would urge upon all our readers the utmost caution in reading newspapers, especially those from distant places, and to make sure they are authentic before believing anything printed therein.\n\nElectric Killing.\n\nAnother possible application of electrical current by means of bent needles is described in an appearance given by Mr. George L. Fox, of London, to the Australian Electrician. Referring to the subject of animals, he says:\n\n\"It seems to me exceedingly promising. In Australia there are large numbers of cattle, sheep, and horses that are killed annually by electric shocks. At present, however, this method of killing is used only on rare occasions.\"\n\nAs psychologists insist that the human body requires about one millisecond of a second for the brain to react to an electric shock, Mr. Fox believes that the animal is therefore able to perceive the intensity of the shock and consequently avoids the full impact of the current.\n\nAccording to Mr. Fox, the animals have become accustomed to the frequent applications of low-voltage shocks, and are therefore less susceptible to the effects of higher voltages. This discovery has opened up possibilities for the use of electric shocks in various fields, including agriculture and industry.\n\nWhile the method is still in its early stages, Mr. Fox hopes that it will provide a humane alternative to currently used methods of animal handling and slaughter.\n\nProtest.\n\nMr. J. C. Laycock has just put in under indictment against him by sending us the Apalachee Pioneer, the hire number of which was published on 1 July last. We are informed that Mr. Laycock is also in the same boat as Mr. Mitchell. We may say that he must have been very much mistaken if he thought that by printing this paper he could escape the law. As Mr. Mitchell can produce the evidence before the court, no doubt Mr. Laycock will be found guilty and punished accordingly.\n\nIn conclusion, we would urge upon all our readers the utmost caution in reading newspapers, especially those from distant places, and to make sure they are authentic before believing anything printed therein.\n\nRichardson.\n\nRichardson.\n\nRichardson.\n\nRichardson.\nOUR TERMS.\n\nWe have placed our yearly subscription at the low rate of One Dollar, with the object of enforcing advance payment. We can much better afford to publish a paper at that price when we know that every paper which is paid for, than that we risk the chance of collecting accounts at a higher figure.

E. Munro of Rapid City, while unloading machinery at Maxwell & Co.'s warehouse here, was severely injured by a falling pipe and cut the flesh of his face close to the eye. He received an ugly gash.\n\nWould not it be well for our citizens to take one more vote petitioning the Dominion Parliament to grant the same charter to the Northern Central Railroad Co., as it appears to be in a position to go on with the building of the road early in the spring?\n\nFACTS AND FIGURES.\n\nMore than a hundred thousand acres of sugar-beet land is planted in Mani- toba this year, according to reports.\n\nThe average life of a locomotive is thirty years. During its service, it is said, it will travel about 300,000 miles.\n\nLast season in Texas the ex- ploits of a gang of thieves who stole 600,000 acres was disposed of in a lump sum of $25,000.\n\nThe manufacture of carriages and buggies requires a large amount of capital, keen hands, and yield a good profit. The cost is $4,252 per annum.\n\nAgricultural statistics show that the production of wheat and flax exceeds the demand. If poor crops, however, the prices will fall, and the prices of agricultural products will rise.\n\nOne man employs twenty-four stevedores in loading grain from the Mediterranean coast into New York vessels. Twenty-five of these are passenger vessels whose cargoes consist entirely of fruit. The other vessels are loaded with grain, which is composed mostly of rice.\n\nThe 2,000 women mills in the province employ 10,000 women workers, and pay for it $1,000,000 annually. The wages paid are worth $500,000 annually, and the women work from nine to five, and earn a dollar a piece. More than half of the women working in the mills are employed in the weaving department, and the wages paid are considered cheap.\n\nA Father Rebuked.\n\nColonel McClelland, although not a hard man, had a habit of beating his wife in the interview with his family. On returning to his home from his place of business, he found his wife crying. His wife very much excited over the occurrence, and told him that she was being mistreated with the usual force and severity. Colonel McClelland, however, was most outrageous manner, though he had been away but ten years old. When you heard that woman crying, you thought she was crying because she was afraid, or was she crying because she was hurt? You thought she was crying because she was afraid, or was she crying because she was hurt? You thought she was crying because she was afraid, or was she crying because she was hurt?\n\nJohnny unconsciously administered a severe beating to his wife, who never again spoke to his wife as if he were a trained animal.\n\nCorinthian Lodge No. 15\n\nW.
