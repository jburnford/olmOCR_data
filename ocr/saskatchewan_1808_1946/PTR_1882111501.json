He traveled by land and water, and after seven weeks' absence, arrived back in Prince Albert on September 2nd.\n\nMr. Smith's journey began by taking the train from Winnipeg to Brandon, where he joined a steamer bound for Edmonton. The steamer reached Edmonton on August 1st, and Mr. Smith then proceeded by rail to Prince Albert, where he arrived on August 3rd.\n\nDuring his stay in Prince Albert, Mr. Smith visited various points of interest, including the Prince Albert Museum, the Prince Albert Art Gallery, and the Prince Albert Public Library. He also attended several social events, including a dinner given in his honor by the Prince Albert Chamber of Commerce.\n\nOn September 2nd, Mr. Smith left Prince Albert by train for Winnipeg, where he arrived on September 4th. His journey back to Winnipeg was uneventful, and he returned to his home in Prince Albert on September 5th.\n\nThroughout his journey, Mr. Smith kept a diary, which he later published in the Prince Albert Times. The diary provides a detailed account of his travels, including descriptions of the scenery, the people he met, and the adventures he experienced.\n\nIn conclusion, Mr. Smith's journey was a memorable one, and he returned to Prince Albert with many fond memories of his time away.\nTHE PRINCE ALBERT TIMES.\nWEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1882.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT'S FUTURE\n\nThe railway, which has set in towards the North-west Territories during the past summer, and which will in all probability set in with increased force during the incoming year, is subject to materially concern the people of this locality. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company will make gigantic efforts to place settlers on the lands immediately contiguous to the line of the railway. The lands, together with the homestead lands in belts A and B, are comparatively easy of access, and are likely to be chosen in preference to those farther south, where the railway service effect is made by the endless series of emigrants to the advantages which Prince Albert possesses over many of the places to the south and west of it.\n\nTo the farming community Prince Albert offers a soil that has not been passed in any part of the North-west Territories. The usual homestead and pre-emption can be secured, and in addition to this the old numbered sections can be obtained for twenty-five dollars per acre, without subjecting the purchaser to the settlement duties required in the railway belt. The town itself will not only be the market place for the surrounding farmers, but it will also be the commercial center distributing point for the neighboring settlements at the South Branch, Carre River, Stony Creek, Shell River and other places which, with the farming country (formerly an area equal in extent to the Province of Nova Scotia) will be settled in a few years.\n\nAs a mere mission station of the Episcopalian and Protestant Churches, and a trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company, has within the last few years risen to be a populous town containing about thirty-two stores, two grist mills, three sawmills, a planing mill, and a large number of other such industries as are required to supply the needs of settlers. The two competing lines of railways, which will be completed to this point next summer, therefore, the River Navigation Company will give us direct communication with the Eastern Provinces, while the proposed Hudson's Bay route will, if found practicable, place Prince Albert at an imperceptible distance, and a more advantageous position than that of any other town in Manitoba or the North-west Territories. Although considerably north of the line of railways, we are on the latitude of Dublin, Liverpool and Berlin, and nearly five hundred miles south of Christiania, Stockholm and St. Petersburg, and other European cities which are not usually regarded as being in the same latitude north. Situated as it is in the best farming land in the North-west Territories, and possessing a salubrious climate, immense timber, mining and agricultural resources, and excellent shipping facilities, Prince Albert must ere long be one of the most important cities in the Dominion of Canada, and it is only necessary that these facts should be made known to find them fully appreciated.\n\nDrs. J. Smith and J. Smith received as under from Mr. Wible for Xmas Cards. J. O. Davis arrived by the mail on Tuesday; he reported to me to be very sleepy and ill.\n\nMr. Fitzgerald Cochran, Barrister, has received a commission by the mail, as Solicitor for Lord Governor Dowding, of the North West.\n\nWe understand that from advice received by the Government they are progressing favorably with regard to railway matters. Satisfactory arrangements have been made for the coming winter, and there is now no doubt but that the work will be vigorously prosecuted in the spring.\n\nDEATH OF E. W. CLAUS.\n\nWe very much regret to hear of the death of an old fellow-countryman, Mr. E. W. Claus, who lately resided at the Great River, near Prince Albert. He was formerly a composer on the Toronto Telegram; also on the Winnipeg Sun. Claus was a man of great kindness, so that his death was not altogether unexpected. He died on the 14th of October, and was survived by his wife and three children, to whom he was very dear, being only twenty-six years old. The funeral was largely attended, and he was buried at the Masonic Order, the deceased being a Member of Rhodesian Lodge, of Toronto.\n\nMrs. Smith, wife of Mr. E. Smith, of the firm of Davis & Smith, arrived yesterday.\n\nSaskatchewan Curling Club.\n\nA meeting will be held at the store of Mr. Davis & Co., Fort Qu'Appelle, at 10 o'clock, for the purpose of organizing for next winter.

Lynn Hilton, author of \"A Taste of Goryon,\" \"The True History of Jackanoum Buidman,\" Etc.\n\nCHAPTER III.\u2014Continued.\n\nOn which she shook off her hair from her face, then stuck her shoulder into the window frame, and looked out at the sea.\n\n\"Gordon, could you think so meanly of me as that?\"\n\n\"No, it was not like you, certainly.\"\n\n\"And Patricia?\" \"But people do say things sometimes, you know.\"\n\n\"I think I should ever do any thing quite so silly as that,\" he said.\n\nOn which she laughed again, and said,\n\n\"Now, then, let us go.\"\n\nPresently the Captain, who had finished his coffee, came to the saloon and sat down by Patricia.\n\n\"Hullo, Gordon; where have you been all this time?\" he said.\n\n\"That's just what I have been asked,\" said Patricia.\n\nNot that she had in words, but he, plumply ignoring the question.\n\nTo London, sir,\" said Gordon, with a look up at the face framed in the scarlet letters.\n\n\"Ay, and what may you have been doing there, boy?\"\n\n\"It is only a misunderstanding bit of family business, on my coming of age,\" said Gordon. \"Lawyers and deeds, and no end of fees to pay and money to be saved.\"\n\n\"Lawyers' sharks,\" said Captain Kemball with a shoulder.\n\nHe was an enlightened old gentleman, though he was a good one; and so he chided his superstitions.\n\n\"I fancied,\" said Gordon, \"that the young man would be able to make a lot of trouble to have a fellow at one's feet, who knew nothing of any kind, and who seemed so jolly for his school.\"\n\n\"It is like telling fortunes by the stars,\" said Captain Kemball, shrugging his shoulders. \"I have seen Mr. Fletcher, who has been my housekeeper for three generations, at least not that man, but the house.\"\n\n\"I thought three generations a long time to last,\" laughed Patricia.\n\nShe had come back to the table, where they were talking, and was studying now by the door. She had buried her head and put her hands behind her neck in order to contemplate the exquisite height of a bright ribbon of ribbon about her throat and a bunch of flowers of some sort.\n\nAnd as she stood there she made a picture of rare beauty, and there was something very pure in her looks, though they were ever so much more than just that.\n\n\"My most mind our backs; now the pride's abroad\u2014oh, thank you,\" said the Captain, looking at her proudly.\n\nAnd Gordon said \"Yes,\" with full meaning.\n\n\"I am glad you know the Fletcher's,\" said the Captain. \"One of our friends to be a good hunter. There is a Catherine Fletcher too,\" he added, looking with an old kind of expression at Patricia, who had been a lady in her young days. All Millwood was made after her. She had been Henry Beaver's first love, and had been known to him, work and play, despite the trials and difficulties overcome, and a noble life's work nobly begun, that she could not have been happy. She had had such glorious fruits already, and was to be hoped for still; also, if she could have kept Gordon \"modeling,\" away his youth at Barnards, Pleasant Valley, and elsewhere, she might have been when she knew about the country or her language, ill-glamored poor, or been up against the world. But she had never heard that a life of loneliness, though ever so delightful, was not the right thing for her. She had never heard the belief that for his good she could conquer her own desires, and even repulse at the same time the claims of those whom she loved.\n\nIt had been his, he goes as long as he would, she was ever entirely loyal to him, and she would have never for her sake, nor for anyone else, nor even for her brother in his need, always kept him in her general care in her heart, and her thought, and her belief, and her intentions.\n\nShe had known as young things of the soul she had never like other, without favor or introspection. She scarcely could remember actually having thought of her past part of her life, and she also did not love him as much as she loved her uncle generally. It was not a fact; just as much as sisterhood or daughterhood is a fact. Gordon was the great man, whom she had said that she had said all.\n\nAnd yet, this time, it had been confirmed by the sight of her, and had been a real change in their relations. It was not coldness by no means of coldness, but just a feeling of which they were a little afraid to speak, and as if they felt both that they must keep from each other, that they needed something to keep them apart, that they must be. But it was not a slight change that Patricia was resolved to meet.\n\nThe Captain seemed to struggle against the shadowy influence in the best way he could, the joyous presence, and the thought that his name was unknown between them still went on, and the visit of the bright young man to his friend's at home was a thing he must avoid.\n\n\"What news when you join?\" asked Captain Kemball, looking at Patricia; and Gordon looked at him.\n\n\"In three days,\" he said, and turned his face toward the sea.\n\n\"Oh, Gordon!\" said Patricia, as though she had been reminded of something, and she knew that he must be going.\n\n\"We shall meet again,\" said Gordon, and Patricia said nothing; she knew that he must be going.\n\n\"Yes, perhaps,\" said the Captain, looking up at the star; \"you don't know what it is like to keep awake on a dark night, and feel yourself isolated from the world, and knowing that they are thinking of you, and feeling their blessed hearts so pitiful.\"\n\nIt was hard lines for the poor fellow who has no one out to meet him, a friend to talk to, and for whom nothing can't carry on. So you'll please keep on being sorry, Patricia, do you hear?\"\n\n\"Yes, Gordon,\" I thought,\" Patricia said, and her hand lay on her uncle's shoulder. \"We must you hear,\" said Gordon; \"we must you hear.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Patricia, \"there isn't anything that can't carry on.\"\n\nThere aren't things to do, don't you see? Isn't there this thing, within your soul, that you take away the last of the sunshine at the time. However, the sigh meant resignation, and what must be done, by and by.\n\nDon't make a Molly of him, Patricia,\" said the old Captain, going into the room; and the old Captain, going into the room, said that he had seen many memorials in his life, but he had seen many memorials in his life, but he had seen many memorials in his life. Without knowing why, Patricia said herself feel grown pale, and an almost childlike fear came over her.\n\n\"I hear Sarah with the tea things, come and have some tea,\" she said abruptly.\n\n\"All right,\" she said, and the reply was not made by the Captain.\n\nAnd he always maintained that some-what lacking Landowners for the most part, looked down upon\u94c1\u8def\u4eba, and was of the opinion of being in the way on board the Mermaid, if a galley was used, and they had to dodges the wind by the side of the ship, as a man who uses one, came in absolute strength of muscle, as the best A.B. on the Admiralty.\n\nTo Be Continued.\n\nSS REDWOOD.\n\nStated from the Old Brick Store, on the evening of the 16th December, a party below deck, consisting of Messrs.

Men, women and children, forgetting all the sanctities at once, sprang off their pews and rushed out for the wreck. The good minister, being in the pulpit, and farther from the door, shouted to the rapidly dispersing auditors:\n\n\"Hold! hold! sisters and brethren, hold! For shame! Sit down but one moment!\"\n\nEverybody obeyed, whereupon, coming down from the pulpit, he walked down the aisle, looking up and still looking up impatiently to learn what the good man meant.\n\nAfter passing out of the door and to a point about fifty yards beyond, he turned to his flock, who were still in their seats.\n\n\"That's right, that's honest, that's all, brethren and sisters. Now let's all get an even start.\" And with that, and without further pause, he bounded off toward the wreath, galloping all his limbs to the scene of the wreck by 200 or 300 feet. That was what he called \"giving everybody an even start.\"\n\nBuy a Heintzman piano, and make home agreeable and pleasant.\n\nGEO. D. NORTHGRAVES,\nWatchmaker and Jeweller.\n\nA. L.
