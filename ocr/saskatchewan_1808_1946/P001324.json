Otter, with 320 troops, started to Poundmaker's reserve Friday afternoon. He arrived all right, and at 5.15 on Saturday morning began the advance in column of companies against Indians. Eight of our men were killed, and thirteen wounded. The attack was begun by the Indians suddenly, and it looked as if a trap had been set for us, into which we ran. The enemy was very strong; their numbers being estimated at six hundred, and they fought fiercely from cover, while we were comparatively open to their fire. They were fighting from the brow of a hill over a coulee. Five minutes after the first shot was fired we appeared to be completely surrounded, and most urgently called back to our own lines. We had just passed through a deep gully thickly wooded, and a swift stream running on one side. The men sent back\n\nand accomplished their object, thus lessening the danger of the situation. The fighting, which was all skirmishing, was over a large and uneven stretch of country, and the men were working under great disadvantage, but they stuck to it like heroes, and with bullets whistling in on them from almost every direction never flinched for an instant. Every corps continued steadily on the aggressive, and by 10 o'clock the enemy had almost silenced. They resumed again shortly, and the fighting was again heavy. The artillery, with two seven-pounders and the Gatling gun, did good work repeatedly by forcing the enemy from their cover, and at 11 o'clock the column was again almost completely in sight. Our force was again given orders to withdraw from its position of such disadvantage. The Indians, observing this, endeavored to cut off the retreat of the men. Our troops fought their way out inch by inch, the front always to the enemy. No praise is sufficient to describe the bravery of our officers and men. Every one showed himself a hero. Col. Otter, with his staff, was in every part of the field, and his orders were cool and decided as in a sham battle. The men were badly used up before the withdrawal began.\n\nOUR FORCE\n\nwas comprised of seventy-five mounted police and scouts, B. B. Brown's Ottawa Mounted Police, C. Conner's Infantry School, the Queen's Own Rifles, and Battleford Rifles. It is thought from thirty to sixty of the enemy were killed. The column returned to Battleford the same night. The wounded are all doing well.\n\nFollowing is the revised list of killed and wounded:\n\nKILLED.\n\nBATTLEFORD RIFLES.\nPRIVATE ARTHUR DODDS.\nGOVERNOR'S FOOT GUARDS.\nPRIVATE JOHN ROGERS.\nPRIVATE OSBORNE.\nINFANTRY SCHOOL CORPS.\nRUGGER FAWKES.\nNORTH-WEST MOUNTED POLICE.\nCORPORAL LOWAY.\nCORPORAL R.

HALL, in the shoulder.\nPRIVATE VANCE, in the shoulder.\nGEORGE WATTS, in the thigh.\n\nTHE OBJECT OF THE FIGHT.\n\nColonel Otter's object in going out with a flying column was simply to strike Poundmaker's camp and then to return. This was done with some success. Fifty tepees were destroyed by our shell and the woods and prairie having been fired as we moved off, Poundmaker's camp was literally burnt. We learned on Sunday that he moved his whole force further west, and that he now occupies a very strong position in a knot of buffaloes covered with scrub. On the north end of the reserve there was a lot of houses. These were either destroyed or badly shattered. At Eye Hill Creek, on the north side of the reserve, Poundmaker had placed ten mounted Indians, who were evidently looking out for a force coming in this way, as they took no part in the fight, but kept galloping up and down in an excited manner. No squaws or ponies were seen to go by. We knew the Indians had three or four hundred head of cattle and a large number of horses. Some of these were killed by our artillery fire. Large herds of cattle lay in the ravines scattered about, and could not doubt been stolen from settlers. According to all accounts the Indians have got all that part of the country clear, plundering and then firing the empty homesteads. There are some half-breeds among the Indians. One of them, wearing a grey shawl hat, was seen to be directing on our left. Major and Lieutenant Owen had charged with the buckshot at times, firing full hail, but fortunately it was nearly always short. The Indians had a much larger force than we supposed them to have when we started.\n\nFORT PITTS.\n\nEVACUATED, APRIL 15TH, 1885.\n\nInspector Dickens, who is a son of the great novelist, was in command at Fort Pitt. He succeeded in escaping with his party of policemen down the river to Battleford, and related the exciting events that occurred prior to the evacuation of the old wooden fortress. On Wednesday, April 15th, Big Bear and his followers arrived from Frog Lake and pitched their tepees in the valley near the fort. The news was received, and its capture was discussed, when a division arose as to whether or not it should be attempted. While these proceedings were going on, the party fired upon the two policemen, Losoya and Cowan, and the half-breed Quinn, who was returning from his hunting expedition. The garrison rallied to the rescue of their comrades and poured in volley after volley into the Indians, killing four and wounding twenty or thirty. Cowan was shot down, and under the very eyes of his comrades he died and was buried. The fate of Quinn, whose body was found and made off in an opposite direction, is unknown.\n\nMeantime Mr. McLean, factor of the Hudson Bay Company, went to the camp to have a talk with the chief, who expressed their friendship to the officials of the Hudson Bay Company. The Indians showed their hostility to the mounted police, and declared that they were going\n\nTO EXTERMINATE EVERY WHITE MAN\n\nbut the employes of the Hudson Bay Company. Mr. McLean was not allowed to return, but was assured that he would be well treated. His life, however, was in peril, and if his people were not immediately joined him. Under these circumstances, Mr. McLean had no other alternative than to submit. A letter, setting forth the situation, was addressed to his employes in the fort. The Company's people and civilians at once surrendered. A demand was then made for the police to give up their arms and be dealt with as\nBig Bear might see fit. Such a cowardly and treacherous overture was scornfully rejected by Inspector Dickens, who told the Indians that they could not hold the fort if even the last man was killed. Fearing that the stronghold could not be taken without great loss of life, the Indians agreed to allow the brave garrison to depart. Left to rely on themselves, they immediately equipped a boat, and landed at a place where ammunition and provisions in a scow and started down the Rapid river. The craft was water logged, twenty-one being constantly engaged bailing out the water, while two others kept the fire going. The boat did not break up well. The sufferings of the entire party until Battleford was reached were of a terrible character. The nights were invariably cold, the entire party having in their possession only three blankets.\n\nINSPECTOR DICKEN'S DETACHMENT.\n\nThe following composed the detachment which evacuated Fort Pitt:\n\nInspector F. W. Dickens.\nStaff Sergeant J. W. Ralph, M.D.\nSergeant Jno. Martin.\nCorporal R. B. Sleigh, x.\n\nCONSTABLES:\n\nW. Anderson.\nJ. W. Carroll, x.\nR. Hays.\nF. Ludlowe, x.\nC. Lousby (wounded).\nL. O. Keefe.\nJ. Quigley.\nG. W. Rowley, x.\nR. Redwood.\nJ. Tector.\n\nThose marked thus (x) were stationed at Frog Lake and succeeded in joining their comrades at Fort Pitt.\n\nThe prisoners, under the charge of Big Bear number about thirty-five (35) and included Rev. Charles Quinney and wife, and Instructor Mann, wife and family.\n\nAN INDIAN'S GRATITUDE.\n\nAlthough the whites in this section profess a deadly hatred towards the Indians, one man at least claims that some of them possess gratitude. Before the Mounted Police evacuated Fort Pitt, Big Bear sent a letter to Sergeant Martin, a copy of which is as follows:\n\nFort Pitt,\nApril 1st, 1885.\n\nSergeant Martin, N.W.M.P.:\nMy Dear Friend\u2014Since I have met you long ago we have always been good friends, and you have from time to time given me things. That is the reason why that I want to speak kindly to you, so please try to get off from Fort Pitt as soon as you can, and tell your captain that I am very kind to him. For years the Canadian Government have had me to starve in this country, he sometimes gives me food. I do not forget the last time I visited you, he gave me a good blanket; that is the reason that I want you to go away without any bloodshed; we had a talk; I told my men before we left camp, and we thought the way we are doing now the best. That is to let you off. If you would go, so try and get away before the afternoon as the young men are all wild and hard to keep in hand.\n\n(Signed) - Big Bear.\n\nP.S.\u2014You asked me to keep the men in camp last night and I did so, so I want you to get off to-day.\n\nBig Bear.\n\nThe document in question was written by a white prisoner at the dictation of the chief.\n\nBIG BEAR'S PRISONERS.\n\nThe following is the list of the persons held prisoners by Big Bear near Fort Pitt\u2014\n\nMr. McLean, Factor Hudson Bay Co.\nMrs. McLean.\nMiss McLean.\nMiss Margaret McLean and Miss McLean.\nMaster Papaman McLean.\nMaster Leslie McLean.\nMaster Angus McLean.\nMaster Duncan McLean.\nMaster J. Rose McLean, and infant.\nMr. Stanley Simpson, Hudson Bay clerk.\nMr. Hunter, servant.\nHenry Dufrane, H. B. Co. servant.\nRabisco Smith, H. B. B. servant, and family of 6.\nMann, instructor, Onion Lake, and family of 5.\nReverend Mr. Mrs. Quinney, Episcopal Missionary, Onion Lake.\nNa-co-tan and family, friendly Indians.\nThree Squaws, friendly.\nMalcolm McLeod, H. B. C. servant.\nReverend Mr. family of 6.\nPrisoners taken at Frog Lake\u2014\nMr. John Delaney, Ottawa, instructor's wife.\nPeter St. Luke, family of 5.\n\nPRIVATE PERGUSON.\n\nPrivate A. M. Ferguson eldest son of Dr. R. B. Ferguson, was in his 19th year and enlisted in the gun battery Winnipeg Rifles before the outbreak took place. He was attending Macdonald College as a medical student and was universally liked by all who knew him.\n\nPRIVATE ROGERS.\n\nPrivate John Rogers of the Otterwa Sharp-shooters, and late of the Interior Dept., Ottawa, was killed in Otter's fight with Poundmaker, May, 1885.\n\nCOLONEL KENNEDY.\n\nA VICTORY FOR THE CANADIAN ARMY\u2014THE SAD END OF SO ACTIVE AND USEFUL SOLDIER.\n\nThe following despatch received yesterday afternoon conveyed the sad intelligence of the death of Col. Kennedy of this city:\n\nOTTAWA, May 3.\n\nT. R. Burge, Winnipeg.\n\"A cable has just been received by His Excellency as follows:\n\nLONDON, May 3.\u2014It is with extreme regret I have to inform you of the death of Col. Kennedy this morning of small pox. Will you convey to his family the expression of my deepest sympathy at the loss of this gallant officer.\n\n(Signed) - Secretary of War.\"\n\nHis Excellency is telegraphing the sad news to his family. Please send at once their address so that they can be communicated with. Wait telegram from His Excellency.\"\n\nThe news spread rapidly and expressions of deepest sorrow were heard on all sides. The man was far more universally liked in the city than the deceased. The sad circumstances attending his death make it particularly painful. After a period of useful service in the Soudan he was returning home when he passed away.\n\nThe deceased was born at Newcastle, Ontario, in 1837. At an early age he started in life as a contractor, but subsequently abandoned that occupation to study law, remaining to the end of Mr. D. W. Dunblane, but died for the second time. It was during the first Red River expedition under Wolseley. Previous to this he held the rank of Captain and Adjutant of the 57th Battalion of Petersborough. After the expiration of his term he was appointed Registrar of the County of Kenora, and after the incorporation of the city he became Registrar of Winnipeg. He was a member of the North West Territorial Council during its existence. He was Mayor of the city for two terms, and also a Member of Parliament. He was a very active part in military matters and was appointed in command of the 90th Battalion on its formation nearly two years ago. He was also a prominent Member and one of the founders of the Grace Church. He was a member of the Board of Education and in fact was associated with almost every organization in the city. He organized the Manitoba contingent of the Imperial Yeomanry, and was appointed to them in Egypt last fall as paymaster. The terms of service for which they were engaged having expired they were on their way home when the Colonel was taken ill with smallpox and sent to London, where he succumbed to the disease.\n\nThe deceased leaves his wife and five children, four boys and one girl, to mourn his loss. John C. N. Kennedy, the eldest son, is attending the military college at Kingston, and the other boys, Charles and Frederick, are with their godfather Baron now at the front. Owing to the wires being down between Humboldt and Clarke's Crossing they have not yet learned of their father's death, although a message was sent to them by Capt. Kennedy yesterday afternoon.\n\nCOL. KENNEDY'S FUNERAL.\n\nLondon, May 6.\u2014Col. Kennedy, of the Canadian voyageurs, who died here, was buried to-day in High Gate Cemetery.\n\nRev. Mr. Greaves, president of the Wesleyan Conference, performed the funeral rites.\n\nThe body was carried to the grave by eight voyageurs, representing the regiment following the coffin. Three volleys of musketry were fired over the grave. The funeral was attended by special representatives of the Prince of Wales, Duke of Cambridge and General Wolseley.\n\nLondon, May 6.\u2014The funeral of Colonel Kennedy was very imposing.\n\nThe firing of volleys over the grave was done by three selected men from the Essex Regiment.\n\nThe Duke of Cambridge sent a wreath to be placed on the bier.\n\nColonel Kennedy telegraphed a special message of condolence.\n\nTHE SOLDIER'S FUNERAL.\n\nAt noon May 6th the casket containing the remains of the late Private Ferguson was taken from his father's residence to the Congregational Church, where it was placed above the altar. That late Private Swifwood, which was bound to carry directly from the railway station the evening before. The lids of the caskets were covered with flowers, each having a wreath contributed by the members of the 35th Battalion, also one of infinite beauty prepared by the ladies of the lamented Ferguson bore the words \"From Mother,\" and there were other floral offerings from various friends. At 2.30 p.m. the funeral service was held, after which the remains were taken to St. John's Cathedral Cemetery, and there interred.\nWINNIPEG WAR SKETCHES.\n\nLIEUT.-COL. SCOTT'S BATTALION, WINNIPEG, PREPARING TO LEAVE FOR THE FRONT.\n\nVIEW OF FORT PITT WITH PORTRAIT OF MRS. GOWANLOCK CAPTURED BY INDIANS.\nFIGHT AT CUT-KNIFE CREEK BETWEEN COL. OTTER AND CHIEF POUNDMAKER,\nSATURDAY, MAY 2nd, 1885.\nTHE BATOCHE FIGHT.\n\nTHE ADVANCE.\n\nBatoche, May 9th. The Clarke's Crossing, May 10th. General Middleton's whole force left the camp at Clarke's Crossing early in the morning. The men were in good condition, and both anxious and eager for the fray. We proceeded four miles west along a ten mile north by the open prairie, camping last night behind Batoche, on the Humboldt trail. No sign of the enemy was visible on the line of march, nor were any signs of them seen when we arrived at our camp for the night. At an early hour this morning the camp was astir, and all preparations were completed for an advance on the rebel position. Everything being in readiness, we started for Batoche at six o'clock, and after an uneventful march, arrived there about nine.\n\nOur force consisted of 913 men, with four cannon and a gatling.\n\nEach gun had two nine-pounders, and \"A\" Battery, in addition, had a Gatling gun, which was taken into action by Captain Howard, United States army, and Lieutenant Rivers. As the column approached Batoche's Captain Freez, A.D.C., galloped up and asked to have the guns sent forward at once. The order was promptly obeyed, and we went forward with the guns at a gallop.\n\nNo 2 gun of \"A\" Battery was immediately prepared for action, and fired on the house, successfully shelling the rebels inside. A Gatling gun began to proceed with the bombardment. At this juncture some persons were seen to emerge from a house next to a church, and the Gatling was turned on this building. After firing a few rounds a man in the gallery of a priest appeared at the door of the house, which was being attacked, holding a white handkerchief. The General and his staff advanced and asked the priest to come forward. After a short time, during which the door was shut, the priest, accompanied by three nuns and five Sisters of the Church, a company of Indians, who explained that they had gathered here from all parts of the country to obtain the rebels protection from the Indians, who were committing depredations and thieving the whites in all directions. While this conference was proceeding, Boulton's scouts, on the right, engaged a score or so of Indians, who retired to shelter in a ravine.\n\nAbout three miles from Batoche we had heard the whistle of the steamer \"Northcote,\" the signal agreed upon by the Indians, who were at Batoche. The steamer, which was manned by \"C\" Company of Infantry of Toronto, passed Batoche, the priests informed us, about half past eight in the morning, and was attacked from both sides of the river when she had proceeded four miles from her point, a running fight being maintained all the way down. The priests complained to the General the lay of the land, and we proceeded at once to the height of land on the left of the parsonage, from whence we could see the village of Batoche. The Gatling Battery had meanwhile been busy shelling the houses on both sides of the river, a number of rebels being seen retreating from them as soon as the firing commenced. From this position we now occupied, it was seen that opposite the village there were canvas tents and Indian tipis, some of them grandly pitched, as established, and some shells were thrown from our guns into its midst. When about to limber up the guns a couple of shots were fired from brush down the slope, and a strong fusillade began on both sides of us. The Gatling was immediately brought into action, and a heavy fire opened by \"A\" Battery, and a couple of hundred shots were poured into the brush in almost as many seconds. The rebels did not seem to relish the warmth of our attack for many of them were seen in the distance breaking cover, and taking to the bush on the banks of the river.\n\nThe artillery opened on the extreme left, on the heights of land overlooking the steep wooded river banks, and as the rebels were seen advancing along the banks, it was feared an attempt would be made to attack our flank. The Garrison detachment of \"A\" Battery was immediately extended on the brink of the hill, from the adobe house near the church. The Gatling gun was also turned to check the rebel advance and many shots were dropped to the rear. While the Gatling was engaged in this work, Engineer Captain of \"A\" Battery, shot a rebel from behind a point directly opposite our flank, the rebels took shelter in the heavy brush, and opened a heavy fire, out of reach of the Gatling, which was returned to its former position. The Battery guns then advanced to shell the village. \"A\" and \"B\" companies of the Royal Grenadiers, who formed the advance guard, extended, and advanced through the bluffs until the guns were reached, when they halted in line with the guns. The 9th, which formed the support, also extended, while the Midland Battalion and the Winnipeg Field Battery acted as a reserve force.\n\nTHE BATTLE OVER.\n\nFiring completely died out by six o'clock, and the forces immediately set to work to clear a place for a camp, and put up barricades.\n\nThe killed and wounded are as follows:\n\nKILLED.\n\nGunner Wm. Phillips, \"A\" Battery.\n\nWOUNDED.\n\nGunner T. J. Stout, \"A\" Battery, ribs smashed by the wheel of a gun carriage.\nDriver Nap. Carpentier, \"A\" Battery, shot in the leg.\nGunner Tweoley, \"A\" Battery, shot in the leg.\nCapt. Mason, Grenadiers, flesh wound in the side.\nGunner Fairbanks, \"A\" Battery, shot in the thigh.\nCook, French's Scouts, shot in the leg.\nCurley Allen, of the same corps, shot in the arm.\n\nThe troops stood to arms sharp at four o'clock (Sunday) morning. There was a film of ice on the water pails and the men were weary, stiff and sore from the long watch of sleep and rheumatism. The rebels had been moving about all night, and the moment we began to stir their advance fired a few shots and gave a loud cheer, apparently by way of challenge. The troops were quite cool and collected, although the prospect of another prolonged conflict with this wily enemy was by no means cheering one. Gen. Middleton had let it be understood, however, that most of the work would be left to the artillery, and at the parade the officer cautioned the men against firing without orders. A hasty breakfast was made of bacon, bread, bacon and eggs, and then a brief delay occurred, the General waiting to hear from the scouts who had gone forward to the outskirts of the bush.\n\nOur artillery moved forward at 5.20, and opened fire on the rebels when the fighting was already under way. Two guns were directed against the houses in the basin-shaped depression along the river. A few rebels lay behind three log shanties just below the river bank, and the artillery soon drove them out. The enemy did not attempt to answer our artillery fire except by musketry volleys; when they let fly at the artillerymen who were pretty well covered, however, by skirmishers. At 8.40, skirmishers from the Royal Grenadiers and the goth were sent a little further towards the river, and were joined by some of our pioneers. Captain Howard with the Gatling accompanied them and kept up a rattling fusillade for half an hour. The rebels did not fire back but lay low in their rifle pits. Occasionally two or three of them would jump up and fire and then fall again, together with the wounded dragging their men after them; but strict orders had been issued against following them. This lasted a long while, no damage being done on either side. We could not, for prudential reasons, send a charge into the pits, and for similar reasons, the rebels refused from running up against our big guns and Gatling.\n\nThe fighting during the rest of the day does not admit of detailed description. Our artillery would blaze away for an hour, and then the skirmishers would advance only to fall back as soon as they came within range while skirmishing flying, suddenly rose in rows in their pits. Neither side gained the slightest advantage. Had Col. Irvine appeared in the rebel rear we should have had them in a trap.\nDOWN THE SASKATCHEWAN.\n\nTHE TRIP OF THE GUNBOAT \"NORTHCOTE\" WITH THE TROOPS AND SUPPLIES FOR GENERAL MIDDLETON\u2014A HAZARDOUS UNDER-TAKING.\n\n(From the Star Special Correspondent with the Midland Battalion.)\n\nON BOARD THE SS. \"NORTHCOTE,\" SASKATCHEWAN RIVER, APRIL 27.\n\nThe stern-wheel steamer \"Northcote\" was fitted up at Medicine Hat, on the South Saskatchewan River, also known by her name to the Saskatchewana Ferry landing, about 12 miles direct north of Swift Current, there to be armed and used as a gun-boat and transport. This boat had been built at Grand Rapids, on the Upper Saskatchewan, and taken down the south branch in September, 1869, and was the first steamer to make the trip up and down that branch. On arrival at the Ferry Landing two barges were lashed to the steamer, one on each side. These latter were loaded with ammunition and supplies, the room being provided in both for the men of the Midland Battalion, under Col. Williams, four companies of which were detailed to accompany the expedition. Including medical corps, crew and staff there were about eighty men who made up the boat's Landing, the whole force being under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Straubenzic, D.A.G. The four companies were selected from the 15th, 40th, 45th and 46th Regiments. The steamer left the Landing at 11.30 a.m. on Thursday, April 23rd, amid the cheers of the troops assembled at the Ferry. The steamer made very slow progress, the river being narrow and sand bars being in unknown points. The wheelmen steered by the current, which runs very swift, and there is a series of bends. Comparatively nothing was known of what we would have to contend against, as the captain and crew had no experience and the sand banks were continually filling up and shifting.\n\nZAREEBAH.\n\nThe infantry started to work and constructed zareebas out of bags of flour, oats and burlap. A quantity of wood was collected on each bank, and then covered with tarpaulins. The men had ammunition served out to them and slept in their zareebahs. Capt. Howard of the U.S. Army, who was on the steamer in charge of the Gatling Batteries, gave an exhibition trial of the Gatling, which was placed in the compartment of the upper deck of the steamer. This machine was made by the Colts Fire Arms Co., Hartford, Conn., and will fire as high as eight hundred rounds per minute out of its ten barrels. It is a most improved and effective gun and uses a .48 calibre cartridge about two inches in length. It is made of Bessemer steel and gun metal, and sighted at the side. An ammunition cart and five horses accompany the Gatling gun, four of which are used to draw the gun carriage and one to carry the ammunition.\n\nThe banks of the South Saskatchewan are very mountainous and barren of all vegetation, and no habitations are to be seen between the Elbow and the Landing. Wood was used entirely by the steamer, a supply being landed somewhere on the river, and was to last until more would be wanted. As the steamer slowly progressed two of the boatmen were on either side with a long pole to fathom the river, yelling out to the steerman the number of feet of water at the bottom. When the steamer struck, the pole was followed almost immediately by the same words from his comrade on the port side, indicating that they could not find bottom with their poles. The captain ordered on \"all steam,\" but we had not run far when the steamer sang out \"She's got 6\u00bd feet, 5 feet 2\u00bd\" in rapid succession. The engine was reversed, but too late, for she watch followed up with \"3 feet\u20142 feet\u2014Bang! There she's struck!\" and we were on a sand bar.\n\nhigh and dry. The derricks, caissons and spars were called into requisition, and we were lifted off the bank. Any person travelling the Mississippi or Missouri rivers will readily understand the process adopted in lifting the flat-bottomed steamers over the snags or sand-bars which impede the navigation on those rivers. Large numbers of ducks and geese were seen and some of the officers had a \"tip-up\" at them at long range with Winchester rifles. The steamer was landed shortly after midnight, and was prepared for the night. Guards were placed on different points to prevent a possible night attack. During the day a little over thirty miles was made, which was considered quite good going for the steamer, struck several times and lost the channel. We were stripped on a sand-bar all hands would be ordered off the steamer on to the barges to lighten her, thus she proceeded for twelve days, coming in Capt. Straubenzic, she proceeded down the river to co-operate with Gen. Middleton in the attack on Batoche.\n\nRIEL'S SECOND REBELLION.\n\nAN INCIDENT IN THE LIFE OF THE REBEL CHIEF NOT GENERALLY KNOWN.\n\nFrom the following extract from an interview between Major Walsh and a Winnipeg Star reporter it appears that the present rising in the North-West is not the second but the third agitation of which Riel is guilty.\n\n\"What do you know of Riel?\"\n\n\"Well, he wintered with me once on the Missouri river, and one Summer he was near me at Wood Mountain.\"\n\n\"What do you think of him as a leader?\"\n\n\"I do not know what to think of him. I remember that during the time I was with him at Wood Mountain he endeavored to get the Sioux, Crees and Assiniboins to join him, and tried to make me to him the acknowledged leader of a rebellion. He went so far in this as to get the Indians to sign an agreement written by himself, making each one's interest a common cause. I heard of this and visited the Indian camp, and saw the agreement with the Indians handed. At that time I had charge of the Wood Mountain, and exerted a good deal of influence with the Indians. I succeeded in getting them to tear up the agreements and break off the confederation which was a new affair and able to accomplish. Riel is an eccentricity not generally known. As a leader, Riel, I have found, is not much liked, even by the half-breeds. He is an ambitious man and something of an agitator. He is extremely fond of notoriety.\"\n\nTHE VICTORY AT BATOCHE.\n\nWe have just received the news of Gen.
