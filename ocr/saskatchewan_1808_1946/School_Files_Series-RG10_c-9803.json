We know that this contract has been let, and when you are ready for figures on school equipment, would be glad to have your specification.\n\nWe understand from the Contractors that the Duck Lake Indian School will be completed about January 1st, and we would esteem it a kindness to be permitted to figure on school equipment required for this Institution also.\n\nWe respectfully wish to bring to the notice of your Institution a blackboard product which is taking the place of all composition and quarry slate boards. In the matter of durability, safety from breakage in transit, cutting surface for chalk and uniformity of thickness and appearance, this board is vastly superior to even the genuine quarry slate. In this connection and for a matter of reference we might state that the Toronto Public Schools are adopting this board.

Every effort was made to secure an adequate supply of water on the site selected, but all attempts have failed, which makes it necessary to negotiate and secure a new site for the building, where an adequate supply of water can be obtained. This matter is now receiving immediate attention, and if a suitable site is secured this fall that will enable us to go ahead with the building program I will immediately advise you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nJames Priel, Esq.,\nContractor,\nSaskatoon, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the well drilling on the new site at Onion Lake, I have to inform you that up to the 5th of this month the drillers had gone down to a depth of 185 feet, and no water had yet been struck; the formation now being much the same as that which we went through on the original site.\n\nI doubt the wisdom of continuing drilling, unless we are prepared to go a great deal deeper. The well drillers can go to a depth of 425 feet, but if we are going to go that deep we might as well move back to the original site.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing in the way of a precedent to go upon in drilling in this district and it may be that there is no water sheet underlying this land, and if there is that it is at a great depth. If there is no sheet of water it would be a matter of pure luck to strike a spring of sufficient volume to supply an institution of the kind contemplated.\n\nKindly let me know if you think we should keep on drilling.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, CANADA\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nRe water supply for the New Onion Lake School\n\nOwing to the failure to secure an adequate supply of water for our Society's new Residential School here after boring to a depth of over 360 ft., on the site chosen last June by the shore of Long Lake, and the necessity which this has created of selecting another site, I arranged to visit this centre on my way from the Mackay School at The Pas to the Schools in S. Alberta, and arrived here yesterday. As Mr. Commissioner Graham had instructed the local Indian Agent Mr. Turner to select another site not less than one mile away from the site first chosen, and have boring operations commenced there, I visited this new site yesterday afternoon with Mr. Turner, and Mr. Ellis, the School's Principal. Boring operations had begun on this site which is fully half a mile from the Lake shore, and a hole had been sunk to a depth of 200 ft. without finding water. As the strata penetrated appeared to be practically identical with that encountered in sinking the hole on the first site, both the Well-borer and Mr. Turner were doubtful as to finding there the supply of water required.\n\nThis site, although situated on the section of land set apart by the Indians for the use of the School is not so suitable as the one first chosen.\n\nFrom this site we proceeded not without difficulty, owing to the deep snow, to the east-end of the Lake where there is a spring of good water yielding about two gallons to the minute. While it might be possible to construct and conserve this water for the use of the School if built there, Mr. Turner, Mr. Ellis, and I were agreed that there were two very serious objections to this locality as a suitable place for erecting a school. These were:\n1. The absence of a level site large enough to accommodate the buildings within a distance of fully a quarter of a mile, and\n\n2. The sandy and consequently barren nature of the soil. No Indians live on it and none of them have ever attempted to farm it.\n\nAfter carefully considering the whole situation Mr. Turner and I came to the conclusion that the best solution to the problem of an adequate supply of water for the new School would be to have the School erected on the shore of the Lake, about 200 yards to the east of the site selected in June, and to have arrangements made for the water supply to be secured from the Lake itself.\n\nAs there is a more gradual slope from this site to the water's edge than at the one chosen in June, we thought that this would facilitate the arrangements necessary for constructing a reservoir, and for the laying down of the necessary piping. We also estimated that the cost of installing this system of water supply would be fully as economical, if not more so, than to continue the boring operations at other centres, with the possibility of not securing an adequate or suitable supply even after much labour and expense. I myself am the more impressed with this view of the situation, as I have learned that no other deep well ever sunk on the Onion Lake Reserve has found water.\n\nTo build therefore the new School for our Society on the site recommended above on the shore of Long Lake, within the section of land already set apart, and to arrange for the water supply to be drawn from the Lake itself, appears to Mr. Turner and me to be the most satisfactory, if not the only arrangement possible under the present circumstances, and I beg to recommend that action be taken by your Department in keeping with this recommendation.\n\nThe site itself, although level, affords excellent drainage facilities to a depression which would be on the rear or north side of the main building and away from the lake. As it stands at the centre of the bend on the north-side of the lake, it commands a full and picturesque view of practically the whole of the lake's surface.\n\nThe height about the lake level is about 100 feet. From the main school building to the water's edge would be about 150 yards, and deep water, I am informed would be reached at not more than 100 yards from the shore. In winter the average thickness of the ice is said to be about 3 feet.\n\nI commend the recommendation set forth above to your early and sympathetic consideration and beg to remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.O\nDuncan C.

Please arrange to have the lighting plant shipped to the Rev. J. B. M. Giroux, O.M.I., Principal of the St. Bruno's Indian Residential School, Grouard, Alta. The freight address is Indiana Station. The St. Bruno's School was destroyed by fire last winter and the church authorities received a substantial grant from Appropriation to replace it. The new building is wired for electricity and they have urgently requested the Department to supply an electric light plant. This shipment should receive your earliest attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nIndian Affairs.

As we are now down to a depth of 185 ft. and as yet there are no indications of water, it seems to me that we should abandon this site.\n\nThe agent suggests that we move back to the first site chosen, which is near the lake, and make arrangements to use the lake water, as we do on Gordon's reserve. This lake is of considerable size and it looks to me as if the water is as good as any to be found in the lakes in this country. I had a sample of this water taken and tested and the opinion from the Laboratory is as follows:\n\n\"Although this water is suitable for drinking purposes from a chemical point of view, the bacteriological examination and the test for nitrites shows that the sample was subject to marked pollution. This is to be expected in a lake water. All surface waters in Saskatchewan must be considered as dangerous for domestic consumption, unless they are treated by some approved process before reaching the consumer.\"\n\nAs the sample was not taken in accordance with Departmental instructions, or, in a sterilized container, conclusions should not be drawn from the bacteriological examination.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.\n\nNov. 14th, 1924\n\nIt seems to me that this water is quite good enough for domestic purposes, and we should decide to have it pumped from the lake for the school requirements, a distance of about 200 yards.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

Graham,\nIndian Commissioner\nNov. 19, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant with further reference to the site for the proposed new Onion Lake School.\n\nBefore we decide to use the Lake water as a source of supply for the new school, I would ask you to have a chemical and bacteriological examination made of the water in accordance with the requirements of procedure necessary for a proper analysis. When this has been done please furnish me with a copy of the Department's bacteriological and chemical analysis.\n\nI think we should be absolutely sure that the water is safe for domestic use before we take any action with regard to the proposed new building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.

When Mr. Priel has delivered the materials on the site I would ask you to send one of your inspectors to Onion Lake to inspect the materials to see if they are of a quality in accordance with the specifications and also to see if he has made proper provision for the protection of all materials delivered, and if so to issue a certificate to the contractor for 90% of the value of the material delivered and labour performed. It would also be advisable when submitting a certificate to the Department to make sure that the contractor is paying for the materials which are being delivered. The last certificate which can be paid for out of this year's appropriation will have to be dated before March 31st.\n\nIt will be necessary to have a survey made of the site of the new school, and plans forwarded to the Department of a similar nature to those furnished for the new Duck Lake School, and I understand that when you were in the Department you intimated that you would give this work to the C.E. Underwood and Associates, 605 Canada Bldg., Saskatoon, which firm performed similar work in connection with the Duck Lake School. Their plans, which should be forwarded to the Department, should show the location of the new school with reference to the source of water supply, also all levels, distances, and all information necessary in order that proper plans of the water supply and sewerage disposal systems can be prepared here.

In the first place, the cedar shingles, according to experts whom I have consulted, will last considerably longer than will the galvanized iron shingles; although I believe if I went to the firm who sell the latter kind of shingles they would say the opposite. I have taken up this matter with several architects, as well as dealers, and they all strongly advise me to stay with the cedar shingles. From the standpoint of economy it will cost just twice as much money to put on the galvanized iron shingles as it would the cedar. I would therefore request that Dr. Westgate be informed that we do not intend to use them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

This I cannot do. Would it not be a good plan for the Department to express an opinion in this matter? I am of the opinion that Dr. Westgate thinks the matter is entirely up to me.\n\nMy instructions from the Department are to curtail expenses and to adhere to the principles that are most generally followed in putting up buildings of this kind. I have taken a great deal of trouble to ascertain to what extent metal roofing is used on buildings such as the one we are putting up and find that it is used on very few.\n\nIt places me in an awkward position if this man and others have the opinion that the Department are indifferent in the matter. It would make matters a great deal better if the Department would say they concurred in what I say, or otherwise. Of course I do not know what has actually been said to Dr. Westgate; I am merely judging from the letter that I have received that he was given to understand that the matter was left entirely in my hands, which it was not.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

I refer to the ordering and placing of pneumatic pressure tanks for the Union Lake School.\n\nYou are aware that the school is now under way, and before the foundations are closed in, these tanks should be placed in the basement; otherwise it will mean tearing down construction. I would, therefore, ask for your authority by wire to order two 1500-gallon pneumatic tanks to be sent to Union Lake without delay.\n\nThe matter of the water supply for this institution is now being gone into, and I expect in the course of a few days to forward you a plan and a price that has been submitted by a firm here.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

I believe the foundations are now in and the construction is well under way.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI enclose herewith a rough sketch of a plan for a septic tank and drainage system in connection with the new Onion Lake Residential School.\n\nIt is proposed to build this tank along the same line as the tank which was installed at the Round Lake School three years ago, and which has given splendid satisfaction and complied with the regulations of the Provincial Government. The length of the tank is 20 feet, the depth 12 feet and the width 4\u00bd feet. The receiving chamber will be 4\u00bd' x 12', and the discharge chamber 4\u00bd' x 8'.\n\nA re-inforced concrete wall 5' high will separate the receiving from the discharge chamber. The tank will be lined with re-inforced concrete and is to be water proof. A horizontal table of re-inforced concrete is to be placed in the tank at a depth of 5' below the surface and a concrete table on the ground surface level forming a roof for the tank. Both the receiving and discharge chambers are to be provided with metal man holes. The tank will be equipped with an Amathes Syphon with long bend.\n\nThe sewage pipe line from the school building to the septic tank, a distance of 230 ft., will be composed of 6\" glazed tile pipe laid at a depth of not less than 7 ft. from the surface of the ground. The discharge drain from the tank will be 200 ft. long with 4\" field tile laid in a valley with open joints not more than 1\" apart, and the whole covered in a proper manner. The nature of the soil that this discharge pipe will pass through is a porous sand and I am told that this length of pipe should take care of the discharge, but if it is found not to be sufficient, it will be a simple and inexpensive matter to add to this field.\n\nI submitted this plan to Mr. James Friel, the Contractor, who is on the ground with a staff of workmen and who is in a position to do the work cheaper than anyone else, and he offers to supply the material and complete the work in connection with this system for the sum of $1082.00. I have gone carefully into the figures in connection with the tank at Round Lake, and comparing them with Mr. Friel's figures (taking into consideration also the distance from the railway) I consider his offer a reasonable one, and would recommend that it be accepted.\n\nI would be glad to have your approval to proceed with this work as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG'10, Volume 6321, file 658-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSaskatoon, Sask.\n\n22nd, April, 1925\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Onion Lake School\n\nIn compliance with your instructions, we have made a survey of the site for the above school and, at the same time, we laid out the basement for the contractor and gave him a grade line.\n\nWe are forwarding to you, under separate registered cover, the original tracings which shows the lay out at this point. You will notice that we have shown contour lines, each line representing a rise or fall of five feet in the ground. We have assumed the elevation of the water level in the lake as 100 feet as a basis for our work. The pipe line leading from the lake to the building was staked on the ground for 50 feet and the position of the proposed well is marked by stake No. 16. It appears that there would be good seepage from the lake to the well. However, without a test hole, it would be impossible to determine this, and if sufficient water does not seep through, it will be necessary to dig a trench out to the lake and fill in with coarse gravel.\n\nFrom the profile of this pipeline we have indicated the grade for the pipe, giving it 9 feet of cover. This can be altered one way or the other. However, as the digging is fairly easy, with the possible exception of the lower 150 feet, we would suggest giving it, at least, 9 feet and 10 feet would be safe. We have the pipe line laid out to enter the building 14 feet west of the centre line of the building and this would bring it in along the passage way, as shown on our plan, and in a direct line with the boiler room and machinery room.\n\nWe have staked out the proposed location for the sewer line and septic tank. There is excellent fall from the building towards the west terminating in a slough, as indicated on the plan. We do not know what system you favour for disposing of the liquid from the septic tanks, but if you wish to put in farm tile on the slope below the tanks and let it seep away into the ground, there is a good location, as shown by the contours. The pipeline is staked every 50 feet and the pipe line goes from 30 inches to 3 feet south of the staked line. We have made the grade of the pipe sufficiently low at the building to take care of the boiler room, if that is necessary, or if you wish to put another pipe line to take care of the wash water, that could be done in the same trench.\n\nIf there is any additional information which you require, we would be glad to hear from you.\n\nWe are enclosing herewith statement of our account, covering the field work and also the office work in connection with the preparation of the plans.\n\nWe might say that in proceeding to Onion Lake we accompanied Mr. Marison by way of St. Walburg, but upon returning we saved a day going by way of Lloydminster. However, as the ferry was not running, it was necessary for us to have a livery meet us at the south side of the river.\n\nYour obedient servants,\n\nJ. E. Underwood & Associates.\nSir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith and recommend for payment Regina Voucher #3171 amounting to $241.50 in favour of J.B. Underwood, 606 Canada Building, Saskatoon, Sask., for engineering fees and expenses of making survey and taking levels in connection with the drainage and water systems at the Onion Lake Residential School. I am also attaching a copy of his report on the survey. I am sending you under separate cover the plans which they prepared in connection with the drainage and water supply systems and would be glad if you would send me blue prints of these plans at your earliest convenience.\n\nI may say that I have under way the preparation of plans for the well at the lakeside and the storage water tank close to the building, and I am submitting same to the contractor, Mr. Friel, asking him to submit a price on the complete water system installation. I shall also obtain a price from the firm of Pantin & Swayze on this work and will communicate with you further when I know definitely what the cost will amount to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:-\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 16th instant, in connection with the ordering and placing of pneumatic pressure tanks in the Onion Lake School, I may inform you that an examination of the plan of the building reveals the fact that there has been no provision made in the plan for placing these tanks in the building.\n\nIt will be necessary to bring the excavation in the machinery room to the same level with the floor in the boiler room, in order that these tanks may be installed under the floor and still leave sufficient height of ceiling in the machinery room.\n\nI would be glad if you will authorize me to proceed with this work, as it is very necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n**Direct Coupled Series, 4 to 6 Kw.**\n\n**DIMENSIONS AND EXPORT PARTICULARS.**\n\n| Type of Plant | GS | HS | KS |\n|---------------|----|----|----|\n| Dimensions of Plant: Height | 3' 6\" | 4' 0\" | 4' 0\" |\n| \" Width | 5' 10\" | 6' 4\" | 6' 4\" |\n| \" Width (excluding Tank) | 3' 6\" | 3' 10\" | 3' 10\" |\n| Nett weight, without Battery, cwts. | 22.0 | 30.0 | 32.0 |\n| Nett weight, with Battery, cwts. | 27.0 | 35.0 | 37.0 |\n| Shipping Measurement, cubic ft. | 139.0 | 148.0 | 154.0 |\n| Battery | 49.5 | 49.5 | 49.5 |\n| 110 volts | 191.0 | 191.0 | 207.0 |\n\nFor prices see overleaf.\n\nLamps consuming 20 watts are taken as standard of comparison.\n\nA 20 watt Metal Filament Lamp gives 16 candle-power.\n\n17\nDirect Coupled Series, 8 to 15 Kw.\n\nEquipment.

(RG 10, Volume 6321, file 658-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI beg to confirm my telegram of even date, reading as follows:\n\n\"Reference your telegram twenty-seventh\nadvise two pneumatic tanks be installed\nOnion Lake.\"\n\nI have gone into the matter of water supply for the Onion Lake Boarding School very thoroughly, and have decided that it would be better to install two pressure tanks in the basement, of the capacity of 1500 gallons each; also a storage reservoir alongside of the school, 12 x 12 and perhaps 10 ft. deep, into which the water from the lake will be pumped, and from there with an electric engine into the pressure tanks. This system is used at other institutions in the country with great satisfaction, and is strongly recommended by Messrs. Paulin and Swayze, in whom I have great confidence.\n\nThe installation of these tanks in the basement will lessen the work of the pump at the lake, which means that the pump will last longer, and if the reservoir outside the school is kept full of water there is always a reserve supply on hand, which is a great advantage in case anything goes wrong with the pump. It also means increased protection in the case of fire.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIf this system is installed I believe it would cost in the neighbourhood of from $1600 to $1800; this is outside of the piping from the lake and the well that will have to be dug at the lake, which latter items might cost another $800.00. Probably it would be safe to say that the cost will be within $3000.00 for the complete system.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nCommissioner Graham has submitted sketch plans of a sewage disposal system for the Onion Lake Indian Residential School, Sask. The scheme will consist in the erection of a two compartment septic tank, located a distance of 230 feet in the rear of the building. The outlet from the siphon chamber which will be 200 feet, will provide by itself a means of disposing of the sewage on account of the absorbing nature of the soil. Mr. James Friel, the contractor who is on the ground with a staff of workmen has offered to carry out this work for the sum of $1,060.00, which, according to Mr. Graham is a reasonable price. I have, myself, made an approximate estimate of the cost of the work, and concur with Mr. Graham's recommendation that this offer be accepted.\n\nThe question of the water supply system is now under consideration, and it is expected that the Department will be furnished with a proposal within the course of a few days.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nSir:\n\nI am today in receipt of a letter from the Rev. H. Ellis, Principal of the Onion Lake Boarding School, in which he makes a request to be supplied with a binder, a mower and a rake. He points out that they have 80 acres of crop in on the site of the new school.\n\nYou have already supplied farm machinery to the St. Paul's Industrial, and other new schools. Is it your desire that the Principal should have these implements? I am of the opinion that the matter of a binder could very well rest until we see whether we have a crop or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

(RG 10, Volume 6321, file 658-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI have received a letter from the Rev. Principal of the Church of England, Onion Lake Indian Residential School suggesting that a folding door be placed in the middle of the passage-way on the first floor of the new school building to separate the Boys' and Girls' Dormitories. This door could be closed while the dormitories are in occupation and thrown open if necessary during the day time. I think the proposal a good one and would recommend its adoption.\n\nThe Field Secretary of the M.S.C.C. has written to me pointing out that no provision is made in the plans and specifications for eave troughs or a cement cistern to hold soft water, which can be conserved for laundry purposes. I do not appear to have any report as to whether the lake water would be sufficiently soft to take the place of rain water, and would suggest that the eave troughs and cistern be provided. He also draws my attention to the provision for attaching the storm windows on the outside and suggests that this should be changed, and the storm sashes be placed on the inside. I have just received a letter from the Inspector of Construction who informs me he has looked into the matter and thinks the storm sashes could be put on the inside without very much trouble. It would be as well therefore to have this done.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThere is a further matter to which Dr. Westgate has referred, that is, that a Drying Tumbler is not included in the items of laundry equipment. It is not the practice of the Department to supply a Drying Tumbler for other Residential Schools and last fall when laundry appliances were furnished at the Cowesses and File Hills Boarding Schools this article was not included. At Hobbs I recently recommended the installation of a washer and dryer, meaning by the latter an extractor, and it was probably therefore not an omission in the specifications when the Drying Tumbler was not included for Onion Lake. If the Department desires to furnish this in addition to what is being provided for please advise me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner,\nSir:\n\nI have just received a letter from Mr. W. A. Hamilton the Inspector of Construction at Onion Lake who reports that the progress on the school is going on satisfactorily. He advises me that no switch was provided for the night lights in the Boys' and Girls' Dormitories, and no lights shown for the coal and wood room, as I think these desirable I have told him that the necessary provision for these may be made.\n\nThere are one or two other matters which he takes up upon which I should be glad to receive your instructions by telegram, as follows:-\n\n1. If folding doors are provided to partition off the passage-way on the dormitory floor, two fire songs should be supplied. One each on the boys' and girls' side.\n\n2. The Heating Contractor wishes to know where the high pressure boiler is to be located.\n\n3. No floor-drain is shown in the engine room and this should be provided.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n4. The return pipes for the heating system are specified to be carried back to the boiler in a trench, but there is nothing specified about the trench, and the contractor claims that he did not figure for covering it, and of course it cannot be left open.\n\n5. There are no specifications covering the ceiling for the boiler room and as the walls are to be of cement it might probably be advisable to have re-enforced cement slab ceiling which would make the room fire proof.\n\nI should like to have instructions about these matters as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n6th July, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 2nd instant with reference to the new Church of England School on Onion Lake, I beg to say that the Department approves of the placing of folding doors in the middle of the corridors on the first floor of the new building.\n\nWith reference to sawe troughs and a concrete drain I think before consideration is given to the installing of the soft water tank that it would be well to make sure that the water in the lake is unsatisfactory for laundry purposes.\n\nThe storm wash may be placed on the inside as recommended.\n\nRegarding the drying tumbler asked for by Dr. Westgate, I would ask you to please make a recommendation as to the mode of drying the clothes in the laundry after they are removed from the ejector.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A. F. MacKenzie)\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nGenl. of Indians,\nRegina, Sask.\n6th July, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 2nd instant with reference to Mr. Hamilton's report on the progress of work at Onion Lake School; I beg to reply to the items mentioned in your letter in the order submitted:\n\n1. Approve two floor gongs.\n\n2. High pressure boiler be located in boiler room.\n\n3. Approve floor drain in engine room.\n\n4. With reference to the placing return pipes in a trench, the Department will expect the contractor to fill in this trench, and finish over with the same material as specified for the floors.\n\n5. It is not thought necessary to provide a reinforced concrete ceiling in the boiler room and there will be less chance of fire if the rafters are left exposed as shown.\n\nI am very glad to learn that good progress is being made on this contract.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\n(A. F. MacKenzie)\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\nOttawa, 6th July, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 23rd ultimo with reference to the payments on your contract for the Onion Lake Residential School. I am enclosing two copies of certificates, No. 1 and No. 2.\n\nYou will notice on Certificate No. 1 that it was necessary to reduce the amount as shown under the heading of Labour and Material in Building at First Certificate by 10%, which made the 1st Certificate amount to $4,424.55.\n\nIn Certificate No. 2, the amount shown under Labour and Material in Building was increased to $3,568., as this is the amount shown on the statement submitted with the Certificate by Commissioner Graham.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.

Have also heard no barn or stable built yet. Please issue necessary instructions both above matters.\"\n\nMr. Ellis the Principal seems very anxious that I should come and inspect the whole building before we enter on occupation, and this I will do if at all possible. I am surprised to learn that nothing has been done towards building a barn and stable and that the main school is without eaves troughs. I have just wired to Mr. Ellis telling him that our Society decline to enter occupation until all equipment has been installed, heating, lighting and water systems supplied, and sufficient stable accommodation provided. In a letter to me dated Oct. 23rd he writes with regard to the water system as follows:\n\n1. The pipe laid down where it meets the water's edge can only be laid below the surface about 2 ft. because of the deep slope to the lake shore. I am of the opinion that in severe weather it will\nfreeze unless the Contractor banks it up on top.\n\n2. The screening at the mouth of the pipe in the lake which has been placed about 200 ft. from the shore is not small enough to prevent the storage tank which is made of cement from being filled with small minnows.\n\n3. He desires to know if the report on the lake water by the Regina Analyst was found satisfactory. In this connection he states that he was informed that the men working on the building would not use the lake water but got their supply from a spring about \u00bd mile away.\n\nYou will see from the above that a careful examination of the whole water system should be made by a competent representative of your Department before the Contractor has been awarded payment. I am disinclined to believe that the workmen could not drink the water from the lake but am asking Commissioner Graham for a copy of the Analyst's report in this connection.\n\nTrusting that the above information may be of service to you and that the buildings will be complete and ready for occupation before the end of this year.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTo W.

M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to inform you that I have just learned that the water from the Hot Water Tank has no circulating pipe. It is merely a one-way system, which is, of course, unsatisfactory, especially in an institution of this kind where water is such an important factor. You will recall that this one-way system was installed at the Edmonton Boarding School and we had to have it changed. I think it was also installed at other schools and changed later on.\n\nI would be glad to have your authority to make this change at Onion Lake, although I do not think we can afford to send a plumber specially from Regina to do this work.\n\nMight I ask the Department to make a note of this for future guidance. There is no doubt there should be a circulating system used in institutions of this kind.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. T. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:-\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report that I have received from Messrs. Paulin & Swayze with regard to the installation of the pumping and water supply system at the new Union Lake Boarding School.\n\nMr. Paulin points out that owing to the early freeze-up he found difficulty in getting the pipe from the pump house to the lake sufficiently deep, but hopes that it will answer as it is. If this pipe should freeze up we will have to depend on hauling water with threshing tanks, and first thing in the spring it will be lowered to a proper depth.\n\nMr. Paulin is of the opinion that the heating, lighting, plumbing and water supply equipment at this institution is an excellent one and will give good satisfaction. I would again draw your attention to what this firm say about the necessity of having a competent man to handle a plant of this kind. He tells me that neither Mr. Ellis nor the man he has could handle it at all, and in allowing them to do so we would be risking the destruction of the plant. In my opinion it is absolutely wrong to allow this plant for one month in the hands of incompetent people.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nN. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nMr. W. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe wish to tender you our report upon the completion of the water installation at Onion Lake Boarding School, Saskatchewan.\n\nThe whole of the work has been executed in a first class workmanlike manner, and has been left in the care of your Inspector, Mr. Hamilton, in good working order in so far as we were able to make a final test.\n\nThe 2\u00bd\" galvanized pipe has been run 95 ft. from the pump house to shore line, and 200 ft. from shore line into lake. There is a probability that later in the season the frost may reach this intake pipe at the shore line, owing to the fact that we were prevented from going deep enough at this point on account of the early freeze-up. In the event of a freeze-up, water can be hauled to concrete supply tank for the balance of the winter. I might state that we had teams hauling earth to cover over the pipe at shore line to a depth of approximately\napproximately 5 ft. This will require to be deepened at this point early next summer, in order to have a frost proof water intake.\n\nIn trying out the engine and pump we pumped direct into the pressure tanks from the lake, and raised 50 lbs. pressure in the tanks, which means, when you add for elevation, a pressure of 85 lbs. The storage supply tank was not ready to receive the water, hence the reason for pumping direct into pressure tanks.\n\nIn conclusion, after having noted the very complete and up-to-date heating, plumbing, lighting and water supply equipment in this building, it would seem to us nothing short of gross carelessness to intrust a plant of this description to the present staff.\n\nAs a suggestion, would recommend that a competent man be placed in charge for a sufficient time to allow the staff appointed to become thoroughly competent to carry on.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPAULIN & SWAYZE\n\nPer:- [Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He suggests as a remedy that a well should be dug about 20 feet from the water's edge into which water from the Lake would seep if sunk deep enough below the Lake level.\n\nAs I have no information from your Department as to the System you directed to be installed I am unable to offer any suggestions but feel it my duty in so urgent and important a matter to pass on to you the suggestions which the Principal has made.

COMMISSIONER GRAHAM,\nREGINA, DATED NOV. 3rd, 1925.\n\nWith reference to my telegram to you of the 31st ultimo dealing with the question of stable accommodation for the milk cows at the new Onion Lake School, it seems to me that it would be wise to build temporary shelter for these animals for this winter and the lumber used in such shelter could be used in the construction of the permanent barns next spring without any loss.\n\nI am informed that it will not be necessary to heat the building after the contractors leave, but I think it would be better to have the school opened without delay as there must be a certain amount of risk in not having the building heated.\n\nThere is no necessity, in my opinion, to have all the Live Stock owned by the school, sheltered at the school this winter, and the present lack of accommodation for all the stock need not cause delay in the opening of the school.\n\nx x x x\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION OF GOODS | LIST PRICE | GROSS EXTENSION | DISCOUNT | NET |\n|----------|----------------------|------------|-----------------|----------|-----|\n|          | Split Pulley S\" Shaft | 8.11       |                 |          |     |\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Lloydminster.\n\nMemo:\nFor new Church of England Residential School,\nOnion Lake Agency.\n\nCertified correct, goods received, price fair and just.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\n124 Eight 11/100 dollars\n\nIndian Affairs.

M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEncs.\nSir:\n\nI wish to bring to your attention that nothing has been done with regard to the stables and outbuildings at the new Onion Lake Indian Residential School, and I note that there was nothing put in the Estimates to cover this expenditure for next year. I would ask that an item of $4000.00 be placed in the Estimates for 1926-27, so that these buildings can be gone on with next Spring. For this winter, the school authorities will have to make some temporary arrangements to house their live stock.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 11, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your 309-11 A of the 29th ultimo and 3rd instant, I have to inform you that I have telegraphed to Dr. Westgate, asking him to arrange for an officer on the staff of the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School who would be competent to look after the mechanical plant of the new building.\n\nI have also your 309-11 A of the 3rd instant, with reference to outbuildings, and have to inform you that the advisability of an appropriation of $4,000 in the case of this school has been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nTORONTO, ONT., Nov. 10th 1925\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nIn preparation for our interview on Saturday morning next, I have thought that you would like to have copies of the following correspondence which has passed between Dr. Westgate and Mr. Commissioner Graham with regard to the Principal's residence and barns for the new Union Lake School, and also with regard to the report of the chemical analysis of the water taken from the Lake from which the supply for the new school is to be drawn.\n\nWith regard to the former matter I beg permission to draw your attention to my letter to the Honourable, the Superintendent General, dated Feb. 11th, 1925, of which copy was duly forwarded to you. Paragraph (4) of this letter states one of the points of agreement reached at that time, in the following words:\n\n\"That, in future, the Architect's plans for new Residential Schools to be administered by the Society shall include provision for....at least the main barns and associated buildings thus avoiding a repetition of the delays and losses to the Society which have occurred, and are now occurring, in connection with the occupancy of the new school on the Blood Reserve.\"\n\nThe statement of Mr. Commissioner Graham contained in his letter, copy enclosed, dated Oct. 31st, is in direct conflict with the agreement reached with the Honourable the Superintendent General. The Rev. Henry Ellis, who has done such valuable work as Principal of the Union Lake School has tendered his resignation to the Society rather than contemplate carrying out the proposal that, in lieu of having a proper residence provided for him in connection with the new School, he and his family should be cramped into narrow and unsatisfactory quarters which are designed as part of the ordinary accommodation of the new building and which were never intended to be occupied by the Principal and his family. It appears to me, further, to be quite impossible for us to enter into occupancy of the new school while, as Mr. Commissioner Graham states, no barns or associated outbuildings have been erected, or are likely to be erected before next Spring at the earliest. Under these circumstances, from the standpoint of the uncompleted...\nChemical and bacteriological examinations of the sample of water provided from the Lake, appears to me to have even more serious implications. No report was furnished the Church Authorities of the same, in fact no notice was apparently taken of the serious character of the bacteriological examination in reporting the presence of \"B. Coli\" (Bacillus Coli Communis, or the bacillus which is the recognized cause of typhoid). The analyst notes that the sample was not taken in accordance with the conditions necessary to a correct and proper examination. Making all allowances, however, for possible contamination from this source it seems clear that the water supply, in its present state, is so thoroughly open to suspicion and grave source of danger to health that, in my opinion, neither the Department nor the Church would be justified in placing the pupils and the staff of a large Indian Residential School in residence in the building before a further careful and competent examination has been carried out by the recognized Provincial Authorities who shall be held responsible not only for the actual chemical and bacteriological examination but for the actual securing, under all necessary precautionary methods, of the sample of the water from the part and depth of the Lake where the intake for the proposed water supply is located.\n\nThese matters are so important that I thought you would like to have this statement of my information concerning them for consideration before our interview on Saturday morning.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nS. [Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nCOPY\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nCanada.\n\n309-11A\n\nRe: Onion Lake School\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant, and as requested I am enclosing herewith a copy of the report of the analyst who analyzed the water in the lake from which the school supply is to be obtained.\n\nNothing has been done as yet with regard to the building of a barn and stable at this school, and I doubt whether anything will be done until Spring. Everything has been late in connection with building operations at this point, as we got started late in the season. As far as the main building is concerned, this will be ready for occupancy in a very short time. The matter of supplying the furnishings is now being attended to, for the school and chapel as well. Some other arrangements will have to be made for looking after the horses and cattle, as I am quite sure we cannot build the stable this year, in fact there is no appropriation for this expenditure.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd) W.M.

I did not have another analysis made of the lake water because I had spoken to the Department of Public Health here, and received the assurance that the water was of a quality suitable for institutional uses, and equal to any used by other country schools in the Province. It was the intention, however, to sink a well close to the edge of the lake and procure a supply by the process of filtration. This project, however, had to be abandoned as quick sand was found where it was proposed to sink this well. I do not think there is any cause for apprehension as to the nature of the water which will be used at the Onion Lake School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C.

Immediately it is possible to begin building operations in the spring; the necessary instructions will be sent for the erecting of the outbuildings and the principal's residence. I would ask you to do nothing further this fall regarding temporary outbuildings.\n\nFrom correspondence received the Church authorities are rather anxious about using the water from the lake, and I would ask you to have an analysis made in accordance with the instructions already sent you, and submit same to the Department, in order that we may determine the type of filter that should be installed.\n\nPlease let me have an estimate of the cost of providing the necessary outbuildings, the principal's residence and the deepening of the water supply pipe to the lake.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.

(RG 10, Volume 6321, file 658-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant 195-1-5, informing me that you do not think it will be practicable, under present conditions, to have the staff and pupils moved into the new Onion Lake School this Fall, and it will, therefore, be necessary to employ a man for the winter months to act as caretaker and fireman, to say nothing of the expense of supplying fuel.\n\nI am indeed surprised that you think it necessary to take this course of action. This building is completed in every detail, after a good deal of rushing of the work towards the end. The water system is in good shape. I have had the water from the lake tested the second time and it is reported to me by the Government Analyst as being excellent water. The lighting plant is installed and ready for use. In fact any work that I had anything to do with was rushed along to completion and as I say, the school is ready for occupancy now, and to get a letter at this late date, saying that it is proposed not to open the school until Spring is very disappointing. You wired me a short time ago to have temporary barns erected at this school; this I did, and the barns are now complete.\n\nIn speaking to the Building Inspector, who returned from Onion Lake a few days ago, he tells me that the Principal has already started to move some of the furniture into the building, and that he fully expects to go ahead and occupy the new school at once, and what could have happened I do not know. It is hard to believe that the school authorities would rather continue to occupy the old building they are now in, and have a new building six miles over that they could move into and carry on their work under very much improved conditions. I think myself that the Department have not been fully advised of the exact conditions existing. There has been no holdup of any work to its end that I can see. The furnishings that I had anything to do with were ordered and are possibly at Onion Lake by now.\n\nIf this building is not occupied this fall, the Department are going to be called upon to pay out over a thousand dollars which I consider will be an absolutely unnecessary expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6321, file 658-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith the final estimate in favor of Mr. James Friel, General Contractor, on account of work performed on the new Indian Residential School at Onion Lake. This comprises the figures for the contract price plus extras allowed. The statement of extras due the contractor dated the 19th of November contains items which I will explain as follows:\n\n$241.96.- This was extra work entailed for providing for the installation of the pressure tanks and included excavating, underpinning of the walls and the cutting of a doorway through the concrete wall from the boiler room.\n\n33.79.- This was for providing double doors on the dormitory floor authorized by the Department in their letter of the 6th of July.\n\n25.80.- The contractor who installed the lighting plant insisted on a partition being built to keep the batteries separate from the rest of the plant and avoid the possibility of damage to the plant by fumes arising from the battery during the process of recharging it.\n\n4.99.- This item covers the building of shelves to hold the battery.\n\n30.04.- This represents an extra for providing tables in the lavatories, these items not having been provided for in the original specifications.\n\n4.85.- No cover was allowed in the plans or specifications to carry the outlet for the ash hoist and this item represents the cost of providing one.\n\n7.40.- This wood tank was let into the ground outside the building by the contractor who furnished the lighting plant and is provided to receive the metal gasoline containers as they are purchased from time to time.\n\n15.30.- This is the contractor's charge for hauling the batteries in his own vehicle from Lloydminster to the school site a distance of 43 miles and which I have allowed as a fair charge.\n\n61.15.- Is for providing material for and setting up the engine base including cement, sand, bolts etc., and the freighting of the engine from Lloydminster.\n\n3.16.- This represents the cost of providing cement, etc., for bases for two pumps.\n\n16.90.- This represents the charge for two concrete cradles to support the pressure tanks.\n\n4.50.- It was necessary to provide an air pipe from the water cistern to the side of the building and to the top of it and this item covers the contract charge for digging the trench for the pipe.\nAfter boilers had been installed by the sub-contractor, the water supply to the building had not been completed, as a test of the boilers was desirable before the sub-contractor left the premises and the weather at that time was cold and uncertain. I authorized the contractor to haul water from the lake and this charge represents the cost of hauling, which under the circumstances I consider fair and reasonable and have allowed.\n\nThe original specifications for the piping for the water line called for the installation of 1\u00bd\" pipe. It was afterwards considered, after consultation with Mr. Beattie, the local supervisor in Swayze who was charged in special work at the school that 2\u00bd\" pipe was more desirable, and would give better service, and you will recall you sanctioned the change. The contractors however laid and connected 320 ft. of the 1\u00bd\" pipe and this item represents a fair and reasonable charge for making the change to the larger sized pipe. This item was allowed by the Department in their letter of the 15th of October.\n\nIn regard to the extra wiring etc., I have to offer the following explanation of the various items:\n\n$14.00 - The plan provided for one switch which turned on all the lights on in the ground floor corridor. The Principal of the School suggested that the control of the lights should be so arranged that only one centre light need be turned on at times when it was unnecessary to light the whole corridor.\n\n$16.35 - This item you allowed and covers the provision of a switch and light for the coal and wood room which had not been provided for in the plans. The items of $9.00, $2.50 and $2.85 were incurred owing to the necessity of providing two fire doors on the dormitory floor after the Department had decided that folding doors should be placed in the centre of the corridor.\n\n$10.29 - The plan provided push buttons to control the fire alarms, as these push buttons were not protected and could be tampered with by any of the pupils at the school it was thought desirable to cover them with suitable alarm boxes, and the cost of these represent the difference between the alarm boxes and the original push buttons.\n\nThe two next items of $7.00 each represent the cost of providing controls in the staff rooms of the night lights in the two dormitories and were authorized by you.\n\nThe items for the light over the automatic pump were provided on the advice of Mr. Paulin of Paulin & Swayne who installed the pump, and the connections from the switch board to the motor on the automatic pump were of course necessary for its operation.\nThe item of $55.90 was the cost of the five light fixtures which you selected and sent forward for use in the Chapel.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBuilding Inspector.\nCHURCH OF ENGLAND INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nONION LAKE SASK.\n\nFinal Estimate\n\nContract completed as per Plans and Specifications $58500.00\n\nExtras authorized as follows:\nQuotation for Sewage Disposal Plant $1143.00\nWater Line 702 ft. @ 90\u00a2 per foot 631.80\nQuotation for staining shingles 266.45\nQuotation for Pump House & Storage Tank 1600.00\nPainting interior trim of portion of Basement and whole of attic floor, instead of staining & Varnishing. 264.95\nExtras on Electric Wiring, attached hereto 182.76\nExtras as per Statement of Nov. 19th, attached hereto 670.65 4521.61\n\nLess 10% on Contract $5850.00\n\" Amount paid on Estimate #1 4444.55\n\" \" \" \" \" #2 20717.22\n\" \" \" \" \" #3 10139.38\n\" \" \" \" \" #4 10191.51\n\" \" \" \" \" #5 3824.27 55067.93\n\nFinal Estimate less 10% Hold Back 7953.68\n63021.61\n\nDated at Regina, Sask.,\nNov. 25th, 1925\n\nBuilding Inspector,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRe: Church of England Indian Residential School Onion Lake\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose the following documents relative to the Onion Lake Residential School which has just been completed.\n\n1. The final estimate incorporating a list of extras amounting to $4,821.65 together with my certificate for the final payment due the contractor of $7965.55.\n\n2. A detail of the contractors extras amounting to $673.65.\n\n3. A detail of the contractors extras for wiring amounting to $182.76.\n\n4. My certificate on behalf of the Department accepting the building as completed.\n\n5. A letter explaining the items comprising the extras allowed amounting to $673.65 and $182.76.\n\nI may add that I remained on the job from the time I arrived after appointment until the building was completed.\n\nThe grading around the building was done and left in a condition satisfactory to the Principal of the School.\n\nThe covering of the pipe line from the lake to the storage tank had not properly settled and the contractor therefore under my direction built up the earth over the line of the excavation to a height sufficient to insure that after gradual settlement the ground will be automatically leveled.\n\nBefore I left I purchased, under your instructions, sufficient lumber to erect a temporary barn and arranged for the building of this, and expect it has now been completed. I also bought the lumber as directed by you to provide shelving in the kitchen, the two clothing rooms, the two linen rooms, and the two store rooms, and left a competent man in charge to do the work.\n\nThe plant at the school was tested and operated satisfactorily.\nRegina, Sask, November 29th, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI am surprised to learn that there has been a question raised regarding the water system at the new Onion Lake School, which was installed under my personal supervision.\n\nYou will recall when I returned from Onion Lake I said there might be a possibility of the system freezing at the entrance of the pipes to the lake, owing to the heavy early frost, but this is only a possibility, and if we have a good fall of snow, as I think we will, there will be no chance whatever of this happening. Since I left there, your Mr. Hamilton covered this pipe with about five feet of earth, according to my instructions, and to me there is only a bare possibility of it freezing in any event.\n\nIf it is a question of not opening the school, on a chance of this system not working, all I can say is that to my mind this is absolutely absurd, and the man who gave this information cannot be very anxious to see the school opened. If your informant is of the same calibre as the Principal of this school, who is to be left in charge of this plant, I am not surprised at any reports you will get. As I stated to you before, this man is utterly incompetent to handle machinery of any kind, and these remarks will be borne out, I am sure, by Mr. Hamilton your own Inspector, who is familiar with the situation. A practical man would never have put these imaginary obstacles in the way of opening the school.\n\nWith regard to the well that is suggested. This is not necessary, and I do not consider it practical. The system you now have installed will work, and work well, and will give you better water because the pipes have been run out to the deep portion of the lake and take the water from where I imagine this lake is being fed by springs, and I understand from you that the Government Analyst reports this water as perfect.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nI may say\nI may say that I will guarantee if this system should freeze up this winter, I will go back to Onion Lake in the spring or summer and take the responsibility of putting it in so that it will not freeze, and if after that it should freeze, I will refund to you the cost of the work.\n\nIf the present system should freeze by any chance, owing to the fact that we do not get a heavy fall of snow, which I look for to further protect the pipes, there is, as you know, a storage tank at the school which holds about 8000 gallons of water - three or four days supply - in addition to two steel storage tanks in the school, which possibly hold another 2500 gallons, and it would be a simple matter to have a threshing tank haul water and empty it into this storage tank at the school, as the lake is only about 200 yards away from the building and you have an automatic pump attached to the tank to draw the water into the pressure tank. It might take four trips a day to do this, and even if it cost $1.00 or $1.50 a day to keep this supply of water there it would not be very much.\n\nE. P. Paulin,\nPAULIN & SWAYZE\n\n(Sgd) E. P.

I was empowered to supply whatever shelving and cupboards were necessary.\n\nI may say that when I did receive the Department's instructions to put in the necessary shelving I took the matter up with the Principal, Rev. Mr. Ellis, and asked him to give me a complete list of what was required, which he did, and at that time he did not mention clothes cupboards in the dormitories. Upon receipt of this list I went into the matter carefully and ordered the necessary material to supply the shelving equipment asked for by the Principal. Dr. Westgate is now at the school and wants a lot more cupboard space provided, which, as far as I can see is quite unnecessary, as I have provided a shelf for each individual pupil to hold his clothing, as well as accommodation for new clothing.

December 3, 1925\n\nDear Mr. Scotts-\n\nMr. Hamilton, the Building Inspector at the new Onion Lake Indian Residential School, whose services terminated a week ago, brought me in a letter this morning that he received from Mr. Walter Street, the man to whom he gave the job of putting shelving in all the existing clothes closets, six in number. In this letter Mr. Street states that Dr. Westgate had arrived at the school, and that he is making the shelves to suit Dr. Westgate. This is after authority had been given and the bargain made with Mr. Street. He also states that Dr. Westgate said he would have to build wardrobes, with drawers underneath, in the dormitories for each child to put his clothes in, and he asks for instructions as to whether he should do this or not.\n\nDr. Westgate has no right whatever to go on to a Government job and interfere with the work of the men who take their instructions from the proper source, and he should be told so. As to the necessity of building wardrobes in the dormitories, I cannot see this. We have had individual shelves put up for each boy's outfit and each girl's outfit in the clothes closets provided for this purpose, one for the boys' and one for the girls'. On the next flat we have put shelves for goods not in use in four closets, and in my opinion it is absurd to go to the expense of spending another $1000.00 or more to put shelving in the dormitories, to say nothing of the fact that it will more or less disfigure the rooms.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIt is rather\nIt is rather difficult for me to carry on work and to have Dr. Westgate going through the country as he has been doing, not on one occasion, but on several, and finding fault with the way things were done, and trying to make changes. It is not in the interests of good work or discipline, and while I have no desire to have any controversy with Dr. Westgate or his superior officers, I must insist that he does not interfere as he is doing.\n\nWhile dealing with this subject I might say that if this school is not to be opened this winter it is hard for me to understand. Everything is in first-class shape, and if there is delay, Dr. Westgate I think is responsible for it. With regard to the water system, I am enclosing herewith the report of the Analytical Chemist, and the Bacteriologist of the Provincial Laboratory, Dept. of Health, as well as the opinion of Mr. R.H. Murray, Director, Division of Sanitation. The first report indicated that we were perfectly safe in going ahead and using this water, but Dr. Westgate saw fit some time ago to take this matter up with you, and you wired me for a second report.\n\nIt is not very satisfactory trying to carry on business in this way. I do my very best to meet the Department's wishes in everything, and in this case there were no grounds whatever for criticising anything that was done by the Department in connection with getting this school into order. I learn from the Inspector that Mr. Hamilton received a letter from the man who built the temporary stables to the effect that Dr. Westgate had instructed him to do some banking around this building. It was not my intention to incur any expenditure in having this banking done. Straw was to be used for this purpose and covered over with snow after the buildings were occupied. Why should the Department pay for anything that Dr. Westgate orders? I never feel sure when I give an order that somebody will not come along and alter it. This should cease.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, December 9, 1925.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 209-11 A of the 3rd instant, with reference to Dr. Westgate's visit to the new Onion Lake Indian Residential School. When you are submitting vouchers in favour of the contractor who is putting in the shelving, etc., you should indicate what expense, if any, has not been authorized by you. At the first opportunity, Dr. Westgate will be informed that he will have to make requests through the proper channels if he is desirous of any changes in the buildings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6321, file 658-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDec. 12, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the electric lighting fixtures for the new Onion Lake Indian Residential School, I beg to say that a letter dated June 16th was received from Mr. Friel, the contractor, asking that Mr. Matthew Kyle of Regina be furnished with a list of the electric lighting fixtures required. This letter was replied to on the 23rd of June, and Mr. Friel was advised to take this matter up with you, as you were being authorized to arrange for the selecting of the lighting fixtures. A letter was addressed to you on the 23rd of June also, advising you of the letter received from Mr. Friel, and asking you to arrange for the selecting of the lighting fixtures required for this building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, SASK.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6321, file 658-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nOn the 15th of July last I forwarded to the Secretary a list of electric light fixtures prepared by the Principal for use in the new Onion Lake Residential School, but find on reference to the file here that I received no acknowledgement or any advice as to what arrangements the Department proposed to make in regard to the selection of these fixtures. I presume that after the receipt of my letter and enclosure the matter was taken up direct with the contractor, and I am not aware of what arrangements the Department made to check the fixtures ordered and used for the purpose of ascertaining whether they were of the proper type and standard and came within or exceeded the allowance of $500.00 which the contractor was to include in his estimates of the total cost of the building. I understand from Mr. W.A. Hamilton that he had no instructions, and did not check the material supplied, and that invoices were not submitted to him for scrutiny or approval.\n\nIt is important that the Department should have access to the contractor's invoices and the assurance that the material supplied was up to standard and satisfactory to the Department. In the list of extras submitted with other documents under cover of my letter to you of the 30th ultimo is a schedule of allowances for extras in connection with the lighting arrangements and this includes an item of $55.00 for\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nfor a five light fixture for the Chapel. This the Inspector of Construction informs me was included by him in the list of extras on the ground that a five light fixture was used in place of a three light, as provided for in the estimates, and this change he further informs me was made at the instigation of the Principal. If the Department will give me the particulars of the arrangements made I can arrange for a proper check of the contractor's charges under the head of \"Electric Light Installation\". It would have been better if the Department had allowed the selection of the fixtures to be made in this office when the Inspector would have received instructions to check the work of the electrician. As it stands all the information he can give me is that fixtures were installed where required, but cannot inform me whether they were up to standard.\n\nI note that in all specifications issued by the Department a lump sum is allowed for electric light fixtures. I do not think this is the best or most economical method of dealing with the subject. The Department itself should buy the fixtures and under this arrangement could specify its requirements and procure competitive prices. The Inspector of Construction would then know definitely what class of material was required and had been ordered and keep a proper check. I shall be glad to have the information asked for as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner,\nWith reference to your #115-1-5 dated the 20th ultimo in regard to vouchers forwarded to you under cover of my letter of the 11th idem covering sundry expenses incurred when installing the water system at the new Onion Lake School. I have to advise you that these represent expenditures incurred by Messrs Paulin & Swayze who performed the installation. All these vouchers are chargeable against the cost of the installation of the water system and will later appear in a statement being prepared by Messrs Paulin and Swayze covering the whole of the expenditure in connection therewith. I would therefore request the Department to pass them for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a photograph of the new Onion Lake Indian Residential School. You will notice that the front porch is not completed. I will send you one of the completed building as soon as I receive same.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. W. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have received a letter from the Rev. Principal of the Onion Lake School asking if he can be provided with a new bake oven for the new building. The one at present in use was originally in the old Battleford Industrial School for a long period before being sent to Onion Lake, and it would appear, therefore, that the request for a new bake oven is not unreasonable.\n\nEquipment of this nature cannot be procured in Regina and perhaps the Department will arrange to make the purchase. The one now in use is a Reid's #60 purchased from the firm at Buffalo, New York. The Principal, however, has forwarded me a leaf from the Mooney's catalogue sheet #K.E. 30, and asks to be provided with a #40 bake oven as illustrated therein. It should be understood, however, that it must be furnished with a wood fuel burning box. Please advise me what action the Department takes in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDecember 17th\n1925\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Onion Lake School.\n\nOn December 15th I received from your Department a Cheque for $5981.90, which was presumably to clean up the 10% Hold-back on my Contract for above School.\n\nWill you be good enough to advise me as to how this amount was arrived at?, as it does not correspond with my books, nor, so far as I can determine, with the copies of estimates furnished to me.\n\nYours truly\nJAMES PRIEL\npen\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant 115-1-6, with reference to Dr. Westgate's visit to the Onion Lake Indian Residential School, and note that you ask me when submitting vouchers in favour of the contractor who is putting in the shelving, etc., to indicate what expense, if any, has not been authorized by me. I presume you wish me to let you know what work was done under Dr. Westgate's instructions given to the contractor over my head. Do you not think it is putting me in a very awkward position if you pay these accounts? If it is your intention to pay them it would have been much better for me to have said nothing about Dr. Westgate's interference.\n\nI am getting tired of carrying on business in this way. I have been told repeatedly by the Minister that all matters pertaining to buildings here in the West were to be left in my hands, and it seems to me that no matter how hard I try there is always some mix-up; due, I feel, to the fact that those representing the Church have not a proper understanding of the matter. I would like to feel that when instructions are given by me to carry out work that the Department are right behind me, and my experience has been that they have not given me this support. I am not unreasonable in this matter at all. I think any business man who knew the circumstances would say that I have grounds for complaint.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\n115-1-5B\n\nOttawa, December 29, 1925.\n\nMr. Ferrier,\n\nI have read Mr. Graham's letter of December 16. It does not seem to me that Mr. Graham has any cause for complaint in this matter or in the conduct of the building programme generally, but I think it is quite useless to tell him so. I think the matter had better be allowed to drop. When the accounts come in for payment, you might let me see them.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant 115-1-5 with reference to the electric lighting fixtures for the new Onion Lake Indian Residential School. You point out that a letter was written to me on the 23rd of June, advising me of a letter received by the Department from Mr. Priel, and asking me to arrange for the selection of lighting fixtures required for this building. I may say that I received the letter referred to, and on receipt of it I took the matter up as to the requirements in the way of fixtures at this school, and submitted a list to you on the 16th of July, asking you to check it over very carefully. I expected that I would get the Department's approval on this list, after which I would obtain competitive prices and either cut the list down or add to it, so long as I kept the cost within the $500.00 allowed. I have no acknowledgement of this letter. I do not know whether it was ever received or not, and what I would like to know now is who placed the order for the fixtures, and were they bought at a reasonable rate. I think I was entitled to a reply to my letter of the 16th of July, and I am of the opinion that this matter could have been handled in a more satisfactory manner than it was.\n\nYou will note on the final estimate forwarded for the contractor that an item of $65.00 is shown as an extra for providing a five-light fixture, and the Department should be satisfied that the remaining fixtures purchased, exhausted the appropriation of $500.00 before this item is paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6321, file 658-5, part 3)\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n23rd, November 1925.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nWhen visiting the new Onion Lake School today, Mr. Street, the Carpenter informed me that he was authorized to place shelves in the kitchen, the two clothing rooms, the two linen rooms and the two store rooms only. As clothes cupboards are very necessary in each of the four dormitories I beg to suggest that Mr. Street be authorized to have these built as well. They should be modelled after those built in the dormitories of the Old Sun School. On reading over Mr. Ellis' copy of the Department's letter to you dated Oct. 20th, No. 115-1-12 I find that you have been empowered to supply whatever shelving and cupboards are necessary.\n\nWith regards to the hauling of the equipment from Lloydminster to the school, I regret to have to inform you that the school management will be unable to render any assistance in this connection. The delay in completing the school ready for occupation is placing so heavy a burden upon the staff that they are quite unable to spare a man or the team from the school premises when wood and hay have to be hauled from the new site in addition to the multifarious other duties. I shall be obliged therefore, if you will make other arrangements for the transportation of the equipment.\n\nI should mention also that in order to keep the batteries from going to utter ruin the engineer on our staff has been charging them from time to time. As gasoline is required for this and the Principal has been paying for the same, I shall be obliged if you will instruct your Agent Mr. Turner, to reimburse him for what he has already spent and purchase a sufficient quantity to enable the batteries to be charged regularly until such time as the water system is corrected, and the whole plant made ready for occupation.\n\nBelieve me,\nYours very truly,\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI enclose for your information a copy of a letter which I addressed to Mr. Commissioner Graham during my visit to the Onion Lake School last month. As I have not received any acknowledgement of the receipt of this letter I am uncertain as to what action, if any, has been taken with regard to the cupboards mentioned in the first paragraph, and will be obliged if you will undertake to see that these are provided.\n\nIn addition to the clothes cupboards mentioned above I beg to state that the following requirements had not been provided at the time of my visit:\n\n1. A guard or railing to be built around the dynamo, belts, pulleys, switch-board, etc. in the engine room.\n2. An ash lift from the furnace room (can, rope, crank, pulleys).\n3. Lockers with clothes hooks built, in each recreation room.\n4. Hooks for towels in the wash rooms, also brackets for tooth-brushes, mugs, combs, etc.\n5. Paper holders in toilets.\n6. Ventilator in the engine house on the lake shore to carry off gas fumes.\n7. Eave-troughs (and down pipes) all around main building, also cement soft-water tank.\n8. Erection of a railing along both sides of the open ditch leading from the septic tank.\n9. Have the verandah on the west end of the main building screened so as to be mosquito proof.\n\nIf you will issue instructions to have 1 to 6 of the above provided immediately, and the others, not later than the end of April I shall be very deeply obliged.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF.\nSir:\n\nI have received a letter from Mr. James Priel the contractor who erected the Indian Residential School at Onion Lake asking me to recommend the payment to him of the sum he deposited when submitting his tender, amounting to $5,850.00, pointing out that one or two minor items of work to complete the building are about completed. This is substantially confirmed by a letter I have received from Mr. W.A. Hamilton who was the Inspector, and it would appear therefore, there would be no reason on this account to withhold payment to the contractor of the amount mentioned. I must, however, refer to my letter of the 16th instant with reference to the payment for the lighting fixtures, in which I drew attention to the inclusion of an extra for providing a five light fixture, and suggested to the Department that it should be satisfied that this payment is in order before a final settlement with the contractor is made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6321, file 658-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Department #115-1-5 dated the 19th ultimo with reference to the installation of the water system at the new Onion Lake Church of England School, I find that on the 22nd and 26th of May last I wrote you on this subject. At that time it had been proposed and it was the intention to sink a well close to the lake shore which would be supplied with water by the means of filtration; difficulties arose, however, which necessitated the abandoning of this part of the scheme. It was then decided to sink a well near the lake which was to be fed by intake from the lake. From the well an engine will pump the water into a storage tank near the building and inside the building an automatic electric pump will force the water from the storage tank into the twin distributing tanks within the building.

I refer to your last letter re Mr Westgate wanting wardrobes built in dormitories and that is what I meant by getting instructions from the proper party and that is Mr Graham or his authorized representative, and I might say that the banking up of the stable might have been done by the mission themselves, you done right by letting Gardner go as there would have been nothing much for him to do when the stable was finished. I note that you located a vein of water with the willow, do you think there is a chance of a good quantity of water and how deep the well would be, I would like to get all the information I can as I feel sure that there is going to be trouble with the present system, and anything you can do towards helping us to remedy the trouble will be appreciated, thanking you in advance for a reply at your earliest convenience re the work at the school and also the water prospects I remain.\n\nYours respt,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I wrote to him about the work we had done and sent in our Time Sheets. I said when Dr. Westgate was here he mentioned about Rails & Hooks in Class Rooms and Wardrobes in Dormitories etc. I said please let me know if this work is going to be done at your earliest convenience. I never said Dr. Westgate ordered this work to be done. Dr. Westgate told me on leaving he would write as soon as he got back to the mission for permission to have this work done as he wasn't going straight back to Regina.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6321, file 658-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nletter would get there before him. He didn't say whether he was writing to Regina or Ottawa. I took it for granted he meant Regina. He asked me who I was working for and I said for Mr. Hamilton Inspector at Regina.\n\nMy letter wasn't sent until a week after Dr. Westgate was here so they must have known all about it before then. If Dr. Westgate didn't write to Regina then my letter would be the first they had heard of it. I wondered if that was it by the answer I got back from Mr. Hamilton. Anyway the work suggested by Dr. Westgate has not been done as I was not authorized from Regina to do it.\n\nHoping this will clear up any misunderstanding & rendering\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nWalter Street\n\nIndian Affairs.

I can firmly state that no instructions were ever given by you or myself to have this work done - for authority was asked after the inspection was made in a letter that was typed by myself to the Commissioner which was dated on the 23rd of November, he having received instructions from Ottawa to have all the necessary shelving etc. done.\n\nUnder these circumstances I fail to see how anyone connected with our Society could ever be accused of ordering work to be done without first obtaining the authority from the Department, and can only suggest that any misunderstanding that has taken place has been through the misinterpretation of Mr. Hamilton, the inspector of construction of Mr. Street's letter.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The letters enclosed herewith are as follows:\n\nMr. Street, carpenter, Lloydminster to Rev. Henry Ellis, Jan. 4th, 1926.\nRev. Henry Ellis, Principal Onion Lake School to me, Jan. 7th, 1926.\nW. A. Hamilton, Regina, to Mr. Street, Lloydminster, Dec. 3rd, 1925.\nW. A. Hamilton, Regina, to Mr. Street, Lloydminster, Dec. 14th, 1925.\n\nIn addition to the evidence contained in the above letters I beg to direct your attention to my letter of Nov. 23rd last, addressed to Mr. Commissioner Graham from the Onion Lake School, a copy of which was forwarded to your Department on Dec. 21st, 1925. In this letter you will observe that the Commissioner was requested to authorize the construction of cupboards in the four dormitories. His\nattention was also directed to the Departmental letter of Oct. 20th, (115-1-12) which empowered him to have the necessary cupboards supplied.\n\nIn addition to the refutation which the above letters furnish to Mr. Commissioner Graham's accusation I beg to state that no order whatever for work to be done, was issued by me during my visit to the Onion Lake School, and I am strongly of the opinion that the Commissioner should be advised to be more guarded in his statements, and to refrain from making accusations, such as the one in question, which are not capable of being corroborated by the facts of the case.\n\nBelieve me,\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This request was made by the Principal at the suggestion of Dr. Westgate, who says,\n\n\"With regard to the laundry building it was understood when this was built that it would be moved to the new site when the building was completed. Kindly take this matter up with the Indian Agent and ask him to undertake the moving. I shall be glad to have your recommendation as to the use to which it could be applied when it reaches the new site.\"\n\nDr. Westgate is asking us to move a building, without knowing for what purpose he wishes to use it. However, the Principal in writing to the Agent says that at some later date it could be converted into a Farmer's residence. If the Department wish to spend $100.00 in having the building moved we could probably have this done.\n\nThere is another small building which could be moved at the same time, which I understand they would like to use as a storehouse.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW.

The Company quoted me a price for installing of $190.00, and this I accepted. It will be seen, however, from the statement which now accompanies the voucher that the cost to the Company greatly exceeded the amount which they undertook to accept for the installation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

I do not see why the Department should be called on to make payments of this kind; I think it is a proper charge against the running expenses of the school. However, in view of certain circumstances I am sending this bill on for you to decide what shall be done. I am deducting $6.00 of a charge for barrel. I do not see why the barrel could not be returned. Will you kindly advise me what you intend to do in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

E. Indian Residential School. I note that the cost of moving the laundry building, which will be eventually used as a farmer's residence, will be approximately $100. Please see that no unnecessary expense is incurred.\n\nI have also your 309-11 A of the 10th instant, enclosing an account in favour of this school for 27 gallons of liquid gloss.

Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, #116-1-5B, informing me that you had received a letter from the Rev. Doctor Westgate, dealing with the matter of additional cupboards required in the new Onion Lake School, and reply to say that all cupboards provided for in the plans, which I think were ample, have been equipped with proper shelving, and the facilities for looking after the clothing of the pupils at this school now are as good as at most of our large schools.\n\nI know that Dr. Westgate wants the Department to install an individual cupboard for every pupil attending the Onion Lake School, probably 100. Does the Department consider this necessary? These cupboards are to be put on the walls of the dormitories. We have no such cupboards in Qu'Appelle, File Hills, Elkhorn or Round Lake Schools, nor have requests for same ever been received from any of these schools. Surely the old and experienced school workers should know what they require. Unfortunately, neither of the Inspectors is here, or I would be able to enumerate the schools in Manitoba. I think we would find that cupboards such as Dr. Westgate requests are not in use in any of the schools in that Province.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nYou will recall that I tried to get the Onion Lake School opened in January. The specifications did not call for shelving in the clothes closets and I had these put in at once, and the work was just completed in December. I informed the Agent that the matter of cupboards in the dormitories would not be gone on with this year in any event, and I should like to know now if the Department wish me to have cupboards installed such as Dr. Westgate asks for.\n\nMr. Murison is now in the Battleford district and will be going to Onion Lake before he returns this spring, and I could have him look into the matter and ascertain if additional cupboard space is actually required. I would prefer to act on the advice of the Inspector and the Principal in this matter. I may point out that to install these individual cupboards would be a very expensive undertaking. Kindly let me know what you wish me to do.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nMarch 6, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 2nd instant with further reference to the additional cupboards, etc., asked for in the new Onion Lake School, I note in your letter that Mr. Harrison will be at the Onion Lake School before returning to Regina, and I would ask you to have him report after consulting with the Rev. Principal as to the actual requirements in the way of additional cupboards and also the probable cost of same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. M.

Taylor, Onion Lake, Saskatchewan, for Freight - new Onion Lake C. of E. School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Commissioner Graham:\n\nI have to inform you that I am of the opinion that the engine now running the lighting plant at the Onion Lake new school is not powerful enough to carry the load. When charging the batteries between 25 and 30 amperes, the engine gets so hot that the exhaust valve chips off, and besides the heavy knock in the engine, the charge has to be reduced to 10 amperes which means that we are unable to get the batteries over a half charge.\n\nTo run continuously as we are now will mean that the exhaust valve will have to be changed at least every two weeks. Even when charging the batteries in the evening, carrying only the lights that are required at 110 volts, we have to further reduce the amperes to 5 which means that we are taking more out of the storage batteries than can be put in, and to continue doing this it will be impossible to prevent the batteries from becoming completely discharged.\n\nTo overcome this difficulty of constantly changing the valves, which are in such a state that they are too badly chipped to be reground, I would recommend that the present engine be replaced with a 20 h.p. new engine, or the same make, which to my mind is the best engine on the market.\n\nFurther, to prevent our plant from being at a standstill while the above change is being made, would you kindly order by telegram to the Fairbanks-Morse Co., Winnipeg or Regina to be forwarded to us by Express the following repair parts, viz:-\n\n1. Exhaust Valve - ZRA-10\n2. Cylinder Gaskets - ZRA-190B\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPrincipal.\n17th February, 1926.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 9th instant with regard to the lighting plant and for your information I have to inform you that we are charging the batteries in series, which means that only half the charge is going into each of them, therefore it is necessary to charge them at a higher rate than if we were charging them in parallel.\n\nI am of the opinion that the engine is worn out, for though we have changed the exhaust valve three times in nearly two months, it does not seem to retain the compression. When pumping the water from the storage tank into the compression tanks when starting up the one h.p. motor at the pump, the engine is killed, which proves I think that the engine cannot take care of the smallest load. Since we have occupied the school we have consumed five hundred and thirty gallons of gasoline.\n\nWe have recently had an inspection from Mr. Lightcap of the Globeite Battery Company of Winnipeg, and I have thoroughly explained the situation to him, who will be able to give you full details of our position.\n\nMr. Lightcap loaned and installed an ampere hour meter for a short time, which is a great help, for it indicates and registers the amount of electricity taken out of the batteries when not charging, also it registers the amount put in when charging, which will now eliminate any guess work.\n\nThe first day's reading showed that 50 ampere hours were taken from the battery during the evening and it registered 65 at breakfast time the next morning. After reducing the cutting off certain lights that we could do without, the second day's reading showed 35 at night and 47\u00bd in the morning after breakfast. It took seven and a half hours running the engine to bring the batteries again to full charge.\nMr. Lightcap rescued a new exhaust valve while he was here, and I am hoping that it will stand up better than the ones that we have put in ourselves. This, however, remains to be seen.\n\nI would like very much to retain the ampere hour meter if you can at all make it possible for us to retain it.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nPrincipal\nWinnipeg, March 4, 1926.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the same way, expenditure which is incurred through the installation of defective or unsuitable mechanical appliances, could hardly be attributed to unsatisfactory supervision on the part of the staff. To illustrate what I mean in this connection, I enclose herewith copies of letters dated February 4th and February 17th addressed by the principal of the Onion Lake School to Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham in connection with the difficulty he was experiencing with the engine installed. This is one instance amongst others which might be mentioned where the installation of an unsuitable instrument is costing not your Department but our Society a very considerable sum of money as no less than 300 gallons of gasoline had been consumed by this engine up to the 3rd of February of this year.\n\nThe engine, the Principal writes, though running well is not heavy enough to carry a full load, and I shall be obliged if you will give this matter your careful consideration and arrange for a sufficiently powerful engine to be installed to take its place.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT. B. R. Westgate.\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| March 9 | To expenses in connection with bringing representative of Fairbanks-Morse Engine Co., from Lloydminster to Onion Lake new school and return; as per receipts attached. | |\n| Feb. 24 | Hotel expenses, Lloydminster | 3.00 |\n| Mar. 1 | | 3.00 |\n| Feb. 24 | Stabling and feed | 2.20 |\n| Mar. 1 | | 2.20 |\n\nMemo:\nThe engine at new school was not running properly and the Fairbanks-Morse Co. were asked to send a man to examine it.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6321, file 658-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith an account in favour of The Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company, Limited, amounting to $113.80, and to make the following remarks in connection therewith.\n\nOn the 4th of February, last, I received a letter from Mr. Ellis, Principal of the Onion Lake School, stating that he was of the opinion that the engine which was operating the lighting plant had not power enough to carry the load. He stated \"When charging the batteries between 25 and 30 amperes, the engine gets so hot that the exhaust valve chips off, and besides the heavy knock in the engine, the charge has to be reduced to 10 amperes which means that we are unable to get the batteries over half a charge.\" He goes on to state a lot of other difficulties which he was having. I replied to this letter saying that there was something radically wrong, and that I was taking the matter up with the Company, which I did, informing them of the contents of Mr. Ellis's letter. I received a reply from them saying that they hardly thought the trouble could be along the lines suggested by Mr. Ellis, and that they were of the opinion that something else was wrong. A lot of detailed information was given to me, which I passed on to Mr. Ellis. After considerable correspondence on the matter I decided that Mr. Ellis could not begin to adjust the difficulty and called upon the Company to send a man up. This was really the only thing that I could do and this bill is the result.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI may point out that in installing the lighting fixtures in this building a number of very large lamps were used, which were quite unnecessary, and when the whole load is on, the plant is naturally carrying a peak load which it was never intended to do.\n\nYou will recall that this engine was sent to Duck Lake School where it was thought it would supply power for the lighting of a school at least twice as big as the Onion Lake School. It was found that it could not do this, however, and I transferred it to Onion Lake, thinking that it would answer the purpose there quite well, and I am still of the opinion that if properly handled it can do this.\n\nYou would be surprised to see the amount of correspondence I have in this office in connection with lighting plants and other details. It takes up a great deal of my time and I believe that if the Department would insist upon having competent men to run our lighting plants they would save the salaries of these men over and over again. The report on this engine at Onion Lake shows clearly that it was not properly handled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nR. Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nI enclose herewith some suggestions in the way of drawings and copies of extracts from letters received from the Rev. Henry Ellis, Principal of our Society's school at Onion Lake with regard to the stock barn and the Principal's residence required at this institution.\n\nI regret that I have not had time to carefully examine the drawings as they just came in this morning, and I have been unexpectedly called East and am leaving this afternoon. It seems to me, however, that the suggestions made by Mr. Ellis are worthy of careful consideration. The fire places in the Principal's residence would be a great comfort.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary M.S.O.C.\n\nDictated but not personally signed because of absence from the office.\nOttawa, April 3, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd ultimo, with enclosures, concerning the Principal's residence and the stock barn at the Onion Lake C.

C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir:-\n\nOn March 5th I received a letter from Indian Agent Turner, enclosing a letter from Mr. Ellis, Principal of the new Onion Lake Indian Residential School in which he asked to be supplied with certain farm machinery in order to carry on farming operations. The list was rather long and I sent it back to Mr. Turner who now tells me that the School have on hand the following:-\n\nOne - 12 inch John Deere Walking Plow\nOne - Massey-Harris Binder\nOne - Mower & Rake, McCormick\nOne - Potato Cultivator.\n\nWhat they are asking for is:-\n\n1 Set of Drag Harrows\n1 Seed Drill\n1 Gang Plow\n1 Disc Harrow\n1 Breaking Plow\n2 General purpose teams\n2 Heavy sets of work harness\n\nDo you propose to supply these implements? I have in mind your letter which I received this week refusing such assistance to the Rev. Father Levern for the R.C. School on the Peigan Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW.M.

Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nOn November 23rd last at the time of my visit to the new Onion Lake School which was then nearing completion I addressed a letter to you suggesting that the carpenter who had been engaged by your Department to build in certain shelves be authorized to build clothes cupboards in each of the four dormitories as well. Up to date I have not received any acknowledgment of the receipt of this letter and would be glad to know that action has been taken in accordance with my request. There can be no question, I think, about the necessity of these and our Society will be content to have them built after the model of those in the Old Sun School.\n\nDuring my recent visit to our Society's School on the Blood Reserve I made a special note of the cupboards which were provided in the dormitories and regret to have to state that I do not consider them satisfactory as they are without any shelving at the top or drawer at the bottom such as I found in the new R.C. School on the same Reserve. If the cupboards have not yet been built in the Onion Lake School I greatly hope that this may be done in the very near future.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6321, file 658-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMay 6th, 1926.\n\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nFrom information which has been presented to me by the Principal of our Society's School at Onion Lake, as well as through other sources, I am fully convinced that the engine and generator supplied to this institution are incapable of meeting its requirements, and I beg to request that steps be taken at your earliest convenience to have them removed and others installed in their place.\n\nWith regard to the kind which would best meet the requirements of this institution I have been advised that a Fairbanks-Morse oil-burning engine of not less than 15 h.p. and a Fairbanks-Morse generator of 7\u00bd K.W. would probably do so with the greatest satisfaction, and I beg to lay this suggestion before you for your favourable consideration.\n\nInability with the present engine and generator to keep the batteries charged will produce deterioration in the latter and necessitate their renewal at very considerable cost. For this reason I beg to suggest the change of engine and generator at the earliest date possible.\n\nFurther, as bills for 828 gallons of gasoline have been presented to our Society since the beginning of this year, I am of the opinion that, under the circumstances,\nyour Department should help to meet the cost of the same. As the gasoline consumed is fully double what it would have been had the engine and generator been in order, I am of the opinion that 50% of the cost should be borne by your Department and will in due course make application for the same.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTRW/JF.\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nWhen visiting the new Onion Lake School today, Mr. Street, the Carpenter informed me that he was authorized to place shelves in the kitchen, the two clothing rooms, the two linen rooms and the two store rooms only. As clothes cupboards are very necessary in each of the four dormitories I beg to suggest that Mr. Street be authorized to have these built as well. They should be modelled after those built in the dormitories of the Old Onion School. On reading over Mr. Ellis' copy of the Department's letter to you dated October 20th, No. 118-1-12 I find that you have been empowered to supply whatever shelving and cupboards are necessary.\n\nWith regard to the hauling of the equipment from Lloydminster to the school, I regret to have to inform you that the school management will be unable to render any assistance in this connection. The delay in completing the school ready for occupation is placing so heavy a burden upon the staff that they are quite unable to spare a man or the team from the school premises when wood and hay have to be hauled from the new site in addition to the multifarious other duties. I shall be obliged therefore, if you will make other arrangements for the transportation of the equipment.\n\nI should mention also that in order to keep the batteries from going to utter ruin the engineer on our staff has been charging them from time to time. As gasoline is required for this and the Principal has been paying for the same, I shall be obliged if you will instruct your Agent Mr. Turner, to reimburse him for what he has already spent and purchase a sufficient quantity to enable the batteries to be charged regularly until such time as the water system is corrected, and the whole plant made ready for occupation.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nDec. 21, 1925.\n\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose for your information a copy of a letter which I addressed to Mr. Commissioner Graham during my visit to the Onion Lake School last month. As I have not received any acknowledgment of the receipt of this letter I am uncertain as to what action, if any, has been taken with regard to the cupboards mentioned in the first paragraph, and will be obliged if you will undertake to see that these are provided.\n\nIn addition to the clothes cupboards mentioned above I beg to state that the following requirements had not been provided at the time of my visit:\n\n1. A guard or railing to be built around the dynamo, belts, pulleys, switch-board, etc. in the engine room.\n2. An ash lift from the furnace room (can, rope, crank, pulleys).\n3. Lockers with clothes hooks built in each recreation room.\n4. Hooks for towels in the wash rooms, also brackets for tooth-brushes, mugs, combs, etc.\n5. Paper holders in toilets.\n6. Ventilator in the engine house on the lake shore to carry off gas fumes.\n7. Troughs (and down pipes) all around main building, also cement soft-water tank.\n8. Erection of a railing along both sides of the open ditch leading from the septic tank.\n9. Have the verandah on the west end of the main building screened so as to be mosquito proof.\nIf you will issue instructions to have 1 to 6 of the above provided immediately, and the others, not later than the end of April I shall be very deeply obliged.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nGENERAL SECRETARY\nREV.

Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a copy of a letter addressed to the Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs on December 21st last, and to state that in a letter received from the Rev. Henry Ellis, Principal of our Society's School at Onion Lake and dated April 14th, he informs me that none of the things requested in this letter have yet been supplied.\n\nI also beg to enclose herewith a copy of my letter addressed to Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham dated November 23rd, 1925, in the first paragraph of which a special request is made for clothes cupboards to be built in the 4 dormitories of the Onion Lake School. Up to date I have not received any reply to this letter from Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham, and as I have not heard from the Principal that the cupboards have been supplied, I am of the opinion that no action has yet been taken in accordance with my request.\n\nAs to the necessity of the items of equipment mentioned in both of these letters, I do not think that there can be any question. Our Society and the School management are fully prepared to do all in their power to save your Department from making any unnecessary expenditure, but the items referred to in these letters cannot be met by our Society at the present time, and as I believe it is the intention of your Department to furnish the same, I shall be\nobliged if you will give the necessary authorization to have them supplied in the immediate future.\n\nWith regard to the clothes cupboards I would repeat what is stated in the first paragraph of my letter to the Indian Commissioner that these should be modelled after those built in the dormitories of the Old Sun School.\n\nOn my recent visit to the Blood Reserve I visited the R.C. School as well as St. Paul's School which is under the management of our Society. I took careful note of the clothes cupboards which were supplied to the two institutions, and I very much regret to state that those which were supplied to St. Paul's are not satisfactory and are vastly inferior to those supplied to the R.C. Institution. It is for this reason I am offering the suggestion that the clothes cupboards at the Onion Lake School be modelled after those built in the dormitories of the Old Sun School.\n\nThanking you in advance for your sympathetic consideration of the above matters.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.\n\nTBRW/JF.\nOttawa, May 15, 1926.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with enclosures, concerning the cupboards for the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School. On March 2nd, Mr. Commissioner Graham wrote the Department in this regard and promised to have a report from Mr. Inspector Murison with reference to what additional cupboards are necessary. I have today written Mr. Graham, asking for this report and for his recommendation.\n\nI wish also to acknowledge a copy of your letter of the 6th instant to Mr. Graham, in connection with the electric lighting plant.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Principal of the new Onion Lake Residential School at Onion Lake, makes a request through the Indian Agent to have a permanent \"V\" joint seat with lockers underneath, constructed around both recreation rooms. He also asks for 2 12 ft. tables, 1 for each room. He states also that clothes hooks are required for the recreation rooms, towel hooks and brackets for the washrooms, and toilet paper holders for the toilets, and asks if the Department will supply these. I am prepared to recommend the granting of his requests.\n\nIn another letter he asks the Department to furnish 33 spools of barbed wire and 325 fence posts at an approximate cost of $195.00, for the purpose of sub-dividing the school section on the new school site and to fence the land which will be put under cultivation, as well as the gardens near the school. The Rev. Principal made application for this to the Society which, however, had no funds. If the Department will supply the material, the labour will be undertaken by the school. I submit this request for the consideration of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 20, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 309-11A of the 14th instant, with reference to lockers, etc., and fencing at the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School.\n\nYou are authorized to have a permanent \"V\" joint seat, with lockers underneath, constructed around both recreation rooms. You may also arrange for two 12 ft. tables for these rooms. Whatever clothes and towel hooks and brackets, etc., you consider necessary for the recreation and wash rooms should be supplied also.\n\nWith reference to a fence, you may purchase 33 spools of barbed wire and 325 fence posts at an estimated cost of $185, after securing competitive prices if possible. I understand that the labour of erecting the fence will be undertaken by the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th inst., number 115-1-5, with regard to the shelving at the new Onion Lake school, Mr. Morrison has been at Onion Lake and knows the situation thoroughly with regard to shelving for the school, and he is of the opinion that ample shelving is provided. I may say that on the 26th of October, I wrote to the Principal of the school, asking him if shelving and cupboards were necessary other than those indicated in the plans, to inform me what he desired to have in addition. He replied to this letter on November 5th, 1925, as follows:\n\n\"With regard to shelving it is important that pigeon-hole spaces are made in both clothing rooms on the first floor, for both boys and girls, where the children's clean clothing may be kept after leaving the laundry. The size of each square should be about 12 to 18 inches. Shelving ought to be placed on the ground floor of the linen and bedding rooms. This could be straight shelving without partitions. This would also apply to the kitchen and store-rooms, only far less in number.\"\n\nOn receipt of this information from the Principal stating just what his requirements were, I took steps immediately to have the shelving asked for, placed in the school.\n\nThis school which is supposed to have a capacity for one hundred children is better equipped than\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nthe File Hills school with an equal number of children, and the Qu'Appelle Industrial School with almost three times the children, for which no demand has been made, and nearly any other school. Dr. Westgate came along after this shelving had been done, and because wardrobes had been put in the dormitories at the Blood school, and possibly one other school, he has called upon us to put in these unnecessary cupboards. Had I known that he was going to insist on having cupboards in the dormitories, I certainly would not have had this shelving done.\n\nI am quite satisfied when the architect drew these plans, he did not consider it necessary to have wardrobes put around these beautiful rooms, disfiguring them, or he would have had the windows placed differently.\n\nI cannot conscientiously recommend that these additional cupboards be placed in the school. Our Inspector is of the same opinion, and I am satisfied that Mr. Ellis never expected them and it is merely because Dr. Westgate came along and stated that he should have them, that he is asking for them. The question now is whether Dr. Westgate's recommendation shall be carried out over the heads of our own officers. Personally I think the matter should end here.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. M.

Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of the 16th instant, No. 115-1-5, respecting new school desks asked for by the Principal of the Onion Lake Church of England Residential School.\n\nThe school has at present single desks to accommodate 76 children and besides has five old double desks, making the total seating enough for 86 children. The grant at this school is for 60 pupils.\n\nMr. Ellis, the principal, is expecting to do some recruiting after the summer holidays and that was the reason he asked for the extra desks. However, he agreed with me that the number of desks on hand would be sufficient for the present, and if it became necessary to ask for more he would do so at a later date.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI am now having plans and specifications, also bill of material prepared for the Principal's house and out-buildings at the Onion Lake Boarding School. The amount of money authorized for this purpose, namely $11,000, is small but still I think what is required can be built for this money. We will have to provide accommodation for at least twenty-four head of cattle and ten horses. I am of the opinion that Dr. Westgate expects more than we are prepared to give him in the way of a residence for the Principal. However, I am going to provide a house with four bedrooms, living room, dining room, kitchen and hall and full size basement. This ought to be quite sufficient for Mr. Ellis. I believe he has quite a number of children. His house will cost perhaps twice as much as the house we are building for the Principal at the Gordon School.\n\nWhile we are forced almost to build a house of this size for Mr. Ellis, I doubt very much if it is a wise policy as there is no telling how long he will be at this Institution as Principal and he might be followed by a man who had no children at all and the house would be far too big for him.\n\nDr. Westgate has asked me to submit the plans for the house to Mr. Ellis for his approval. I do not think this is necessary. When the plans are on the ground with our Inspector he will listen to any suggestion that Mr. Ellis might want to make for any minor changes, but on the whole I think the general plan is a matter for the Department to decide upon. He is still pressing to have individual lockers established in this school which I cannot see at all necessary, but there is no use discussing this matter with him because I think when we are through with Onion Lake that they will have a pretty complete outfit of buildings, including a good residence for the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.McGraham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan G.

You will doubtless remember the special circumstances attached to our entering into occupation of the main building of the Onion Lake school and the special assurance given me that the Principal's residence and other buildings would be provided this year.

Limited,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd of July, No. 115-1-5, and my reply of the 23rd of July, No. 309-11A, I beg to inform you that I deemed it necessary to send Mr. Paulin, who installed the water system at this school, to Onion Lake and look into the reports made by the Principal regarding the system, in which report he expressed fear that the pipes would freeze and the school be entirely out of water during the winter. Mr. Paulin has returned after having gone over the whole system and has made it safe beyond doubt by extending the pipe so that it is now a couple of hundred feet into the lake and putting a covering over the pipe which is in the lake for some distance out which makes it absolutely safe.\n\nMr. Paulin brought back another sample of the water in a container furnished to me by the Department of health here which has been examined and I am today informed by that Department that the water is absolutely safe.\n\nMr. Paulin also looked over the lighting plant and he thinks that it has been badly handled in the past, and that the pumping and lighting system should be in the hands of a competent man, that the difficulties we had in the past and the expense were due to mis-management and ignorance.\n\nThe lockers in the Boys' dormitories have been installed and so far as I can tell, everything is complete and up to date at this institution.\n\nThe barn will be completed before winter.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nwinter sets in. I am finding difficulty in getting carpenters and workmen.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, August 27, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge, with thanks, receipt of your No. 309-11A C.E., reporting on the work you have had carried out to the water system at the Onion Lake C. of E. Indian Residential School in order to make it safe from danger of freezing. It is noted that the water supply which you have had examined is found to be absolutely safe.\n\nIt is also noted that the lockers in the boys' dormitories have been installed and that the barn will be completed before winter sets in.\n\nYour remarks regarding the pumping and lighting system at this school have been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nRe Onion Lake School\n\nWith further reference to my letter of May 6th, and particularly to that part of it which deals with the abnormal amount of gasoline consumed by the engine operating the lighting system, I now beg to furnish you with the following particulars in this connection, and to request that your Department reimburse our Society to the extent of not less than one half of the expenditure incurred:\n\n| Month       | Amount   |\n|-------------|----------|\n| January     | $246.95  |\n| February    | 45.75    |\n| March       | 45.14    |\n| May         | 114.67   |\n| June        | 123.05   |\n| August      | 95.30    |\n| September   | 72.45    |\n| October (1st) | 28.06   |\n| Total to Oct. 1st | 771.37 |\n| Freight on gasoline | 116.50 |\n| Grand total | $887.87 |\n\nTotal quantity consumed 2530 gallons.\n\nIt seems to me and to our Society to be a reasonable request under the circumstances that your Department should meet at least one-half of the above amount, and I shall be obliged if you will furnish me with a cheque at your earliest convenience.\n\nMy request that lockers should be installed in the dormitories, and my further request that the water system should be extended to the new barn now under construction, have not received favourable consideration from your Department for reasons which I find it very difficult to understand. I trust, however, that the present request may not meet with a similar fate, and that I may receive the reimbursement requested in the very near future.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSgd. T.B.R. Westgate.\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nSir:\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter received from the Rev. T.B.R. Westgate, incorporating a statement of gasoline used at the Church of England School on the Onion Lake Reserve, from the commencement of the year until the first instant at a cost of $897.87; 50% of which Dr. Westgate submits should be borne by the Department. In an earlier letter to me Dr. Westgate made the claim that the gasoline consumed was fully double what it would have been had the engine and generator been in order. In my opinion I cannot see that the Department should be called upon to bear any of the cost of gasoline consumed.\n\nNotwithstanding Dr. Westgate's assertion that inadequacy of the engine and generator resulted in a greater consumption of gasoline than was necessary, the School Authorities have, by their action in laying water from the school to the barn, an outlay which I consider was unnecessary and would not recommend, added an extra burden on the plant. Dr. Westgate complains that his request for the extension of the water system to the barn did not receive favourable consideration from the Department but should have considered his request. He applies for that if the plant was before over-worked and inefficient, the extension of the water system would further reduce its efficiency. I am forwarding Dr. Westgate's letter for the Department's consideration and have so advised him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 9, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 309-11A C.E. of the 29th ultimo, concerning the cost of gasoline used at the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School. I agree with your opinion that there is no reason why we should make an exception to our general practice in this case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to enclose herewith and recommend for payment, Regina Voucher No. 4065, amounting to $131.50, in favour of Mr. Eric Rotherham, Onion Lake, Sask., for the labour performed, as per the time sheets attached, in constructing and completing the seats, lockers, etc., at the Church of England Residential School, Onion Lake, Sask.\n\nThe work has been performed in a very satisfactory manner and the school authorities are very highly pleased.\n\nDepartment authority is dated May 20th, 1926, File 115-1-5.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK August 27th, 1926\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to ask for an accountable advance cheque for labour etc. in connection with new buildings at Onion Lake Church of England school.\n\nKindly send $2000.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe the Onion Lake Water Supply\n\nWith reference to the intake pipe from the lake which was not completed last fall, would write that we were pleased to find that there had been no freeze up or any serious interruption of water supply to the school during last winter.\n\nThe intake pipe extends into the lake some 200 feet - 75 feet of this is now well protected and precludes any possibility of damage by freezing. We extended the cribbing 30 feet farther out than it was last fall. The intake pipe has a depth of 6 feet of earth over the pipe at the lowest point.\n\nOutside the cribbing here is a row of 5\" Tamarack posts driven in and securely spiked to the cribbing. The earth has been well tramped down. Approaching the shore we hauled stone and piled them up the bank to break the wash. The only improvement that might be offered would be to extend the intake pipe 400 ft. farther out which would allow the pipe to rest on land some distance. The depth in the same place is 6 ft. on either side; it is about 12 ft. deep. The above is offered as an alternative in event of any contamination at the present point.\n\nMr. R. H. Murray, C.E. of the Public Health Dept. supplied me with a sealed container for the purpose of definitely ascertaining the condition of the water. His report is very satisfactory, a copy of which you will find enclosed. For the ten days that we were up there, August 2nd to 12th, we could not detect anything at all peculiar in the test or effects of the taste and effect the water was boiled. They have started to use Chloride of Lime for the purpose of destroying a slight vegetable taste; the results have been very satisfactory indeed. Mr. Murray reports the hardness as a little harder than the Regina water. There are great quantities of water going to waste as there are no eaves troughing on the building. The building would also be better preserved by keeping the splash away from the walls.\n\nYou have a first class boarding school with the Dunham heating system, electric lighting, electric pumping unit and gas pumping engine at the lake as well as laundry equipment.\n\nIt is my opinion that some person, capable of handling this plant, should be put in charge and made responsible for its maintenance and operation. The principal of the school should not have authority over the appointments, other than to require efficient service. Mr. Ellis is not a mechanic and his interference with a competent man would only result/\nonly result in disaster.\n\nIn conclusion it is a pleasure for me to state that I was very pleased with the general appearance of the school inside and out.\n\nThanking you, we are,\n\nYours truly,\n\nBAULIN & SWAYZE.\n\nPer. . . .\"E.P.

My business on this trip was really to arrange for the erection of a residence for the Principal, a barn and other out buildings. The main building put up last year appears to be very well built. I would point out however, that no save troughing was provided for this building and this I think should be put on as water dropping from the roof has a bad effect on the foundations of the building.\n\nWith regard to the sewerage disposal, the sewerage is discharged into an open trench which extends for 120 ft. from the end of the drain tile. This trench is saving in and I would suggest that 120 ft. of 8 inch tile be provided to complete this work. Before I left the school the carpenter had the work of the Principal's residence well under way. Before his arrival I had the excavation for the cellar done and a great deal of gravel and other material on the ground.\n\nThe foregoing report is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

I at once proceeded to get competitive prices in Lloydminster on material required for the erection of the Principal's residence and outbuildings at the Onion Lake Church of England Residential school and drove to Onion Lake late the same evening. On Monday the 30th I went to the school and marked out the site for the buildings and arranged for the excavation of the basement and the freighting of gravel and other material. A heavy rain commenced that evening and continued until Friday, the 3rd instant. As it was impossible to do any driving I checked up the Cash Book, Stores Ledger, Inventories and other records in the office.\n\nMr. Mayoh arrived on the evening of the 3rd instant. I proceeded with him on Saturday the 4th to examine the local lumber purchased and instructed him regarding the location of the buildings to be erected at the school. On Monday morning I went to Frog Lake Reserve, visited the Day school and went to Cold Lake Reserve for the night. I inspected both reserves at Cold Lake as well as the Day school on Tuesday. On Wednesday morning I interviewed some Indians at Cold Lake and then drove to Keeheewins reserve where we have a new Farming Instructor and left there the same evening, arriving at Onion Lake Agency after midnight. On the 9th and 10th I completed my inspection and gave final instructions in connection with the erection of the buildings and proceeded to Lloydminster Saturday evening, the 11th; where I got final competitive prices on the plumbing, heating etc.\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nRegina, Sask., Sept. 23, 1926\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report of an inspection made at the Onion Lake Agency by Mr. Inspector Murison.\n\nThe house at the school is being built under the direction of Mr. Jos. Maych, who has done a lot of carpenter work for us in the last three or four years. He proceeded from Norway House to Onion Lake to take up this work, and I am satisfied that he will save the Department considerable money on the job. This man will also look after the erection of the outbuildings at the school. The material was bought after obtaining competitive prices, and as there are mills close to the reserve, most of the dimension material and boards will be bought there.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that the Principal's residence at the Onion Lake School is well under way, and the material for the barns is being hauled. This work is under the direction of Mr. Jos. Mayoh, and the material was bought after obtaining competitive prices.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Murison, on his return from a visit to the Onion Lake Anglican Residential School, reports that eaves troughing has not been provided for the building. This, I fear, is a mistake inasmuch as the water shed from the roof has the effect, in time, of impairing the foundation of the building. I would recommend that authority be granted as soon as possible to have the necessary eaves troughing provided.\n\nHe further reports that the furnace chimney is built on a cement footing and extends up the outside of the building and into the wall of the building as far as the interior plaster work. This method of construction weakens the building and the result is that through the settling of either the chimney or the building, the plaster work has cracked so badly that daylight can be seen through the cracks. Men who have had practical experience in the construction of buildings in this cold western country inform me that it is not considered good practice to place chimneys in the walls of buildings. It is considered much more satisfactory to have the chimney built inside the wall as it is conducive to obtaining a better draft. Another point is that if a chimney is built on a solid heavy cement foundation, it remains rigid while the natural settling of the building causes the walls to crack. On the other hand if the chimney is not on a solid footing, the settling of the chimney will have the same effect on the walls. It appears to me that it would be sound practice if, in the preparation of future plans, this factor were taken into consideration and provision made so that the chimney would not project into the walls of the building; in other words, the chimney to be a separate unit, so placed that the cutting of the walls would be avoided.\n\nAnother matter the Inspector reports is in connection with the discharge drain from the septic tank. The sewer is discharged into an open trench 120 ft. long; this trench, owing to the sandy nature of the soil, has settled in and does not permit of a free flow of the fluid. Field tile should be provided and this trench filled in. The work of laying this tile is not difficult and could be done by the School Staff. I think that this matter should be attended to before freeze up.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOctober 4, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd ultimo regarding the Onion Lake Anglican Residential School, I beg to say that you may purchase the necessary building tile to provide the proper discharge drain from the septic tank; the work of installing same to be done by the school.\n\nWith reference to the eave troughing, I would ask you to obtain and submit to me a price for this work. I would say with regard to the eave troughing that in the cold weather there is liable to be trouble as the eave trough will fill with water and freeze, causing the water to back up under the shingles.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. B. McLean,\nAust. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. GRAHAM, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6321, file 658-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant #119-15, authorizing me to purchase the necessary tile to provide proper drainage from the septic tank at the Onion Lake Anglican School, and pointing out that the work on this drain should be done by the school.\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter which deals with the question of eavetroughing, I may say that it would be impossible to get competitive prices on this. However, I will get a price from the only local man and submit it to you. It will be necessary to have a reply by wire, as the season is well advanced and I should like to have the eavetroughing put on this Fall if possible.\n\nI note your remarks regarding the effect of cold weather on eavetroughing, i.e., that the water is likely to freeze and back up under the shingles. Of course you understand that 100% of the houses in this country have eavetroughing, and I doubt if there has been any trouble of this nature. The only houses that do not have eavetroughing on are a few shacks on the outskirts of the towns, where they gather their supply of soft water by means of a board and barrel. I think we should adopt the policy of having eavetroughing placed on all our buildings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6321, file 658-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that ever since we installed the 10 H.P. Fairbanks Morse engine in the Onion Lake School I have had nothing but bad reports of it from the Principal; first that the engine heated too rapidly, then that it was overworked, and on two or three occasions during the short interval that it has been in use at the school I have had to send experts up there to ascertain what was wrong and to make reports, but no sooner do they get things going well than we get a report that it is out of order again.\n\nThe contention of about half the people who have seen this engine is that it is overworked. You will recall that this engine was purchased in the first place to do the work at the Duck Lake School, which is about twice the size of the Onion Lake School, and I thought that if it were capable of doing the work at Duck Lake it surely would have power to spare if sent to Onion Lake, but apparently this is not the case.\n\nI do not think we will have any satisfaction here until we purchase a 15 H.P. Fairbanks Morse engine and install it. The water has to be drawn about 1000 feet, and the engine has got to operate the lighting plant as well, and it would be better to have power to spare than to have too little. I would, therefore, recommend that I be authorized to place a 15 H.P. Fairbanks Morse engine in the Onion Lake Boarding School at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOctober 19th, 1926\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 9th instant with reference to the engine used at the Onion Lake School for operating the electric lighting plant and pump, I would say that a 10 h.p. engine should be of ample size to operate a 5 kilowatt generator. I do not know, however, the power that is required to operate the pump at this school. It might be advisable to install a separate engine for the pump and to leave the 10 h.p. engine to operate the generator. You mention in your letter that they complain that the present engine is over-worked. A 15 h.p. engine would have to run the same length of time in order to operate the generator as a 10 h.p. engine.\n\nIf on further investigation you find that it would be more suitable and economical to install a larger engine, you may arrange to purchase same and have it installed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary\nSir:\n\nI have had a communication from the Rev. T.B.R. Westgate, asking if water connections from the Church of England School cannot be carried to the new barn which is being erected, but I do not think the Department should be called upon to incur this expenditure. The distance from the stable to the lake is not great and the cattle could easily be driven to water.\n\nWe have not at other points introduced water connections in school barns and unless the necessity should be very urgent, I do not see any reason why we should create a precedent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n| ARTICLES                  | FIRM ASKED TO QUOTE | REMARKS |\n|---------------------------|--------------------|---------|\n| Paint for Residence and   | Sherwin Williams & Co., A.

General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI enclose herewith a copy of my letter addressed to Mr. Commissioner Graham on the 25th ultimo relative to the abnormal amount of gasoline consumed by the engine operating the lighting system at our Onion Lake School, and requested that as an abnormal consumption was due to the installation of an unsuitable plant, fifty percent of the cost be borne by your Department. In reply to this letter Mr. Graham wrote on Oct. 28th stating that he had forwarded a copy of my letter to your Department. I have now received from him another letter dated Nov. 16th in which he informs me that he is in receipt of a letter from the Department stating that they can see no reason why the usual practice should be departed from with regard to meeting the cost of the gasoline for the lighting and pumping plant at Onion Lake. This means that my request has not been granted, and I am writing again for the specific purpose of having it reconsidered. The difficulty which the lighting plant installed at the Onion Lake School has caused the School management has been the subject of correspondence with Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham for sometime. On the 14th of April the Rev. H. Ellis, Principal of the School, submitted to him a statement in this connection and received an acknowledgment of the same in a letter written by the Commissioner on April 21st, who stated, in part, as follows:\n\n\"I regret very much that you have had so much trouble and difficulty with the engine and I am getting in touch with the manufacturers with a view to having the engine definitely put into proper working order or changed\".\n\nAbout that time two engine experts visited the School but nothing was done then\u2014or has anything been done since to remedy the defects.\nOne of the above experts called on me in Winnipeg after his return and informed me that the plant would never give satisfaction or meet the requirements of the School. I then wrote to the Commissioner on May 6th and forwarded a copy of my letter to you for your information. The Commissioner replied to my letter on May 10th. His letter reads as follows:\n\n\"I have your letter of the 6th, with reference to the engine and generator at present in use at the Onion Lake School. I appreciate the difficulties that have been encountered and this has also been a source of considerable trouble and anxiety to me. The equipment was first bought for use in a school twice as large as that at Onion Lake and there are those who state that it would have met requirements at that school. However, the Department decided to make use of it at Onion Lake. There are those again who claim that it should be also efficient for the work it is required to perform at the Onion Lake School. However, I am daily expecting a report from the Company who made the installation and in view of the conflicting opinions which I have received, I feel I should not make any recommendation to the Department until I receive this report. The matter will be dealt with promptly on receipt of this.\"\n\nI wrote to him again on the 4th of Oct., urging that steps be taken as soon as possible to have both the engine and dynamo replaced by those of greater power and better quality and stated as I had done in my letter of May 6th, that a bill for the extra gasoline consumed would be presented in due course. The plant is not satisfactory and I doubt very much whether it can ever be made to do the work it is expected to do at this institution. It has already been a very great expense to our Society and a very great worry and inconvenience to the School management and staff. They have been left at times for days without light while repairs have been effected, and subjected to annoyances which should not be laid upon them.\n\nI respectfully submit, therefore, that my request for reimbursement of at least half of the cost of the gasoline consumed is but fair and reasonable, and I beg to request that you will give it your sympathetic consideration.\n\nI also beg to request that the engine and dynamo be replaced by others which are capable of meeting the requirements of the School. In my letter of May 6th addressed to Mr. Commissioner Graham, and a copy of which was forwarded to you, I suggested that a Fairbanks-Morse Oil Burning engine of not less than 15 h.p. and a Fairbanks-Morse Generator of 7\u00bd k.w. would probably give the greatest satisfaction, and I am still of the same opinion.\"\nI commend these two matters to your prompt and sympathetic consideration and beg to remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.O.C.\n\nTERW/JF\nNovember 24, 1926.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to the amount of gasoline used in the operation of the lighting plant at the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School. There is evidently a difference of opinion in this connection, and I am asking Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham to let me have a copy of a report from a Winnipeg expert, with whom he is in communication. I wish to point out that Mr. Graham draws attention to the extra load placed on the engine because of the water connection to the barn, which was not authorized by the Department.\n\nIn the interim, would you let me have a statement concerning the qualifications of the engineer at the school and indicate the date of his appointment. Mr. Paulin, of Regina, under cover of August 23rd, last, writes in part as follows:-\n\n\"It is my opinion that some person capable of handling this plant should be put in charge and made responsible for its maintenance and operation. Mr. Ellis is not a mechanic and his interference with a competent man would result only in disaster.\"\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. T. B. R.

I want to be satisfied, after receiving expert opinion, as to whether it is really necessary to change the plant at the Church of England School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6321, file 658-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nIn reply to your letter of Nov. 24th (115-1-5), requesting information with regard to the qualifications of the engineer at the Onion Lake School, I beg to state that the Principal of this School in a letter dated Nov. 18th, 1925, writes in part, as follows:\n\n\"In reply to your letter of Nov. 12th, in which you include a copy of the telegram received from the Department with reference to the appointment of a competent man to operate and run the mechanical part of the new School, I have to inform you that I am of the opinion Mr. Mitchell is quite competent to handle this work. He has operated gas engines for the past 16 years. He has run a gas tractor for 2 years. He has owned and operated a steam boiler at Mulvihill, Manitoba, in connection with a milling business there. He has had a fair experience in electrical work. He is a good mechanic. Since the contractors left he and I have operated the plant, filling the storage and compression tanks, and charging the batteries to the satisfaction of the building inspector, Mr. Hamilton of Regina, Sask. He has a thorough knowledge of the system.........\"\n\nIn addition to the above I may state that Mr. Mitchell the engineer who is a man of 37 years of age, was educated in England at the College of Preceptors and studied science for one year at St. Lawrence College, Ramsgate. He is well educated, more than ordinarily efficient as a mechanic, and thoroughly trustworthy. He is severing his connection with the Onion Lake School at the end of this month as he has a wife and four children and we are unable to accommodate so large a family. When I spoke to one of\nThe experts referred to in my letter of Nov. 17th about the competency of Mr. Mitchell to handle all the mechanical appliances at the School, he gave it as his opinion that Mr. Mitchell was fully competent, but that no engineer no matter how competent, could make the engine and dynamo at the Onion Lake School render the service required. Our Society has another fully qualified engineer (unmarried) ready to take his place.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Commissioner Graham's reference to the extra load placed on the engine because of the water connection with the barn, I beg to state that so far as I have been informed no extra load has yet been placed on the engine in the way suggested. That the water system has been extended to the barn I am well aware, but the extension having been made as late as October, I have not yet learned that it has been utilized. In a letter dated Oct. 2nd and addressed by the Principal to the local Indian Agent, I find the following remarks in this connection:\n\n\"As the cost of laying the water on at the new barn now being erected at the new Onion Lake C.E. Indian Residential School only means the expense of digging a trench 250 ft. and the purchasing of a few reducing nipples and elbows and a galvanized iron trough, there being sufficient piping on hand to run the entire length of the water line from the main school building to the new barn, I herewith ask the Department to permit and authorize this work to be done.... The cost of laying on the water while the barn is being built is so small as compared to that after the building is completed, I trust that the Department will give this favourable consideration and approve of the work being done now\".\n\nAs the complaints with regard to the engine date from the beginning of this year and have been coming in almost continuously ever since, I am unable to see that the extension of the water system to the barn can in any way be held responsible for its inefficiency to meet the needs of the School. I am satisfied in my own mind from what I have seen and heard that the engine is too small to meet the needs of this institution, and I trust that the remedial action suggested in my letter of the 17th instant may be undertaken.\n\nBelieve me,\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTERW/JP\n\nIndian Affairs.

The cause of the repair item being so heavy was through the pipes freezing every day in the battery room. These pipes were replaced at a cost of $11.35. The House Equipment item was chiefly for the ice tools and a blow torch. It was necessary to thaw out the return pipe every morning, in spite of keeping a very heavy fire on during the night. Thermometers were placed in different parts of the building in order to have a check on the temperature. The ice tools were asked for in the December quarter list of last year, but they were not shipped. It was necessary to put up ice this year, as it is impossible to keep food in the main building for any length of time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd) Henry Ellis,\nPrincipal.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn connection with the enclosed letter from the Principal of our Onion Lake School, and the bill which has been paid by our Society, I have been instructed by our Commission to apply to your Department for reimbursement for the items marked \"Repairs\", (R) \"Equipment\" (H.E.) and \"Special\" (S).\n\nThese total, according to the Principal's distribution on the bill itself, the sum of $69.50, and I shall be obliged if you will furnish me with a cheque for this amount.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, April 28th, 1927.\n\nRev.

You may arrange to purchase the material required for this purpose, at an approximate cost, including paint, of $200.\n\nIt is noted that the labour in connection with the erection of this fence will be supplied by the school management.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received your letter of April 28th in reply to my letter of April 21st, and note with some surprise and regret your decision not to meet the bill from the Lloydminster Co-operative Association for certain repairs and equipment required at our Onion Lake School, as the greater part of the bill represented expenditure incurred in connection with the lighting and water systems at this School and about which I wrote to the Deputy Superintendent General on the 17th of last November and again on Nov. 29th. The defects in the plant installed were chiefly responsible for that particular part of the expenditure in question and also for the consumption of not less than 2,550 gallons of gasoline between Jan. 1st and Oct. 1st of last year. The total cost of this to our Society including freight charges was $887.89. From the 1st of Oct. to the end of the year other bills for oil and gasoline amounted to not less than $443.60, making a total, at least of $1,321.49 which was paid out by our Society. This abnormally high amount was due to operating the unsuitable engine and generator installed by your Department in connection with the lighting and water systems. In my letter of Nov. 17th last, I made what seemed to me and to our Commission the very reasonable request that under the circumstances referred to above, your Department should share equally with our Society the heavy cost of the gasoline consumed. This request does not appear to have been granted, and in consequence our Society has been obliged to meet a much heavier cash expenditure than they could reasonably be expected to do. Our Commission have felt it keenly that their reasonable request for cooperation from your Department in the meeting of this abnormally heavy expenditure was not granted, and the further action now taken by your Department in declining to meet the bill for repairs has intensified...\nThis feeling, and they are beginning to wonder how it will be possible for them to maintain and operate this school without some further financial assistance. In preparing their estimates for next year they find that even with a slight increase in the per capita grant they will still have a heavy cash expenditure to make over and above all cash receipts including the per capita earnings. In endeavouring to discover a way whereby this condition of things could be remedied, they concluded that the best, if not the only course to pursue, was to have the enrollment increased from 80 to 100 pupils, and I was directed by them to refer this matter to you and ask that an enrollment of this number of pupils be sanctioned immediately. The building has a capacity of 100 pupils and the Principal is of the opinion that he will have no difficulty in securing this number. I respectfully beg to request, therefore, that you give this matter your most careful and favourable consideration, and furnish me with the authorization requested at your earliest convenience.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.O.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It stands at present at 80 pupils, and if increased to 125 pupils the annual increase in the per capita earnings would furnish the necessary financial relief. Our Commission realise that such increase may not be possible during the current fiscal year, but they can see no possibility of a satisfactory and permanent solution of the problem until such action has been taken. Our Society has been made well aware of the fact that Residential Schools with an enrolment of 100 pupils or less are practically incapable of being properly staffed and operated without a deficit, on the present per capita basis, and it is for this reason that they desire Schools with a capacity of not less than 125 pupils to be built in preference to any others. It is recommended and requested, therefore, that as a measure towards securing the permanent financial relief required for our Onion Lake School, the capacity of this school be increased, not later than during the next fiscal year, from 80 to 125 pupils.\n\nAs a measure towards providing the immediate relief required, our Commission instructed me to suggest the following:\n\n1. To provide all the milk cows required instead of having half of these provided at the expense of our Society.\n\n2. To meet the abnormal expenditure incurred through the installation of an unsuitable lighting system as set forth in my letter of Oct. 25th, 1926, addressed to Mr. Commissioner Graham, a copy of which is enclosed herewith.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6321, file 658-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nof which he informed me had been forwarded to your Department.\n\n3. To provide at the earliest date possible all the buildings, and equipment including tools and implements required for the proper administration and maintenance of the institution.\n\nFrom your letter of May 12th (116-1-14) written in connection with the live stock requested for the St. Cyprian School, it would appear that you do not consider it obligatory upon your Department to provide a \"complete outfit of all kinds\" when a school has been in operation for some time. In this connection I beg to state that our Society has always abstained from asking more than what they considered was reasonably necessary, but they have felt that where the church provided, and equipped the buildings as in the case of the old Peigan and old Onion Lake Schools, your Department could reasonably be expected to deal generously with them in the establishment and equipment of a new institution.\n\nI commend, therefore, the recommendations set forth above to your favourable consideration, and have the honour to remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTRBW/JF\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Residential School. This was mentioned in the last paragraph of your 309-11A C.E. of October 23rd.

I shall cause a note to be made for future estimates.\n\nI am pleased to inform you that, on the 21st instant, Mr. Commissioner Graham was authorized to purchase 8 milch cows for the use of this school.\n\nConcerning the unusual expenditure because of the lighting system installed in this school, I regret that I have been unable as yet to get an expert's report. I have repeated my request in this connection and at a later date will have a further communication for you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have your No. 11f-1-5 of the 25th ultimo in regard to furnishing you with a copy of the expert's report on the Onion Lake C. of R. Indian Residential School plant. I regret that this was overlooked but as a matter of fact I did not secure a report in writing but made a personal visit at the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company's office in Winnipeg and reviewed the situation with them. I had an earlier report from one of the Company's experts stating that the generator was of 5000 watt capacity and could thus take care of 125 -40 watt lamps or double that number of 20 watt lamps, but that the number of lights in use was 172 and it was clear, therefore, the 10 H.P. engine had not sufficient reserve to meet the requirements of the school. You will remember that the engine was previously installed at the Duck Lake School but exchanged for one of larger capacity. It was hoped that the smaller size would meet the requirements at Onion Lake, hence the reason for shipping it there.\n\nIn addition to the\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6321, file 658-5, part 4)\nIn addition to the earlier report from the Company's expert which I wished to have verified, there were frequent complaints from the school and it seemed advisable to install a larger plant for which I secured authority under cover of a letter from the Secretary, dated the 19th October last. I regret I overlooked your request for the expert's report, but this as I state was a verbal one given to me at a personal interview in Winnipeg. The latest report I have had in regard to the new engine is that it is working satisfactorily.\n\nIn regard to the old 10 H.P. engine which was displaced, the Reverend Principal asked if he might keep it as the school propose to erect a power line to the pump house so as to dispense with the gas engine there during the cold winter months, and the old engine could be utilized in its place. He also intimated that it would act as an auxiliary when repairs were needed. He added that the engine could be re-erected without any further expense to the Department. I had intended and indeed had given instructions to have the engine shipped to Regina so that it might be on hand if needed elsewhere. The Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company, however, did not carry out my directions owing to a misunderstanding and as the engine had not been shipped I acceded to the request of the Principal and the engine was left there for what use they could make of it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, July 11, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to refer to the last paragraph of the Deputy Superintendent General's letter to you of the 24th ultimo, relative to unusual expenditure at the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School. I have now learned that the engine first installed to look after the lighting plant was actually too small for its work and I am directed to state that, upon the occasion of your next visit to Ottawa, you should discuss with Mr. Ferrier ways and means of a special grant to offset the unusual cost of lighting the school for the period in question.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir:\n\nWhen at the Onion Lake Agency recently, Inspector W. Murison looked into several matters to which my attention had been drawn, and has submitted a report.\n\nOne matter was in reference to the ventilation of the barn which was erected last year, and the installation of the stanchions for the cattle. These matters Inspector Murison has satisfactorily adjusted.\n\nA request was made by the Principal of the School to be supplied with granaries and these are no doubt required. The present requirements will be met by furnishing the School with one large permanent granary in which there will be sufficient room to enable the School to clean and pickle grain under cover. A building 20'x30' would satisfy this need. A smaller portable granary, 14'x16', might also be furnished. The mechanic at the School should be able to supervise their erection and the cost of the two will be approximately $100.00. Inspector Murison reports that a root house is needed and that the School has not as yet been provided with one. The cost of this would be approximately $600.00. Will you please advise me if the Department will provide funds for the erection of the buildings mentioned.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIt was reported to me\nIt was reported to me that the tubing running through the hot water tank at the School was very badly corroded. Inspector Morrison has verified this and reports that the piping will need to be renewed. Galvanized piping should be utilized and the cost of this, together with a pipe wrench, will approximate $40.00. I am advised by a responsible firm of plumbers here that the piping in use in this hot water boiler is likely to corrode very frequently owing to the hard nature of the water and renewals might be necessitated every year or two. Will you please advise me if the Department will provide the necessary funds to renew the piping referred to.\n\nInspector Morrison also enquired as to whether we could purchase suitable Holsteins and I understand that suitable grade Holstein cows can be bought for about $100.00 each, probably less. I am writing to the Agent to tell him that he may buy eight at a price not exceeding $800.00. I may say that Inspector Morrison saw one or two animals belonging to a small herd which is for sale, comprising ten females and one pure bred bull, at a price of $775.00. As Inspector Morrison thinks this would be a good purchase, I have told the Agent that if, after he has inspected the whole herd, he is of the opinion that it would be advisable to make the purchase, he may do so. I trust this arrangement will be satisfactory to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, July 15, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 309-11A of the 8th instant, with reference to the advisability of providing granaries and a root house at the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School. I regret there are no funds for the purpose at the present time, but a note will be made for future estimates.\n\nYou may expend approximately $40.00 renewing the tubing in the hot water tank.\n\nA further communication will be addressed to you with reference to the milk herd.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

He spent three days here and seemed very pleased with everything he saw, and was particularly interested in the new Anglican Indian Residential School and other buildings on the reserve. He is the proprietor of The Battleford News, and, as he wishes to give the Department buildings and Indian work on the reserves a write-up in his paper, he asked me whether I could supply him with three woodcuts of the principal buildings. I cannot afford to have these woodcuts made at my own expense, and would ask the Department to kindly allow me to expend an amount not exceeding $30.00 for this purpose. The woodcuts would, of course, be the property of the Department, and could be loaned to Mr. McIntosh to print from.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAugust 5, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the furnishing of cuts for an illustrated article in the Battleford News on Departmental work in the Onion Lake Agency.

It will mean that we are liable to lose anywhere in the neighbourhood of $3,000.00 as we have not an inch of space where we can store approximately 1600 bus. of wheat, 2000 bus. of oats, about 275 bus. of barley and between five to six hundred bus. of potatoes besides about a hundred bus. of garden produce, 20 acres of oats which was put in for green feed that possibly will be threshed as the oats have turned out well.\n\nWould you kindly urge the Department that we must have these buildings this year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(signed) H. Ellis.\nPrincipal.\nRe: Buildings required at Onion Lake School C.of E.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose for your information a copy of a letter just received from the Principal of our Society's School at Onion Lake, Sask. From this you will see that he is very deeply concerned about a root-house and granaries to store this year's produce from the farm and garden. The situation appears to me to be so urgent that I feel it my duty to ask you to give it the earliest possible consideration.\n\nIn the list of requirements which our Society submitted to your Department for inclusion in your estimates for this year, contained, amongst others the following items:\n\nA root-house, estimated cost $600.\nA granary 30ft. x 18ft. estimated cost $250.\n\nI am not unaware of the fact that a heavy expenditure has been incurred by your Department in connection with this school this year. At the same time you will recollect from recent correspondence namely my letter to you dated June 20 and your replies dated May 17 and July 11 (Nos 115-1-5) and Mr. Scott's letter dated June 24 (No. 115-1-5) that our Society has been obliged to meet an unexpectedly heavy expenditure at this school also and that we cannot by any means afford to run the risk of sustaining the heavy losses referred to by the Principal in his letter. I shall be obliged therefore if you will give this matter immediate attention and take steps to have the root-house and the granary erected in time to receive the season's crops.\n\nI remain,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, August 10, 1927.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to the advisability of providing, without delay, a root house and granaries at the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School. In view of the urgency in this case, the Department has arranged to postpone other activity in connection with schools administered by your Society, and instructions are being sent to Mr. Commissioner Graham today. He is being authorized to provide a permanent granary, 20' x 30', and a portable one, 14' x 16', and also to provide a suitable root house. The school management should be given to understand that they must provide the rough labour as far as possible, so that the cost of this activity will be kept to a minimum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, August 10, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer further to your No. 309-11A of the 8th ultimo, concerning improvements at the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School. It has been represented that there will be a serious loss in the matter of crop if suitable arrangements to house it are not made without delay. The Church authorities have been given to understand that other work at their schools, which was estimated for, will be postponed, thus releasing funds for the erection of two granaries and a root house as recommended in your letter. The school management will provide as much of the rough labour as possible, and you may proceed with the work without delay.

It is considered that a scale of this type would be satisfactory for the purpose of weighing the pupils, and the cost should not exceed the sum of $20. You may obtain prices from a number of firms and arrange for the purchase of a scale of the type mentioned.\n\nRelative to a measuring rod, it is considered that the Principal could have a graduated scale marked on the wall which would be quite satisfactory in measuring the height of the pupils. We are not prepared to authorize the supplying of the measuring rod asked for.\n\nWhen you have obtained the weighing scale, please forward a certified account, in duplicate, in the usual manner covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Indian Residential School; and to inform you that before I had taken any action in this matter I received a letter from the Rev. H. Ellis, the principal, stating that he had been instructed by the M.S.C.C. to ask the Department to furnish the school with an ordinary platform scale as part of its regular equipment. I then had a conversation with Mr. Ellis, and he agreed with me that if the Department furnishes the regular size platform scale, it would be unnecessary to purchase the small size scale for weighing the pupils, as the large one could be used for that purpose.\n\nThe price of the large platform scale at T.

We note that you estimate the cost of this large scale to be $35.50 F.O.B.

Spooner.\nSir,\n\nI have to report about fires which have broken out at the Anglican Indian Residential School here during the past few days.\n\nAbout 10 p.m. on the night of the 6th instant, I received word from the Rev. H. Ellis, principal at the school, that fire had broken out in the engine room there, but that it had been successfully put out. Early the next morning I drove to the school to inspect the damage caused by the fire, and to endeavour to find out its origin, and, after investigating I concluded that it had been caused by a short circuit in the wires in the battery room. With the exception of the destruction of the batteries, very little damage was done. This fire was reported to the Indian Commissioner and instructions received from him.\n\nJust after the burning of the Roman Catholic School and I had returned home, about 11 p.m. last night, an alarm was received that the Anglican School was on fire. This school is about six miles from the Agency and, before we left to drive there, another message was received stating that the fire had been put out and that no help was needed. This morning I visited the school to see what damage had been done, and found that a small hole had been burned through the peak of the roof. I also discovered that two of the biggest boys, George Petchow and Gilbert Sackamoose, both aged 17 years, had deliberately set fire to the building. I enclose herewith statements made by them, taken down by the Rev. H. Ellis.\n\nI questioned the youths and they both admitted their action, and added that they had been thinking and talking about setting fire to the school for some time. Although they both deny having started the fire in the engine room a few days previously, suspicion pointed towards them, as they both work in the engine room at times.\n\nI explained to the lads the enormity of their offence, and asked Mr. Ellis to keep them under strict surveillance for the present, which he has consented to do. I am reluctant to hand them over to the police to be dealt with, without instructions from the Department to that effect; but they are almost men, and certainly should be punished. Kindly instruct me.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6321, file 658-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOnion Lake, Saskatchewan,\nFebruary 9th, 1928.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to confirm my telegram of the 7th instant, reading as follows:\n\n\"Fire broke out in engine room at Anglican School last night. Was successfully put out and very little damage done excepting batteries completely destroyed. Please wire me authority to have engine room re-wired so as to restore light to basement.\"\n\nand you reply:\n\n\"Re. fire damage you may have necessary wiring done in engine room. Will expect full report by mail.\"\n\nAbout 10 p.m. on the night of the 6th instant, I received a telephone call from the Rev. Ellis Principal at the Anglican School, informing me that the engine room at the school had been on fire, and that they had managed to put it out. After ascertaining that I could do nothing for him that night, I promised to be at the school early the next morning. Accordingly, the next morning I drove to the school and inspected the damage caused by the fire and tried to find out its origin.\n\nNobody could tell me just how the fire started, but it is quite evident that it started in the battery room, probably from a short circuit, as the place where the fire shows evidence of having burnt the fiercest is in the middle of the shelves on which the batteries stand. It appears that Mr. Howe, the engineer, inspected the running of the plant immediately after supper at 6.0 p.m., and then went to the Principal's residence. Between 7.30 and 8.0 p.m. the farming\n\nInstructor.\nInstructor, Mr. Spooner, went to the engine room for the purpose of removing his farm clothing, and could not get in because the place was full of smoke; he then gave the alarm and Mr. Ellis attempted to ring the fire alarm, but could not do so as the wires were burnt. In the meantime a hose was being placed in readiness and the water turned on. By this time flames were seen to be issuing from the battery room, the window of which was taken out and the water projected through it to the flames which, after a short time, were successfully subdued.\n\nRegarding the damage done. Most of the batteries, of which there are 56 in use, are either cracked or broken a lot of the wiring in both the battery and engine rooms is destroyed; the wood work in both places is charred, and the packing around a lot of the piping in the engine room is burnt off.\n\nIn my opinion the only thing that saved the whole building from going up is the fact that the spaces between the studdings on the lower floor are filled with concrete. The fire so scorched this studding in the chapel above the battery room, that a lot of the woodwork has been badly scorched there, had it been possible for a draft to carry the flames between these studdings the whole building would have gone.\n\nI have had an electrician visit the school, to see that there were no dangerous short circuits left by the fire having broken the wires; and also to find out what he would require in the way of replacement material.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgn) Lang Turner,\nIndian Agent.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner.\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose copy of a report from Indian Agent, Lang Turner, at Onion Lake regarding the fire which took place in the Anglican School at that point recently.\n\nYou authorized purchase of batteries in your telegram of the 8th instant and these have been shipped. There will be an account later on for material and rewiring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFebruary 21, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Turner:\n\nMy attention has been drawn to your 99-16 of the 11th instant, with reference to the recent fires at the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School. I take quite a serious view of the actions of George Pechowe and Gilbert Sackamoose and I believe it would be advisable for you to have a charge laid against them. They should be arrested by the police at some time during the day when those at the school will know that they are being apprehended. This and a short gaol sentence would have a salutary effect and would be one of the most effective ways of minimizing the risk of other pupils taking similar action. If the court approaches you concerning the sentence to be imposed, you may request the minimum term, as I do not consider a lengthy period in gaol would have a good effect on the culprits, themselves. No matter what the outcome is, these two boys should be considered discharged from school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Turner by telegraph at Onion Lake, and patrolled the same day to Onion Lake with police team.\n\nMr. Turner informed me that he was awaiting instructions from the Department of Indian Affairs as to certain boys at the Anglican Mission School at Harlan, who had confessed to setting fire to the school there.\n\nOn February 10th 1928 the Roman Catholic Mission was burned to the ground, together with the Church, and the same evening a fire was discovered in the roof of the new Anglican Mission six miles south, but this one was soon got under control.\n\nOwing to suspicious circumstances, a confession was secured from a boy named George Peechowe, aged 16, who was working at the Mission, that he had set fire to the building.\n\nMr. Turner has written to the Department asking what action to take, stating that he would recommend that the boy be punished, but that he would not take any criminal action through the Police until the wishes of the Department were known.\n\nHe has instructed Mr. Ellis, the Principal of the School to keep the lad and another one concerned in it under strict control until such times as instructions are received from the Department.\n\nA further report will be submitted whenever an investigation is made as to the various outbreaks of fire in the district. It is my opinion that there is some collusion between the boys who were concerned in the fire at the Anglican Mission and the boys at the Catholic Mission who more than likely started the fire there.\n\nF.B.

As a full report in connection with this fire was submitted to your Department through Mr. Turner, the local Indian Agent, I do not consider it necessary to enter into any further details in connection with the same in this letter, except to state that in the opinion of the Principal the fire was caused by a short circuit of the wires, and to request that provision be made both in the battery room and the engine house for better ventilation, in order that all gas fumes may immediately escape. I am making this request as the Principal has given it as his opinion that the fire from the short circuit of the wires ignited the fumes which had collected, and is otherwise unable to explain how the fire could have spread so rapidly.\n\nWhile writing in connection with this fire, I very much regret to have to report that a second fire broke out at this school on Friday, Feb. 10th. Upon investigation the Principal discovered that this fire had been started by two of the older boys, Gilbert Saskamoose, a boy age 17 years, and George Peechow, another boy of the same age. As a full report on the outbreak of this fire, including statements of the boys responsible for its origin, have already been forwarded to you through your local representative, it does not appear to me to be necessary to enter into further detail in this connection in this letter. Our Commission have instructed the Principal to consult the Indian Agent, and to come to a definite\nUnderstanding with him as to the nature of the punishment which should be administered to these two pupils for this serious offence, as they are strongly of the opinion that it should not be passed over lightly. The Principal's statement of the decision reached with regard to the nature of the punishment, has not yet come to hand, and I shall be glad to have an expression of your opinion in this matter. If instructions have been forwarded by your Department to the Indian Agent at Onion Lake in this connection, I shall be glad to have a copy of the same for our records here, as a guide to our Commission should any similar situation arise in future.\n\nWhile regretting very deeply the outbreak of these two fires, I cannot but feel that very great credit is due to the Principal and his staff for the prompt and effective way they were able to bring them under control.\n\nIf there is any further information you may desire in connection with the incidents referred to above, I shall be glad to furnish the same on receipt of your request.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTERW/JF\nOttawa, March 21st, 1926.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, relative to the recent fires at the Onion Lake C. of E. Indian Residential School.\n\nReports regarding the fires that occurred at this school were forwarded to the Department by Mr. Agent Turner, and I enclose herewith copy of a communication to Mr. Turner relative to the action that should be taken in the punishment of the two young Indian boys who were responsible for setting the fires. We have had no further information as to whether the instructions contained therein were carried out or not.\n\nYour report as to the cause of the fire that broke out in the battery room of the engine house has been noted. I shall be pleased if the Principal will forward, through Mr. Agent Turner, a recommendation as to what he would advise be done in making provision in both the battery room and engine house for better ventilation, in order that all gas fumes may immediately escape and thus overcome, in a great measure, any danger from fire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.G.,\n39-45 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOn February 27th 1928, I received a telegram from Mr. L. Turner, Indian Agent at Onion Lake, making for my attendance at Onion Lake as soon as possible in the above connection; instructions having been received by Mr. Turner from the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nI patrolled the same day with Police team horse 2030 and hired team horse, from Lloydminster to Onion Lake Indian Reserve, and by request of the Indian Agent made preparations to prosecute the above named Indian Boy who had assisted another Indian Boy to set fire to the Anglican Indian Residential School near Onion Lake, on the 10th of February 1928.\n\nI patrolled to Harlan and interviewed D.H. Cameron Esq., J.P., who refused to act on the preliminary hearing of a charge against this boy owing to the age of the boy, Gilbert Sacknosee, who is only 17; until the proper authority should be secured for him to assume the position of a Judge of a Juvenile Court.\n\nMr. Cameron consulted Chapter 108 of the R.S.eited as the Juvenile Delinquent's Act, 1906.C 40.\u00a7 1, and as the definition of \"child\" is \"a boy or girl apparently or actually under the age of eighteen years,\" he held that he could not act without further authority in the matter.\n\nI returned to Lloydminster Detachment, and by telephone received instructions from the Officer Commanding \"F\" Division Prince Albert, to advise Mr. Cameron to state the difficulty by night letter to the Attorney General for Saskatchewan; which he refused to do, however; taking the attitude that this was the duty of the Prosecution; so, acting for the Indian Agent I sent a night letter to the Attorney General for his advice.\n\nMr. L. Turner, the Indian Agent received a reply from the Attorney General, stating that the boys, Gilbert Sacknosee and George Peechowe, his companion could be prosecuted in the ordinary way as they were over the age of 16 years; and this ruling being satisfactory to Mr. D.H. Cameron, J.P.; I patrolled again to Onion Lake and Harlan on the 5th instant to prosecute.\n\nAt the Anglican Indian Residential School, near Onion Lake, on the 5th instant, Mr. Turner, Indian Agent, representing the Department of Indian Affairs, laid an information against Gilbert Sacknosee, under Section 31 of the Criminal Code of Canada.\nA warrant to apprehend the above named boy was handed to me, and acting in harmony with the wishes of the Department of Indian Affairs, I publicly arrested him.\n\nOn March 5th 1928, at Onion Lake Anglican Indian Residential School, Gilbert Sackmose, school boy aged 17 was charged that he did, on the 10th day of February 1928 at or near Onion Lake Saskatchewan, unlawfully, willfully, without legal justification or excuse, and without colour of right, set fire to a certain building, to wit; the Anglican Indian Residential School, there situate, the property of the Department of Indian Affairs, contrary to Section 511 of the Criminal Code of Canada.\n\nSeveral School boys; Mr Frank Rowe, Engineer employed in the School; and Mr L. Turner, Indian Agent; gave evidence. The evidence showed that at about eight o'clock on the night of February 10th 1928, the junior boys including the accused were located in their Dormitory, in accordance with the rules of the Institution, for the night. The accused in company with another boy named George Pochowe, had used the fire escape from their window to make their way to the ground, secure gasoline, and a brass and hit, and by going through the junior boys' Dormitory reached the attic; bored a hole and poured gasoline out on to the roof, which they set fire to with a match.\n\nHaving warned the other boys that they were about to set fire to the building, they waited till the fire had gained dangerous headway and then had given the alarm to a matron in charge of the junior boys' dormitory who gave the general alarm and the boys had rushed the house to such good effect that in twenty minutes after the alarm sounded the fire was out; and subsequent examination disclosed about $15.00 damage to the roof.\n\nMr Turner's evidence included a voluntary statement from the boys, and when warned by the Court and asked if they wished to make a statement, said that all the evidence given, was true, and that they wished to have their trial as soon as possible.\n\nThe Accused who admitted actually starting the fire with the assistance and advice of George Pochowe was by the Court ordered committed to Jail to await trial at the next Court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nI escorted the accused to Lloydminster on the 6th instant, and with a view to economy and in compliance with the wishes of the accused for a speedy trial, I communicated by telephone with F.G. Atkinson, Agent for the Attorney General at Battleford, who advised me that he would endeavour to arrange to have the accused appear before His Honour Judge Buckles as soon as possible for election as to trial.\n\nI escorted the accused from Lloydminster by train to North Battleford on the 7th instant and in the afternoon to Battleford. The same afternoon the accused Gilbert Sackmose appeared before His Honour Judge Buckles at the District Court Judges' Original Court and elected for speedy trial.\n\nCharged as above with setting fire to the School, the accused pleaded \"Guilty\" and when questioned by the Court stated that he had set fire to the school in order to obtain his liberty from the School.\nHis Honour inquired of me as to the previous character of the accused and his companion, their parents, and the view taken of the matter by the Department of Indian Affairs; and from information I was enabled to furnish, having made inquiries of the Rev. H. Ellis, the Principal of the School, as to their character, and of Mr. Turner, Indian Agent, as to the view taken of the matter by the Department, which was a serious one.\n\nHis Honour pointed out the very serious nature of the crime committed, stating that he would, on account of their youth give them a light sentence, but that owing to the very serious nature of the crime he did not think it would be in the interests of justice for him to give them a suspended sentence.\n\nHe therefore sentenced the accused Gilbert Sackmoose and his companion George Peschowe to five months imprisonment with hard labour; with the added requirement that they should report to the Lloydminster Detachment of the R.C.M.P. Police on release from Jail and at intervals of two months for one year thereafter.\n\nI escorted the accused Gilbert Sackmoose and his companion (charged jointly) George Peschowe, to the Jail at Prince Albert, arriving there on the 8th instant in P.M., and returning to Lloydminster in the early morning of the 10th instant.\n\nA further investigation may be made of the movements of the accused Gilbert Sackmoose and his companion George Peschowe, who may have been concerned in another outbreak of fire that occurred at the A.I.R. School a few days previous to the fire which was the subject of the charge in this report; and in the event of any connection being found a further report will be submitted.\n\nNothing in the evidence would indicate that there was any connection whatever with the cause of other fires in the same building or the other Schools in the district.\n\nF.B.

Police on release from Jail and at intervals of two months for one year thereafter.\n\nI escorted the accused George Peshow and his companion (charged jointly) Gilbert Sackmosee, to the Prince Albert Jail, arriving there on the 6th instant in P.M., and returning to Lloydminster in early morning of the date of this report.\n\nA further investigation may be made of the movements of the accused George Peshow and his companion Gilbert Sackmosee, who may have been concerned in another outbreak of fire that occurred at the A.I.R. School a few days previous to the fire which was the subject of the charge in this report; and in the event of any connection being found a further report will be submitted.\n\nNothing in the evidence would indicate that there was any connection whatever with the cause of other fires in the same building or the other Schools in the district.\n\nF.B.

Indian Residential School, I beg to inform you that, acting upon my request, Corporal Pearson, R.C.M.P., made quite a ceremony of the apprehension of George Pechowe and Gilbert Sackmosee, by arresting them in the dining hall at the school during dinner time. The arrests appeared to make a great impression on the minds of the other pupils, and I took the opportunity to speak to them of the danger and folly of such action as that of Pechowe and Sackmosee.\n\nThe lads were both committed for trial, and, on my advice, elected to have a speedy trial. They were taken before Judge Buckles at Battleford, on March 7th; pleaded \"Guilty\", and were each sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five months, with hard labour, and to be under police supervision for one year after release.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nDuncan G.

(RG 10, Volume 6321, file 655-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nONION LAKE C. of R. RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nI visited this school on March the 16th and made a general inspection of the school buildings and equipment. I found the school buildings clean and tidy and the children presented a healthy appearance, with one exception, a girl who was under the care of the Doctor at the Infirmary. The building appeared quite comfortable and I am told that they have no difficulty in heating it during the coldest weather.\n\nFire Protection - There is a stand pipe at each end of the hall in the main building with hose connections on each floor. I tested the hose, by turning on the water and found it in good condition. There are also two fire extinguishers kept on each floor for emergency use. A large cement storage tank, which is kept full, insures a supply of water and in case of fire they do not depend entirely on the pumping system at the lake. An electric pump is used to fill the pressure tank and is working very satisfactorily. The engine, which was provided to pump water from the lake, is worn out and has been discarded and they are now using the farm engine for that purpose. I am informed that this engine, when supplied, was a second hand one and has never given satisfaction. The water system was put to a test twice during the month of February and stood up well. A fire broke out in the boiler room on February the 6th and did considerable damage to the roof, but was successfully put out. I made a close examination with a view to finding out the cause and think it quite possible that a short circuit in the wiring may have been responsible for it. A suspicion has since arisen that the fire may have been of an incendiary nature in as much as the school was deliberately set on fire on February the 10th by two boys who worked in the engine room. On the latter\noccasion the boys climbed into the attic with a small tin of gasoline, which they threw on the interior of the roof and set fire to it. This fire was put out before it had gained much headway. The boys, namely, George Pechow and Joe Sacamoose, pleaded guilty and are now serving five months in the Prince Albert jail.\n\nFire Escapes - Iron stairs with landings at each floor are provided at the back of each wing. I noted that the means of access to these escapes are convenient and the windows, which are secured with hooks on the inside, can be quickly removed from the interior, while they cannot be opened from the outside. I tested the fire alarm and found it in good order. Regular fire drill has also been a feature at this school and the children, I am informed, were not excited when the fire broke out.\n\nStaff - I noted that some changes in the staff had been made since my last visit. I was much more pleased with conditions at this school than I have been on former occasions. I was present at the children's evening meal and noted that they had an ample supply of good wholesome food. Meat is given to most of them twice a day and they are given all the milk they care to drink. They have nineteen milch cows and were milking eight at the time of my visit.\n\nFarming - Their wheat crop, 40 acres which was sown on new land, was badly frozen and they only threshed 90 bushels. I saw a sample of this grain and it was really not good feed. They threshed 2,400 bushels of oats, which were a good sample from 72 acres and 360 bushels of barley from 14 acres. Their garden was a complete failure, owing to frost and their supply of potatoes have had to be purchased.\n\nOutbuildings - The barn, about which some complaint was made last year regarding ventilation, has been very comfortable during the past winter. The suggestions,\nwhich I made last year, have been partially carried out. The openings between the joist have been filled in and as a consequence steam has not collected to any extent on the roof. Material has been supplied to box in the ventilators to the roof and the Principal assured me that he will have this work done by his staff. I examined the hay carrier and found the trouble was not caused through the supporting brackets being nailed, as I found the supporting brackets all firmly in place. The difficulty was that the end pulley was attached to a 2 x 6, spiked to the studding. This should have been bolted, as it happened this 2 x 6 was wrenched from its place and the strain came directly on the track, one section of which was badly bent. In consequence, several of the cast iron clips were snapped off. These can easily be replaced and the track put in proper shape at very little expense. The stanchions, which were reported as practically useless by Canon Westgate, were not installed in accordance with specifications, being about five inches lower than called for in the plans. However, the remark that they were practically useless was absolutely unjustified by facts. I had the cows rounded into the stable and made a thorough and close examination and found that they were perfectly comfortable. The Principal had to agree with me in this connection. The stanchions have been in use for two years, however, instructions have been given to install them in accordance with plans. In my opinion, the expense is unnecessary at the present time. Two new granaries have been added since my last visit and a very fine cement root house has been provided. This root house, however, has not been used during the past winter, as they had nothing to put in it. A hen house and implement shed complete the outbuildings. They require a hog pen, I noted a big improvement in tidiness about the premises. I have already reported in connection with the drain from the Principal's house.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6321, file 658-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\n\nREGINA, SASK., APRIL 1928\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith Inspector Murison's report on the various schools in the Onion Lake Agency. The report is very complete and the Inspector has gone into matters very thoroughly.\n\nWith reference to the Cold Lake Day School, I notice that the Priest in charge of the Mission purchased beef, beans, lard and tea at a cost of $5.70 and provided a bowl of soup for each child at a cost of less than one cent per meal. I do not think the Department want to call on the Priest to provide this food for the Indian school children and I am of the opinion that they would be willing to make a small grant for this purpose, say five or six dollars a month. I should be glad if action on these lines could be taken, as I do not think it is the intention of the Department that children should go to Day School on empty stomachs, as is pointed out by the Inspector.\n\nThe work that is going on at the Keeheewin Day School seems to be quite satisfactory, but the building in which this school is held should be plastered with lime and sand this summer. The cost would not be more than $100.00, and probably a great deal less. It is poor business plastering with mud.\n\n-The attendance-\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nThe attendance at the Frog Lake Day School has not been good. This school also should be plastered with lime and sand during the coming summer. You will note that there is not much of a midday meal being provided here and I think we might meet the request of the parents and see that a certain amount of meat, etc., is provided so that the children could have a bowl of soup at midday, especially during the winter months, and for the year around we might send a supply of Dri-Milk to this school. Dri-Milk is very palatable and just as good as the other milk and the cost would be very small.\n\nYou will note what the Inspector says regarding the fires that have broken out at the C.of E. Indian Residential School, also his remarks about the fire escapes. I would particularly draw your attention to the Inspector's remarks regarding the hay carrier, which was complained of by Dr. Westgate. It seems to me that this is a detail that could have been looked after by the Principal had he been at all practical, and I do not know that Dr. Westgate's report was called for. According to the Inspector, the stanchions which Dr. Westgate complained of as being useless, were not at all bad. However, I have given instructions to have these changed this Spring. The Inspector assures me that the cattle have not been suffering any discomfort.\n\nI would also draw your attention to the Inspector's remarks regarding the pumping engine that was installed at this school and has only been in use for a little over a year but is now claimed to be worn out and has been discarded. The information given to the Inspector that the engine was second-hand when installed is absolutely wrong and after reading the report I called on Mr. Paulin, the man who secured this engine from the Ontario Wind Engine and Pump Company and installed it for us, and he has given me a Declaration to the effect that the engine was absolutely new. I then called upon the Manager of the Ontario Wind Engine & Pump Company, who was surprised to learn of this report and had no hesitation whatever in giving a Declaration, and Mr. Hamilton, Building Inspector, who was on the job, is satisfied that the engine was a new one. In the face of this we have a report from absolutely incompetent men to the effect that a second-hand engine was supplied. The trouble here is that\u2014\nis that our plant is in the hands of people who do not understand how to handle it, and I do not think the Department should be called upon every now and again when damage is done through inexperienced men handling this machinery.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, April 23, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your 309-11 of the 10th instant, enclosing Inspector Murison's report on the schools in the Union Lake Agency. You will receive separate communications regarding any action that is required for each school. I note that the pumping engine installed at the C. of E. Residential School was a new one and that it must have been improperly handled. Mr. Murison's report on this school indicates more satisfactory conditions than in the past.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nOwing to a fire that occurred at the Onion Lake C. of E. Indian Residential School, some damage was done to the interior of the building, and some tools were lost, and I am in receipt of a letter from the Indian Agent, in which he asks that the following material be allowed:\n\n- Endless leather belt $40.00\n- Rubber belting $25.00\n- Tools $15.00\n- Paint, etc. $54.00\n- Lumber & Shingles, to repair roof $25.00\n\nTotal $160.00\n\nKindly advise me if this may be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Indian Residential School, as mentioned in your letter. Accounts covering the cost should be forwarded in the usual manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

We can protect the boilers, no doubt, by using Soda Ash, (14lbs to a 1000 gallons of water) but unless a soft water system is installed very soon, I fear that many of the pipes on all the pressure lines will have to be changed.\n\nLast summer it was necessary because of the chemical action to change the tubes in the hot water tank. We have now located three places where the iron piping has been eaten through.\n\nBy installing a soft water system now, will save a very heavy expenditure in changing other lines.\n\nWill you kindly bring this to the notice of the Department in order that they consider the situation before it is too late.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHenry Ellis (Signed)\nPrincipal\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir: Re: Need of Water Softener at Onion Lake School, C. of E.\n\nI enclose herewith a copy of a letter just received from the Principal of our Society's School at Onion Lake, setting forth the necessity of having a water softening process installed at this School, if the water system is to be maintained in working order, and frequent inconveniences and expenditures in this connexion avoided. A similar process is also required at the Elkhorn and Blood Schools where the chemical action of the water supplies is seriously affecting the boilers and pipes in the way described by the Principal of our Onion Lake School.\n\nI commend these needs to the earliest possible consideration of your Department, and remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nEnc.\nMay 16, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, together with a copy of that sent to you by Henry Ellis, Principal of the Onion Lake Indian Residential School, with reference to the necessity of providing the above mentioned institution with a water softening apparatus, together with that of Elkhorn and Blood Schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that before giving any consideration to this request I should like to be furnished with a report of the chemical analysis of the water which is being used at the above mentioned buildings. This could be obtained by sending a specimen of water to the Provincial Department of Health at Winnipeg, as has been previously done. When this report is received the matter shall receive further attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing, Aest. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R.

This engine was bought by the Department, at the time this school was erected, for pumping purposes. The Principal at the School claimed that it was not giving proper service, and, after a good deal of correspondence, I directed that it should be returned to the shippers at Regina for examination. It is claimed by the shippers and the contractor who installed it, that it was a new engine and should have given efficient service, if it had been properly handled. Under the circumstances, I beg to recommend payment of the voucher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nI visited the Onion Lake C. H. Indian Residential School during July, and I am satisfied that a filter and softener should be supplied for this school as soon as the necessary funds ($1800) can be appropriated. I have made a note for 1929-30 Estimates.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6321, file 658-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, August 8, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nPursuant to Mr. Ferrier's visit with you to the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School, I have to authorize you to screen the verandah of the Principal's residence and to put a storm porch on the back door. You may also provide two screen doors. The total cost of this activity should not exceed $140.\n\nI am pleased to state that funds were specifically provided for the new kitchen range for the main building at this school. You may arrange for the purchase of a suitable 3-oven and 2-firebox range, at an approximate cost of $459. You should secure competitive prices, if possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nWith reference to Department No. 115-1-5, dated the 17th December last, on the subject of providing eavestroughing and down pipe at the Onion Lake C. of E. Indian Residential School, I have to advise you that I have been in correspondence with the Indian Agent and he informs me that two firms who have submitted prices both affirm that it would not be practicable to provide the outlet for the rain water into the present storage tank, which I at first supposed could be used for the purpose. One firm offers to provide eavestroughing and rain water tank complete for the sum of $3,441.00, but this sum appears to be excessive. The other firm offers to provide the eavestroughing and supply and install the drain from the building to the proposed site of a rain water tank for the sum of $866.25. Mr. Turner is of the opinion that, if this latter work were done, he could arrange to install a rain water tank 16' x 13' x 8' for an amount not exceeding $800.00, bringing the total cost to $1,666.25 approximately.\n\nI think that the eavestroughing should be supplied, but I cannot at the present time recommend the added expenditure, and I think the question of the permanent disposal of the water should be left over until an Inspector next visits the Agency. For the present, therefore, I would recommend that the eavestroughing be supplied and installed at the price of $394.90, the figure given in my letter to you of the 10th December last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nW.

Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nOn your return to Ottawa, you promised me to look into the question of shelving and sewing machines to be supplied to the Onion Lake C.E. Indian Residential School.\n\nRegarding the sewing machines, I am still at a loss to know why these should have been struck off the list by the Department, when they have been supplied to all other Indian Residential schools. These were included again in my list of requirements in the 1927 estimates, asking for two ordinary machines and one Jumbo tailor machine, but to date they have not been supplied.\n\nRegarding the shelving, you will remember that I spoke about the meagre amount the Department allowed which was $250.00 to furnish the shelving when the school was first opened. The actual amount of shelving for this amount was 1500 ft. Speaking to Mr. Hamilton, the Inspector of Construction recently, he confirmed this amount, which left nothing for cupboards and the food store rooms. With your knowledge of Institutional life and the equipment required for the running of the same, I feel sure that you will agree that a serious inadvertence has been made.\n\nOn October 20th 1925 you instructed Mr. Commissioner Graham to arrange to have whatever shelving and cupboards built other than the plans indicated. The grant allowed by the Commissioner was so small that the shelving of two store rooms and cupboards for the sewing room and because the Infirmary was then occupied as a residence, these had to be left off the list.\nI personally enquired at the new R.S. School at Onion Lake and find that the amount for shelving and cupboards put in at that Institution other than their plans specified exceeded the $2300.00 mark.\n\nComparing their grant allowed with the $250.00 we were allowed, you will readily see that there has been a mistake made in our requirements.\n\nCupboards and shelving for the Infirmary, Sewing room and the food store room are urgently required, and I would be obliged if you will grant this to be done with the least possible delay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nP.S. Speaking to Mr. Indian Agent Turner today he states that the cupboards for the dormitories have been authorized and will commence this work as soon as possible.\nOttawa, October 6, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th ultimo, with reference to shelving and cupboards for the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School. I should be pleased if you would secure an estimate of the cost of having the infirmary, the sewing room and the store room properly equipped. When you have this information, please give it to Mr. Indian Agent Turner and ask him to forward it direct to the Department.\n\nTwo ordinary sewing machines and one tailoring machine are being ordered, and a letter in this connection will be directed to Mr. Indian Agent Turner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

November 16, 1928\n\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am obliged to direct your attention to the urgent need of a suitable engine for pumping the water at our Onion Lake School. It would appear from correspondence before me that Mr. Indian Agent Turner, acting on instructions received from Mr. Commissioner Graham, requested the Rev. Principal Ellis to have the engine at the pump-house on the lake's shore returned to the Ontario Wind Engine & Pump Co., Regina. This engine, which had never given satisfaction, had previously been removed from the engine house, and was used for cutting wood and crushing grain whenever a grain crusher could be borrowed. To take its place, for the time being, the Principal installed in the pump house the engine which he had been using for other purposes, such as cutting wood, etc. While this engine is made at present to furnish the school's supply of water, the Principal states that it is not sufficiently powerful for this purpose, and has to be kept working daily from 8 in the morning until 9 o'clock at night, with a correspondingly large consumption of gasoline. He was of the opinion, that the other engine was removed by order of the Commissioner, a better engine would have been supplied immediately to take its place. This action however, has not been taken, and I am obliged to submit the matter to you for your prompt and sympathetic consideration.\n\nThe Principal states that the engine required to furnish the school with a necessary supply of water should be one of not less than 6 H.P., or one that would pump at least from 2,500 to 3,000 gallons per hour. He also suggests that the new engine should have a better cooling system than the one removed, as that was one of the hopper type which may be suitable enough for outdoor work, but was by no means suitable\nfor indoor work in a small pump house only 9 ft. square, where the steam created affected the magneto.\n\nHe also states that the piping laid from the lake to the main school building is of 2\u00bd\" dimensions and consequently an engine more powerful than the one first installed could easily deliver 3,000 gallons per hour without any fear of friction.\n\nIn commenting on the engine which you have removed, the Principal expresses some doubt as to whether it was new when it was installed. In support of this he states that the main drive shaft was bent when it arrived and that it was equipped with a Webster magneto, the kind which is easily put out of commission through the steam created in the small building.\n\nI trust, therefore, that in view of the above considerations, you may be able to furnish a new engine at a very early date as the School Management are left without an engine for cutting wood, crushing grain, etc., and as our Society is faced with an unnecessary heavy expenditure on account of gasoline to keep the smaller engine temporarily installed in the pump house, in operation for thirteen hours daily.\n\n- I have the honour to be, Sir,-\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.O.O.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6321, file 658-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, November 26, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to your 309-11A C.E. of July 25th, last, concerning the gasoline engine which was shipped from the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School to Regina for examination. It is now reported that neither the engine nor one to take its place was returned to the school. I should be grateful if you would give this your immediate attention. The Rev. Principal has reported that the engine should be not less than 6 horse power, as one that will pump 3,000 gallons per hour is desirable. He also requests a better cooling system than the one on the engine which was sent to Regina. The steam from the Hopper type of cooler affected the magneto when operated in the small pumphouse. In view of these representations, it might be advisable to supply the engine requested and secure a credit for the old one. If you concur, please make the necessary arrangements without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

Only 1019 bushels of wheat were threshed; this will possibly grade 5 or 6 Northern. 656 bushels of oats were threshed from 25 acres and 50 acres of oats were not considered worth threshing and were kept for feed. 13 acres of barley yielded 199 bushels. It is too bad that this grain was frozen as they had the promise of an excellent crop of wheat. The frost also effected the yield of their garden produce.\n\nThe stock now consist of 29 cattle, 12 of which are milch cows. They have 4 good work horses, 2 old horses and 2 drivers. They require another team. They have 25 poultry and 17 hogs.\n\nI may say that I was better pleased with conditions at this school than I have been on any previous visit.\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nCommissioners Office, Sask.\nNov. 29th, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nYou will note what Mr. Grevil, the Engineer at the Onion Lake C. of E. School asks for in the way of hose for fire protection. This might be authorized. You will also note what the Inspector says regarding the completion of the contract at the new R.C. Indian Residential School. He states that no provision was made for chimneys in the laundry and bake-oven. This may or may not have been an oversight, as they may have had some other scheme in view when the plans were drawn. He also complains about the manner in which the laundry floor has been built. I do not know whether this was in accordance with the details of the plans or not. Mr. Hamilton has gone to this school to make a final report and the Department will then be in a position to know just how the matter stands.\n\nOne matter, however, I think should not escape the attention of the Department and that is that the Inspector says he was not impressed with the Engineer. I do not know whether this man has the proper qualifications or not, but if he has not he should be replaced. It is absolutely wrong to have an incompetent man handling a plant of this kind, as he can do more damage in a few months that we should expect to occur in ten years. I would ask the Department to look carefully into this man's qualifications. The Inspector remarks that he has a great deal to say. I found this to be the case when I was at this school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6321, file 658-5, part 4)\nRegina, Sask. Nov. 23rd, 1928.\n\nINSPECTION REPORT ON SCHOOLS ONION LAKE AGENCY.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nONION LAKE CHURCH OF ENGLAND RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nI visited this school on October 24th, and made a careful inspection of the school and outbuildings. I found the school buildings in a well kept condition.\n\nThere are 60 pupils enrolled at this school; 77 were present on the day of my visit, 44 boys and 33 girls. The pupils were clean and tidy and had a healthy appearance. I am informed that there has been very little illness at this school during the past year.\n\nI was present at the children's noon-day meal and noted that they had an ample supply of wholesome food. The children received all the milk that they care to drink. They were milking 5 cows at the time of my visit, which give them an ample supply for the children.\n\nThe Rev. H. Ellis, Principal, has as a staff 7 women, 1 of whom is a trained nurse and 2 are properly qualified teachers. The kitchen matron was absent on the day of my visit on account of sickness. Mr. D. Spooner, the farming instructor, appears to be a competent man. Mr. W. Gravil, the Engineer, impresses me as being a first class man for the position. He appears to thoroughly understand the operation of the plant and is quite capable of doing the necessary repair work. I found everything in the boiler and engine room in first class condition.\n\nMr. Gravil brought to my attention that the water system was not available for fire protection in the engine and boiler rooms and stated that if he was supplied with a 1\u00bd\" hose connection and 50 ft. of fire hose, he could do the work himself and provide protection for that wing of the building. They have one large size extinguisher in the boiler room. He also pointed out that a ventilating fan installed in the chimney would carry off the battery and gas fumes from the engine room. He tells me that at times these are quite strong.\n\nI examined the fire fighting equipment and found it to be in good working order. The plant appears to be operating satisfactorily. They are still using the farm engine to pump water from the lake.\n\nOUTBUILDINGS.\n\nSince my last visit, the stanchions in the cow barn have been raised and re-set in cement. The hay carrier track has also been repaired. I notice an improvement in the condition of the outbuildings and in the tidiness of the premises. A separate sewage disposal system has been installed in connection with the Principal's residence and is very much appreciated. It is working very satisfactorily.\n\nFARM.\n\nThe School crop this year consisted of 50 acres of wheat, 75 acres of oats and 13 acres of barley. The sample...\nOttawa, December 6, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Mr. Inspector Murison's report on his inspection of the Onion Lake C.E. Indian Residential School regarding the request of the engineer for fire protection in the engine and boiler rooms, I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of 50' of fire hose, with the necessary connections and nozzle. Please forward an account in the usual manner covering the cost.\n\nIt is noted that the engineer also requests that a ventilating fan be installed in the chimney to carry off the gas fumes from the engine room. If you consider that this fan should be installed, you may arrange to have the work carried out, keeping the cost as low as possible.\n\nIt is noted that the Inspector found an improvement in the general conditions at the school and in the tidiness of the premises.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, No. 115-1-5, with reference to the gasoline engine that was shipped from the Onion Lake C.E. Indian Residential School to Regina for examination. This engine was brought here at my request, as the Principal reported it to be useless to him. After it arrived here I had the Ontario Wind Engine & Pump Company, who had supplied it, make the examination and their statement was that the engine was practically a total wreck, owing to the rough usage it had received, and that it was absolutely shameful to have handled an engine in such a way. Mr. Paulin, who went up there at the time the engine was installed tells me that it is one of the best engines he knows, and that in proper hands it would be capable of doing even more than it is called upon to do at the School, so that there is no doubt at all in my mind that this machinery is in incompetent hands. This is what I have been complaining about all along, viz.\u2014the way in which our machinery is handled, not only at this school, but at many others as well.\n\nI note the Rev. Principal has reported to you that the engine should be not less than 6 h.p. It might be well to inform him that the one which he now has is 7 h.p.\u20141 h.p. more than he thinks he should have. This gives you an idea of his knowledge of engines. I cannot conscientiously recommend the buying of expensive machinery to be put into the hands of such men as we have at some of our schools, and Onion Lake is one.\n\n\u2014I may\u2014\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI may say that this engine is being thoroughly overhauled and will be put in as good shape as it was the day it first left the factory, and I think that in future it should be up to the church authorities to see that it is kept in repair and put in the hands of competent operators. It will be about two days before it is completed and I shall then see that it is shipped out immediately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, December 12, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of the 16th ultimo, concerning a suitable engine for pumping water at the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School. I have today received a report from Mr. Commissioner Graham, and am pleased to state that this engine has been thoroughly overhauled and returned to the school already. I may add that the Ontario Wind Engine and Pump Company reported that the engine had received rough usage. Further, it is a 7 horse power, which is more powerful than the one requested by the Principal as necessary for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

He also states that the station agent at Lloydminster had received no advice in connection with it.\n\nWith regard to the report of the Ontario Wind Engine and Pump Company mentioned in your letter, \"that the engine had received rough usage\", the Principal remarks as follows:\n\n\"If the engine which was running the day before it was returned to Regina had received rough usage, it must have been before it was installed at the school. The Building Inspector and other workmen here were very much surprised that such an engine was installed here as new equipment. I can produce expert opinions that the engine was in better working shape when it left here than when it was first installed, as it was installed with a bent crank shaft which was afterwards changed by the Company that furnished the engine.\n\nThe engine is of an inferior make and is not capable of standing up to the daily running which a pump engine is required to do. These engines are installed with a Webster Oscillatory type magneto which are easily put out of action by the steam created in a pump house 9' x 9'. These engines...\"\n\"are only suitable for occasional outdoor work, and that is why the engine had to be changed.\"\n\nIn the light of the above information, in addition to that set forth in my letter of Nov. 16, I am of the opinion, that the expenditure incurred in having the old engine removed and overhauled might better have been applied towards the purchase of a new engine. However, as the Commissioner decided to have the old engine overhauled, and as the School Management is subjected to much inconvenience owing to the shortage of an engine, I shall be obliged if you will endeavour to have this one returned at the earliest date possible.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Dec. 31 | To the following eavestroughing material supplied for Anglican Indian Residential School, Onion Lake Agency. | $68.20 |\n| Dec. 6 | 620 feet, 5\" eaves-troughing @ 11\u00a2 | $68.20 |\n|       | 210 \" 4\" Conductor pipe @ 14\u00a2 | $30.45 |\n|       | 6 Outside mitres, 5\" @ 7\u00a2 | $4.20 |\n|       | 2 inside \" \" @ 1\u00a2 | $1.40 |\n|       | 26 Ends, 5\" @ 1\u00a2 | $4.48 |\n|       | 14 \"roos \"plain, @ 6\u00a2 | $8.68 |\n|       | 28 \"elbows, 4\" \" @ 4\u00a2 | $11.76 |\n|       | 10 \"Shoes, \" @ 5\u00a2 | $5.70 |\n|       | 6 \"lbs.Solder @ 4\u00a2 | $2.70 |\n|       | 1 \"Ammoniac acid @ 5\u00a2 | $0.50 |\n|       | 250 \"Spikes and ferrules. @ 0.5\u00a2 | $12.50 |\n|       | $150.57 | $150.57 |\n\nPre-paid freight. $2.13\n\n| 29 | 20 feet 5\" eavestroughing. | $2.20 |\n|    | 2 Drops, 5\" plain. | $1.24 |\n|    | 50 feet 5\" eavestroughing. | $5.50 |\n|    | $6.94 | $8.94 |\n\nAuthority.\n\nCommissioner's telegram dated Nov. 27th 1926.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nForm 52.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Oil Cup must have been lost in transit, so the Company sent a supposed new one. The total account being $15.99.\n\nThe engine returned is practically the same as it left here, except that the bearings on the main drive shaft have been re-babbitied. As before stated, the engine for the present pump house is useless, as the globules of water caused through the condensation of the steam created from the hopper of the engine forms on the breaker points of the magneto and causes a short circuit. The engine cannot run more than thirty minutes at any time without stopping.\n\nIt will be necessary to build an addition to the present pump house which is 9' x 9' before the engine can again be permanently installed.\n\nAs the engine was returned to the Company by the Department and repaired by them I cannot see why the Commission should be held responsible for this account.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) Henry Ellis,\nPrincipal\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nJanuary 21, 1929\n\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of Dec. 12th, last (115-1-5) and my reply to the same on the 3rd inst., relative to the repairing of the pump engine at our Onion Lake School, you will find enclosed herewith a bill from the Ontario Wind Engine & Pump Co. for $15.99 for the repairs effected, and also a copy of the Principal's covering letter to me when he forwarded the above bill. As the engine was removed from the School by order of Mr. Commissioner Graham, and apparently without any reference whatever to the Principal, our Commission consider that the bill should be met by your Department and not by them.\n\nIn connection with the enclosed letter, I beg to direct your attention to the need of a larger pump house as set forth in the second last paragraph, before the returned engine can be permanently installed. If your Department would provide the material, the School Management could make the enlargement, and I beg to suggest that you authorize Mr. Indian Agent Turner to take any further action necessary in this connection.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

H. Ellis, principal at the Onion Lake Anglican Indian Residential School, has informed me that the Department wrote to the Rev. T. B. R. Westgate, M.S.C.C. under date of January 29th last, requesting him to obtain an estimate of the cost of the materials required for the enlargement of the pump house at the school.\n\nIt appears that what the school really requires is a new pump house, built on a level about four feet above that of the present one, and not the enlargement of the existing one, the basement of which is below the level of the lake from which the water is pumped, and consequently is always flooded with water.\n\nThe following is a list of the material required, and the estimated cost, for the construction of a building such as Mr. Ellis is asking for; 10' x 16' in size, with a concrete floor and foundation, and a brick chimney:\n\n- 40 bags, Cement @ $1.50 = $60.00\n- 3 \" Lime = $4.50\n- 8 yds.

The estimate given by you of the cost of the various materials required in the erection of the building have been noted, and the various amounts should not be exceeded, if possible. If the school will provide the labour, you may arrange for the purchase, to the best advantage, of the material required to construct the building, and you should forward itemized accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.

Engine in use at C.o.F.E. Residential School, Onion Lake, Sask.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 118-1-5 dated 26th Nov. 1928 and reply dated 7th December.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101.\nWinnipeg, Man. May 28, 1929\n\nThe Secretary\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI deeply regret to have to direct your attention to the difficulty which the school management of our Onion Lake School still have with the water system. You will recall from your letter of December 12th, 1928, #15-1-5, that the pumping engine had been taken out by Mr. Commissioner Graham for repairs, and was returned to the school. In a letter dated May 13th, Mr. Ellis, the Principal of this school, states that this engine cannot be used for pumping purposes, and that he has been obliged to use for pumping the water required by the school, the engine that was supplied in 1921. He states, however, that it will be a matter of a few weeks before this engine will be used up, and he urges that a new and suitable engine be supplied forthwith.\n\nIn addition to the difficulty with the engine, he directs attention to the urgent need of a larger pump. He points out that the best result he can obtain with the present pump is only 450 gallons per hour and recommends that a pump be provided which has a capacity of at least 3,000 gallons per hour. The present pump has a capacity of 1,000 gallons per hour, but owing to the elevation between the lake and the school, this capacity is reduced to 450 gallons per hour. If a 3,000 gallon per hour pump were installed, the high elevation would reduce this capacity to 1,500 gallons per hour, and this is the minimum required to meet the school's needs, and to maintain a sufficient pressure to combat any outbreak of fire. He states that even with the two compression tanks full of water, and the engine pumping at the lake shore, it would not be possible with the present pump and engine to \"keep one fire hose stream constantly working.\"\nThe necessity of these improvements in the water system at this school are very obvious to our Commission, on account of the abnormally heavy bills they have to meet on account of oil and gasoline. Your Department has recently authorized the erection of a larger pump-house and our Commission feel strongly that arrangements should be made for the whole water system to be placed on a satisfactory working basis at the same time, by the installation of a proper pump and pumping engine.\n\nAt the time that Mr. Ellis wrote his letter, he states that the pump had broken down and that the school management were forced to draw water from the lake by hand.\n\nI expect to visit this institution early in June, and would like to be able at that time to inform the Principal and his staff that the unnecessary labour and anxiety which they have had to contend with for so long a time, in connection with the school's water system, was about to be eliminated. I shall be obliged, therefore, if you will give this important matter your very careful consideration and kindly undertake to supply the pump and engine recommended.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, June 4, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, requesting that a new engine for pumping purposes and a pump of larger capacity be supplied for the use of the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School. In this connection I have to inform you that the Department is referring this matter to Mr. Commissioner Graham for a report as to cost, etc. When his reply is received, consideration will be given to furnishing this equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Westgate, Field Secretary, M.S.C.G., relative to the engine used for pumping purposes at the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School. In this connection you will note that besides requesting that a new engine be supplied he also asks that a pump of a larger capacity be installed. I shall be pleased to have your recommendation regarding the request of Rev. Dr. Westgate, and, if possible, you should furnish an estimate of the cost of any changes you recommend be made in the pumping equipment at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOffice of the Onion Lake Indian Agency,\n\nMay 30, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 36, amounting to $44.80 in favour of Crane Limited, Winnipeg, Man., for Wire Guards.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 115-1-5 dated April 11, 1929.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI received a letter from the Department dated the 4th instant, No. 115-1-5, enclosing for my information a copy of a communication received from the Rev. T.B.R. Westgate, Field Secretary, M.S.C.C., relative to the engine and pump in use at the Onion Lake C. of E. Indian Residential School. This matter is one that has caused me a great deal of anxiety, and a great deal of correspondence has passed between this office and the Department concerning it ever since the school was built. I took every precaution to see that the system was properly installed and abundantly able to do the work for which it was intended. You will, perhaps, recall that shortly after this system was installed it was reported on as being of little use, and it was said that the engine was defective. I sent a practical man from here, viz:- Mr. E. P. Paulin, who understands the business of installing systems of this kind, and he spent a great deal of time at the school putting everything in good shape. On his return he reported to me that he was of the opinion that no matter what kind of a system, or how good a pump and engine we put in there it would only be a short time until it was put out of business, owing to the utter inefficiency of the Principal and the man who was directly under him. Shortly afterwards Mr. Paulin's prediction came true, and the engine was put out of commission through inefficient handling. I then had this engine brought back to Regina, thoroughly overhauled, and tested in the presence of an expert. I also had an officer from this Department go over and see that it was in Al shape before it was shipped back to Onion Lake.\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nnow being called upon to buy another engine to replace this one, and the result would have been the same had it been a brand new engine. I claim it is a waste of money to allow expensive machinery to be placed in the hands of inefficient men such as we have at this school. I have not seen the engine, but I have had reports from competent men to the effect that it has been abused, and how could it be otherwise when they take on men and pay them half, or probably less than half the wages that would be paid a man to run such machinery in any other institution.\n\nI note that Dr. Westgate, in his letter to the Secretary, states that the best result which can be obtained with the present pump is 450 gallons per hour, and recommends that a pump be provided which has a capacity of at least 3,000 gallons per hour. He goes on to say that the present pump had a capacity of 1,000 gallons per hour, but owing to the elevation between the lake and the school, this capacity is reduced to 450 gallons per hour. There is something radically wrong here. I will admit that there is a certain loss of friction owing to the fact that the water has to be forced from the lake up a hill, but this loss does not and could not possibly reduce the capacity to 450 gallons if the engine and the pump were kept in the condition in which they should be kept. It might reduce the capacity a couple of hundred gallons, and if it did it would still provide all the water that was required. You will recall that at a great expense to the Department we had a large tank built just outside the building for the purpose of acting as a reservoir, and also so that the big pump, which I am speaking about, would not be called upon to force the water into the pressure tanks but only into this reservoir, and we have an electric pump for the purpose of pumping the water from this reservoir into the pressure tanks, so that the system was an ideal one had it been handled properly, and any practical man who understands this machinery will bear me out in this. It is just about one year since the overhauled engine was returned to the school and now we are asked to buy another engine and pump. Mr. Paulin, and others claim that a pump with a capacity of 3,000 gallons per hour is absolutely unnecessary, and that the purchase of such a large pump would be a useless waste of money. I am inclined to think-\nthink that if the present pump and engine were in the hands of competent men they might be put in shape without buying anything.\n\nMy advice to the Department is that they insist upon a properly qualified man being put in charge of this plant, otherwise we are just going to tear through and break up machinery at a great and unnecessary cost to the Government.\n\nIf it is your wish that I should buy a new engine and pump I should be glad to be advised, but I would strongly recommend that nothing be done until we have an Al man in charge. I would also recommend that the present pump and engine be returned to Regina to be overhauled again by the people who supplied them, and they will give us a report as to the cause of the defects if there are any. If it is found that they can be put in shape they can be returned to the school, but if on the other hand they are found to be beyond repair we can then buy a new outfit. In the event of a new outfit having to be provided we might buy a 10 h.p. instead of a 7 h.p. engine, but I believe it would be a mistake to buy a larger pump, and we certainly should not buy one with a 3,000 gallon per hour capacity. Mr. Paulin and others tell me that a pump the size of the one now in use if properly handled and kept in repair is capable of delivering 1,000 gallons per hour, which is ample when we take into consideration the system that we have at this school.\n\nWe have had a lot of correspondence about this matter and I should like to get it settled once and for all, but I cannot see any daylight until we know we are going to have this machinery handled by men who understand how to handle it properly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nJune 18, 1929.\n\nMemorandum: Dr. Scott,\n\nThere has been considerable correspondence regarding the water supply system at the Onion Lake C. of E. School; in fact from the time the building was opened the system does not appear to have given satisfaction. Commissioner Graham reports that the principal fault is due to the incompetency of the Engineer in charge of the plant. I beg to recommend for your consideration that the Dominion Water Power Branch be asked to have one of their Engineers make an inspection of the water supply system at this building and report to the Department, stating whether the Engineer at the School is competent to operate the plant.\n\nARCHITECT.\nOttawa, June 31, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 14th instant with regard to the proposed installation of an air starter for the operating of the 25 h.p. engine etc., for the Onion Lake R.C. residential school, Sask., I beg to request that you arrange at once for the furnishing and installation of the above mentioned machinery as already recommended by Mr. Tempest, Commissioner of Irrigation, last October.\n\nYou may also authorize the purchase of 300 ft. of 2\u00bd\" fire hose with necessary couplings and hose rack for its proper keeping. Should additional fire extinguishers be required besides those already in the building, these may also be purchased and installed in place.\n\nAs I presume that it will be necessary for one of your Engineers to supervise the installation of the air starter, kindly instruct him to make an inspection of the water supply system of the Church of England residential school which is located a short distance from the above mentioned one, and to ascertain whether the Engineer in charge of the system possesses the necessary qualifications for the proper operating of the above mentioned plant.\n\nI should appreciate if you would give the above mentioned matters your earliest consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power Branch,\nOttawa.\nIndian & Eskimo Commission of the Missionary Society\nOF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND IN CANADA\n\nSt Barnabas' School\nONION LAKE, SASK.\n\n15th June 1929.\n\nMr. L. Turner,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Turner:\n\nAs it is found that the erection of the new pump house will require the services of a competent builder to superintend the work which will be chiefly done by the school management for the running in of the cement of a full size basement and the building of the superstructure, I herewith ask the Department to supply us with this very necessary help.\n\nThe school management has already prepared and dug out the basement, and will give all the necessary help to reduce the cost of a competent overseer to a minimum.\n\nThe materials for the erection of this pump house will be hauled from Lloydminster free of charge by the school management.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of April 19th last, No. 115-1-5, in which authority is given me to purchase material to build a new pump house at the Anglican Indian Residential School here, providing that the school authorities agreed to supply the labour in connection therewith.\n\nI communicated the contents of your letter, above quoted, to the Rev. H. Ellis, principal of the school, and have now received a letter from him in connection with this work, and enclose it herewith.\n\nI should add that no member of the school staff is qualified to put up this building, and fear that material would be wasted should the staff be left to do so without competent supervision.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 28, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 99-18 of the 17th instant, concerning a new pump house for the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School. In reply I have to inform you that the Department has lately requested the Dominion Water Power Branch of the Department of the Interior to make an inspection of the water supply system at this school, and I have to request that you will take no further action in connection with the pump house until after the Department is in receipt of this report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, June 29, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of the 28th ultimo, concerning a new engine and a new pump for the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School. Upon receipt of Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham's report, the Department decided to have the water supply system of this school inspected by an engineer of the Dominion Water Power Branch of the Department of the Interior. When his report is received, the Department will be in a position to give consideration to your request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. B. R.

June 21, 1929\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring my recent visit (June 14-16) to our Society's School at Onion Lake, I made a careful examination of the difficulties which the management have experienced in connection with the water system, and greatly hope that Mr. Commissioner Graham may soon provide the new pump and engine requested in my letter of May 28th, and referred to in your reply on June 4th., No.115-1-5. Neither Mr. Indian Agent Turner, nor the Principal of the School had received any communication from him on this matter, at the time of my visit. Mr. Indian Agent Turner undertook to write to you in this connection, and also in connection with the question of some assistance towards building the new pump house authorized by your Department. I am aware that in a former communication I informed you the School management would erect this building if your Department provided the material. When I reached the School, however, and saw the heavy work which the management had already done in the way of excavating soil for the building, I felt that it was quite too much to expect them to undertake all the building work as well. Mr. Indian Agent Turner agreed with me in this opinion, and undertook to write to you accordingly. I trust, therefore, that your Department may relieve the School management of this labour, so that they may be able to devote their energies to the farming and gardening activities which press heavily at this time of year.\n\nWhile dealing with the condition of the water system at this School, I beg to direct your attention to the need of a reducing valve. Approximately 1100 gallons of water are required daily in the operations of the School, and to maintain an adequate pressure for fire protection.\npurposes. At present when this amount is pumped in the morning, only about 500 gallons are left by evening, and another 600 gallons must then be pumped to raise the pressure to the safety mark. The installation of the reducing valve which would reduce the house pressure from 60 lbs. to 35 lbs. would save a great deal of pumping, and a corresponding amount of gasoline and labour. The cost of a suitable valve, 1\u00bd\" end weighing 30 lbs., would be $45.00. To install this valve, about 5 lengths (or 60') of standard piping would be required, and this would cost approximately $20.00.\n\nI shall be obliged, therefore, if you will authorize the Principal, or Mr. Indian Agent Turner, to have the reducing valve installed, at a cost not exceeding $75.00.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nTBRW/EMW\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nTo the following supplied Onion Lake Agency:\n\nFor 6 of 8 Indian Residential School.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| June 26 | To the following supplied Onion Lake Agency: For 6 of 8 Indian Residential School. | |\n|       | Garages |        |\n|       | 16 pcs. 2x4-14 | $30.00 | $20.30 |\n|       | 56 \" 2x4-12 | $30.00 | $20.30 |\n|       | 6 \" 2x4-10 | $30.00 | $20.30 |\n|       | 700 ft.

This matter was referred to Mr. Commissioner Graham, Regina, who states that this expenditure was not incurred under any authority from his office and that he forwarded the account to you for explanation. If you have this account, you should attach it to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and send to the Department.

The Principal should report any matters requiring attention to you, provided he considers that the cost of same should be paid by the Department, and you should forward his request, together with a full explanation, and receive the necessary authority before incurring the expenditure. You should inform the Principal that, in future, the Department cannot consider payment of accounts for which authority has not first been obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst.

Indian Residential School, I may say that Messrs. Paulin and Swayze, of Regina, who installed this plant assure me that with proper handling it should have lasted from ten to fifteen years, but from the very beginning it was not in competent hands, and if the Department were to buy a new one the same thing would happen. I have said so much lately about putting competent men in charge of the machinery and expensive lighting plants at our schools that I hesitate to say any more. The Department must know the situation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMr. L. Turner,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs the water in the lake has fallen approximately six feet during the summer, the suction pipe to the pump on the lake shore is exposed and will freeze unless piles are driven in and banked with brush and earth.\n\nIt is estimated that it will cost about $150.00 to employ sufficient labour to have this work executed and therefore would ask the Department to approve of this expenditure.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6321, file 658-5, part 4)\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from the Rev. H. Ellis, principal at the Onion Lake C.o.E. Indian Residential School, with reference to the water supply for the school.\n\nOn receipt of the letter, I visited the school for the purpose of ascertaining just what was required. The level of the lake, from which the school water supply is drawn, has dropped several feet, and, consequently, the pipe through which the water is drawn is within two feet of the surface, nearest the shore. When this pipeline was put in a pier was built over it, extending out into the lake, until the pipe was covered with about six feet of water, but as the level of the water has dropped, this pier should now be extended far enough, so that the pipe will be below frost level. I believe that by extending this pier about 15 feet the school water supply will be safe, but this should be done as soon as possible as the season is already quite late for this kind of work. I believe Mr. Ellis' estimate of $150.00 will easily cover the cost, and I would ask the Department to kindly wire me authority to proceed with the work.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSend the following Night Letter, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to:\n\nOttawa, November 5, 1929.\n\nLang Turner,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nvia Lloydminster, Sask.\n\nMay incur expenditure approximately one hundred and fifty dollars extending pipeline and pier water supply intake Onion Lake Anglican residential school.\n\nJ.

I have had several reports from experts, as well as from our own Inspectors, to the effect that the man in charge is not competent to run an engine. I think it is a sin to put a new outfit in his hands. The engine would be installed within a week.\n\nThe same remarks will apply to the R.C. school, where a new engine and pump were installed a year ago and we are now called upon to expend between three and four hundred dollars in repairs, due to nothing but neglect and incompetence. The repairs for this institution have also gone forward.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nW. M.

On the 30th ultimo, the Rev. Principal of the Roman Catholic School wrote that the former engineer had been discharged and that a properly qualified successor had been appointed. In connection with the Church of England School, the Department has asked the Dominion Water Power Branch engineers, who are making a report concerning the water supply at this school, to ascertain whether the engineer in charge of the system possesses the necessary qualifications for the proper operating of the mechanical plant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Engine and pump\nshould be on the same level. Present pump house too small to\noperate plant this way.\n\nThe cement footings are in and it only requires the\ncement walls and roof to complete same.\n\nNo inspection has been made to date, and do not\nbelieve that it will ever be made.

You will remember that we had an expert examine the engine, you had an officer from your department come over and we showed him an engine which had been disgracefully used. We showed your officer where the operator of this engine apparently did not know, or if he did know, he did not feel that it was necessary to tighten up the main journals. We could actually move the crank shaft in the journals 3/8\" of an inch, we are not exaggerating this because we took measurements.\n\nWe also found that the connecting rod journals were all loose, the mechanism re operating the valves was also at a point of falling off the engine for the want of being tightened up. During the twenty years that the writer has been with the Company he has not seen an engine come back into the warehouse in such a delapidated condition caused apparently from inefficient ability on the part of an operator.\n\nWhile we like to have business, and have always enjoyed doing business with the Department of Indian Affairs, we feel that in justice to ourselves, and to our goods, we would prefer not sending any more machinery, pumps, etc., to Onion Lake unless there is a decided change in the system of looking after such machinery.\n\nWe hope that this letter will be received in the same friendly spirit that it is written in. We are endeavoring\n\n- to explain\n\nVerry Poor Copy\nto explain that the trouble is not due to poor material or\npoor workmanship re the engine but is entirely due to some\nincompetent operator at Onion Lake, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMCPHERSON & THOM (SALE AGENTS)\nONTARIO WIND ENGINE & PUMP CO.,\n(Western Branch) Limited.\n\n(Sgd) D. C. Thom\nManager.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant No. 115-1-5, informing me that the Department has asked the Dominion Water Power Branch engineers, who are making a report concerning the water supply at the Orion Lake C. of E. Indian Residential School, to ascertain whether the engineer in charge of the system possesses the necessary qualifications for the proper operating of the mechanical plant. I do not know whether there is anyone on the job who is capable of passing judgment as to this or not. I understand, however, that since writing to you another man has been placed in charge of the plant, Mr. J. Littlewood, and from what I can gather he has the necessary qualifications. I am quite satisfied that the man who was there before was not qualified, and it has been a pretty expensive business for the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nOn receipt of the following telegram from the Principal of the School,-\n\n\"Pump engine on lake shore broken down beyond all repair absolutely worn out parts falling off been without water for five days new engine imperative advise what can be done.\"\n\nI naturally took the matter up with the Company who supplied this engine new, less than four years ago, and they informed me that it should give good service for from ten to fifteen years. I am enclosing herewith copy of a letter from Messrs. McPherson & Thom Company. I also took the matter up with Mr. Paulin, of the firm of Paulin & Swayze, and his statements will bear out what Messrs. McPherson & Thom have said, I think, therefore that the reports received regarding the way in which this plant has been handled are correct, notwithstanding what Mr. Ellis may say.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

REGINA, SASK., 9th Dec., 1929,\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to report that I visited the Onion Lake Anglican Residential School on the 6th instant and made an examination of the pump house and pumping plant which is installed near the lake shore and furnishes the water supply for the main building.\n\nThis pump house has been in use since the school was built a little over four years ago and has been condemned by the school management; the main reason given was that water seeped through into the basement and flooded the pump and had to be pumped out by hand each morning. I may explain that the basement of this pump house is floored with concrete and the walls are lined with ten inches of concrete as well. I am satisfied, after taking rough levels, that the floor of the pump house basement is above the water level in the lake and it appeared strange to me that sufficient water would drain through ten inches of concrete in twenty-four hours to cause very much trouble.\n\nI had the engine stopped and went down through the man-hole to the basement to examine the pump and found that as soon as the engine was stopped the water from the main pipe line leading up to the building immediately started draining back through the pump into the basement. I called down Mr. Erick Retherham, who went with me to examine the plant, and the present Engineer, Mr. Littlewood, and pointed\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6322, file 658-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nthis out to them. They agreed with me that this back drainage was causing all the trouble in so far as the flooding of the basement was concerned. The seepage through the concrete walls in twenty-four hours would be negligible and by installing a shut-off valve in the pipe close to the pump it would be possible to stop this back drainage and, in our opinion, would solve the question of the flooding of the basement.\n\nThe engine house, which is situated over this basement, is in size 8 ft. X 8 ft. with an 8 ft. stud. The floor of this is re-inforced concrete slab, six inches in thickness. This building is provided with a brick chimney at one end. There is no ventilating shaft in the building, and, as the engine provided is hopper cooled, the result is that when the engine heats up steam is generated and there is no means provided for carrying it off. The result is that everything is wet. The engine does not get proper lubrication and the magneto has to be taken off and thoroughly dried very frequently. There is no doubt in my mind that if precaution had been taken to stop the back drainage and to have the steam carried off from the pump house, the plant would have worked satisfactorily, but the result of neglecting to remedy these defects has been that through improper lubrication we have a worn out pump and the engine has not given satisfactory service. It would, in my opinion, be perfectly feasible to install the present plant in this building, but it would mean that we have have to deprive the institution of a water supply during the period that would be taken up in making the new installation. I have made arrangements, subject to your approval, to add an addition 6 ft. X 8 ft. to the present pump house and will have the engine placed on a solid concrete base. A ventilator with a cowl to go over the hopper will be provided to carry off the steam. The new pump will be placed on a concrete slab at ground level in the existing building. This can be done at comparatively little cost. There\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6322, file 658-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nis absolutely no necessity for building a new pump house, and in the opinion of the Engineer, who appears to be a practical man, the present arrangement should meet the situation and provide a satisfactory installation. The Agent has been given full instructions and will order the necessary piping from Lloydminster. The angle valve for the shut-off has been ordered by telegram from Winnipeg. Mr. Erick Rotherham has been engaged to do the work of building the lean-to and making the installation. I have given instructions to have the building banked with manure for the present winter to keep out the frost. Mr. Rotherham will commence the work in a few days. In the meantime the present pump is being operated with the farm engine and by providing the stop valve already referred to the present plant will furnish the water supply until the new installation is completed.\n\nI have also given directions to the Agent to see that the excavation which was made for a new building is filled in to prevent the water pipe from freezing. The foregoing is respectfully submitted.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir:\n\nOn November 2nd, I received a telegram from the Department instructing me to make immediate replacement of the pumping engine at the Onion Lake C. of E. School, and stating that later the Department would determine who should pay the expenses. In accordance with these instructions I purchased from the Fairbanks-Morse Company, Winnipeg, a new engine and pump costing $755.25, f.o.b. Winnipeg, and arranged with the Company to send a man to Onion Lake to install same.\n\nIn due course Mr. Pederson, the Fairbanks-Morse representative, went to Onion Lake, and on the day of his arrival he wired stating that it was impossible to install the pump until the new building was completed. As I had received no advice from the Department that the building of a new pump house was contemplated I wired Indian Agent Turner and informed him that he should not have allowed me to send Pederson from Winnipeg without first advising me that the Department had under consideration the erection of a new building. I then wired the Deputy Superintendent General, informing him of what had taken place, at the same time pointing out that the present pump house had only been built four years ago and that it was absolutely unnecessary to erect another building. To this I received a reply stating that if the present pump house were suitable the men from Winnipeg should make the installation of the pump. By the time I received this telegram Mr. Pederson had returned to Winnipeg without doing anything.\n\nIn due course I received a letter from Mr. Lang Turner explaining what had taken place between the Department and himself, of which correspondence I think he should have previously informed me, and I am inclined to believe that the Department had been entirely misled by Dr. Westgate or some other authority of the\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSchool pointing out that there was a necessity for incurring the expense of erecting a new pump house.\n\nAfter all the trouble and expense of sending a man from Winnipeg, I decided that the only thing to do was to send Inspector Murison up again to see what the situation really was, as I could not understand the request for a new pump house. He has now returned and from his report, which is attached hereto, you will see that all that was necessary to overcome the difficulty was a shut-off valve in the pipe close to the pump in order to stop the back drainage after the pump was stopped. It seems to me that a boy of fourteen years of age should have been able to solve this problem. You will also note what the Inspector states about the pump house having no outlet for the steam. These conditions have been allowed to exist until the outfit has been practically destroyed, although it should have lasted for another ten or fifteen years.\n\nWhile on the ground the Inspector found a lot of material, probably $100.00 worth, the purchase of which had been authorized by the Department, and under instructions from me he arranged for the erection of a small leanto on the building, which would make a little more room, although, as he says, the pump could have been installed in the present building.\n\nMight I ask that in future in matters of this kind I be informed, so that we can deal with them in the most economical way. I think now that if the Department has been misinformed by Dr. Westgate it should be up to the Church authorities to pay for this expense, as you suggested in your wire of November 2nd. that later on you would decide as to who should bear the expense. Dr. Westgate is not a practical man, nor is Mr. Ellis, the Principal of the School, and it seems to me that it is unsafe to act on any recommendations these gentlemen make without first having the matters thoroughly inquired into.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| December 5| To the following supplied Onion Lake Agency.

From our letter of the 2nd inst., you will have learned that a Fairbanks-Morse expert had reached the school to install the new engine and pump, but that he did not advise the installation being made in the old pump house. There can be no question whatever about the urgent need of this building, and I trust that it may be provided with the least possible delay.\n\nIn the closing sentence of your letter of November 22nd, last #15-1-5, you stated that the Dominion Water Power Branch had been asked to ascertain if the engineer possessed the necessary qualifications, etc. In this connection, I beg to inform you that our Society takes the greatest possible care in the selection of their agents, and they feel assured, from the information before them that Mr. James Littlewood who is filling this position at present, is fully capable of handling all the mechanical equipment with which that school has been provided. I trust, therefore, that the provision of the pump house may at once be made, and the water system at this institution placed on a satisfactory basis for many years to come.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We regret very much that we have put you to this additional trouble in connection with our invoice. We have checked over our engineer's expense account, together with his daily reports, and have made up a revised invoice, showing how the figures are arrived at.\n\nIt is not possible for us to give you receipts covering the various disbursements, as we do not ask our engineers to turn in receipts with their expense accounts covering such items as travelling and hotel costs. We have one receipt for $3.55, covering fittings purchased at Lloydminster, which is attached to our revised invoice.\n\nFrankly, if the Department will refuse to pass our invoice without the receipts for which you ask, we are at a loss to know just what action we can take. Our engineer who was at Onion Lake is expected in Winnipeg in a few days' time, and we will discuss the matter with him at that time, to see if we can obtain at least some of the receipts you require. We do not presume these will be necessary in the case of railroad fare, because we believe that ticket agents at railroad stations are not authorized to issue receipts at the time they sell tickets.\n\nIn going over our engineer's expense account, we find that his expenses from Onion Lake to the branch of the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company at Edmonton were not included with our original invoice, and we have, therefore, shown them on the bottom of this revised invoice.\n\nWe should be very pleased if you would let us know if the invoice as we have now made it out will meet the requirements of your Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE CANADIAN FAIRBANKS-MORSE COMPANY LIMITED\n\n(Sgd) J.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from the Principal of the Onion Lake C. of E. Indian Residential School in which he requests that a 6 H.P. engine for cutting wood be supplied.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that our appropriation for the present fiscal year has been completely assigned and there are no funds to provide for the cost of this equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

School, I wired you on the 4th instant stating that there had been no unnecessary delay, and that I had received no complaint regarding the matter from the Agent. At the same time I wired the Agent, making inquiry regarding the work, and his reply was that work had been commenced on installation December 30th and was proceeding satisfactorily. This information I passed on to you.\n\nI may say that immediately on receiving your instructions that a new pumping and lighting system was to be installed at this school I took action and there was no delay whatever. It was necessary to send a new pump and engine from Winnipeg, and I also arranged to have a man go from the factory in Winnipeg to make the installation. On his arrival at the school he was told by the Principal that he was not to install the pump, as it was the intention of the Department to build a new pump house. This was the first intimation I had that the building of a new pump house was contemplated, and on December 3rd, I wired you stating that this was not necessary. When Inspector Murison went to Onion Lake to investigate the matter it was found that material for a new pump house had been on the ground for several months and that the engine had been neglected and had been working under water, which was not coming from the lake, nor was it seepage from the ground, but backwater from the pipe, and it was not until a layman went down from here that this was discovered.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nwas discovered. Mr. Murison arranged with a man on the ground to proceed at once with the work of installing the pump and making a new foundation for the engine. This could not be done in a day and the weather has been extremely cold, which would cause some delay in the building of the foundation, as it has to be fairly warm to set the concrete. The work is going ahead as fast as possible, and there were no grounds whatever for the complaint that nothing had been done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner\nSir,\n\nI have to report that it has been discovered that an item of $22.80 has been twice paid the Co-Operative Association, Ltd., of Lloydminster, Sask.; once on Voucher No. 261, dated December 5th, and again on Voucher No. 274, dated December 16th. I have written to the Co-Operative Association explaining this mistake, and have asked for a refund of the $22.80. When this is received it will be immediately transmitted to the Department. Apologizing for the error,\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJanuary 16, 1930.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nWith reference to that part of your letter of the 11th instant which is relative to the pumping equipment at the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School, I may say that the Department has received a report from Mr. Commissioner Graham, which indicates that the installation of the new plant is being proceeded with as fast as weather conditions will allow. He states that the installation was commenced on the 30th ultimo, after some particularly cold weather, and that satisfactory progress is now being made.\n\nDr. Westgate wrote concerning a new engine for cutting wood at Onion Lake; but, as our funds are completely assigned at the present time, the request could not be given favourable consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Mackenzie's letter, dated November 28th, 1929, serial number 115-1-13.\n\nWhile we do not admit the existence of sufficient grounds for the statement concerning food, health of children, etc., contained in the report in question, we are unprepared to accept the visit of the travelling nurse in question, or any other travelling nurses, on the status of an inspectress. We accept and are prepared to co-operate with (1) the local medical officer of the Department (2) the local Indian Agent and (3) the inspector concerned of the Department at Ottawa. We further submit respectfully, that all matters falling under the general head of \"Inspection\" should be limited to the reports of one or other of these three officials; the visits of the District nurse being limited, strictly, to the purposes for which we understood such nurses were to be appointed i.e. the nursing care of such pupil, or pupils, as may require the same, particularly the additional nursing care required in the event of an epidemic occurring among them.\n\n2. The installation of the new Pumping Equipment -\n\nIn this connection I quote from our correspondence the following statements made by the Principal of the School:\n\nFrom a letter, dated December 26th, 1929 -\n\n\"Since May last we have been waiting for an inspector from the Dominion Water Power Branch, but to date no inspection has been made.\n\nI wired to the Commissioner at Regina to the effect that the water system had broken down. He immediately shipped in a new engine and pump, instructing the Indian Agent not to allow any of the school officials to touch it, as an expert would be sent to make the installation. When the expert arrived, he found it was impossible to install the plant, and on receipt of a telegram from his Company, he left for the Peace River District.\n\nMr Graham immediately sent Inspector Muirson here, and after discussing the situation, recommended putting an extension 6' x 8' in size on the west end of the present house and installing the new pump and engine on the floor level, which is about 8' above the regular pipe line. Also, he recommended the placing of a cowl over the hopper of the engine to take off the steam vapour.\n\nWhen this extension is done and the other necessary improvements made, personally, I believe, it will cost as much as the new pump house which was $400.00 including materials and labour.\"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6322, file 658-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\"I am confident that the arrangement made of installing the new engine and pump in the old pump house will not be satisfactory even with the extension, as the cost of keeping fires and the placing of the pump 8' above the pipe line will cause loss of water because of so many elbows and long stretches of pipe as shown in the rough sketches enclosed.\n\nThe new proposed pump house shows that the pump and engine would have been erected on the pipe line which is the most satisfactory way.\"\n\nLetter - December 23rd. -\n\n\"We are badly in need of a 6 h.p. engine for cutting wood. The one supplied by the Department in 1921 has been used at the pump house for the last three years to replace the defective engine used for pumping the water at the lake shore. We have tried for the last five days to get the defective engine to run, but without success. Had we not been compelled to have used this engine at the pump house, it would have lasted for a good many years to come. The pump house as it is arranged at present would destroy any engine after a year or two.\n\nWould you please urge the Department to supply us with another, as it is impossible to get any wood ahead for our general use.\"\n\nAs you are aware, this Society made, at the time, strong representations to the Department concerning the unsatisfactory results which, in our opinion, would follow the installation, in connection with the new buildings, of a second-hand engine removed from the Duck Lake Institution. These results involved us in very great expense and have led directly to the present situation in which, among other very serious considerations, the school has been left for many months without any adequate fire protection.\n\nIII.

C.M.G.\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA,\nOnt.\n\nDear Mr Scott:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 16th inst. serial number 115-1-5, \"relative to the Pumping equipment at the Onion Lake C.E. Indian Residential School.\"\n\nI note, with regret, that the installation of the new plant is apparently being proceeded with in the position occupied by the old plant, with the operation of which this Society had such a trying and expensive experience. I respectfully submit that sufficient evidence, in fact none of an expert kind, has been submitted to the effect that the new installation will not be seriously affected, in the results given and in the life of the plant installed, by the stated disadvantages of the site occupied by the old plant.\n\nI would, also, respectfully recall to your attention the fact that our claim \"concerning a new engine for cutting wood at Onion Lake\" is based upon the fact that on the breakdown, last May, of the water-pumping plant, the school authorities were obliged to take the engine for cutting wood and use it for pumping purposes\u2014a purpose for which the engine was not built and which has practically, if not completely, worn it out. Our request, in this respect, is, therefore, based directly upon the results of the delay of the Department officials in failing to repair, through the installation of the new plant, a serious condition of affairs which was brought about as long ago as last May, by the final breakdown of the old engine.\nI note that your \"funds are completely assigned at the present time\". This statement applies, I presume, to the Departmental financial provision for the current Parliamentary year ending on March 31st. May I renew the request in the following form:\n\nThat this Society purchase the needed engine for cutting wood, of a type and on the condition required by the Department, with the definite understanding that the cost of purchase will be refunded to the Society out of the Departmental Funds provided by Parliament for the year beginning April 1st. next.\n\nCommending this request to your sympathetic consideration,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nJanuary 30, 1930.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nWith reference to that part of your letter of the 24th instant, relative to the supplying of a new engine for cutting wood at the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School, I have to say that, if your Society will arrange for the purchase of an engine of the type required and for payment of same, this Department will refund the cost when our appropriation for the next fiscal year is available. No unnecessary expense should be incurred, and an account, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded about the end of April, next, when the cost of the engine will be refunded to your Society.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

School has been handled, and, as you know, I attribute a great deal of the difficulty to a lack of knowledge on the part of the Principal and his staff.\n\nWe have at this school a lighting plant with a capacity of 7,500 watts, and judging from the requirements at other schools it would appear that more lights are being used than are really necessary, and also that lights are left burning when not in use. The lights in the hall should be reduced to 20-watt lamps, and the same thing applies to the cellar and other parts of the building. The amount of wattage used in the dining-room is 21 - 40-watt lamps, a total of 840 watts. This is twice the amount of lamps required, and over twice as many as are used in the average school dining-room, where even more pupils are accommodated. The total capacity of this plant is, as I say, 7,500 watts, and this is ample to supply the lighting requirements of a school of this size if proper care is exercised. In the average school only 60% of the lights are used at any one time. This is the method used in basing current requirements. This would leave a load of 4944 watts, which indicates that the present equipment, if operating efficiently should meet the requirements.\n\n-Mr. Ellis-\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMr. Ellis has not shown good judgment, and with your approval I shall inform him that he is to reduce the size of the lamps in certain parts of the building where they should be reduced. You will recall that this gentleman was asking for a plant almost double the capacity of the one which he now has. This is absurd. I maintained that the plant which he had was all right.\n\nI may say that I have written this letter after getting the opinion of experts in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.

Indian Residential School, I beg to inform you that I have just received a final report from the Fairbanks-Morse Expert who was sent to Onion Lake to overhaul the engine of the plant.\n\nAs you know, I have always contended that this plant, as well as the plants that we have at various other schools, have been abused through having incompetent men operating them. The Expert has this to say in his report regarding this engine:\n\n\"Found this engine falling off in horse power owing to water getting into cylinder, and the governor sleeve pin worn out owing to lack of oil when engine was new; as these pins must be oiled when engine is first put in or they will begin to cut and wear down very rapidly. Also butterfly valve loose, and worn, owing to being left in this shape so long. These Type Z engines have a very sensitive governor and must be balanced properly with butterfly valve arm working over dead center. Exhaust valves were being eaten away by the chemical action of the water......Engine would not pull a 40 amp. load in that shape. Put on new Cylinder and piston wired to Regina for gov. sleeve pin #60A and #202A.C. butterfly valve assembly complete. Installed new 3\" exhaust line throughout, tested engine pulling 70 amp. load, this being all they could scare up, and 58 amperes is their present peak load and engine only plays with that. No effort for it at all.\"\n\n-This goes-\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThis goes to show that the engine is today in perfect order after having been overhauled.\n\nI may say that I have not yet had a reply to my letter of the 16th ultimo, in which I informed you of the extraordinary amount of lighting that Mr. Ellis, the Principal, expected this engine to do, and asked for an acknowledgment of my letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nFeb. 13, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 16th ultimo with reference to the lighting plant at the Union Lake Church of England School, I beg to say that a 7\u00bd K.W. generator properly operated should give the current required for the lighting system in a building the size of the Union Lake School.\n\nIt does not seem to me to be advisable to reduce the lights to 20 watt lamps as suggested, as they would not give satisfactory lighting and with a 7\u00bd K.W. generator they should have ample power for the lights installed, as at no one time would they have to use more than fifty or sixty percent of the lights.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

These children are classed as whites and should be discharged, but the Provincial Government will not take them in unless they are forced to do so.\n\nI think Dr. Westgate went too far in this matter and should have consulted the proper authorities before taking them in.\n\nI would particularly draw your attention to that portion of the report in which it is pointed out that the milk supply is inadequate. I would say that it is very inadequate. I do not think this matter should be passed over lightly. The Principal of this school is always ready to criticise the Department and call upon the Department to make right anything which is wrong in his opinion, and he was the means of officiating our Nurse who was to visit this school not long ago. Seven gallons of milk was delivered that contains 118 persons is also bad! The Inspector points out that they have 50 head of cattle and that the stable only contains 31 stalls. This is true, but if they had the right kind of cattle, as it was intended they should have when the buildings were erected, 31 stalls would have provided ample for the cows. The trouble here is that they have the wrong type of cattle, probably not milking strain.\n\nThere is an item in the Estimates for re-painting this school, which will be done as soon as proper authority is received.\n\nUnder the head of Fire Protection, I notice the Inspector says he examined the equipment and found 3 - 50 ft. lengths of linen hose in a leaking condition. This should not be. This hose should last for years; it is comparatively new. All linen hose leaks and sweats at times. I am going to take this matter up with the Inspector when he returns.\n\nYou will notice that the Inspector visited the Long Lake, Frog Lake, and Island Lake Day Schools.\n\nI do not know what to recommend with regard to the teacher's residence at the Island Lake Day School. It seems to be a poor affair. Perhaps if we carry out the suggestion to have a Farming Instructor placed at these reserves, we might come to some better arrangement.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner\nPART OF INSPECTOR MURISON'S REPORT, FORWARDED\nUNDER COVER OF MR. COMMISSIONER GREGHAM'S 309-11\nDATED MARCH 29, 1930.\n\nONION LAKE C. E. RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nANGLICAN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nI visited this school on the 7th instant,\nand made a complete inspection of the building. There are 99\npupils enrolled, 48 boys and 51 girls. There are 3 half-\nbreed children in addition, about whom the Department are\nalready aware. Information has been given the police who\nare endeavouring to locate the father of these children\nso that they can be turned over to him. The children\npresented a clean and healthy appearance. I saw them in\nthe school\nANGLICAN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nthe school and at play, and was quite pleased with their happy appearance.\n\nFARM\n\nThe crop, as already reported, was a complete failure at this institution last year, owing to lack of rainfall during the growing season. Their stock consists of 13 milk cows, 1 bull and 11 young stock. There are only 5 cows milking during the winter. In February, according to the record, these cows produced 2,210 lbs., which is equal to 231 gals. This is a very inadequate supply and it can readily be seen that they cannot provide the children with milk to drink. With the Principal's family and staff, there is an average of 118 persons to provide for.\n\nIf the stock are to be increased at this school, it will be necessary to increase the housing accommodation for cattle. They now have 30 head of cattle and there are 21 stalls in the barn.\n\nBUILDING\n\nThe school building has not been re-painted since it was built, and an item appears in the Estimates this year for this work. The metal ceilings are becoming discoloured, and the walls, although not in bad shape, are getting dirty in spots. The school has been occupied for four years.\n\nWATER SUPPLY\n\nThe new pumping unit is working very satisfactorily. They now have to pump 1\u00bd hours per day and 2 hours on wash days to keep up the water supply. With the old unit they averaged 13 hours pumping per day and then could not keep up the supply. They now use 8 gals. of gasoline per week. They formerly used 13 gals. of gasoline.\nANGLICAN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nWATER SUPPLY (CONT'D.)\n\ngasoline per day. The installation of the new outfit has materially reduced their expenses. A new cylinder has been put in the 15 H.P. engine which supplies power for generating electric light, etc. The installation has been changed by discarding the exhaust pot and having the exhaust carried straight to the open air through a 4\" pipe. Since this installation was made, the engine develops full power at normal speed. Before the installation was changed, the engine would only develop 35 amperes, or half its rated power. I am satisfied that the trouble with this engine has been caused through faulty installation in the first place. There was a larger inlet to the exhaust pot than the outlet. The consequence was that back pressure was created which caused the engine to overheat with a consequent loss of power. With the new installation the cost per kilowatt is now 6.6\u00a2 in place of 15\u00a2 per kilowatt under the old conditions. Both these units are working very satisfactorily.\n\nFIRE PROTECTION\n\nThe pupils are given practice at fire drill twice a week when they are not expecting it. The Principal informs me that he visits the school and makes a regular inspection each night after 10 o'clock. I had him sound the fire alarm while the children were at their classroom work. They evacuated the school in an orderly manner in less than two minutes. It could readily be seen that they knew exactly what to do. I examined the equipment and found 3 - 50 ft. lengths of the linen fire hose in a leaking condition. This should be replaced.\nANGLICAN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nFIRE PROTECTION (CONT'D.)\n\nThey are well equipped on each floor with 5 gal. chemical fire extinguishers. The fire escapes are easy of access and appear to be quite safe.\n\nI examined the water storage tank while the pump was in operation and noted that the water pumped from the lake had a strong stagnant smell. Personally, I would not care to drink it. It is treated with chloride lime before being used.\n\nGENERAL\n\nI found the school building clean throughout. It was well ventilated, but I noticed a strong smell in the dormitories, which, I found, came from the beds. They have 74 straw ticks, and as the straw or hay is only changed once a year, the smell from these ticks is not pleasant at this time of the year.\n\nIce is put up for use during the summer months, but there is no refrigerator or adequate means for keeping fresh meat during the summer months.\nOttawa, April 4, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to refer further to your 309-11 of the 29th ultimo, enclosing Mr. Inspector Murison's report on the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School. You may arrange for the painting of the main building, as funds are now available for this purpose. Further, you may arrange for the erection of an ice house. Please be guided by the regulations concerning the purchase of materials and the engagement of labour.\n\nYou may make replacement of the fire hose which was leaking if, upon enquiry, you find that this is now necessary.\n\nAnother letter will be directed to you with reference to the milk supply.\n\nIt has also been represented to the Department that some plastering and a few general repairs are required at the Onion Lake C. E. Residential School. You might let me have an estimate of the cost of erecting an ice house and doing the painting and also a statement concerning what other work you believe is necessary this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

As was pointed out in a previous report all lakes and surface waters in this Province are unsuitable for domestic supplies unless they are treated by filtration or some other recognised process. The two examinations which have been made of the water from the lake at your school prove this statement to be true. Another source of supply should be sought or the water should be filtered, chlorinated or boiled before use. This matter is urgent and the school authorities must accept any responsibility for any outbreaks of disease which may occur if they continue to use the lake water in an untreated condition.\n\nRHM/MC R. H. Murray, C.E.\nDirector, Division of Sanitation.\n\nThe statement on page 2 is part of this opinion.\nThe opinion given on page 1 is based upon the detailed information recently furnished regarding the source of supply and upon the foregoing laboratory findings.\n\nIf the source is satisfactory, care should be taken to protect it against future contamination.\n\nIf the source is doubtful, the improvements recommended should be given effect to at once.\n\nIf the source is unsafe, the supply should be abandoned, or the water boiled until such time as the suggested changes are made, and another opinion obtained from this Division.\n\nINTERPRETATION OF LABORATORY FINDINGS.\n\nTOTAL SOLIDS - Generally speaking, an ideal drinking water should contain not more than 50 grains per gallon of total solids. Wells on the prairie, however, usually show a much larger amount. The maximum amount of total solids permissible in a drinking water varies in accordance with the relative quantities of the constituents. For this reason a water containing several times the quantity names might be pronounced satisfactory. In certain circumstances the cumulative effect of drinking a hard water may affect the health of the consumer.\n\nNITRITES - The presence of Nitrites ordinarily indicates contamination in the water from decaying animal matter or from animal excrement.\n\nORGANIC MATTER - Underground streams, unless very shallow, are filtered free of organic matter. The presence of organic matter in a well usually points to defects in the cover or cribbing.\n\nBACTERIA - Drinking water should have a count of less than 200 bacteria per cubic centimeter. (A cubic centimeter is equal to about one third of a teaspoonful)\n\nB. COLI - Is an organism or germ which comes from the intestinal tract of animals and human beings. Its presence in a water indicates that the sample is contaminated with waste matter of human or animal origin, and that dysentery, typhoid fever or other intestinal diseases may be transmitted by the water.\nWinnipeg, Man. May 17th, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe:- Water supply Onion Lake School, C. of E.\n\nWith further reference to your letter of June 29th, 1929, 115-1-5, re the decision of your Department to have the water supply at our Onion Lake School inspected by an engineer of the Dominion Water Power Branch of the Department of the Interior, (see also your letter of Oct. 11th, 1929). I am enclosing herewith, for your information a copy of the report on the laboratory findings in this connection as furnished by the Department of Public Health of the Govt. of the Province of Sask., and with it a copy of the covering letter from the Principal of our Onion Lake School which accompanied this report. It is practically obvious from this report, and from the opinion expressed by Mr. Murray, the Director of the Division of Sanitation in the Province of Sask., that some remedial action must be taken at once to protect the health of the staff and pupils of this School from the dangers to which they are subjected through the water supply now in use.\n\nThe process of chlorination already adopted by the Principal can only be looked upon as a temporary expedient in the matter, and I am of the opinion that a process of filtration should be adopted by the sinking of a large reservoir on the lake shore. I find that this same suggestion was presented to your Department, in a letter addressed to the Architect on October 30th, 1925, and I now beg to repeat it for further consideration. As the situation is undoubtedly one of urgency, I trust that it may receive the prompt attention of your Department.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6322, file 658-5, part 5)\nONION LAKE CHURCH OF ENGLAND INDIAN SCHOOL.\n\nDate of inspection: May 9, 1930.\n\nPurpose of inspection: To inspect the water supply system of the school, and to ascertain \"whether the engineer in charge of the system possesses the necessary qualifications for the proper operation of the aforementioned plant.\"\n\nThe Church of England Indian School at Onion Lake obtains its water supply from a lake known as Long lake, and is located on the banks of the aforesaid lake. A pumphouse is located on the lake shore with a 2\u00bd-inch inlet pipe, running into the lake some 90 feet, into a depth of water around six feet, with the stage of the lake as on May 9th, 1930. The pumphouse consists of a Fairbanks-Morse 6 H.P. engine, connected with a double action Fairbanks-Morse pump, with a rated capacity of 2000 gals. per hour, and has a 10-foot well. Water is forced up the hill some 25 feet into a concrete reservoir built below frost line, with the dimensions of 10x10x8 feet, or approximately 40,000 gals. The pumphouse is a small wooden building 18 by 10 feet in size, heated with a coal stove. The water is taken into the school by means of a one H.P. electric pump, which pumps directly out of the sunken reservoir into two pressure tanks of 2000 gals. each and the pressure is around 25 to 30 lbs in the tanks. The water line from the pumphouse to the reservoir is 2\u00bd\" pipe.\n\nThe engineer in charge of the system is J. Littlewood, and he has been at this school since 14th October 1929. He is a Scotsman by birth and has had an extensive experience in plants of sundry description, such as, engineer in charge of electric supply for H.M. Office of Works, Messrs Vickers Ltd., together with a knowledge of generators, engines, fitting and machinist work. He stated that he was wounded in the war, and came out to this country to regain his health, which was very poor on his arrival in Canada, but he is in fair health now.\n\nIn my opinion he is well fitted for the operation of the system and is able to make running repairs to all parts of the system and thus enable the plant to keep going until new parts are brought in, and as this school is not located on a railway, his ability to repair various items is very valuable.\n\nGeneral Observations.\n\nThe water supply system of the school is operating fairly well but I would venture to suggest that the inlet pipe which is laid into the lake is not carried out far enough. By carrying out this pipe some further 100 feet, it would enter deep blue water, and the quality of the water would be increased, as there exists much vegetation and silt in the shallow water. A fine screen filter should be placed on the up-turn elbow, to eliminate the many small fish which run into the pump at present. The pumphouse is very small and a lean-to should be\nbuilt on to it so that the total floor area would be around 26' by 10'. The pumphouse is supplied with a coal-burning stove, whereas only wood is available which is not efficient for heating in the winter time, unless coal is brought in.\n\nThe sunken reservoir should be painted with a coat of concrete preparation to prevent hairchecking which is starting to make its appearance.\n\nOn the whole the plant is fulfilling the requirements of the school which consists of around 100 children at times and a staff of 10 teachers, but I would suggest that any requests for material asked for by the engineer in charge should be favourably considered, as the engineer is capable and has the successful operation of the plant at heart.\n\nThe boiler room and the storage room batteries are kept in a clean condition, together with the pumphouse, but in connection with the latter, there is no room to store wood in the winter time, or to enable one to work around the engine or pump without discomfort.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) W. G. Stuart.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM J. T. JOHNSTON,\nDIRECTOR, DOMINION WATER POWER & RECLAMATION SERVICE,\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OTTAWA, May 19, 1930.\n\nOriginal on 115-8-5.\n\nRE: Onion Lake Church of England Schools.\n\nYou will notice that certain recommendations are made with regard to improvements which appear to be necessary and I should be glad to have your instructions in the matter.\n\nExtract from Report of J. S. Tempest,\nCommissioner of Irrigation, Calgary, Alta.,\ndated May 15, 1930. (Enclosed with Mr. Johnston's letter of above date).\n\nWith regard to the Church of England School, Mr. Stuart has recommended that the pumphouse be enlarged so as to facilitate operation and also, in order that the building may be properly heated during the winter months. It is likewise recommended that the intake pipe be extended to deep water, which can be obtained by the construction of an additional one hundred feet of 2\u00bd\" pipe. It is also recommended that a fine screen filter be placed on the upturn elbow of this intake pipe in order to eliminate drawing small fish into the system.\n\nThe question of a suitable preparation to apply to the sunken reservoir, where Mr. Stuart reports hair-checking to have started, will be considered and we shall advise you concerning this matter at a later date.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Stuart considers the engineer in charge to be a capable man and fully qualified to undertake the duties involved.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nTo: H.

It is very inconvenient hauling gasoline forty miles every third week during the severe weather. The tank can be filled in the fall of the year and the pump locked which will serve also as a protection against the children having access to the gasoline and prevent a repetition of fire from this cause that we experienced a couple of years ago.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith two letters received from Rev. H. Ellis, principal at the Onion Lake C. of E. Indian Residential School; in one of which he asks the Department to supply a 1500 gallon gasoline tank and pump, and in the other to erect a cottage for the farming instructor.\n\nWith respect to the 1500 gallon tank asked for, I beg to state that recently the Department has supplied the R. C. School here with a 500 gallon tank and pump, and I have no doubt that Mr. Ellis would find one of great convenience at his school.\n\nWith respect to the house for the farming instructor, I beg to say that the school is short of accommodation for its staff, some members having to sleep in rooms which were not intended for that purpose. Two members of the staff, Mr. Spooner, Farming Instructor, and Miss Beatty, an Indian girl who is cook at the school, are engaged to be married; and the building asked for is to enable them to do so, and live in it; thus releasing two rooms for other members of the staff. I may say that the building contemplated is a similar one to that erected two years ago for the farming instructor at the R. C.

This building still rests on the blocks and skids on which it was moved, and detracts from the general appearance of neatness of the school property. During my visit to this school last June, I spoke to the local Indian Agent about having it placed on a good foundation with a full-sized basement underneath which might be used as a store-room, and he agreed to lay the matter before your Department.

H. Ellis, Principal of our Society's School at Onion Lake, he desires to know what action has been taken by your Department with regard to the water supply at this school. I find from our records that I wrote to you about this matter on May 17th, last, and enclosed with my letter a copy of the report on the laboratory findings in this connection as furnished by the Department of Public Health of the Govt. of Saskatchewan. The situation appears to me to demand prompt and careful consideration, and I trust that it may receive this from your Department.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nSept. 4, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 16th instant, with further reference to the water supply system at the Onion Lake school, I beg to say that the Engineers of the Dominion Water Power Branch are being asked to submit a report and recommendation as to what steps should be taken to ensure a satisfactory supply of water for this building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSECRETARY.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, B.D.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSept. 4, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of May 19th of this year, with reference to the water supply system at the Onion Lake Church of England School. The school authorities have requested that immediate consideration be given to the treatment of the water supply system, as it is claimed that it is unsafe for drinking purposes. Will you please instruct your Commissioner at Calgary to have a sample of the water analysed and submit a report and recommendation as to what means should be taken to guarantee a pure water supply for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDIRECTOR,\nDOMINION WATER POWER BRANCH,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nYour file number: 115-1-5.\nOnion Lake Church of England School.\n\nI have received your letter of the 4th instant with reference to the water supply system at the Onion Lake Church of England school, a copy of which has been sent to the Commissioner of Irrigation with a request that he carry out the instructions contained therein, and submit a report and recommendation as to what means should be taken to guarantee a pure water supply for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nTo the Secretary,\nIndian Residential School Commission, M.S.C.,\nThe Bible House, Alexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that at 3:20 p.m. this afternoon, a serious fire broke out between the floors of the small boys' dormitory. The fire was caused by a faulty wire connection in the junction box where the light leads through the floor to the bath room on the second floor.\n\nMiss Gillespie, the Boys' Supervisor stated that she had smelt smoke at 3 o'clock that afternoon in the bath room, but did not think anything was wrong because the small boiler was on to heat the water for bathing in the boiler house.\n\nSoon afterwards, while talking to an Indian in the office, I heard Miss Mount, the Matron asking where the smoke was coming from, as she had smelt burnt rubber while working in the kitchen.\n\nI immediately left the Indian and began to make an investigation. On the top floor, I saw smoke coming through in clouds. I went around and could not locate where the fire was on the second floor, having been watching the hospital department. Coming out from there, I looked in at the bath room and found that the paint on the tin ceiling around the light fixture in the bath room had the paint burnt off and was hot. I immediately came to the conclusion that the fire was in connection with the wires in the boys' dormitory. I asked Mr. Littlewood to cut out the main switch on the board in the engine room and start and operate all the water pumps. We then decided to cut through the floor in the dormitory and as soon as a hole was made, the flames burst through three or four inches high. I then thought the building would soon be raised to the ground. Having checked the fire with the hand extinguishers, this gave us the chance through the smoke to play on the water hose. Having put out the fire, I immediately asked Indian Agent Turner to come up and make his inspection and to see the rough flooring burnt through around the junction box.\n\nThe fire crept along the joists for about 10 feet which was badly charred. The rough flooring being burnt almost through, though the joists as before stated was charred.\n\nPhotos will be submitted as soon as I receive the same from the photographer.\nCAUSE OF FIRE\n\nMr. Littlewood found two joints; one of two wires and one of three wires, totalling five wires in one junction box. The joints were made by simply twisting to secure the bare ends of the wires. These bare ends allowed corrosion to take place where the wires were making contact due to them not being soldered. The corrosion setting up a high resistance which caused heat, which eventually set fire to the insulation. The junction box containing the five wires was insecurely fastened to the conduit, having three pipes entering into the box. Two pipes were fastened with lock nuts inside the junction box, the other was left loose without a lock nut, thereby breaking the continuity, and rendering the ground wire ineffective. Had the conduit been making a good contact, the chances of fire would have been very remote because the fuse controlling the circuit would perhaps have been blown, thus breaking the circuit and cutting off the electric current.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\nTo have all junction boxes inspected to see that there are no loose wires and all tapes removed to see that all the joints are soldered. If found that the wires are the same as the enclosed sketch, (top) which caused the fire, then to re-wire the whole building because the same does not meet the requirements of the Fire Underwriters. The loop-in system being required.\n\nNo substitute \"Guardene\" Fire Extinguishers, the seven on hand did not meet with our requirements. Four on each floor including dormitories and landings are required. This must be treated as urgent.\n\nTo re-decorate the interior which has been damaged by smoke and water and to replace the flooring which was necessary to cut up.\n\nFour Firemen's Axes - .5\" cut -.4 to 5 lbs weight.\n\nSigned: Henry Ellis\nPrincipal.\nCOPY\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL COMMISSION\n\nONION LAKE, SASK\n\n23rd August, 1930\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Res. School Commission, M.S.C.C.,\nThe Bible House, Alexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI herewith enclose my report on a fire which occurred this afternoon. Particular credit is due to Mr. Spooner for his splendid assistance. To Miss Boate and Mrs. Kenley who promptly carried the Hand Fire Extinguishers to the top floor through so much smoke and to Miss Gillespie who kept the children fully occupied while the fire fighting operations were taking place. Credit is also due to Miss Mount for her quick warning as I did not detect anything wrong even with an open door in the office. It is remarkable that the building has been saved with such little damage, for had it occurred at night it is difficult to state how far the fire would have gone on until detected.\n\nThough much nerv\u00e8d up at this particular time, it will be but a few hours before the damage has been put right so that the children can occupy the dormitory when they arrive.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) Henry Ellis\nPrincipal.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed herewith you will find (1) a copy of a report received from the Rev. Henry Ellis, Principal of our Onion Lake School, on a fire which broke out in the main school building on the afternoon of August 23rd., and (2) a copy of his covering letter which accompanied the same. As it seems to me to be quite clear from the report that the fire originated through the defective wiring in connection with the lighting system, I beg to direct your careful attention to the recommendations given in the concluding paragraphs of the enclosed report, and to urge that immediate action be taken to have all defects in the wiring system eliminated and to have the additional fire extinguishers and axes supplied. The question of repairing and redecorating the damaged parts should also be authorized.\n\nAs there can be no doubt that this valuable building was saved from complete destruction through the vigilance and energy of the staff who knew their duty and performed it in a moment of crisis, I beg to suggest that a message of appreciation from your Department be forwarded to the members through the Principal.\n\nThe Principal and his staff were very anxious that the interior of the school should be redecorated throughout this summer, but so far, no action appears to have been taken by your Department in this matter. It would be a great encouragement to them, and to our Commission, if this work could be done at once, and also if the official capacity of the school could be increased from 90 to not less than 100 pupils.\n\nYour favourable consideration of these various matters will be deeply appreciated by\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, September 4, 1930.\n\nW.

F. MacKENZIE.\nOnion Lake, Sask.,\nAugust 23rd, 1930.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to report an outbreak of fire at the Onion Lake (C.R.) Indian Residential School this afternoon, caused by a short circuit in the wiring of the building.\n\nAt about 3:30 o'clock this afternoon the school building was discovered to be full of smoke, but no fire could be located until it was seen that the paint, on the steel ceiling in the bathroom on the second floor, was scorched. The staff then went upstairs and tore up the flooring in the small boy's dormitory, which is immediately above the bathroom mentioned. It was then discovered that a large patch of the floor joists was on fire, and flames leaped out into the dormitory. This fire was quickly put out, as the hose was already in position to deal with it. In the meantime Mr. Ellis had phoned for me to go there as quickly as possible, and I arrived at the school just as the fire had been overcome. I should add that when the flooring in the dormitory was torn up it was seen that the fire had emanated from about 18 inches of the wire conduit, which was then glowing with heat, caused by a short circuit in the wiring inside. As soon as the fire was subdued this conduit was disconnected and the wiring made safe.\n\nA good deal of damage had been done to the floor and plaster in the dormitory, and the paintwork has been scorched in places; and the whole line of wire should be overhauled and renewed where necessary. I would ask you to kindly wire me authority to have these repairs made. While I cannot give you any detailed estimate of the cost, I do not think it should exceed $150.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nSgd. Lang Turner,\nIndian Agent.\nSir:-\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter received from Mr. Turner dated the 23rd August at Onion Lake, reporting the outbreak of a fire in the Onion Lake Church of England School. I am glad to state that very little damage resulted. I have instructed the Agent to effect the necessary repairs, but before doing so to take care that the electrical circuit in which the fire occurred has been repaired and adequately tested by a competent man.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

He has now written that the Indian Agent has been authorized to make the necessary repairs and, before doing so, to take care that the electric circuit in which the fire occurred has been repaired and adequately tested by a competent man. I am today writing to Mr. Graham, informing him that you have urged that all the wiring system be examined. He is also being requested to supply whatever additional fire axes and extinguishers are necessary.\n\nI am writing direct to the Rev. Principal, congratulating them on their vigilance and their successful efforts in connection with the outbreak.\n\nI regret that there are no funds for redecorating the school at the present time. Your request that the pupilage be increased cannot receive favourable consideration, as 90 is the very limit for this building. Please see my letter to you of August 29, 1928, in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nYou will perhaps recall how long ago it is that a new cylinder head was placed on the 15 h.p. engine Fairbanks engine that operates the lighting plant. I now have to inform you that the exhaust valve has burnt out and it is too badly damaged to be refaced. I cannot account for this burning out so soon - and as the valve was already placed in the new cylinder head when shipped and put on by the expert, I cannot say if it was seated properly or not. My own personal opinion is that it was installed satisfactory and was correct in all detail when put on. We are now using an old one for the present, but this will only last for a week or two. We would appreciate having another sent as soon as possible. I have kept the damaged one here for your inspection, if you so desire, which has been shown to Mr. Indian Agent Turner.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) Henry Ellis\nPrincipal.\nSt. Barnabas School,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nJuly 16th, 1930\n\n15 H.P. ZA\n\nTook the train Sunday night for Lloydminster, had to wait one day there owing to mud and rain, got to Onion Lake School Tuesday night.\n\nMr. Ellis, the principal, was very much surprised at seeing me and wanted to know who sent me, as he said what was I doing there as everything was running beautiful and everybody happy every since I had been there last January. He said two months after I left they burnt out exhaust valves owing to letting cylinder head gasket shrink, allowing water to cut it out and burn, the engineer told me that was all that went wrong, and Mr. Ellis was so much difficulty to obtain the necessary repairs that he requires that he always sends the old parts to Mr. Graham, Indian Affairs Com., at Regina for him to forward the necessary parts back.\n\nHowever, when I was out there last January to check over entire installation you can rely that I saw to it that the installation is all correct in every way, cooling system, timing, etc., therefore, you can rest assured you will have no more trouble on that score, and if anything should go wrong, as there is bound to do, if they write to us, we can certainly give them reasons why. Of course, any engine is liable to burn out valves unless touched up every two months or so that is at a point where they are running every day, like this instance after an exhaust valve is allowed to become pitted, it is liable to start and blow and burn out completely in two hours' time, but if you ever find an engine that burns out exhaust valves chronically, it is mostly due to exhaust valve seat becoming too deep, then the only thing to be done is put in a new seat or a new cylinder head. While at Onion Lake, I drew piston and reground valves, and left one new exhaust valve for a spare and engine O.K. I am also sending them three piston rings, as they will soon require them.\n\nThere is one more thing I might state, and that is I would recommend a suction fan to be put in engine room, as it gets terribly hot in summer months, owing to the design of the room, the air does not move and makes the place unbearable to work in, and is almost too hot for the batteries, which are fairly close to cooling tank, although the engine itself runs cool enough. However I would appreciate you recommending this to Mr. Graham, Regina\u2014 the cost is small, I presume the Dept. if Indian Affairs will pay for my trip, as there was no fault found in installation or defective engine parts.\n\nTruly,\n\nE. J. Leask.\nThe Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company, Limited.\n\nWinnipeg, Man.,\nOctober 4, 1930.\n\nMr. W. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nCommissioner's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe must apologize for delaying so long in replying to your letter of September 25th, file No. 208-11A C.E., which has been due to the writer's absence from the office for a few days.\n\nAttached please find revised invoice, showing details of how the expense of $40.10 were arrived at.

School at Onion Lake to again look over the 15 H.P. engine in operation at that point. In explanation I may state that in May I received a letter from Mr. Ellis, copy of which I enclose. I could not understand why there should be any trouble with this plant when an expert had visited the school in January and placed it in good working order. I therefore got in touch with the Company's Agent here and discussed the matter with him in the office. He expressed surprise that there should be any necessity for replacing parts so soon after the expert's late visit, and stated it was the Company's desire to give service and that another expert would again visit the school, and, if the trouble was due to faulty over-hauling, no charge would be made.\n\nI enclose a copy of the experts report, dated the 16th July, from which you will note that no fault could be found, and Mr. Ellis expressed surprise that anyone could have visited the plant for the purpose of inspection. I can say only that I am too frequently receiving letters from Mr. Ellis or the Agent with reference to repair parts for this plant, and I am constrained to remark that, in view of the employment there of a satisfactory and capable engineer, I am of the opinion we would have less trouble and fewer complaints if Mr. Ellis would leave the man in charge to operate the plant without interference.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nW.

The extinguishers were sent without any chemical. I can get three acid bottles and the Bi-carbonate of Soda from the Agency as they have the re-fills on hand. I do not think that the three extinguishers are sufficient. It takes fifteen minutes to get the water pressure up to the top floor which would have to be raised from 25 to 30 lbs. pressure in the day time to 50 to 80 lbs. pressure for fire fighting, hence the use of the extinguishers in the meantime. We cannot keep the full pressure up to eighty pounds in the day time as this pressure cuts through the faucets, the brass seatings. At nights we raise the pressure for fire purposes. We need at least twelve more to feel fairly safe that we could meet any emergency.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) Henry Ellis,\nPrincipal.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nWinnipeg, Man., October 18, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of September 9th, #115-1-5, in which you state that Mr. Commissioner Graham was being requested to have the wiring system at our Onion Lake School examined, and to supply whatever additional fire axes and extinguishers were necessary, you will find enclosed herewith a copy of a letter just received from the Principal of this school, from which it seems quite clear to me that the fire extinguishing equipment supplied by the Commissioner is neither satisfactory nor sufficient.

WHITTAKER, A. M. E. I. C.,\nASST. HYDRAULIC ENGINEER.\n\nReceived under cover\nof Herbert Keller\nJune 14/31\nReport on the Proposed Filtration Plant in connection with the existing water supply of the Onion Lake Church of England Indian School, near Lloydminster, Saskatchewan.\n\nPrepared for the Department of Indian Affairs by\n\nDavid Whittaker\nAssistant Hydraulic Engineer\nDominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nGeneral.\n\nThe Onion Lake Church of England School is a comparatively new structure, designed to accommodate some one hundred and ten pupils, situated on high land about eight hundred feet from the east shore of Onion Lake.\n\nOnion lake is a lake of some 400 acres in extent located within high banks and is situated some thirty-five miles north of the town of Lloydminster and is somewhat isolated.\n\nThe lake has no inlet or outlet and is dependent on local precipitation with the possibility of some minor springs. For the most part it is some fifteen to eighteen feet deep but the water is of a greenish colour with minute but visible particles of vegetable matter in suspension; further to this, it has a very definite odour. Generally speaking, it would be described as stagnant.\n\nOther than the possibility of deep wells there is no alternative supply in the neighbourhood from which the school could be supplied.\n\nThe pumping plant, the system and the management of the supply would appear to be of a high order, but an examination and study of the water demonstrates the necessity of treatment before the school may be regarded as safe or efficient.\n\nOn the representation of the Rev. H. Ellis, the Principal of the School, analysis of the lake water has been made from time to time by various authorities as a matter of policy and one and all agree that there is danger of pollution without adequate means of prevention inasmuch as the lake water is being used for domestic purposes practically untreated.\n\nTo date the only method of treatment attempted has been chlorination though to the credit of all concerned every effort has been made to keep the lake free from contamination in so far as possible. Needless to say, should contamination take place and Bacteria Coli, - traces of which have been found from time to time - become active, an enormous percentage of mortality would doubtless be the result.\n\nA report\nA report on six water samples taken from various parts of the lake and analysed by the Provincial Authorities at the University of Alberta, shows from 690 to 3000 colonies of bacteria per cubic centimeter as against 200 colonies or less in good drinking water, and in one case out of the six there was a positive return in regard to the presence of *Bacteri* Coli.\n\nThis sample was taken from a point a distance of half a mile from the inlet, but in view of this bacteria being directly responsible for typhoid dysentery and other intestinal diseases, its presence is sufficient to warrant anxiety.\n\nVegetable content is reported in each case as \"Heavy\".\n\nA further report made by the Department of Public Health of the Province of Saskatchewan in 1926 gives a content of 2500 bacteria colonies per c.c., and also shows the presence of *Bacteri* Coli. This report continues:\n\n\"This is hard water but its use for drinking purposes should be quite suitable for persons enjoying normal health ....\"\n\n\"All surface water supplies in Saskatchewan including rivers, lakes, streams, and sloughs are dangerous for domestic purposes and should not be used without some form of treatment.\"\n\n\"Water should be passed through a filter or chlorinated.\"\n\nFrom the above facts and reports it would appear to be definitely established that some further effort is necessary before this supply can be regarded as suitable for the purpose for which it is being used and careful study has been made into the matter from all angles with the result that a combination of filtration and chlorination would appear to be advisable.\n\n**Chlorination.**\n\nWhere vegetable matter is present, water if chlorinated becomes dark in colour, offensive in odour, and unusable in regard to taste. This is due to a direct chemical action on the vegetable content and cannot be avoided.\n\nSince the water throughout Onion Lake carries a heavy content of vegetable matter, some form of filtration in addition, is necessary.\n\n**Filtration.**\n\nFiltration may be carried out by the installation of a mechanical filter or by the construction of a closed reservoir on the shore of the lake between the inlet and the present pumping plant.\nThe former of these proposals, with a mechanical filter as supplied by Francis Hankin & Co., may be installed at an estimated cost of $1700. This is a cost $400 in excess of the second proposal and in addition, there are several features such as maintenance charges, isolation, and inconvenience of periodical washing which render it less suitable than construction of a closed reservoir as outlined above, and herewith described.\n\nIt is proposed to sink a circular well on the shore of the lake, twenty feet in diameter and to a depth of ten feet below water level. The walls of this well would be raised to a height of three feet or more above the said water level and banked and ditched round, clean sand and gravel being used in all filtration areas. The said well or reservoir to be properly roofed and covered and provided with manhole and facilities for examination.\n\nThe reservoir would have a capacity of some 19,650 gallons at normal water height. Its advantages would be capacity, cost, simplicity of construction, convenience of construction inasmuch as the existing plant would not be disturbed, and the fact that it could at all times be readily pumped out and cleaned.\n\nFiltration and Chlorination.\n\nThe chlorination of the water supply as outlined above could be carried out at any time with satisfactory results, inasmuch as the vegetable content would be removed and chloride could be applied.\n\nStocking the lake with suitable fish.\n\nIn addition to the matter of filtration, in order to keep down the growth of minute vegetable matter as shown in the water content together with insect life and leaches, it is strongly advised that the lake be stocked with perch and sucker. These species live entirely on the matter in question and, in the opinion of the Inspector of Fisheries, would greatly improve the existing conditions.\n\nRecommendation.\n\nIt is recommended that a filtration plant consisting of a circular well as described above be constructed at Onion Lake Church of England Indian School in connection with the existing plant and that in regard to the matter of stocking the lake with suitable fish in an effort to improve preliminary conditions, further advice be obtained.\n\nThe cost of construction on the lines outlined and depicted on the accompanying plan is estimated at $1270.\n\n(Sgd) David Whittaker\nA.M.E.I.C.\nSir:-\n\nI am forwarding two copies of a report by Mr. D. Whittaker upon proposed methods of improving the water supply at the Church of England Indian Residential School at Onion Lake, Saskatchewan.\n\nMr. Whittaker recommends the provision of an infiltration well on the margin of the lake in preference to a mechanical filtration plant. This system is in use at other public institutions in the Edmonton district and has given satisfaction. The cost of the well is estimated at $1270.\n\nIf further security is needed a small mechanical chlorination plant could be placed in the boiler room at an extra cost of approximately $450, making a total estimated cost of $1720.\n\nIt would be advisable to start construction on this plant until the spring, but material could be placed on the ground this winter to advantage, as the river is frozen over and transportation is handled better at this time of year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.S. TEMPEST.\nCommissioner of Irrigation.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydro Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nAs requested in your letter of October 20th last, (your file 115-1-5), we have secured from the Commissioner of Irrigation a report as to a filtration system for the Onion Lake Church of England School. Copy of this report by Mr. D. Whittaker of our Calgary staff is enclosed for your information.\n\nThis report was received under cover of a letter from the Commissioner, dated January 14th, copy of which is also enclosed. You will note that while it would be inadvisable to start construction before spring it would be of advantage to place material on the ground this winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

FERRIER\n\nRe Onion Lake School Water Supply.\n\nMay I advise as follows:\n\n1. Unqualified approval cannot be given a water supply from a land locked lake of 400 acres, to which cattle and people have ready access, and from which the water is used untreated.\n\n2. The scheme proposed by Mr. Whittaker seems good, but I should want to be assured that the filter well will not freeze.\n\n3. Automatic chlorinating apparatus has not given good results in our institutions except where someone has been found to give it careful supervision; \"someone\" having invariably been a person who has a technical knowledge of such apparatus.\n\n4. I think you should look forward to improving this supply in the near future, but, in the prevailing state of funds, it might be left off for another year. In the meantime I might suggest the following:\n\n(a) Try to ensure that the lake is not obviously contaminated by water closets etc. or any preventable access by cattle or people.\n\n(b) Try to devise some small and cheap experiment to see whether a well will fill at the edge of the lake, what sort of strata will be met with in digging, and whether it will freeze.\n(c) Find out who is to be responsible for keeping the system in order.\n\nE.L. Stone, M.B.\nDirector of Medical Services\nOttawa, February 5, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 40782-W of the 19th ultimo, enclosing a report on a filtration system for the Onion Lake C. of E.

H. Ellis, principal at the Anglican Indian Residential School here, in which he asks the Department to build a sun room on the roof covering the porch of the main entrance to the school. I also enclose a rough sketch of the proposed sunroom, which Mr. Ellis also submitted.\n\nIn conversation with Mr. Ellis on this subject, I gathered that he did not wish me to submit an estimate of the cost of the proposed sun room to the Department; but that he expected, if the Department approved the expenditure, that it would have a plan made, from which I could obtain tenders for the necessary materials and labour.\n\nThe erection of this proposed sun room would be a great boon to the school. It is a matter which has been brought up on several occasions during my visits there; and, on my last visit, in conversation with Mr. Ellis, I told him to write me on the subject and I would transmit his letter to the Department. Dr. Hill was present at that conversation and heartily endorsed the project.\n\nI should add that if these alterations are made at the school, it is intended that the Matron will occupy one of the present infirmary rooms, which would then be vacated.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 16, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Onion Lake C.

Some of the older pupils are given half day work on the farm and at domestic employments, and half day in the classroom. Two teachers are employed; Miss Boate has a second class permanent Manitoba certificate, and Miss Fairservice has a first class certificate from New Brunswick. She has had ten years experience in teaching, and appears to be well qualified.\n\nI noted that they had an ample quantity of wholesome nourishing food for their lunch, consisting of pork, potatoes, turnips, bread, and sago pudding.\n\nI found the school clean throughout. I may say that this school has not had any interior decoration since it was built over six years ago, and some of the rooms are beginning to look as though they require it. I may say that the plaster work in this school has stood up remarkably well and is in good condition.\n\nIt is noted that they are still using the hay mattresses in the dormitories. I did not need to have my attention drawn to this as I could smell them as soon as I entered the dormitory. This matter has been reported on before. In my opinion, it would be very desirable.\nONION LAKE C. of E. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nvery desirable to have these mattresses replaced with woollen mattresses. They have a few on hand now, but would require 36 - 6 ft. and 35 - 5 ft. mattresses to meet their requirements.\n\nWith regard to the equipment, the pumping plant is giving splendid satisfaction and an hour's pumping each day gives them all the water they require. The fire hose and equipment I found in good shape.\n\nSomething appears to be the matter with the large engine used for generating electricity and for running the laundry machinery. The valves in this engine burn out regularly, and have to be replaced at least once a month. This may be the result of an overload.\n\nThe hot water boiler used in connection with the range for heating hot water for the kitchen will have to be replaced. There is some ingredient in the water which is hard on metal, and this boiler is eaten through in many places. It is an 82 gallon horizontal range boiler. I may say that this boiler should be replaced at once.\n\nThe water supply, as reported previously, is obtained from the lake. This water is hard, and a request has been made by the school authorities for a water softening plant. The school building is equipped with eavestroughing, but no storage facilities are provided for soft water, and all the rain water caught by the roof is allowed to go to waste.\n\nThe outbuildings are in a good state of repair. They have a large supply of firewood on hand, which has been sawn up and is very neatly piled. The premises\nONION LAKE C. OF E. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\npremises have been cleaned up and presented a very creditable and neat appearance.\n\nThe farm last year produced 122 bus. of wheat, 607 bus. of oats, and 930 bus. of barley. They had 631 bus. of potatoes, and a large quantity of other roots and vegetables sufficient for their requirements. There is 110 acres of land under cultivation in connection with the school.\n\nThey have now 23 cattle, including 14 milk cows, 7 of which they are milking at present, and the other 7 are expected to freshen very soon. I took up the question of the girls receiving training in milking, and was assured that they were given an opportunity during the summer months. They have 5 brood sows and 10 other pigs, 25 turkeys, some geese, and about 60 hens. The farm work is in charge of a practical farmer.\n\nFrequent practice at fire drill is given the pupils, and they are called up occasionally during the night at unexpected times, and I am informed that at the last midnight call the pupils evacuated the school in two minutes.\n\nThe Rev. H. Ellis is in charge as Principal. Mr. Littlewood, the engineer, is an expert in his line. Mr. Spooner, the Farming Instructor, appears to be a practical farmer. There are seven women members on the staff, including the two teachers.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Residential School, states that something appears to be the matter with the large engine, used for generating electricity and for running the laundry machinery. The valves in the engine burn out regularly and frequently have to be replaced. He states this may be the result of overloading the engine. I have to request that you will make enquiry regarding this matter and instruct the Principal to see that the engine is not overloaded.\n\nThe Inspector further draws attention to the condition of the hot water boiler, used in connection with the range for heating water for the kitchen. He states that this boiler is leaking in many places and he recommends that it be replaced at once. I shall be pleased to have your recommendation regarding the supplying of a new boiler. You should state the size and approximate cost of the boiler and its installation.\n\nIt is noted that the general conditions at this school are satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nA. R. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of May 29th last No. 115-1-7, with reference to Inspector Macdonald's report on the C. of E. Indian Residential School in this Agency; and, in connection with the first paragraph thereof, to inform the Department that I have spoken to the Rev. H. Ellis, the principal, with respect to seeing that the engine is not overloaded, and his reply is that the engine at present installed is not large enough to take the load required by the school.\n\nWith respect to the small hot water boiler used in connection with the kitchen range. This leaks badly and should certainly be replaced. The boiler is 82 gallon capacity, horizontal type, manufactured by Crane, Limited, Winnipeg, and the cost F.O.B. Winnipeg is $37.50. The school would be able to do the installation and the total cost should not exceed $50.00.\n\nIn this connection I would report that the two main compressor tanks at this school have commenced to leak, three small holes having been eaten through by the action of the water. Mr. Ellis and I are both of the opinion that these holes could be drilled out and bushings and plugs inserted; and if, also, the tanks were given three or four coats of paint, it might be a long time before there was any further trouble with them. I do not think the cost of this work would exceed $40.00 and would ask permission to have it done.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 12, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, informing the Department that it will be necessary to replace the small hot water boiler used in connection with the kitchen range and make certain repairs to the two main compressor tanks at the Onion Lake C. of E. Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of a new hot water boiler of 82 gallon capacity. It is noted that the school authorities will do the work of installing the boiler, and that the total cost of supplying same will not exceed $50.\n\nRelative to the repairs to the compressor tanks, I have to say that the Department will approve of you incurring an expenditure not exceeding approximately $40 in having the holes drilled out and bushings and plugs inserted, and the tanks given three or four coats of paint. The school authorities could, no doubt, do most of the work in connection with the tanks.\n\nPlease forward certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of the above authorized expenditures.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

P. Spies.\nLLOYDMINSTER, October 23rd 1931\n\nTurner Rdq\nIndian Agent\nOnion Lake,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nCarrying out your instructions at the Anglican Indian School at Onion Lake, Viz. To repair the two pressure tanks of about sixteen thousand gallon capacity and to inspect the same as to their condition, and also re-placing the eighty-two gallon range boiler.\n\nOn October 18th, I made the necessary repairs to the tanks by welding three patches on the same. I took the man-hole covers off the tanks, cleaned them thoroughly, and made an inspection of the tanks. I found the material below the water of the tanks to be eaten away by the character of the water which is being used at the school. There are hundreds of places throughout the tank, where the material is already eaten away to a thin shell. The average size of these places are from three to four inches in diameter, and the action penetrates the material to a point where it fairly comes through to the outside of the tank, about one eighth of an inch, and continues to get larger. The tanks are absolutely ruined, and will require replacing. The galvanized range boiler which I replaced, I found to be the same, and was beyond repair. I also found the piping system being gradually eaten away, and, if allowed to continue, the whole system of piping will need replacing in the near future. Both the plumbing system as well as the heating system, especially the wet return piping.\n\nTherefore I recommend the installation of two new 4 by 16 ft pressure tanks, as the present ones will be a source of continuous expense in repairs, and would possibly be out of order just when needed in case of fire. I also recommend the installation of a water softening system to avoid further trouble, and also for the protection of the health of the children and the staff, as the analysis of the water proves it to be very injurious to health as well as to the equipment.\n\nYour's Truly,\n\nR P Spies.\n\nper O F Jacobsen.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6322, file 658-5, part 5)\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of August 12th last, No. 115-1-5, and to enclose herewith two letters received from R. P. Spies, of Lloydminster, who made the repairs to the compressor tanks at the Onion Lake C.E. Indian Residential School.\n\nI would ask for authority to purchase the globe valves recommended, the cost of which is, approximately, $15.00. With reference to the replacement of the compressor tanks, I may say that in conversation with Mr. Jacobson, who made the repairs, I learned that he considered that the tanks could be made to last until next year, and replaced at the same time as a water softener was installed, if it is the intention of the Department to install one at this school next year.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 5, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, enclosing two communications which you received relative to the repairs to the pressure tanks at the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School, and requesting authority to purchase the globe valves recommended, at a cost of approximately $15.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase and installation of these valves, and the cost should not exceed your estimate. When these have been supplied and the other work performed, as authorized in official letter of August 12th, last, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nWith reference to the replacement of the pressure tanks, it is noted that, after consulting with the man who made the repairs, it is considered these tanks would last until next year. Our funds this year are extremely limited, and it will not be possible to replace these tanks at the present time. It is hoped that they will be satisfactory until next year, when you might again draw this matter to the attention of the Department, giving full particulars as to the type of tanks required and the cost of same, installed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Ellis, Principal of our Society's Indian Residential School at Onion Lake, Sask., a certificate of analysis of the water in use at this School as made by the Elgin Softener Corporation, also a copy of the report of the plumber, Mr. R. P. Spies of Lloydminster, Sask., as furnished by him to Mr. Indian Agent Turner after a careful examination of the pressure tank, piping system, range boiler, etc., at the above School. The report, a copy of which I presume has already reached you, clearly indicates that the whole system has been so seriously injured by the nature of the water, that immediate action will have to be taken, if serious consequences are to be averted, and I shall be glad to know if your Department is giving this important matter the careful attention it demands.\n\nYou may recall that, as far back as April 1928, I directed your attention to the injurious effects which the water supplies were having on the water systems at our Onion Lake, Elkhorn and Blood Schools, and you replied on May 15th of that year (see letter No. 115-1-5) requesting a certificate of chemical analysis. The certificate was forwarded in due course, but no remedial action was taken. This whole question was submitted to our Commission at a meeting held on Nov. 10th, and I was instructed to inform you that the members could not accept any responsibility whatever for any consequences which might result from the dangerous condition in which the water systems at the three schools I have mentioned now stand. They recommend that all three systems be overhauled and renewed where necessary, and that water softening plants be installed to prevent a recurrence of what has already taken place.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\n\nIndian Affairs.

Turner,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Turner,-\n\nI herewith ask the Department to furnish us with a new set of storage batteries - 56, 12 plate for 160 ampere hour capacity. The present batteries have been in use over four years. As soon as the engine is closed down the voltage drops below 55 volts which leaves the building in semi-darkness and it is getting worse as the time goes along. The batteries were cleaned out this spring of all sediment, with the expectation that they would last for this season. This, however, is not possible, and unless they are re-placed immediately, we shall be without light, except when the engine is running. To have to run the engine for three or four hours every night during the winter, after the children have retired will cost the school management a very heavy outlay for gasoline, which they have no appropriation for.\n\nIt will be possible for us to make the installation ourselves.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSgd. Rev. Henry Ellis\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nW.

Will the Department please advise what action is to be taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

In reply I have to authorize you to purchase the storage batteries required for the Onion Lake C.E. Indian Residential School from the A. F. Miller Hardware Company, of Lloydminster, provided they can supply what is required at a reasonable price. For your information, I may say that, nearly four years ago, the present battery was supplied. It consisted of 56 cells, 160 ampere hour, and was known as the \"Globelite\".\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 28th instant, No. 115-1-5, regarding the purchase of storage batteries for the Onion Lake C.E. Indian Residential School. This school, as you are aware, is in constant trouble with their lighting and pumping systems, and have been for years. I am therefore very anxious that when batteries are supplied, they will be good ones.\n\nYou will remember that the last time batteries were supplied at one of our institutions (File Hills), we installed what is known as \"Iron Clad\" batteries, which, I am told by experts, have a longer life and much better efficiency. The cost is slightly higher, but the difference is more than overcome by the life of the batteries; they are also less trouble during the period of operation. These batteries are manufactured right here in the City of Regina.\n\nI notice that you ask me to purchase the batteries from the A. F. Miller Hardware Co., of Lloydminster. Of course, you know we have been buying batteries in the past at the same price as Mr. Miller will be able to purchase them from the factory, and in all probability we will have to pay from $100. to $125. more for these batteries if we have to purchase them through a local dealer. None of these local hardware men carry batteries - they merely accept an order and purchase the batteries at cost from the factory.\n\nI shall be glad to know whether I may be permitted to purchase the \"Iron Clad\" batteries, and whether I shall place the order through Mr. Miller.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Dept., I.A.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that on the 21st of December I received a letter from the Principal of the Anglican Boarding School at Onion Lake, informing me that the Fairbanks-Morse, 6 H.P. engine that is used to pump water at the lake shore had developed a defect that caused the exhaust to blow into the water hopper so that all compression was lost, and that he was unable to use it. He gave as his opinion that the chemical action of the water had eaten through the iron casting, and that he was unable to get at it, because of the cylinder casing.\n\nI took this matter up with the Fairbanks-Morse and they advised me that there was no difficulty so far as the water was concerned, and they asked me to have Mr. Ellis remove the cylinder head and make sure that the leak was not in the cylinder wall, and to inform him that this could be easily done. I wired this to Mr. Ellis and he wrote back to me stating that the head had been taken off by their engineer before he wrote to me, and repeated that he could not locate the trouble. He stated that had it been in the cylinder head this could have been easily overcome, as he could change the head.\n\nAs he assured me that the engine had to be overhauled, there was no course open for me but to have him send it down here, which was done at a cost of $8.00. The return freight would also be $8.00. I sent it over to Fairbanks-Morse, and all they did was\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nto remove the cylinder head, (which Mr. Ellis said he had done), and they at once located the trouble. All that was needed was a new cylinder head gasket, costing one dollar.\n\nThe Fairbanks-Morse people told me that had the nuts been kept tight, the original gasket would not have had to be replaced. I might say that when the original gasket was destroyed by carelessness, they put some kind of a mat with a tarry substance on it, to take its place, which, of course, added to the trouble. This company also told me that there was really no necessity for sending the machine down here, as an engineer with very little experience could have located the trouble.\n\nThe engine was very dirty when it reached here, which shows that it has not been well taken care of. My opinion is that the Department should not be called upon to pay this account. If he had carried out instructions, the engine would never have been shipped. We have had a lot of trouble with this man over neglect of engines, and I am holding this account here, as I think Mr. Ellis should be informed that he will have to pay it himself.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Fairbanks-Morse engine, used to pump water at the Onion Lake Anglican Indian Residential School. It is noted that this engine was forwarded to Regina to be overhauled. It is considered, in view of the circumstances as mentioned by you, that the school authorities could easily have placed this engine in good condition without the necessity of incurring the expenditure in having it sent to Regina.

Fetterly, B.Sc., A.M.E.I.C.\n\nPurpose of Report.\n\nAn inspection of the existing water supply system of St. Barnabas School was made on July 5th, 6th and 7th, 1932, instructions having been received from the Director in a letter dated June 10th, 1932. This was accompanied by a copy of a letter dated May 30th, 1932, from the Department of Indian Affairs, containing authorization for the inspection. The inspector was requested to report as to the advisability of installing a water softener in addition to the other improvements.\n\nReason for Inspection.\n\nComplaints were received at the offices of the Indian Department in Ottawa that the water was injuriously affecting the plumbing and heating systems, including the pressure tanks, because of the presence of certain salts, causing the water to be very hard and corroding the metal. The presence of a large amount of vegetable matter was also potentially injurious hygienically. It is visible and is held in suspension.\n\nResults of Former Inspections.\n\nMany water samples have been analysed and the complaints were found to be justified. The results of analyses are on file. Officers of this Bureau reported on general conditions under date of May 9th, 1930 and also in 1931.\n\nResults of Present Inspection.\n\nThree principal subsystems were studied, all however, being related to the general water supply system. These will be dealt with in the order of importance, i.e. in the order in which repair or replacement should be carried out, in the opinion of the\nPrincipal, the School Engineer, and also of the writer.\n\n(a) Pressure Tanks.\n\nThese are also called pneumatic tanks. They are two in number and are 16 ft. long by 4 ft. in diameter. They lie horizontally and parallel to each other. The water in the lake can be pumped directly into them by the main pump at the lake, or they may be filled from the reservoir.\n\nIt was found that the corrosive action of the water due to possible chemical and (or) electrolytic action from the dissolved salts and decayed vegetable matter in the lake water, has badly injured the metal of the tanks. Certain areas are covered with blisters an inch or so in diameter. When broken open these blisters are found to be filled with a corrosive \"pus\" which apparently gradually corrodes the metal, causing holes to appear. The destroyed portion is cone-shaped with the base inside the tank. The sharp angle gradually spreads and touches the surface. These tanks will not stand the \"hammer test\", i.e., one dare not strike them with a hammer. The hammer is liable to break the metal. Several holes have already appeared which have been plugged by the Engineer. The portion mostly affected is naturally that below the water line, but turning them upside down would be ill-advised because the weakened portions now under water would not stand the air pressure or hold the air.\n\nThe Engineer is compelled to keep the air pressure below 20 pounds instead of at least 75 pounds which should be the working pressure.\n\nIt may be parenthetically noted that the boiler is in ever present danger of being similarly affected. It was, of course, impossible to examine the inside of the pipes, radiators, boiler, etc., to ascertain possible damage.\n\nAny new pressure tanks provided should be painted on the inside with a coat of red lead and another of a bituminous paint, e.g., Dr. Smith's Solution.\nFilter Tank at the Lake.\n\nWater for the system is drawn from a lake 800 ft. to the south. This lake has neither inlet or outlet. The inlet valve for the pipe is about 100 ft. from the shore and 80 ft. below the School. The general layout is shown on the accompanying plan.\n\nAs before mentioned, the water is drawn directly into the pressure tanks or the reservoir at the School without treatment, except for Chloride of Lime which is added at the rate of one teaspoonful per 1,000 gals. The salts, vegetable matter, etc., are thus left in the water.\n\nIt is proposed to erect a sand and gravel timber filter at the edge of the lake to extract the major portion of obnoxious solid matter. The bottom of the lake consists of 3 or 4 ft. of muck overlying sand. The tank may be joined to the lake by an inclined filter bed of sand and gravel as shown on the plan, if the tank alone does not receive sufficient seepage water.\n\nIt may here be noted that the writer has been told that the Gordon Indian School at Punnichy, Sask., tried this alone without a water softener but was unsuccessful, and was compelled to add a softener in the School.\n\nIf it be decided to construct a trench also, the area to be excavated will have to be coffer-dammed.\n\nTests were made by the Chief Engineer of Fort Saskatchewan Jail near Edmonton as to the rate of seepage into a similar system well. He stated, under interview by the writer, that the water seeped at the rate of one half pint per minute per sq. ft. of surface. At this rate the proposed tank would receive 9,600 gals. per day. The requirements of the School are about 4,000 gals. per day of filtered and softened water.\n\nIt is to be remembered that this proposed filter is intended only to dispose of the coarser vegetable and other injurious matter, and does not affect the dissolved salt content. This coarser material would quickly choke up a proposed water softener.\n\nThis filter tank should be so connected with the main 2\u00bd in. pipe line from the lake that gate valves can be installed in order...\nthat water may be drawn directly from the lake or filter tank at will, e.g., in case of fire.\n\nThe lower portion of the pipe, containing strainer and foot valve, should be surrounded with a perforated metal box 2'x2'x2' for protection from debris. The capacity of the tank to water level 11\u00bd' in diameter by 11' high, is about 6,500 gallons.\n\nA surface ditch 2\u00bd' wide by 2' deep should surround the tank 2\u00bd' away to collect surface drainage.\n\nProvision should be made to cover the tank and manhole with straw a least 6 ft. thick for frost protection.\n\nWater Softener.\n\nThis machine consists of a mechanical filter connected with a brine tank which extracts the salt content from the hard water. The regular filter consisting of sand and gravel will not do this. The Zeolitic Water Softener manufactured by the Crane people performs this action. An installation by Crane's in Prince Albert City Waterworks Station was examined by the writer recently. It performs its work to the complete satisfaction of the City Engineer who described its action to the writer. It could be placed in the boiler room and connected with the existing system by pipe and gate valves as shown on the accompanying plan. An area 7 ft. long by 5 or 6 ft. wide is available.\n\nThe argument may be recapitulated by stating that a filter will remove solid matter but not salts. A softener will remove the salts. Both are present damaging the system.\n\nChlorination.\n\nThe filter (b) and water softener (c) dispose of the solid matter and the salts. Neither, however, take care of all of the germ impurities. The only known method for this is chlorine, usually administered in the form of chloride of lime. At Present this is added to the reservoir at the rate of one teaspoonful per 1,000 gallons. The Prince Albert authorities use chlorine gas administered by a rather expensive machine. In this case it can be added manually as at present.\nExtension of the present Pump House and exchange of the coal stove for a wood stove.\n\nThe present coal stove should be exchanged for a wood stove as only wood is available for fuel.\n\nThe Pumphouse was originally 10' by 10'. An addition 6' by 10' was made on the west side. A similar extension should be made on the east side for storing wood fuel, making a building 22' by 10'.\n\nPresent Reservoir.\n\nThis reservoir should be painted on the inside with a waterproofing paint as checks are beginning to appear in the concrete which must in time cause leakage.\n\nExtension of the Pipe Line.\n\nThe pipe line now extends into the lake about 100 feet. It might be extended another 100 feet, although one thinks that this is hardly necessary if the other improvements be made.\n\nVegetation.\n\nThe Vegetation on the bottom of the lake for about 300 feet surrounding the pipe line should be cleared from the bottom. The School Engineer states that he will be able to do this work.\n\nFish.\n\nPerch and suckers should be placed in the lake to clear the vegetable matter.\n\nReservoir for Rain Water from Roof.\n\nThe Principal has wished a Reservoir to collect soft water from the roof through eaves already in place. This, however, should not be necessary if a water softener be provided.\n\nGeneral Notes.\n\nThe lake varies only a foot or so in actual height during the year. At the time of visit it was stated to be at flood level.\n\nThe Engineer of the School stated that provided he had the necessary tackle, he could remove the old pressure tanks and install new ones. He also stated that he could deal with the excavation. This work could be advantageously and inexpensively completed by the School Engineer, who is a Civil Engineer educated by Vickers, under supervision of an official of this Bureau, together with a\n(a) Pressure Tanks.\n\nPrices have been requested from two firms for two tanks 16' long by 4' diameter with manholes.\n\nThe Dominion Bridge Co. quoted $1,157.00 f.o.b. Calgary for tanks, including pressure gauge, (one is already available), water gauge, hand hole, manhole and couplings. The tanks would have a working pressure of 100 lbs, and a tested pressure of 150 lbs. per sq. in. A copy of their letter is enclosed.\n\nAn official of the Calgary Iron Works submitted verbally a rough estimate of $800, excluding 6% Sales Tax and boiler inspection fees.\n\nA safe estimate for the two tanks f.o.b. Calgary Freight - Calgary to Lloydminster (less gauge) $1140.00 Haulage from Lloydminster to the School 7500lbs. for 35 miles Removal of old tanks and installation of new tanks (The School Engineer Claims that he can do this with proper tackle)\n\nTotal $1323.00\n\n(b) Filter Tank at Lake.\n\nMr. David Whittaker, in his report dated Jan. 14th, 1931, provided for a tank 20 ft. Diam. with no timbered filtering approach from the lake. The present estimate is based on a tank 12 ft. diam. with an alternative approach.\n\nFilter Tank\n\nIron Bands $92.00\nFreight 9.00\nHaulage 5.00 $106.00\n\nSheet Piling 48\" x 3\" 70.00\nRafters and Roofing 40.00\nPipes/Witting 76.00\nHauling freight, use of Machinery framing etc. 150.00\nLabor 150.00\nExcavation\n\nAdd 10% $59.00\n\n$592.00\n\nThe School Engineer states that he can provide for the excavation.\nAlternative trench.\n\nThis trench may be afterwards added, if found necessary, at a cost of about $200.00 for piling, stringers, struts, sand and gravel, together with labor of excavation and construction.\n\nWater Softener\n\nA water softener capable of treating 4,000 gallons per day of lake water can be purchased for about $300.00 and having a capacity of 4,000 gallons per day.\n\nChlorination.\n\nThis can be done manually as at present at the rate of one teaspoonful of chloride of lime per 1,000 gallons.\n\nExtension of Present Pumphouse and wood stove.\n\nAn extension would cost about $100.00 and a wood stove about $35.00.\n\nPainting of Reservoir.\n\nThis can be done at nominal cost, say $10.00.\n\nExtension of Present Pipe Line.\n\nThis is unnecessary if the filtering system be constructed.\n\nFish.\n\nNo estimate is necessary.\n\nand (J) are self explanatory.\n\nRECAPITULATION.\n\n| Item                  | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Pressure Tanks        | $1323.00 |\n| Filter Tank at Lake   | 652.00  |\n| Water Softener        | 300.00  |\n| Extension of Pumphouse| 100.00  |\n| Wood Stove            | 35.00   |\n\n$2409.00\n\nAs before mentioned, the necessity for these improvements is discussed in the order of their necessity.\n\nA plan of existing and proposed works accompanies this report, together with a copy of the estimate of the Dominion Bridge Com-\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nDated,\nJuly 27th, 1932.\n\n[Signature]\nEngineer in charge\n\nP.A.

Water should be passed through a filter or chlorinated.\n\nR.H. Murray, C.E.\nDirector, Division of Sanitation.\n\nThe statements on the reverse side of this sheet are part of this opinion.\nThe opinion given overleaf is based upon the detailed information recently furnished regarding the source of supply and on the foregoing laboratory findings.\n\nIf the source is satisfactory, care should be taken to protect it against future contamination.\n\nIf the source is doubtful, the improvements recommended should be given effect to at once.\n\nIf the source is unsafe, the supply should be abandoned, or the water boiled until such time as the suggested changes are made, and another opinion obtained from this Division.\n\nINTERPRETATION OF LABORATORY FINDINGS.\n\nTOTAL SOLIDS - Generally speaking, an ideal drinking water should not contain more than 50 grains per gallon of total solids. Wells on the prairie, however, usually show a much larger amount. The maximum amount of total solids permissible in a drinking water varies in accordance with relative quantities of the constituents. For this reason a water containing several times the quantity named might be pronounced satisfactory. In certain circumstances the cumulative effect of drinking a hard water may affect the health of the consumer.\n\nNITRITES - The presence of nitrites ordinarily indicates contamination in the water from decaying animal matter or from animal excrement.\n\nORGANIC MATTER - Underground streams, unless very shallow are filtered free of organic matter. The presence of organic matter in a well usually points to defects in the cover or cribbing.\n\nBACTERIA - Drinking water should have a count of less than 100 bacteria per cubic centimeter. (A cubic centimeter is equal to about one-third of a teaspoonful.)\n\nE. COLI - Is an organism or germ which comes from the intestinal tract of animals and human beings. Its presence in a water indicates that the same is contaminated with waste matter of human or animal origin, and that dysentery, typhoid fever or other intestinal diseases may be transmitted by the water.\nDirector,\nDept. of the Interior\nDominion Water Power Branch,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe following are the results of the partial chemical analyses and of the bacteriological analyses of the samples of water delivered to us by Mr. D.

The cost of these is estimated at $2409. According to this report the most pressing need is the renewal of the pressure tanks, estimated to cost $1325, and to prevent the new tanks being corroded in the same manner as the present ones, it is recommended that a filter tank be constructed in the lake to cost $651. The solids in suspension in the water would be removed by this filter and the salts in solution which cause the corroding effects could then be removed with a water softener to cost $300.\n\nThe other expenditures recommended are the extension of the pump-house to cost $100, and a woodstove in place of the existing coal stove in the pump-house, to cost $35.00.\n\nI shall be glad to have your instructions regarding this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

This has been received and in order to put this system in a satisfactory working condition it will be necessary to carry out the following works:- when these improvements have been made which include a filter tank and softener the trouble experienced in the past from the hardness of the water and its corroding effect on the tanks and plumbing and heating systems will be removed.\n\nNew pressure tanks........$1325.00\nFilter Tank at Lake........$650.00\nWater Softener.............$300.00\nExtension of pump house....$100.00\nWood stove.................$35.00\n\nIt is recommended that the alterations be carried out by day labour under the direct supervision of Mr. Fetterly of the Dominion Water Power Branch in Calgary. If you approve will you kindly give me the names of firms from whom the tanks, quantity of pipe, water softener, lumber and cement may be purchased, also the names of one competent steam fitter, one carpenter and two or three labourers. The nearest town to the Onion Lake School is Lloydminster.\n\n$5,800.00 was provided in this year's estimates for this work.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Pressure Tanks and accessories.\n2. Water softener and accessories.\n3. Filter Tank and accessories.\n\nPrices for No. 2 were obtained from the interested parties and the lumber purchased from Security Lumber Co. of North Battleford.\n\nThe filter tank being of immediate necessity, because of the weather, the iron work, consisting of the three twelve foot hoops and four 6 ft.3/4\" round iron for the trench, were also ordered from Bowers Hardware. These were absolutely necessary in immediate construction of the filter tank, so no time could be lost, bad winter weather having already set in.\n\nThe Carpenter and labourers enumerated were despatched to Onion Lake on November 3. The Carpenter used his car. I consider that we are responsible for their transportation to Onion Lake. The amount will be comparatively small.\n\nThe School Engineer, Mr. Littlewood, who is a\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior\nOttawa.\nVickers Graduate, is in charge in the absence of Mr. Fetterly. He is quite competent and understands the plans perfectly.\n\nBids were requested from Bowers Hardware Co. of North Battleford, T.J. Foley of Lloydminster, and Lockerbie and Hole of Edmonton (the latter re.your wire of October 25) for numbers 1 and 2. They were instructed to obtain the prices as quickly as possible and send them to Calgary. All prices were to be F.O.B. Frenchman's Butte, Sask., which is on the C.N.R. 13 miles east of Onion Lake, as the ferries north of Lloydminster have stopped and the river has not frozen over as yet.\n\nRegarding the second paragraph of your letter of the 19th ultimo, Dr. Hill, the Indian Agent at Onion Lake, whose Agency lies 5 miles west of the school, was interviewed regarding payment of labour. He is quite willing to take this responsibility.\n\nI would suggest that a cheque for $300 be sent to Dr. Hill to be disbursed to the workmen when their portion of the work is finished.\n\nAccording to your letter of instructions this office will be responsible for compilation of accounts for the materials and equipment for transmission to you. It is understood that cheques for payment of materials will come from Ottawa, when the work has been finished and passed.\n\nFurther information will be furnished to you as the work proceeds.\n\nI might mention that Mr. Fetterly was informed by Mr. Orr of the Indian Department, when he visited Ottawa in September that $3500 less $1600 had been voted for this work instead of the $51600 mentioned in your letter of August 8th. Mr. Orr stated that a clerical error had been made in some way regarding the amount. Mr. Fetterly cannot remember whether he mentioned this fact to Mr. Cochrane of your office or not.\n\nThe whole estimate is based on this amount as the work would be impossible for the smaller amount.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(SGD) O.H. Hoover,\nEngineer in Charge.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the water supply system at the Onion Lake Church of England School I enclose herewith, copy of a letter received from Mr. Hoover, the Engineer in Charge of our Calgary office, describing the progress which is being made with the work there.

The Reverend Henry Ellis is in charge as Principal and the school is operated under the auspices of the Church of England. The staff consists of a Farming Instructor, Engineer, Matron, three lady assistants, and two qualified teachers.\n\nThere are 102 pupils enrolled, all of whom were present at the time of my visit. The children presented a clean and healthy appearance and there was no sickness at that time. In addition to the classroom work, the girls are taught sewing, cooking, knitting, and laundry work, the boys feeding and care of stock, milking, and odd carpentry work. The Provincial School Inspector speaks favorably of conditions in the classroom and mentions that there is improvement in the methods used, although he found it necessary to make certain suggestions.\n\nThe main building was erected in 1924. It is a frame building and is standing up well. The workmanship appears to have...\nappears to have been of a good class. I found the building well cared for and clean and tidy. It has electric lighting and running water throughout. It has outside fire escapes to which accessible outlets are provided on each floor. Two stand pipes with hose connections on each floor are connected with the pressure tanks. I examined the fire fighting equipment and found it all in good order. The children are given regular fire drill.\n\nI may point out however that the pressure tanks will have to be renewed. There appears to be an ingredient in the lake water which eats into the iron and the bottoms of these tanks are now practically honey-combed. My attention was drawn to holes one half inch in diameter which had been stopped with wooden plugs. There is no possible way of repairing these tanks and in a short time they will be utterly useless, as they will not stand the pressure required to force the water throughout the building. As a measure of safety I would advise replacing them at once. The Boiler Inspector left a memorandum in connection with certain equipment including two globe valves and two check valves with the necessary unions and nipples to be installed in the boiler as a measure of safety. I have not obtained an estimate yet of the cost of this installation, but I would judge that it would probably amount to $15.00.\n\nThe pumping unit at the lake is giving good satisfaction. Water is pumped from the lake as distance of about 750 feet up a steep incline into a cement storage tank, from which it is pumped into the pressure tanks. I have obtained an analysis of the water with a view to finding out if some compound could not be used to counteract the effects of the ingredients in the water which destroy the boilers and water pipes.\n\n- The outbuilding -\nThe outbuildings are in a good state of repair. They have a good frame building, 24' x 40', which could be made into a useful storage building if placed on a cement foundation. This could be done at little expense and would provide a great deal of useful storage space. The other buildings were in good shape.\n\nThe garden produced 370 bushels of potatoes and ample vegetables for their requirements.\n\nOne section of land is set aside for the use of this school. Their crop this year consisted of 16 acres of barley which yielded 414 bushels, 60 acres of oats yielded 1934 bushels, 45 acres of green feed, and 40 acres were summer-fallowed in preparation for next year's crop.\n\nThe live stock consist of 36 cattle, 96 hogs, about 300 hens, 100 turkeys, and four work horses. Twenty of the cattle are milk cows, 10 of which were milking at the time of my visit and 10 were due to freshen during the winter.\n\nThe foregoing report is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\n## RUNNING COSTS OF MECHANICAL TRANSPORT\n\n**St. Barnabas Indian School, Ominibek, Sask.**\n\n| Cheque or Voucher No. | Day of Month | Remarks | Gasoline | Lubricants | Cost of New Tires | Cost of Tire Repairs | Cost of Repairs Not Including Tires | Accessories, Wages, Landlord's Salaries | Storage | Overhead |\n|-----------------------|--------------|---------|----------|------------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------|----------|\n| M1                    | June 18      | Mushroom Serv.

The work in connection with excavation near the water's edge, and construction of the tank has been prolonged because of severe weather conditions which included zero temperature, snow and ice. The cost will exceed Mr. Fetterly's estimate, which was made under summer conditions. The Carpenter and three labourers enumerated in your letter of 18th ultimo are installing the filter tank.\n\nThe two pressure tanks, water softener (made by Westaway Co. of Hamilton, the only Canadian Company manufacturing this article) and valves, etc., have been ordered from Bowers' Hardware of North Battleford after competitive prices had been obtained from T.J. Farley of Lloydminster, Sask., and Lockerbie and Hole, of Edmonton, Alberta. They will be installed when ready by Harold Dye, steamfitter, of North Battleford.\n\nI received a letter dated 29th instant from Dr. J.T. Hill, Indian Agent of Onion Lake, Sask., who has charge of disbursement of wages to the Carpenter and three labourers, that the cheque for $300, which he received from the Department of Indian Affairs, is insufficient to cover the labour charges.

The material has been delivered at the School and is being installed. Mr. Fetterly proceeded to the School on the 4th instant, under my instructions, to overcome difficulties and to direct operations for a few days.\n\nFor the information of the Comptroller, an explanation of the items of the invoices may be necessary.\n\nInvoices of Bowers Hardware for $1407.30 and $14.72.\n\nItems of $823, $435 and $51 are in accordance with the successful bidding on these materials. The \"change in manholes\", costing $28, was due to a clause in Saskatchewan Government boiler regulations, necessitating an extra cost of $14 for each pressure tank. The water meter, costing $16.45 is an extra for the water softener to enable the operator to regenerate at the proper time. It was not included in the contract price of the machine.\n\nThe Hoops of the filter tank, costing $38.90, were ordered from Bowers Hardware on November 1, i.e., when the lumber was shipped by the Security Lumber Co. who were the successful bidders, in order that construction of the filter tank be not delayed. The Bandiron and stay rods were used in construction of the trench.\n\nThe second invoice for $14.72 constitutes extras necessitated by slight changes.\n\nSecurity Lumber Company's Account for $315.60.\n\nThis Company was the successful bidder for the lumber to be used in construction of the filter tank.\n\nTen per cent was deducted from cost of material. They paid all freight charges and millwork and submitted the total sum as a bid. Consequently no freight bills are submitted or available.\n\nI would recommend that a cheque for $1422.02 be sent to Bowers Hardware and one for $315.60 be sent to Security Lumber Co., all of North Battleford, Sask.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

March 2nd, 1933.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Rev. Henry Ellis, Principal of our Onion Lake Indian Residential School, has informed our Commission that the zeolite water softener recently installed at that institution will require 50 lbs. of coarse salt daily to keep the zeolite clear, and I have been instructed to ask your Department to make arrangements through the Onion Lake Indian Agency to furnish this school with the salt as required. The Principal states that the salt, if purchased locally, will cost at the rate of $3.60 for every 200 lbs., and consequently a year's supply at that rate would amount to $328.50. As the per capita grants have now been cut by your Department by 15%, our Commission do not consider that they should be asked or expected to meet this expenditure out of the per capita grant earnings, and they earnestly request that the arrangement suggested above may be agreed to by your Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, March 22, 1933.\n\nRev.

Fetterly,\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI beg to make the following report on the condition of the Steam Heating Boiler, Hot water storage tank and piping as I found to be during my work here.\n\nReport on Locomotive Tye Heating Boiler.\nThis boiler was opened up and examined thoroughly washed out and found to be in good condition.\n\nTubes showed very little scale and shell of boiler is not pitted to any appreciable extent.\n\nImprovements suggested check valve on water feed line and a Blow down valve at bottom of water column.\n\nHot Water tank and colorifer. This was opened and examined. The colorifer pipes had a heavy scale on and the shell of the tank was pitted in places to a depth of 3/16\". The tank was washed out and the scale removed.\n\nGeneral Condition: poor.\n\nBoth Tubs and Tanks will have to be replaced at no distant date.\n\nCondition of piping.\n\nThe piping of the heating and water systems have been inspected and are generally in a bad condition. The sections of pipe that have had to be taken out are very badly corroded and in many cases almost blocked up with (Scale) a deposit of the consistency of hard lime also the metal is in many places through with corrosion. Up to the present several of the pipes have had to be replaced due to this fault.\n\nSamples of pipe that I have taken out will be kept for your inspection.\n\n(sd) William A. Thibault.\n(for Harold Dye).\nDepartment of the Interior\nCanada\n\nDominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau\n\nCalgary, Alta., March 22, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of 1st instant regarding the necessity for obtaining vouchers for the accounts submitted in connection with St. Barnabas Indian School, Onion Lake, Saskatchewan, I am returning the documents in question with vouchers attached.\n\nTwo slight irregularities should be explained. R.P. Spies' account contained an item of $1.50 for Phone Call and Express. It will be noted that the vouchers are for 95\u00a2 and 50\u00a2. Evidently he entered a \"round number\" in his invoice instead of $1.45.\n\nThe other irregularity is in connection with Mr. Dye's account.\n\nI have just received a letter from him today as follows:\n\n\"I have had quite a lot of trouble getting these (vouchers) fixed up. You will notice that the two freight bills come to $3.86. In my statement sent to Ottawa I had \"Freight $4.60.\" The reason for this was that on the day of leaving for the job I got hold of another (extra) set of block and tackle which I had to express as they would not have got up to Lloydminster for nearly a week (if sent by freight). So I included this all as freight, at that however I see I did not add enough.\"\n\nYou will note that I have made a notation on the express bill of 0.74 to be added to the $3.86 to make $4.60.\n\nMr. Dye's delay in returning the signed vouchers is the reason for my delay in returning them to you, as I wrote to the parties concerned on March 6.\n\nAll documents are attached hereto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

Indian School, Onion Lake, Sask., I can now send all of the invoices to date.\n\nThe two new pressure tanks, water softener, and all repairs to the system which are at present necessary, have been installed.\n\nThe only portion not finished is the filter tank at the lake. The temperature in this area during most of the time of installation was 20 to 30 below zero. The excavation for the tank continued favourably until Christmas. The excavators, however, struck three large veins of water at 7 feet. They could not control the water with the available equipment. (The school is 40 miles north of Lloydminster, in the woods). Consequently they requested Mr. Fetterly to go to the scene with a proper pump. He went to Onion Lake with a centrifugal pump and attempts were made to clear the excavation of water. After 28 days of useless endeavour, because of the extreme cold and freezing up of equipment, it was decided to temporarily abandon the filter tank until milder weather ensued. The work could have eventually been finished at the time but the appropriation would have entirely disappeared as money was being expended with nothing accomplished. It was then decided to install the pressure tanks and water softener immediately. The filter tank can be finished towards the end of March just before the ice goes out, and when the weather is milder. At that time the necessary clearing of earth in the bottom of the lake in front of the filter trench can also be finished. Meanwhile, the water being used is taken directly from the lake as before. The principal reported on January 26th as follows:- \"I am pleased to report that the system is working very satisfactory and the water softener has made a wonderful change in the water.\"\n\nBecause of the severe weather and deep snow, extra materials were difficult to obtain. The steamfitter was not called to the job until the inside equipment was ready for installation. As a consequence the condition of the old installations could not be known until he had disassembled the plant. This is the reason for the invoices from various firms in Lloydminster. In order to save the time of the men, extra material was ordered from that point by the ordinary supply team or the mail carrier. I am sending the following invoices, the payment of which is to be made direct by the Department of Indian Affairs:-\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\n1. Harold Dye, Steamfitter, North Battleford, Sask.\n\nThis man had to be transported from and to North Battleford, 79 miles, by train; and 40 miles through deep snow to Onion Lake. His travelling expenses were paid. $147.00.\n\n2. Electrical Engineers Limited, Calgary, Alberta.\n\nThis account is for the centrifugal pump which was taken by Mr. Fetterly to clear the excavation of water, including rental and freight Calgary to Lloydminster, $14.22.\n\n3. Electrical Engineers Limited, Calgary, Alberta.\n\nThis account is for freight, returning pump to Calgary, $3.98.\n\n4. Geo. Devlin, 1172, Yorke St. North Battleford, Sask.\n\nMr. Devlin, the carpenter, transported the three laborers from North Battleford to Onion Lake, 130 miles in his car, the school being isolated in the woods. He paid their expenses on the trip. He also had to purchase several tools and telegrams. $33.45.\n\n5. R.P. Spies, Lloydminster.\n\nExtra supplies for repairing hot water tank and connections, caused by previous erosion, by hard water. Not found until dismantled. $28.22.\n\n6. Miller Hardware, Lloydminster.\n\nExtra supplies as above $10.20.\n\n7. L.W. Hewitt, Ashley, P.O., via Lloydminster.\n\nTransporting two 3700 lb. pressure tanks, water softener, Zeolite and fittings from End of Rail at Frenchman's Butte to the School, 15 miles, by trail. $37.00.\n\n8. Lloydminster Co-operative Association, Lloydminster.\n\nThe belt from pump to engine broke when attempting to de-water the excavation. A new belt, which had been purchased by the school for another purpose, was used. $8.30.\n\nWages of Carpenter and three labourers.\n\nI have received the following letter from Dr. J.T. Hill, Indian Agent, of Onion Lake, Sask.\n\n\"$248.90 will be required to complete payment of wages for work done to date on St. Barnabas School water-softening plant.\"\n\"From the cheques, Nos. 228 and 3361 for $300 each, received from the Department for this purpose, we have disbursed $597.40 and have a balance on hand of $2.60.\"\n\nWill you therefore please send a cheque for $248.90 to Dr. Hill to complete payment of wages.\n\nAlso, be kind enough to see that the appropriation is held intact as we may not be able to finish the filter tank until after April 1.\n\nI am sending you a copy of a letter from Wm. Thibault who did the steamfitting for Harold Dye. You will note that the more serious defects have been repaired.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) O. H.

Hill, the Indian Agent at Onion Lake, Saskatchewan to pay wages of men employed on the work at this school.\n\nProvided Mr. Hoover's requests meet with your approval, I would ask that they be complied with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Indian Residential School.\n\nWe had been expecting this cheque for some time but as it had not arrived at the end of the fiscal year we submitted a statement of disbursements of the two cheques received (Nos. 223 and 3381 for $700.00 each) and forwarded it together with unexpended balance of $2.60. The $2.60 will now be necessary to make our payments complete.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nOn receipt of your letter of lst instant regarding the invoices of Messrs. Dye and Devlin for work performed on the Water Supply at St. Barnabas School, Onion Lake, Sask., I immediately communicated with these men, requesting vouchers in triplicate for various items in the accounts as mentioned by you.\n\nMr. Devlin lives in North Battleford but was expected to be on his way to Onion Lake, 140 miles away, to finish the filter tank. As a consequence my letter may have to follow him and thus cause delay. At any rate I have not heard from him.\n\nIn your original letter of March lst you only marked one item in Mr. Devlin's account, viz:- telegram 65\u00a2 as requiring vouchers. I obtained vouchers, in triplicate, for this account and sent it to you. That is the reason for lack of vouchers for the other items.\n\nI received a letter today from Mr. Dye, who is in North Battleford. In order to prevent further misunderstanding, I will describe the matter in detail.\n\nReferring to the copy of the letter from N.C. Allen, Representative of the Treasury, dated March 30, he states as follows:\n\n\"Mr. Dye's accounts (C.N.R. freight) amount respectively to $2.22 and $1.30, add to $3.52, not $3.86\". Mr. Allen has apparently overlooked the voucher for $1.64 for freight from Lloydminster to North Battleford.\n\nHowever, in order to clear matters I requested Mr. Dye to obtain triplicate vouchers for $1.30 with a notation on it to the effect that $0.74 of this amount was applicable to the freight bill between North Battleford and Lloydminster. He replied to-day to the effect that he did not understand my request but that he had obtained two new vouchers for $1.30. I came to the conclusion that it would be better to explain the matter to you.\n\nThe explanation is as follows:\n\nMr. Dye obtained two freight vouchers for $2.22 and $1.64 respectively; and an express voucher for $1.30 for a belated shipment of tools from North Battleford.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nto Lloydminster. These are all on the file and amount to $5.16. The invoice contains an amount for $4.60. A notation was made on the receipt for $1.30 by myself as follows: $0.74 of this is chargeable with $3.86 of freight bill ($2.22 plus $1.64) to the $4.60 on Mr. Dye's invoice.\n\nAs I understand the matter, Mr. Allen did not notice the voucher for $1.64 mentioned above, and was thus adding $2.22 and $1.30 instead of adding $2.22, $1.64, and $1.30 and taking this sum as the total against a bill of $4.60.\n\nMr. Dye paid $1.30 for the last item but inadvertently charged only 74\u00a2 on his bill, which, together with the other items of $2.22 and $1.64, amounted to $4.60. My letter of 22nd ultimo explained this fact, but apparently was not sufficiently lucid.\n\nI hope that the foregoing explanation is satisfactory as Mr. Dye is extremely anxious to receive payment as he needs it badly, according to his letters.\n\nMr. Devlin's account will have to wait until I have heard from him as the purchases were made at various points 140 miles apart, and some time will be occupied in obtaining vouchers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) O. H. Hoover,\nEngineer-In-Charge.\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of March 30th returning for revision and correction the accounts of Harold Dye and Geo. Devlin, engaged on repairs to the Water Supply System of St. Barnabas (C. of E.) Indian School, Onion Lake, Saskatchewan.\n\nThese accounts were referred to our engineer in the Calgary district and are now returned to you with copy of a letter of explanation, regarding the items questioned.\n\nI trust Mr. Hoover's explanations will be satisfactory to you and that you will be in a position to issue necessary cheques, as the payees appear to be in need of them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nN. C.

The cost should not exceed the sum of $40. Please obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the expenditure. This account, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. I enclose Encumbrance Certificate, authorizing the funds for the purpose.

Those of Mr. Devlin were obtained with more difficulty owing to his departure for Onion Lake to complete the installation of the filter tank, and the absence of Mr. Fetterly for three weeks ending May 15th on regular water power activities.\n\nI am enclosing the accounts of Geo. Devlin with sub-vouchers attached. The total amount is $33.45.\n\nI have also received a letter from Rev. H. Ellis, Principal, to the effect that the work has now been finally completed. Mr. Fetterly was unable to visit the school during his three weeks' absence in the north country, the roads being impassable. He will inspect the finished work on his next trip and will then submit a report. Mr. Littlewood, School Engineer, who is also a civil engineer, is satisfied with the installation. A copy of Mr. Ellis' letter is enclosed.\n\nThree springs were intercepted at a depth of seven feet when excavating for the filter tank. One of these is nearly 2\" in diameter and they will provide an unlimited supply of good water which will not be from the lake. The school is very fortunate in obtaining this supply.\n\nI am also enclosing the wage account for the carpenter and two laborers in connection with the construction of the filter tank from April 14 to May 13 as certified by Rev. H. Ellis and Mr. Littlewood, School Engineer. These are as follows:\n\nGeo. Devlin, North Battleford, Sask. $153.04\n(1172 Yorke St.)\nFrank Longhorn, North Battleford, Sask. 86.29\n(General Delivery)\nAlf. Blower, Onion Lake, Sask. 74.52\n\nTotal amount $315.85\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nA letter dated January 24, 1933, was received from Dr. J.T. Hill, Indian Agent at Onion Lake, Sask., regarding wages due Geo. Devlin and his co-workers. This read as follows:\n\n\"$248.90 will be required to complete payment of wages for work done to date on the C. of E. Indian School Water-softening plant.\"\n\nFrom the cheques Nos. 226 and 3361 for $300 each received from the Department for this purpose, we have disbursed $597.40 and have a balance of $2.60.\n\nA summary of the payments made are as follows:\n\n\"Geo. Devlin $184.63, Tom Turner $147.02, J. Smith $124.74, Frank Longhorn $106.51, and to Indians supplying stone, gravel and sand $34.50.\"\n\nIn a letter dated February 13, page 3, I copied this letter in part and requested that cheque for $248.90 be sent to Dr. Hill for this purpose.\n\nWe have no means in this office of knowing whether this cheque was sent or disbursed.\n\nAt a later date Mr. Devlin stated by letter that he had not received it so I conclude that as the men had departed for their home in North Battleford, Dr. Hill was unable to pay them personally as the points are 150 miles apart with no complete rail connection.\n\nOwing to the physical difficulties encountered in excavation for the filter tank I could not recommend any stated sum for transmission to Dr. Hill for payment of wages in order that he should have it on hand at the time of completion.\n\nAlthough no communication has been received from Dr. Hill I would conclude that he has been able to pay them for the former work (previous to January 24) while they were busy in Onion Lake, in April and May, and that the total amount due them at present is $315.65 as detailed earlier in this letter.\n\nThis matter of payment of wages through Dr. Hill has been a difficult matter because of the distance between the points and their remoteness from Calgary (500 miles), and because, apparently, Dr. Hill has to pay them personally. All have been in immediate need of the wages, Frank Longhorn particularly, having existed all winter on $1.50 per week relief payment. I considered that Dr. Hill would send it by mail but he apparently cannot do this.\n\nThree methods are available for the payment of the wages now due, viz: $315.65.\n\n1. Send it to Dr. Hill for disbursement. The present disadvantages of this are mentioned above. It was mentioned as an alternative in your original letter of instructions dated October 19, 1932, and at the time was considered to be advantageous to the work of this office. Dr. Hill is at Onion Lake, while Geo. Devlin and Frank Longhorn are at North Battleford, although Alf. Blower resides at Onion Lake.\n2. Send it to this office for disbursement by Mr. Fetterly on his next trip northward.\n\n3. Send it direct to the three men at their various addresses.\n\nThe second method would apparently be the best to use in this case. I would therefore recommend that the following payments be made:\n\nGeo. Devlin $33.45 for expenses of his trip in January, according to account and vouchers enclosed.\n\nGeo. Devlin wages for April and May $153.04\n\nFrank Longhorn wages for April and May $66.29\n\nAlf. Blower \" \" \" \" \" $22.80\n\nAccounts outstanding consist of a small bill for fittings and for telegrams due Rev. H. Ellis; the further travelling account of Geo. Devlin for April and May, and one or two other small items. These are not yet to hand but will be attended to when received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) O. H.

Devlin, with sub vouchers attached in accordance with your requirements.\n\nWage accounts for a carpenter and two labourers, in connection with the construction of the filter tank are also enclosed for payment.\n\nIt is hoped that these accounts meet with your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEncl.\n\nJ.

The Mr. Littlewood referred to in his letter is an employee at the C. of E. School and acted in the capacity of timekeeper. May I point out that our previous credit voucher, No. 350, in connection with this work, passed without any comment. Is it the Department's wish that the number of days in addition to hours be determined for the entire work or only for the portion covered by voucher No. 29? The four men employed on this work are at their respective homes in, or in the vicinity of, North Battleford, and considerable time and trouble would be entailed in getting their signatures.\n\nI had no instructions from the Department regarding this work and did not know it was being done until the workmen arrived.

The necessity for these renewals could not be known or suspected until the pipes connected with the pressure tanks were dismantled during the new installation.\n\nI might mention that the system cost slightly more than was expected because of this fact and because of the difficulties encountered in sinking the filter tank. Three springs were unexpectedly found at a depth of 7 feet which were very difficult to control. These springs, however, preclude the necessity of using water from the lake itself. They produce very pure water.\n\nWith the present installation, however, if the springs should fail the filter tank has direct connection with the lake through the filter trough. In other words, the school is now assured of an inexhaustible supply of pure water and may be considered to be as fortunate as any school in the West as far as water supply is concerned.\n\nThe accounts are as follows:\n\n1. Bowers Hardware\n   North Battleford, Sask.\n   Material supplied $6.15\n\n   The express charges as mentioned in the account are part of the bill and therefore do not need vouchers. The Handles are used for turning the valves in the main pipes which are located 7 feet under ground.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n2. Walsh and Charles\n   Tribune Building, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nAccount rendered $20.27\n\nThis account is for a Water Meter for the Water Softener. The first meter supplied would not admit sufficient water and it was decided to replace it. This meter also measures the total amount used by the school.\n\n3. Rev. H. Ellis, Principal, St. Barnabas School\n   Lloydminster, Sask.\n\nAccount rendered $32.27\n\nThis account is for extra material supplied from the private stock of the School to replace certain plumbing in the Engine and Boiler rooms eroded by the hard water. Replacement could not be anticipated because of the nature and cause of the repairs.\n\n4. Rev. H. Ellis, Lloydminster, Sask.\n\nAccount rendered $2.85\n\nThis account was caused by the location of the school, which is connected with Onion Lake Government Telegraph office by private phone. The telegrams were used in ordering urgent supplies. The account was paid by Mr. Ellis, who should be reimbursed. The voucher is enclosed.\n\nI would recommend that these accounts be paid to the several firms mentioned. When this is done all accounts in connection with this school will have been settled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) O. H.

File 4811.\n\nThis was incurred in connection with the repair of the Septic Tank at Blue Quills Indian School. The Indian Department were indebted to Joe Hamlin of St. Paul, Alberta, for clearing the tank, $125.00; and to the Standard Iron Works of Edmonton for repair of motor, $66.40. Referring to your letter of March 28, a cheque for $163.34 was sent to us.

Indian Residential schools.\n\nA copy of your letter has been referred to our engineer in charge at Calgary and I now enclose copy of a letter received in reply to our letter.\n\nWith the explanations offered covering the two items questioned, it is hoped that you will be in a position to pass them for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nFINAL REPORT\nON\nWATER SUPPLY SYSTEM\nAT\nST. BARNABAS INDIAN SCHOOL,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nby P.A. Fetterly\nAsst. Hydraulic Engineer.\n\nPURPOSE OF REPORT\n\nThis Report describes the installation and behaviour of the re-habilitated water supply system at St. Barnabas Indian School, Onion Lake, Saskatchewan. The final inspection was made by the writer on July 19, 1933.\n\nFILTER TANK\n\nThis tank, which is 12 feet diameter by 14 feet deep, is sunk into the ground at the edge of the lake to a depth of about 11 feet. The water has a depth of over 8 feet and is clear and cold and pure except for the salts, the excavation having intercepted three springs.\n\nAt present no water comes from the lake through the trench as the springs possess abundant supply for all purposes, including the fire hazard. However, if more were needed it would come through the trench or the main pipe, both of which are directly connected with the lake. These inlets are kept closed at present. The tank is well built. Difficulty was encountered in excavating for the tank because of quicksand. The source of the supply should not need attention for many years. The tank will be protected from frost by means of straw cover.\n\nThe tank is lowered 3 feet by 1\u00bd hours pumping and again fills up in 1 or 2 hours.\nWATER SOFTENER\n\nThe installed Westaway Water Softener (of Canadian manufacture) is working excellently. The full supply for the school, 2400 gallons for ordinary days and 2800 gallons for wash days, passes through the machine, as measured by water meter. A total of 130 people occupy the buildings. The needed supply is never less than 1800 gallons. The average per day over one month is about 2400 gallons, or 20 gallons per capita. This is the first authentic data of school requirements known to the writer.\n\nAccording to rated capacity, the softener clarifies 1400 gallons per regeneration. However, the school is using 50 lbs. of salt to regenerate 2000 gallons or more because of the expense. This is done five times per week. An average of 250 lbs. of salt is used per week. More could be used but Mr. Littlewood, the school Engineer, states that this amount gives satisfactory results.\n\nA regeneration was performed while the writer was present. It is a simple operation.\n\nAccording to the chart which is being kept, 9 sacks of 50 lbs. of salt each, were used to regenerate the 45,500 gallons of water used from July 1 to 19 or 100 gallons per pound of salt. This was done in the absence of the school Engineer and many of the staff and students on vacation. The machine does not plug. When regeneration begins the regenerating water is soapy in appearance, but it soon clears.\n\nPRESSURE TANKS\n\nTwo new pressure tanks were installed and new\nconnections made where the old pipe was corroded. The work was well done and according to specifications.\n\nA section of one of the old pipe connections, 8 inches in length and 1\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\" inside diameter was obtained and is in the possession of the writer. The outside of the section is coated with a yellowish-grey salt \\(1/8\\) thick or more. The inside is lined with salt to such an extent that the orifice is only \\(5/8\\) in diameter. It is quite probable that coating would be found inside most of the water pipe in the building but it would be obviously impossible to ascertain the extent. However, this possible condition will not be increased as the salts are now being removed by the softener.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nGood material was used and the work was well done.\n\nReferring to Mr. Mackenzie's letter of July 11, file 115-1-5 and 128247-W., last paragraph, there should be no further expenditure at this school on water supply.\n\n---\n\nP. A. Fetterly  \nAssistant Hydraulic Engineer.\n\nEngineer-In-Charge.\n\nCalgary, Alta., August 18, 1933.\nEnclosed herewith you will find a copy of the Final Report by Mr. P.A. Fetterly of our Calgary staff on the water supply system at St. Barnabas School, Onion Lake, Saskatchewan.\n\nIt appears from this report that the water supply system is now functioning satisfactorily and that no further expenditure should be required for water supply at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nV.

Fetterly for Department of Indian Affairs for $10.53. This account is in connection with Blue Quills Indian School and is chargeable to the general standing advance account.\n\nYour letter dated July 11, 1933, No. 115-1-5, Ref. 128247 W, last paragraph, suggested that there would be no further expenditure at this school.\n\nHowever, I received a letter from Rev. Jos. Angin, Principal, on September 1, as follows:\n\n\"I have not yet received any communication about the payment for the board of Mr. Fredrickson during his stay and work at School\". \"Could you give me any information about this?\"\n\nI therefore considered it necessary that Mr. Fetterly interview the Principal and Mr. Fredrickson on the matter, and so instructed him as follows:\n\n\"If necessary you see Fredrickson (and the Principal) and have this matter positively settled on your present trip\".\n\nAs a consequence Mr. Fetterly, on his last trip from Edmonton to Prince Albert proceeded to St. Paul on September 10 and interviewed these gentlemen. He ascertained, and so reported to me, that all cheques had been received subsequent to transmission of Father Angin's letter of September 1. I had not been advised of this fact before instructing Mr. Fetterly. I hope this explanation will be satisfactory to the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) O. H. Hoover,\nEngineer-In-Charge.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing, in duplicate, account of Mr. P.A. Fetterly for the month of September covering expenditures incurred on behalf of your Department on General Surveys account, amounting to $10.53.\n\nI am attaching copy of a letter received from the Engineer in Charge of this Bureau at Calgary submitting this account.\n\nIn order that Mr. Hoover's standing advance shall be maintained at the original amount of $50.00, will you kindly arrange for the issue of a cheque in Mr. O. H. Hoover's favour for $10.53 and forward it to the undersigned for delivery.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nEnc.\n\nA. F.

July 26, 1934.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe stock barn at our Onion Lake School has accommodation for twenty animals only, and as the horses and cows have to be housed in this building it is altogether too small for the purpose. Twelve horses are required to handle the farm work, and the Principal finds that twenty milk cows are necessary to provide an adequate supply of milk. Under existing circumstances a number of the cows have no shelter during the winter, and our Commission are keenly desirous of having the situation remedied. The Principal recommends the immediate erection of an additional barn for the cows and their offspring, and estimates the cost, including the Beatty fixtures, at approximately $3500.00. In the comprehensive list of requirements forwarded to your Department last October, to be provided this year, this additional barn was included, as well as an implement shed ($300.00), and a cottage for the Engineer or Farmer ($500.00), and if you are unable to provide all of these buildings, our Commission would recommend that the additional stock barn be given priority of claim.\n\nYour careful and sympathetic consideration of this urgent need will be highly appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, July 31, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th instant, requesting the erection of an additional barn, an implement shed and a cottage for the engineer at the Onion Lake Church of England Indian Residential School.

Miller, Headmaster, Indian Residential School, for the purchase of supplies.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 115-1-5 dated August 24th, 1934.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nSaskatoon,\nCanada\n\nAugust 11, 1954.\n\nDear Mr. Ellis:\n\nThis letter is in confirmation of the conversation we had with you on Wednesday last, with reference to your refrigeration problem at the Indian School at Onion Lake.\n\nAs you know, in company with Mr. Leonard, we checked over your present arrangement for handling your meats and food, and, as intimated to you during our conversation, your present system may have answered your purpose in the past, but in view of the fact that it is possible for you to install a proper refrigerator in the basement of your school and operate same electrically at the cost of a few hundred dollars, we have no hesitation in saying to you definitely that you will be able to save the price of your equipment in two years time. Where you are serving the number of meals you are per day, approximately 450 meals a day, it is just impossible for you to handle your food supplies economically with your present equipment.\n\nWith Genuine Frigidaire Equipment we can guarantee to you a constant temperature. This temperature will be controlled by your requirements and you will readily appreciate that where you are buying food supplies to feed as many people as you are at your school, it is absolutely imperative that proper refrigeration be used if you are to have economical results. With proper refrigeration all trimming of meats is eliminated; you can purchase in larger quantities and hold satisfactorily for a period of three to four weeks. Further, when you place anything in your refrigerator you are assured that you will find it in a satisfactory condition when required and we know that you will heartily agree with us that your present arrangement does not give you this service. Furthermore, the great advantage of Frigidaire equipment which is seldom appreciated until used is the fact that we give you a positive control of the humidity of your refrigerator. This point is absolutely impossible with any other make of refrigerator and you thoroughly appreciate that humidity is a great essential in the proper handling of meats and other food stuffs. The humidity in refrigerators cooled by W.K. Frigidaire Diamond Fin cooling coils is handled automatically.\n\nAfter discussing your requirements with you and checking over the conditions under which your installation will be made, we submit herewith the following specifications:\nQUOTATION:\n\nWe will supply and install the following equipment:\n\n1 only Walkin Refrigerator 5\u00bd' wide, 9' long, 8' high, outside measurements.\n\nThe insulation of this job will be: 2\" of corkboard set in hydroline with wax paper on both sides.\n\nThe Walkin refrigerator will be built in sections so that it is portable. In other words, this refrigerator will be supplied in nine sections and if at any future time you should wish to change the location it can be taken down the same as any other portable piece of equipment that you may have.\n\nIn the 5\u00bd' end of this refrigerator will be:\none only Walkin Refrigerator Door, size 24\" wide x 6' high.\nThis door will be equipped with brass roller bearing hinges and automatic hasp refrigerator door will be equipped with Wirt gaskets and a workmenlike job will be done in every respect.\n\nThe interior of this walkin refrigerator will be thoroughly shellacked, making it impervious to moisture.\n\nAfter the walkin refrigerator is erected we will install therein:\n1 only WX476 Frigidaire Diamond Fin Cooling Coil.\nThis coil will be 78\" long, 14\" wide and 7\" high.\nThis coil will be installed to control the temperature.\n\n1 only TS Automatic Expansion Valve.\n\nOutside of your refrigerator will be installed:\n1 only Frigidaire Flowing Cold Air Compressor model 20,\n21\u00bd\" wide, 28\" long, 16-1/8\" high, 1/5 H.P., direct current.\n\nWe will supply the above Refrigerator and Frigidaire Equipment and install same complete for the sum of $732.50. This price includes the freight to Lloydminster, but does not include the cartage from Lloydminster to Onion Lake, as we understand that you have private ways of carting your supplies from Lloydminster to Onion Lake.\n\nIn submitting the above quotation to you for your consideration, we have included a properly constructed walkin refrigerator suitable for your purpose and you will specially note that we have specified 2\" of corkboard set in hydroline and covered with wax paper. In constructing a Frigidaire in this manner it enables us to reduce the heat leakage to a minimum. By doing this we are assuring you at all times of a constant even temperature, as you may desire, and to do this with minimum operating time, consequently less cost of operation and less depreciation.\n\nUnder separate cover we are mailing you a descriptive catalogue and we are marking on this catalogue specific specifications that we wish you would take the time to study and if you do this we feel that you will agree with us that considerable care and precision is exerted in the manufacture of Genuine Frigidaire Equipment.\nAs you already know, we have many commercial installations consisting of institutional work, restaurants and hotels throughout the province of Saskatchewan, and as far as we know, they are all giving satisfaction. We have no hesitation in saying that we can promise you the same satisfactory performance with this equipment.\n\nIn concluding permit us to point out to you the fact that Mr. H. Leonard of Lloydminster, is one of the best Frigidaire engineers in Western Canada. When he was at our factory attending school training him for Frigidaire work he passed all examinations with an average of 98%. Following this he served six years in practical experience and at all times his judgment and method of installation has met with the hearty approval of factory inspectors, and we have no hesitation in assuring you of a workmanlike job in every respect. Mr. Leonard is thoroughly competent in every way and you are particularly fortunate in having him located at Lloydminster.\n\nConcluding, if there is any further information we can give you concerning the above equipment, do not hesitate to get in touch with us and at this time we wish to extend to you our appreciation of your courteous treatment when visiting you a few days ago.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE J. H. ASHDOWN HARDWARE CO., Limited,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFRIGIDAIRE & ELECTRICAL DEP.\nWINNIPEG, MAN. August 22nd, 1934.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Rev. Henry Ellis, Principal of our Onion Lake School, has forwarded to our Commission the enclosed letter from the J. H. Ashdown Hardware Company, Ltd., at Saskatoon, Sask., embodying the terms on which they would provide this school with Frigidaire equipment. As it is my understanding that the Deputy Superintendent General recently visited this school, and is well acquainted with the urgency of the need of this equipment, I can only express the hope that the equipment may be provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nEnclosure\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Residential School, requesting that the Department assume the cost of putting in an additional door leading from the staff dining room into the children's dining room and supplying a new drive belt for the dynamo.\n\nIn reply I have to say the Department will approve of an expenditure, not exceeding $20.00, in putting in the additional door and approximately $50.00 in supplying the new drive belt. Certified accounts, in triplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nThe Estimates for the current fiscal year for Indian Education provide the sum of $1,200.00 towards the cost of miscellaneous repairs, equipment and painting of the exterior of the main building. I have to request that you will advise the Department with reference to the painting of the building, stating in detail the work you would recommend be carried out and the approximate cost of material and labour. Regarding the labour, you should state what part could be performed by the staff and what outside labour it would be necessary to employ. Your recommendation as to the best means of having the painting of the building carried out is requested at an early date. It would be advisable for you to consult the Principal in the matter.

The Department will provide the cost, if funds permit, of any extensive replacements or repairs.\n\nIn many cases, principals of residential schools seem to rely on the Department to carry out minor repairs and replacements which are properly the responsibility of the school management and which should be paid from the per capita allowance or other receipts of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Indian Residential School.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your report, giving the information as asked for in the letter referred to.

Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your 115-1-8, of May 22nd, with reference to repairs, etc., for the C. of E. Indian Residential School, and in reply:\n\n(1) Repairs. (a) The generator in connection with the lighting plant needs repairing. Approximate cost, $60.00.\n\n(b) Planks are needed in the cow barn to repair the floor, also some other minor repairs, approximate cost, $40.00.\n\n(2) Equipment. None required.\n\n(3) Painting Main Building. The main building was painted in 1930 and is still in a good state of preservation, with the exception of the roof, which is badly faded. The following out buildings: Principal's residence, horse and cow barn, hen house, and implement shed, were painted last in 1926. These need painting badly, and some of them will require two coats. Other out buildings, viz., garage, two granaries, hog house, ice house and store house, erected just after 1926, are also badly in need of paint. I have consulted the Principal and it is his desire that the money appropriated for paint should be used on the ten buildings enumerated, together with the roof of the main building. I would recommend this, as the walls of the main building could easily go one or two years without showing any bad effect.\n\nThe material required, on a basis of 1 gallon of paint covering 600 sq. ft., and 1 gallon of shingle stain covering 200 sq. ft., with one coat, is as follows:\n\n| Item                  | Quantity | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|----------|--------|\n| Pearl Grey            | 8        | $5.60  |\n| Outside White         | 2        | $3.80  |\n| Shingle Stain         | 65       | $1.75  |\n| Red Barn Paint        | 40       | $2.75  |\n| Raw Linseed Oil       | 10       | $.89   |\n| Brushes and Freight   |          | $25.00 |\n| Shingle Stain (Main Bldg) | 75     | $1.75  |\n\nThis quotation $425.30\nThis quotation is from the Sterling Mill Work, Co., North Battleford, for their first quality paint. This firm supplied the paint for the school in 1930, and gave complete satisfaction. I would recommend that a first quality paint be purchased ready mixed, and that local men be employed to apply it. Geo. Flower and Son, painted the building in 1930, and are available now at 40\u00a2 and 35\u00a2 respectively, per hour. The Principal will supply one man from his staff to assist. The total cost of labour should not exceed $200.00.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 13, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, regarding the cost of the materials and labour required in the painting of the roof of the main building and the outbuildings at the Onion Lake Anglican Indian Residential School, and also enclosing an estimate of the cost of the repairs to the generator in connection with the lighting plant and the purchase of planks to repair the floor in the cow barn.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may arrange to have the repairs required made to the generator and lighting plant. It is noted the approximate cost will be $60, and I enclose an encumbrance certificate, authorizing an expenditure to that amount.\n\nRegarding the painting of the buildings, it is noted that the cost of the paint, shingle stain, brushes and freight will be $425.30, and that the total cost of the labour, over and above the work that can be performed by the staff of the school, will be $200. It is noted, further, that the cost of the plank in repairing the floor of the cow barn and making some other minor repairs will be, approximately $40. I enclose an encumbrance certificate authorizing an expenditure to a total amount of $670 for the above purposes.\n\nI would request that you arrange for the purchase of the paint, shingle stain, oil and brushes, from a firm on the approved list, and also for the outside labour required in carrying out the painting. You should arrange, also, for the purchase of the planking required for the cow barn.\n\nPlease obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of all materials, and accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the repairs to the generator and the extra labour necessary in connection with the painting. When the accounts, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. Please state, on each copy of the accounts covering the cost of the plank, paint and labour that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R. No. 3892. On the voucher covering the cost of the repairs to the generator, you should state that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R. No. 3893.\n\nThe Department will leave all this work in the hands of the Principal and yourself, to see that a satisfactory job is completed. The work in connection with the painting should be as mentioned in your letter referred to above.

It is considered, however, in forwarding estimates, that every care should be taken by you to see that the approximate amount is stated; as, when the original estimate given is exceeded, it is very difficult to obtain the extra funds.\n\nIt is hoped that all the painting will be completed before the extreme cold weather sets in.

Principal Ellis of our Onion Lake School, has directed the attention of our Commission to the need of a new engine to operate the lighting plant at his school. He states that the engine now in use (this is a 15 h.p. Fairbanks-Morse, horizontal oil engine Z type, with high tension rotary magneto) \"has never carried a full load during the winter season\", and recommends that a 25 h.p. Diesel engine, either Lister or Fairbanks-Morse be secured.\n\nAs there is a 25 h.p. Fairbanks-Morse \"Y\" horizontal engine, style H. No. C27732 not in use in the power house at our Elkhorn School, it has occurred to me that it might meet the needs of our Onion Lake School, and I am writing for the specific purpose of recommending that you instruct your Inspector Hamilton of Winnipeg to have the Elkhorn engine carefully examined and furnish you with a recommendation as to the advisability of having it utilized in the way I have suggested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nSir:-\n\nI visited the St. Barnabas C/E Indian Residential School on the 9th instant and met the Provincial School Inspector, Mr. Hicks.\n\nI found the school building in excellent condition throughout. The premises also presented a neat and tidy appearance. The hot water boiler should be replaced at once. This boiler is badly pitted and the holes are breaking through. There is some agency in the water at this school which is hard on boiler plate. I think that the damage was largely done before the water softener was installed. The boiler in use now was made by the Vulcan Iron Works, 48\" x 10' in size with a man-hole in the head. The cost of the boiler F.O.B. Lloydminster is $356.10. The 15 H.P. engine which is used for generating light and running the laundry and pumping machinery is done. It is impossible to generate more than 30 amperes and it pounds badly when generating that amount. Sixty amperes are required for the full load. I have several times reported on this engine in the past as being too small for the work it is called upon to do. It has been working since its installation with an over-load, with the result that it has been continually burning out valves and has not been very satisfactory. I have in mind that it might be possible to pick up a good engine from some town where their power unit has been discontinued and power is being supplied by one of the Power Companies. I am making enquiry with a view to locating such an engine should it be authorized. There is no doubt that this engine is getting to the point where it will have to be\n\n- replaced -\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nreplaced.\n\nThe water supply system appeared to be in good working order, also the fire equipment. The pupils are given fire drill regularly twice a month. A night watchman has been engaged for duty during the period that the furnaces will be in operation.\n\nThere are 97 pupils enrolled, 50 boys and 47 girls. The Principal informed me that it was his desire to obtain authorization to admit 10 more children, as he has accommodation for them. The health of the children appeared to be very good and they presented a bright and well nourished appearance. When visiting the dormitories I examined the mattresses and found that they were not in good condition. They have been using straw mattresses and even with frequent changes they are not satisfactory. I noticed a strong smell from them and they did not appear to be very comfortable. I mentioned this condition in my report on this school dated May 14th, 1931, and understood at that time that the Agent was asked to include them in his Estimates. Apparently the matter has not received attention. They require 40 mattresses 5 ft. long and 36 mattresses 6 ft. long.\n\nFarm\n\nThe farm crop was light owing to insufficient moisture in the early part of the season. The soil at this farm is very light and early maturing. They threshed 359 bus. of No. 2 Nor. wheat, 316 bus. of oats, 119 bus. of barley, and 96 acres in green feed. Their potatoe and vegetable crop was very good and they have procured 822 bus. of potatoes, 200 lbs. cabbage, 105 lbs. carrots, 70 lbs. beets, 90 lbs. parsnips, and over 200 lbs. turnips. They will be well supplied with roots and vegetables.\n\nThe stock comprises 40 head of cattle, 14 milk cows, 7 work horses, 80 hogs, 80 turkeys, and 163 hens.\n\nThe foregoing is respectfully submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nSir:-\n\nI visited the St. Barnabas C/E Indian Residential School on the 9th instant and met the Provincial School Inspector, Mr. Hicks.\n\nI found the school building in excellent condition throughout. The premises also presented a neat and tidy appearance. The hot water boiler should be replaced at once. This boiler is badly pitted and holes are breaking through. There is some Agency in the water at this school which is hard on boiler plate. I think that the damage was largely done before the water softener was installed. The boiler in use now was made by the Vulcan Iron Works, 48\" x 10' in size with a man-hole in the head. The cost of the boiler F.O.B. Lloydminster is $356.10. The 15 H.P. engine which is used for generating light and running the laundry and pumping machinery is done. It is impossible to generate more than 30 amperes and it pounds badly when generating that amount. Sixty amperes are required for the full load. I have several times reported on this engine in the past as being too small for the work it is called upon to do. It has been working since its installation with an over-load, with the result that it has been continually burning out valves and has not been very satisfactory. I have in mind that it might be possible to pick up a good engine from some town where their power unit has been discontinued and power is being supplied by one of the Power Companies. I am making enquiry with a view to locating such an engine should it be authorized. There is no doubt that this engine is getting to the point where it will have to be replaced.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe water supply system appeared to be in good working order, also the fire equipment. The pupils are given fire drill regularly twice a month. A night watchman has been engaged for duty during the period that the furnaces will be in operation.\n\nThere are 97 pupils enrolled, 50 boys and 47 girls. The Principal informed me that it was his desire to obtain authorization to admit 10 more children, as he has accommodation for them. The health of the children appeared to be very good and they presented a bright and well nourished appearance. When visiting the dormitories I examined the mattresses and found that they were not in good condition. They have been using straw mattresses and even with frequent changes they are not satisfactory. I noticed a strong smell from them and they did not appear to be very comfortable. I mentioned this condition in my report on this school dated May 14th, 1931, and understood at that time that the Agent was asked to include them in his Estimates. Apparently the matter has not received attention. They require 40 mattresses 5 ft. long and 36 mattresses 6 ft. long.\n\nFarm\n\nThe farm crop was light owing to insufficient moisture in the early part of the season. The soil at this farm is very light and early maturing. They threshed 359 bus. of No. 2 Nor. wheat, 316 bus. of oats, 119 bus. of barley, and 96 acres in green feed. Their potatoe and vegetable crop was very good and they have procured 823 bus. of potatoes, 200 lbs. cabbage, 105 lbs. carrots, 70 lbs. beets, 90 lbs. parsnips, and over 200 lbs. turnips. They will be well supplied with roots and vegetables.\n\nThe stock comprises 40 head of cattle, 14 milk cows, 7 work horses, 80 hogs, 80 turkeys, and 163 hens.\n\nThe foregoing is respectfully submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nOttawa, November 5, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is informed that there is surplus to requirements, in the powerhouse at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, a 26 h.p. Fairbanks-Morse \"Y\" horizontal engine. The Anglican School at Onion Lake, Sask., is in need of a new engine to operate the lighting plant, and it has occurred to the Department that the engine at Elkhorn would be satisfactory for the purpose. I would request that, at your early convenience, you will have the engine referred to, at the Elkhorn School, examined, and, if you consider it is in fair condition, you might have any necessary repairs made and arrange to ship the engine, addressed to Rev. Henry Ellis, Lloydminster, Sask.\n\nAny expense, in connection with overhauling and placing the engine in good condition, and also the transportation charges will be paid, upon receipt of vouchers, in triplicate, properly certified.\n\nMr. Inspector Murison, who visited the Onion Lake C.E. Residential School, has drawn the Department's attention to the need of a new engine, and he is being informed of the engine that is surplus to requirements at Elkhorn. I would request that, after examination of the engine at Elkhorn, if you consider it satisfactory, that you will inform Mr. Murison. The Department will leave the matter in your hands, in the hope that it will be possible to utilize the engine at Elkhorn at the Onion Lake C.E. Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWINNIPEG, MAN.\nOttawa, November 5, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 309-11A C.E. of the 26th ultimo, reporting on your visit to the Onion Lake Protestant Indian Residential School. In this connection it is noted that a new hot water boiler is required, to replace the one at present in use, which has become badly pitted. It is noted, also, that the cost of supplying a new boiler, f.o.b. Lloydminster, would be $356.10.\n\nThe Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of a new boiler, of a type that will be satisfactory, and the cost should not exceed your estimate, as stated above. You should make purchase from the best available source of supply and arrange for forwarding same to Lloydminster. Please notify the Principal of the School when the order has been placed, so that arrangements can be made to have the boiler taken from Lloydminster and installed in the school. It is hoped that the cost of installation will be kept as low as possible. It might be advisable for you to inform Dr. Hill, Indian Agent, when the boiler will arrive at Lloydminster, in order that he can arrange for installation. After the boiler has been delivered, you should forward an itemized account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nRegarding the 15 h.p. engine in use for generating light and running the laundry and pumping machinery, it is noted that a new one is required. In this connection I have to say that the Department has surplus to requirements, at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, a 25 h.p. Fairbanks-Morse \"Y\" horizontal engine, which would, no doubt, meet the needs at the Onion Lake Protestant School. Mr. Inspector Hamilton is being written to have this engine carefully examined and report concerning the advisability of having it sent to the Onion Lake Protestant School. Mr. Hamilton will be requested to have the engine overhauled and placed in good condition, if he considers it would be satisfactory. He is being requested to communicate with you in the matter and to make the necessary arrangements for shipping the engine to Onion Lake.\n\nWith reference to the condition of the mattresses, the Department will have no funds this year to supply new ones.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6322, file 658-5, part 6)\nOttawa, November 5, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, regarding the need of a new engine, to operate the lighting plant, at the Onion Lake Church of England Indian Residential School, and reporting that there is an engine, surplus to requirements, at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that Mr. Inspector Hamilton, Winnipeg, is being requested to have the engine at Elkhorn examined, and, if he considers it would be satisfactory, he is being instructed to have it thoroughly overhauled, placed in good condition and shipped to the Principal of the Onion Lake School at Lloydminster, Sask.\n\nI may add that Mr. Inspector Murison, who recently visited the school, has also drawn this matter to the attention of the Department, and he is being informed of the engine at the Elkhorn School, which might serve the purpose.\n\nFor your information, I may say that the Department is authorizing Mr. Inspector Murison to arrange for the purchase of a new hot water boiler, to replace the present old boiler, which has become badly pitted and is unfit for further service.\n\nA.

Hill,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 14th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your 99-16 of the 31st ultimo, enclosing sketch and estimated cost of a proposed new engine room and heated garage for the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School.\n\nNo funds have been specifically provided for this purpose in our appropriation for the current fiscal year. The Department has, however, provided $400 for alterations to the barn and $300 for miscellaneous repairs, or a total of $700. Owing to the reduction in our appropriation, this is the only amount that can be allowed for the Onion Lake C. E. Residential School this year. If the Principal would prefer to erect the proposed addition at a cost of $590., the Department is prepared to consider this matter favourably on the understanding that its cost would be taken out of the $700 provided in the current year's Estimates.\n\nPlease discuss the matter further with him and advise me in order that the Principal's request may receive further consideration.\n\nWould the expenditure be less if an addition was built sufficient to enlarge the engine room but without providing a heated garage? The Department doubts the necessity of building the latter.\n\nYou should direct the attention of the Principal to the fact that the Department's appropriation has been reduced and, consequently, only expenditures that are absolutely necessary can be considered.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

(St. Anthony's) and the Onion Lake Church of England Indian Residential Schools.\n\nThe Department owns both these schools. The St. Anthony's (R.C.) School was erected during the fiscal year 1927-28. The Church of England School was erected during the fiscal year 1925-26.\n\nThese schools are located on reserves, and the Church Authorities did not possess ownership in the buildings that were in use previous to the erection of the new schools.\n\nAttached hereto are statements, showing the total cost of buildings and the furnishings, equipment, and repairs carried out during each fiscal year since these schools were erected.\n\nNo painting has been done to the exterior of the St. Anthony's (R.C.) School since the building was erected. Funds were provided to have the exterior of the school painted in the summer of 1936, but the Principal of the School and the Church Authorities requested that the funds be utilized, instead, in repairing water and fire protection services.\n\nThe exterior of the Church of England School building and the outbuildings were painted during the summer of 1930 and in the summer of 1936.\n\nEncl.\n\nSgd. H. W. McTire\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOnion Lake Agency\n\nOffice of Indian Agent\n\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nOctober 20, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to your 115-1-5,\nof September 26, 1935, which authorized the\nappointment of a night watchman at each of the\nIndian Residential Schools here, from October 15, 1935,\nto April 15, 1936, at a wage of $40.00 per month.\n\nAssuming that this is now routine, I instructed\neach principal to place a man on duty on the 15th\ninstant. This was done and I trust that it will\nmeet with the Department's approval and confirm-\nation.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 28, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant, the Department approves your action in arranging for a night watchman at the Onion Lake C. E. Residential School and the Onion Lake R. C. Residential School for the period October 15th, 1936, to April 15th, 1937, at a wage of $40.00 a month each. The usual vouchers should be forwarded from your office.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. B. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nDr. J. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit the following with reference to the semi-Deisel engine that was shipped from the Makhorn Indian Residential School, Manitoba, to the C. of R. Indian Residential School, Onion Lake. The engine is now installed in its new building in Onion Lake, but it arrived in bad condition and the following repairs are needed: The head of combustion chamber is cracked and should be replaced by a new one together with a new gasket. The air suction valve also needs replacement. The relief valve requires grinding. The stuffing box on the water pump should be welded, and the cooling tanks need repairs. In addition the following parts are missing: exhaust pipe, 10', burner bracket, burner bracket support, burner shield, heating torch, thermometer and the fittings for connecting cooling tanks. A new pulley will be required to adapt generator speed to the speed of engine installed. It is estimated that the cost of replacing the missing parts, making the necessary repairs, purchasing the new pulley, together with the labour involved in overhauling and fitting parts, would be approximately $150.00. I would be pleased to receive authority to purchase the pieces referred to and to make the necessary repairs. Apart from the above the engine is in good condition and should give complete satisfaction.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 17, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, informing the Department of the repairs and parts that will be needed for the semi-Diesel engine that was shipped from the Elkhorn Indian Residential School for use at the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may incur an expenditure of approximately $160.00 in supplying the new parts required and in having the equipment placed in a satisfactory condition. It is hoped, when the repairs are completed, that the engine will give entire satisfaction. Please obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of placing the engine in good condition. These accounts, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nDr. J. T.

(RG 10, Volume 6322, file 658-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 318, amounting to $102.54 in favour of Fairbanks-Morse Co., Ltd., Winnipeg, Man., for Rentire for semi-Diesel Engine, C. of E. Indian Res., School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 115-1-5, dated November 17, 1936.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 518\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to your 116-1-5, of July 24th, which authorized the expenditure of $976.35, for the erection of a building and the installing of an engine and generator at the C. of R. Indian Residential School. The above amount proved to be more than enough for the purposes for which it was intended, but not sufficient for the extra voucher, No. 100, of Oct. 7, for $24.00 made against it for repairs to generator. The generator in use at this school had suddenly ceased to function early in September and I had it repaired immediately, and assuming that the $976.35 would take care of the work with the other work to be done, I put through a voucher on the above authority. In this I was mistaken and in my explanation for exceeding the amount by $65.42.\n\nThe authority asked for on November 8th for $160.00 and conceded in your 116-1-5, of the 19th instant, for supplying missing and extra parts for the semi-Diesel engine is proving insufficient as the last purchase from Messrs Fairbanks-Morse Co., cost us $60.00 more than we had anticipated. Consequently the total cost of this will be $120.00. The installation of this engine is now completed. It is running perfectly and giving complete satisfaction.\n\nHot Water Boiler. A new hot water boiler to replace an old one at this school was forwarded by Inspector Murison and had to be installed, as it was beyond the capabilities of the school staff. I got the crew working on the new building to do the work. The old boiler had to be taken out, and, owing to its weight, 600 pounds, and location in the building, proved a difficult and expensive operation. It was situated close to and parallel with the outer wall, at an elevation of eight feet, and was supported by vertical gas piping. A strong scaffold had to be built on which to turn it, and two windows with their frames had to be removed to permit its exit, and replaced after the new boiler was placed in position. In addition, the fittings and connections on the new boiler were different from those on the old, and some expense was involved in procuring the extra fitting, etc. The cost for this work was $47.15, and I would be pleased to receive authority to issue vouchers for this amount.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 9th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, enclosing vouchers in payment of repairs to Diesel engine at the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection, it is necessary to request the Fairbanks-Morse Company Limited, Winnipeg, to forward a receipt for express charges on shipment of part of material used in carrying out the repairs. When this receipt is received, payment of the account will be made.\n\nRegarding the installing of the hot water boiler, it is noted that it was necessary to obtain some extra fittings and connections and that other expense was involved in installation, to a cost of $47.15. You may forward vouchers in triplicate, properly certified, covering this expenditure, when payment will be made. If there are any charges for freight or express, you should see that proper receipts accompany the vouchers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\n\nDr. J. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, December 9th, 1936.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your account dated September 18th, last (your file No. E 6595) amounting to $17.42, for material supplied to the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School, Lloydminster, Sask.\n\nThis account, a copy of which is enclosed, contains an item of $1.00 for express - Edmonton to Winnipeg. Before the account can be paid, it will be necessary for you to attach to the enclosed a receipt in payment of the express charges to the amount mentioned.\n\nI would request that you give this matter prompt attention and, when same is received, payment of this account, as well as the accounts covering the cost of other material supplied to a total amount of $102.54, will be made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Hill, Indian Agent, Onion Lake, Sask., has forwarded to the Department a letter from the Principal of the Onion Lake C. E. Residential School requesting us to supply a new set of 13 plate Storage Batteries - fifty-six in number with a 240 ampere hour capacity.\n\nThe battery at present in the school was supplied in February, 1932. It is a A.H. ironclad battery and cost $625. Our Appropriation for the current fiscal year is completely assigned, and it is, therefore, impossible to favourably consider supplying a new battery at the present time.\n\nOn the occasion of your next visit to the Onion Lake Agency, I would appreciate your inspecting the battery, with a view to determining whether the school authorities have given it the proper attention. In the event of your considering that new batteries should be supplied by the Department, you should let me know if you consider that we should supply as expensive a set as was furnished in 1932. Possibly a suitable battery could be secured at a more reasonable figure. In any event, it will not be possible to consider replacement of the battery until the new fiscal year, which, as you know, commences on April 1st.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hossy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nSASKATOON,\n\nNovember 25, 1936.\n\nReverend H. Ellis,\nPrincipal, Anglican Indian School,\nLloydminster, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Ellis:\n\nAt the request of our Mr. Harry Leonard of the Electric Shop of Lloydminster, I am submitting herewith a quotation on a Walk-In Refrigerator complete with Frigidaire equipment suitable for your school at Onion Lake.\n\nYou will possibly recall that Mr. Leonard and I visited your school some two years ago, and discussed with you at that time, suitable frigidaire equipment for your requirements, but recommended the operation of this equipment by Electric power only. Since that time, however, in conjunction with the manufacturers of Gasoline engines, we have developed a Gasoline Engine that is specially adapted for working such as you have, and in the quotation that we are submitting for your consideration you will note we are recommending the substitution of a Gasoline Engine as Motive power, replacing the Electric motor. Our reason for doing this is that we appreciate the fact that you are compelled to develop your Electric energy by an isolated plant and employ Storage Batteries as an auxiliary. Therefore, employing the Gasoline Engine that we are recommending to you and knowing its efficiency as we do, we believe that you can attain a highly satisfactory and economical performance.\n\nWith this information before us, we are submitting here with a quotation, namely:\n\nWe will supply you with one only Walk-in Refrigerator, 5\u00bd feet wide, 9 feet long and 8 feet high, outside measurements. The insulation to be used would be 2 inches of Cork Board set in hot hydroline and faced with wax treated insulating paper. The Refrigerator, as on our former quotation will be in sections making a portable. This Refrigerator is to have one Walk-in Door, 24\" wide x 72\" high. The door is to be equipped with Refrigerator hardware of sufficient strength to carry this door for a\nThe H. H. Ashdown Hardware Co. Limited\n\nlong period of time and also offset. The door will be equipped with Wire Gaskets. In our former quotation, we did not specify Service doors, but these will be included if you so desire.\n\nTo refrigerate this job, we would employ the use of one only WX 1476 Diamond Fin Cooling coil. The coil would be 78\" long, 14\" wide and 7\" high, complete with one only TS Automatic expansion valve. The compressor that would be used is one only Model 2C genuine Frigidaire Compressor 21\u00bd\" wide, 28\" long and 19-1/8\" high. This compressor is one of our latest models and has given sufficient economical service on the field for the past three or four years that we have no hesitation in guaranteeing results to you.\n\nRe Gas Engine Drive. We would supply you with one only Villiers Century Gasoline Engine, two cycle with a speed range from 12 to 1800 R.P.M., and as stated previously this would be used as Motive power in replacing the Electric Motor.\n\nWe will supply the above equipment and install same complete on the following contract terms, as follows:\nCash $153.00. Balance $27.25 per month for 24 months.\nThe price quoted is F.O.B. Lloydminster but does not include carriage from Lloydminster to your school.\n\nUnder separate cover we are mailing you information of a general nature on Refrigeration and descriptive advertising.\n\nIf after reading this letter, there is any further information that we could give you, do not hesitate to write us.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE J.H. ASHDOWN HARDWARE COMPANY. LIMITED\n\n(sgd) C.A. Woodley\n\nCAW/H FRIGIDAIRE DEPARTMENT\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Principal of our Onion Lake School has written to our Commission pointing out the need of Frigidaire equipment for this institution. He states that this equipment \"is absolutely essential where quantities of beef have to be kept frozen during the warm and hot months of the year. We have never been able to keep food in proper condition as soon as spring comes, even though we put up over forty tons of ice. The building is too warm to keep meat over three days.\"\n\nIn your letter to me on September 4th, 1934, No.115-1-5 you stated that when the estimates for the next fiscal year were being prepared, consideration would be given to this need. Apparently the matter received your careful consideration, for you wrote to me on March 21st, 1935 (No.115-1-5) and stated that no funds were provided to cover the cost of this equipment. You also stated that it was not the policy of the Department to install electric refrigeration in schools where electric power for the operation of the same was not obtained from the power companies' lines.\n\nThe Rev. Principal Ellis has furnished our Commission with the enclosed quotation from the J. H. Ashdown Hardware Co. of Saskatoon, and it will be appreciated by our Commission if you will again give further consideration to this important need, and take whatever steps you may be able to supply the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, February 8th, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, pointing out the need of refrigeration equipment at the Onion Lake C. E. Indian Residential School.\n\nRecently, we received a report indicating that it will probably be necessary to supply a new set of batteries at this school in the near future. Inspector Robertson has been directed to make a special report regarding the batteries and, on receipt of his reply, the Department will know definitely whether or not new batteries are needed.\n\nOur appropriation for the current fiscal year is assigned and, at the present time, we are not in a position to state what funds will be available for repairs and equipment at residential schools during the next fiscal year. In view of these circumstances and the further fact that it will probably be necessary to supply batteries, the question of purchasing a Frigidaire for this school will have to remain in abeyance. However, your request for this equipment will be kept in mind when funds are available.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. T.B.R.

The Plant is fitted with a Shunt Wound Generator, and Batteries are provided to give sufficient current for lighting the average number of lamps in use at any one time for 15 hours on one full charge; which would be equivalent to about 20 hours' work during the summer months. The Plant would, therefore, be required to charge the batteries for about six hours every other day during the summer months, and for about nine hours every other day during the remainder of the year. This is the most satisfactory basis of calculation as a larger battery would suffer through insufficient work during the summer, and a smaller battery through overwork during the winter. A switch is provided for starting the Plant from the battery with the minimum consumption of current.\n\nVOLTAGE\n\nBattery Charging Plants are manufactured for four voltage ranges:\n\n(a) 6-24 V.\u2014This is intended for use with 13 cell, 6 Volt plant.\n(b) 12-48 V.\u2014This is intended for use with 19 cells, in small installations, up to 1-5 k.w.\n(c) 30-73 V.\u2014This is the usual voltage for small plants up to 2-25 k.w. in Europe.\n(d) 110-220 V.\u2014This is the usual voltage for larger plants.\n\n(It is advisable to specify 110 volts where long cable runs are involved.)\n\nWILL MEET YOUR EVERY REQUIREMENT...\n\nDIRECT LIGHTING PLANTS\n\nFor buildings or residences used only at intervals, such as Churches, Institutes, Clubs, Factories and similar buildings where the total number of lamps installed are generally all in use at the same time, we recommend a Direct Lighting Plant.\n\nThis type of Plant supplies current direct to the lamps, and heavy balanced flywheels are fitted to ensure steady, flickerless lights. Compound Wound Generators are incorporated, and these maintain a practically constant voltage under varying loads.\n\nDirect Lighting Plants are arranged for hand starting. Petrol Plants can be stopped by means of a Magneto Earthing Switch placed at any convenient position in the building.\n\nVOLTAGE\n\nDIRECT LIGHTING Plants can be supplied for any standard voltage up to 250.\n\nALTERNATIVE FUELS\n\nKEROSENE (Paraffin).\n\nKerosene-engined Plants can be supplied in place of petrol-engined Plants without extra charge.\n\n'DIESEL' FUEL.\n\n'Diesel'-engined \"Lister-Light\" Plants run on cheap fuel oil. The engines start immediately from \"stone cold\" on the fuel on which they run, without the use of any form of external ignition or pre-heating device. They can be arranged for either hand starting or for electric starting, and are as easy to start and simple to operate as the Lister Petrol Engines. Cheap fuel oils of many kinds are available in all the principal markets of the world.\n\nThe calorific value of the fuel oil for a Lister 'Diesel' Engine should be 19,000 B.Th.U.'s and its viscosity should not exceed 50 seconds Redwood at 100\u00b0 F.\nset the highest standard yet reached. From design to delivery they are entirely British; manufactured by a firm of Engineers established in 1867, and having a household name for initiative, enterprise and efficiency.\n\nThe main features of these plants are absolute reliability and unusual simplicity\u2014their low running costs commend them to occupiers of all kinds of residences, from the small bungalow to the largest country house. They are well adapted for Church lighting and similar buildings. Hundreds have been installed in this country and overseas\u2014even tariff walls have failed to keep them out: a striking testimony to their dependability.\n\nTO SELECT YOUR PLANT.\n\nTHE TYPE OF PLANT most suitable for your requirements will be apparent after reading the descriptions overleaf of the TYPES of plants available. (Note voltages). Having decided on your TYPE of Plant, next determine the size.\n\nTHE SIZE OF PLANT is governed in the case of\n\n(a) DIRECT LIGHTING PLANTS, by the total number of lamps you propose to install.\n\n(b) BATTERY CHARGING PLANTS, by the average number of lamps likely to be in use at any one time.\n\nSelect the paragraph above\u2014(a) or (b)\u2014corresponding to your TYPE of Plant, and guided by the information given, fix YOUR NUMBER of lamps.\n\nNow find in the corresponding Table below\u2014(a) or (b)\u2014the column headed LAMPS. In this column find the number nearest YOUR NUMBER of lamps. To the left and right of this NUMBER will be found SIZE and other particulars relating to the PLANT suitable for your requirements.\n\nNote.\u2014In selecting a Plant as described above, due allowance must be made for any additional load, such as Vacuum Cleaners, Radiators, Kettles, etc.\n### IMPORTANT NOTE\n\nBatteries of larger sizes than those listed here are available and can be supplied if required. Particulars of these will be sent on request.\n\n### (a) DIRECT LIGHTING PLANTS\n\n| Type No. | K.W.

H. Aitken writes:\n\n\"It gives me much pleasure in recording my entire satisfaction with the 1\u00bd K.W. Lister-Light Plant installed at this hotel two months ago.\n\nThe Lister has been admirably suited at this altitude, and although near the plant, has been installed 100 yards distant from the hotel, the exhaust is inaudible, and the engine itself remarkably silent.\n\nThe low fuel consumption, coupled with its simple design throughout and absence of any \"clockwork\" cannot fail to make the LISTER a most attractive lighting set, while its simplicity with ease of operation, maintenance, cleaning, charging and re-fuelling, should appeal to the non-technical user.\n\nThe excellence of this British production confirms my belief acquired from long engineering experience in both India and East Africa (Uganda, Kenya and Tanganyika), that it ever spoke British Engineers still lead the world; that it pays to buy British every time.\"\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd). J. H. AITKEN.\nYOU CAN HAVE CHEAP ELECTRICITY ANYWHERE\n\nThe repeated choice of Lister-Light Plants for places far from the beaten track, where any breakdown might be disastrous, is testimony to their reliability. Thousands have been installed the world over, and many a mansion, homestead, farm, cottage, cinema, hospital or other institution, is relying exclusively on a Lister-Light Diesel Plant for its electric light and power. The use of the Lister Diesel Engine for these plants cuts generating costs to a minimum.\n\nDIESEL\n\nDIRECT CURRENT PLANTS\n\n| K.W. | Output | Tank Cooled | Radiator Cooled | Voltage | No. of 25 Watt Lamps | Tank Cooled | Radiator Cooled | Engine | Flywheels | Max. |\n|------|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------|---------------------|-------------|-----------------|--------|----------|------|\n| 1.6  | 1.5    | 50 73       | 64              | 60      | 3 b.h.p.            | 25          | 31              |        |          |      |\n| 2.75 | 2.5    | 110 162     | 110             | 100     | 5 b.h.p.            | 25          | 31              |        |          |      |\n| 4    | 4.5    | 110 162     | 200             | 180     | 9 b.h.p.            | 26          | 4               |        |          |      |\n| 8    | 7.5    | 110 162     | 320             | 300     | 18 b.h.p.           | 18          | 6               |        |          |      |\n\nALTERNATING CURRENT PLANTS\n\ncan be offered incorporating Lister Diesel Engines, and are available in a range of sizes from 3.5 k.w. to 32 k.w.

It has proved itself in all climates, from Alaska to Ceylon, and for all purposes, from driving Rice Hullers to Pumps, etc.\n\nEspecially is it to be found where the work is hard and the hours are long, where costs must be next to nothing and an engine is left almost to look after itself.\n\nIt stands up to its most arduous job; starts from cold with a few turns of the crank; runs day and night for nothing more than refuelling and gets the last ounce of power out of the fuel which is put into it. In every way it justifies its position as the premier small power unit of the world.\n\nGreenland\n38 h.p. Diesel driving Road Making Plant.\n\nNew York City\n18 h.p.

The question of the necessary heat for ignition is a comparatively small one after the engine has been running for a while as the successive explosions create considerable heat in the castings. At the start however, this heat has to be supplied, and it is supplied in a Lister engine by cutting off the small auxiliary chamber, thus reducing the total size of the combustion chamber, and very greatly increasing the degree of compression of the gases in the cylinder head to a point where the heat thus generated is sufficient to cause combustion. After starting, a turn of the hand-wheel removes the plug from the aperture, and the size of the combustion chamber is increased by opening up the auxiliary chambers. The pressure is thus reduced to that necessary for maximum efficiency and maximum fuel economy when running under load.\n\nThe engines operate on the 4-stroke cycle principle, are totally enclosed, and are normally supplied for hand-starting, but can be supplied, if required, at an extra price for compressed air starting, electric starting, or remote\n\n---\n\n**Type 3/1 Single Cylinder**\n\nA Diesel Engine of the smallest power, greatly increasing the scope for the application of Diesel engines, especially in the Agricultural field.

It was all full of pin holes and incapable of holding water nor could it be repaired.\n\nAt that time I stated that the cistern was useless and should be replaced but gave no authority to have it done. On my recent visit to Onion Lake Dr. Hill informed me that the cistern had been replaced. I drew his attention to the fact that no authority had been given to have this done. I, at the same time, advised him to forward the vouchers and I would submit them.\n\nThere is no question about the necessity of this work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIn a letter just received from the Rev. H. Ellis, Principal of our Onion Lake School, he earnestly requests that the attention of your Department be directed to the urgent need of a frigidaire system for this School.\n\nYou will recall that this need was the subject of correspondence at the beginning of last year (see your letter, Feb. 8, 1937, No. 115-1-5). At that time, however, the need of new batteries for the lighting plant at this School was considered of greater urgency, and as funds were not available to meet both needs, the batteries were provided.\n\nAlong with my letter to you on Feb. 5th, 1937, I sent a quotation from the J.H. Ashdown Hardware Co.; Ltd., Saskatoon, and the Rev. Principal Ellis recommends that their quotation be accepted. The size of the Walk-In Refrigerator recommended is 5\u00bd feet wide, 9 feet long, and 8 feet high, and the cost f.o.b. Lloydminster is estimated at approximately $800.00.\n\nWhile the School has put up approximately 50 tons of ice for summer use, the Principal states that it is impossible, even with this, to keep meat from getting tainted.\n\nI commend this urgent need to your early and sympathetic consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTBRW/KH\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa,\nMay 12, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 9th instant with reference to a request that you have received from the Principal of the Onion Lake C. E. Residential School for a frigidaire system and it is noted that the Principal estimates the cost at $600.00\n\nIn preparing our appropriation for the current fiscal year it was found possible to include an amount of $600.00 only for repairs, improvements and new equipment at the Onion Lake C. E. School. The present set up of the appropriation does not permit our exceeding the amount specifically provided.\n\nWould it not be possible for Mr. Ellis to review this matter with a view to recommending equipment the cost of which would come within the amount provided? In that event full particulars and catalogue numbers should be supplied in order that the details may be given to our Purchasing Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission,\nM.S.C.C.,\nThe Bible House,\n184 Alexander Ave. East,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nLLOYDMINSTER, SASK.\n\n6th May 1938\n\nDr. J. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Dr. Hill:\n\nI herewith ask the Department to authorize at this time the following expenditure to renovate the interior of our school.\n\nMaterials:\n- 30 gallons Flat White Paint $127.50\n- 5 gallons Ivory 21.50\n- 5 gallons sizing 15.00\n- 1 gallon Black Paint 4.25\n\nExtra Labour 50.00\n\nFor the past twelve years there has been no appropriation allowed for the upkeep of the interior; therefore, I think you will agree that our request is not unreasonable.\n\nIt would be appreciated if the Department will give favourable consideration at this time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a communication from the Rev. H. Ellis, Principal of the Onion Lake C. of R. Indian Residential School, requesting paint for the interior of the school.\n\nAs stated, there has been no painting done on the interior since the school was built and the paint asked for would add much to its appearance.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nMay 17, 1938.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 9th instant enclosing letter received from the Principal of the Onion Lake C.E. Residential School requesting to be supplied with paint.\n\nIn preparing our appropriation for the current fiscal year it was found possible to include an amount of $600.00 only for repairs, improvements and new equipment at the Onion Lake C.E. School. Recently we received a letter from Rev. T.B.R. Westgate, Secretary, Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C., requesting us to supply a frigidaire at the Onion Lake C.E. School at an estimated cost of $800.00. We replied to Doctor Westgate by advising him of the amount available in the current year's appropriation and suggesting that he review the request of Mr. Ellis in the hope that the latter would suggest equipment coming within the amount that is provided.\n\nThe present set up of our appropriation does not permit our exceeding the amount specifically provided for any Residential School and consequently until a final decision is reached regarding the proposed frigidaire we feel that no other expenditure should be authorized. It might be well for you to show this letter to Mr. Ellis as quite possibly he has recently received a letter from Doctor Westgate.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.T.

We assure you that the price we would name, and the job we would install would be equal to anything on the market.\n\nThanks in the hope of being favored in due course.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRYAN BROTHERS LIMITED.\n\nPer\n\nQUOTATIONS SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.

Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Dr. Hill:\n\nI herewith enclose the original estimate for the proposed Frigidaire, from the Bruce Robinson Electric Co., of Edmonton.\n\nI would appreciate if you will expedite matters in the connection by having the same installed with the least possible delay.\n\nAs mentioned over the 'phone, it is impossible to keep our meat any length of time, even though we have made provision by putting up over 520 blocks of ice this year. The outside meat house cannot be brought down to a sufficient cooling temperature, hence the constant waste of meat.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your 115-1-5, of the 17th ultimo, re appropriation for the C. of E. Indian Residential School, for the current fiscal year.\n\nAs requested I showed Mr. Hill your letter and he decided that the frigidaire was almost indispensable as he has already lost a substantial quantity of fresh meat. I am enclosing an estimate of cost submitted by representative of Bruce Robinson Electric Co., Edmonton and Calgary, for complete installation, which is well within the amount allotted to the School. Under the circumstances I would recommend that the frigidaire be given preference over the other work that was intended which was principally interior painting and is not nearly so urgent.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I am unable to give you an estimate of the total expenditure involved, but from the information I have received, am inclined to think that it will not exceed $50.00.\n\nIf you will kindly authorize this expenditure and the transfer of the generator, our Commission will meet any cost in excess of the amount I have specified.\n\nA prompt reply will oblige.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBRW/KH\nOttawa,\nDecember 13, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 8th instant with reference to transferring the electric light generator surplus to requirements at the Elkhorn school to the Onion Lake C.E.

We will allow an amount not exceeding $50.00 to cover the cost of transferring the machine and its installation at Onion Lake.\n\nAs part of the amount allowed by the Department will include freight charges it will be necessary, when forwarding the voucher, to attach a receipt from the freight company.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

This teacher will take charge of the Senior Grades and Miss Sherstone will have charge of the Intermediate Grades. I have instructed the Principal to apply through the local Indian Agent for the necessary classroom equipment for the third room, and I trust that this may be granted promptly by your Department. The appointment of the third teacher will surely place all the classroom work on a satisfactory basis. Although the third teacher has not yet been appointed our Commission have in view for this position a fully qualified and experienced person.\n\n(Sgd.) T.B.R.

The night watchman reports having visited the building at 5:30 a.m. to replenish the fire in a coal stove that heats it, and upon his return at 7:45, found the building in flames.

An estimate of the cost of material to replace the building as it was previously with two thicknesses of boards on the outside and one on the inside, together with a brick chimney, double doors, etc., is $150.00; and the labour in connection, $85.00.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Indian Residential School - February 6th, 1939.\n\nI have to report that on Monday the 6th inst., the pump house 10' x 16' on the lake shore was demolished by fire, caused, I believe, through an overheated stove.\n\nThe night-watchman visited this building at 5:30 a.m. and before leaving placed a small quantity of coal in the stove.\n\nAt 7:45 a.m. Mr. Stoddart went down to the pump house in order to start the pump for the use of the Laundry. Owing to the intense heat and smoke he was not able to get into the building.\n\nThe alarm was immediately raised by Mr. Stoddart and eight hand extinguishers were taken down. Three of these, however, failed to fully work. Had we had more extinguishers we might have been able to have saved the building, as it appeared at one time that we had the fire under control. Not being able to obtain water, in spite of throwing snow inside and on to the roof, the fire made headway. We then started to save the machinery. Snow was thrown into the building two to three feet high to cover the pump and the gasoline engine.\n\nWe then began to tear the building down to prevent the intense heat from damaging the equipment.\n\nHaving cleared the debris away, a tent was placed over the machinery and a stove was put in, thus saving the water system from freezing up.\n\nAll night a special attendant was detailed to start the engine every thirty minutes.\n\nToday arrangements are being made to erect a temporary single ply building to take the place of the one lost.\n\nIt was a wretched day, being about 14 degrees below zero with a strong north-west wind blowing.\n\nThis morning it was 40 degrees below zero. This intensive cold slows up considerably the work of getting things into running order again.\n\n(sgd) Henry Ellis,\nPrincipal.\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.\nSuperintendent Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWhile I am of the opinion that you will have received from the Indian Agent at Onion Lake an account of the destruction by fire of the pump house at our School on the Onion Lake Reserve, I have thought it well to furnish you with the enclosed statement from the Principal in this connexion.\n\nIn a letter written at a later date, Feb. 15th, the Reverend Principal Mills reports that failure of the three fire extinguishers to function might have been due to the contents being spilled on the way from the School to the Lake-shore, where the pump house was located, a distance of some two to three hundred yards. He further reports that a shiplap building $10' \\times 15' \\times 8'$ was being put up around the tent which had been erected over the engine and pump, but that, owing to the severity of the weather\u201440 to 50 below zero\u2014the work of building was very difficult.\n\nTo complete the building he states that some building paper, lumber for the siding, and shingles would be required, but does not give an estimate of the cost. As this is not likely to amount to a very great deal, it will be appreciated if you will authorize the Indian Agent to purchase the same so that the building may be completed with the least possible delay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa,\nMarch 24, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 16th instant with reference to the destruction by fire of the pump house at the Onion Lake C.E. school.\n\nThis matter was reported to us some weeks ago and the Indian Agent was instructed to forward detailed information regarding the material required to replace this building in order that it may be purchased by our Purchasing Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.

E. Indian Residential School. Immediately after the fire a tent was used to protect the pump and engine, but before I could communicate with the Department, the Reverend Mr. Ellis, proceeding on his own, purchased material, lumber, shingles, hardware, etc., costing approximately $80.00, and proceeded to erect a new building the same dimensions as the one destroyed. The building as it stands consists of two ply of lumber, and school boy labour was used exclusively. Another ply of lumber by way of lining is required to make it frost proof. A chimney, door, two windows and finishing material, as per requisition No. 378, at an estimated cost of $57.50, will also be needed. If school boys are available and capable to perform the work, Mr. Ellis has paid for the shingles and hardware ordered by him, but the bill for lumber, amounting to $60.15, remains unpaid. Will it be in order to issue vouchers in payment of lumber and to re-imburse Mr. Ellis?\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T.

E. Indian Residential School, the Purchasing Agent is being requested to secure the material mentioned on your requisition of the 24th ultimo, amounting to $57.80.\n\nYou may forward the account of $60.15 covering the cost of the lumber ordered by the Principal.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation an amount of $750.00 was provided for repairs and improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Onion Lake C.F.

However, no further expenditures can be authorized until you supply the information requested in my letter of the 22nd ultimo, regarding the new engine, as the cost of this will have to be charged against the balance remaining in our appropriation for the Onion Lake C.

As he keenly desires to have the new engine installed before the School reopens after the summer vacation, it will be appreciated if you will give this matter immediate attention.\n\nThe old engine which operated this equipment was formerly used to operate the lighting plant of the School. As it was not new when installed in the first place, and did not have sufficient power to handle the lighting plant, I do not think there can be any doubt whatever about the need of another engine to take its place.\n\nI am assuming that full particulars of the kind required have already been submitted to you through the local Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBRW/KH\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have been in touch with this Division this morning and they have given me assurance that steps will be taken to purchase the engine immediately.\n\nA number of reports have reached me recently in respect to the delay in securing supplies for residential schools. This delay, in my humble judgment, is due to the new purchasing regulations which are somewhat unwieldy. When repairs or supplies are needed at an Indian residential school a request is usually sent to the Indian Agent who in turn sends it forward to his Inspector. The Inspector sends it forward to Ottawa with certain comments thereon. The requests are then carefully reviewed by the officials of this Division and sent forward to the Purchasing Division at the head office, the officers of which call for tenders and make the actual purchases. It has been my experience, however, that in most cases additional information is nearly always required by the Purchasing Division. This, of necessity, involves delay and causes a great deal of inconvenience. If it is the intention of the Churches to meet the Minister at any time in the immediate future this is one of the matters that might be very carefully reviewed.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate,\nSecretary, Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission,\n38-43 The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Ave. East,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nIf it is not the intention of the Churches to interview the Minister at any time in the immediate future it might be well, perhaps, for you to take the matter up with him yourself, bringing to his attention certain specific cases where delays have occurred in securing supplies.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

(RG 10, Volume 6322, file 658-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nNovember 7, 1939\n\nHon. T.A. Crerar,\nMinister of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Crerar:\n\nWhile I am deeply sensible of the heavy duties and equally heavy responsibilities resting on you at all times, and especially during the present critical period in the history of Canada and the Empire, there is one important matter which I feel strongly should have any personal consideration you may be able to give it.\n\nThis matter is the delay created through the new purchasing regulations in securing some very essential repairs or supplies for the Indian Residential Schools.\n\nAs one instance out of many which I might quote you, I may say that an engine was required at our Union Lake School to operate the laundry and bread-making equipment to take the place of the old engine, which had previously been used to operate the lighting plant, but was found not to have sufficient power for that purpose. The Principal forwarded his request for this item of equipment to the local Indian Agent on May 15th last and hoped to have it installed and working when the School reopened after the summer holidays. He wrote to me again in the matter on July 29th, on August 3rd, and on Sept. 11th, and I find from my files that the matter was duly referred to the officers of your Department and that they in turn had communicated with the Purchasing Division.\n\nAs the engine had not reached the School when the Principal wrote to me on Sept. 11th, and by which time\nthe School had reopened after the summer holidays, you will be able to understand the inconvenience to which the School management was being subjected through this delay.\n\nSo far as I am able to understand the situation all Principals submit their requests to the local Indian Agent, the Indian Agent forwards the same to the Inspector, and he in turn sends them on to the officials concerned at Ottawa. After the officials have carefully considered them, all requests accepted are sent forward to the head office of the Purchasing Division. If the process ended there, and I myself can see no reason why it should not end there, many delays might be avoided, but, it would appear that the Purchasing Division does not always accept the endorsement of a Departmental official and the matter is referred back for further information, which means that the whole lengthy process has to be repeated, with inevitable delays, similar to the one I have mentioned.\n\nAs my purpose in writing this letter is not one of criticism but rather as a means of having some improvement effected in this department of Government service, I will be very grateful for any consideration you may be able to find time to give to the same.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa,\nNovember 15, 1939.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn your letter of July 3 last you recommended that the Department purchase a new engine for use at the Onion Lake C.E. residential school.\n\nA complaint has been made to the Department that the Principal brought this matter to your attention on May 15. Please let me know on what date your records show the Principal advised you of the necessity of a new engine. If he forwarded his request on May 15 please let me know why you delayed writing to the Department until July 3.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. J. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nDear Dr. Westgate,\n\nIn the absence in England of my Minister, Mr. Crerar, I am replying to your letter of the 7th instant. You expressed the view that the departmental purchasing regulations are somewhat cumbersome and cited the case of an order for an engine required at the Onion Lake School. I don't believe you are in possession of full details of this transaction. The department at Ottawa did not hear anything about this until July 11th when the Agent's letter of the 3rd idem was received. He did not furnish sufficient information on which to place an order and was asked on the 22nd of the same month to supply it. His reply dated August 1st was received on the 15th of the month and a requisition forwarded to the Purchasing Agent on the 17th. Tenders were invited and the order placed on September 26th.\n\nCompetition is necessary in connection with the placing of government orders and it is certainly most advisable that competitive bids be obtained.\n\nYou will see that the delay in this instance might be placed in a small degree only on the Purchasing Division, and delays of this kind will be reduced as departmental agents are educated to the necessity of supplying full details. The department must be able to determine the necessity for an article ordered, whether it is the most suitable for the work to be performed, and whether others handling or manufacturing similar goods are entitled to compete for the business. An extra man was placed on Indian Affairs purchasing late in the summer and this should help to cut down the time necessary to deal with requisitions submitted by that branch.\n\nReverend T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nIndian & Eskimo Residential School Commission,\nThe Bible House,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nThe purchasing regulations were not established until the necessity for exercising a greater measure of central control became apparent, and it is believed they are serving reasonably well the purpose for which they were set up.\n\nI might add that we were pleased to receive your letter and will welcome constructive criticism at any time. We are all working to the same end in the Indian work. We do, however, have to be careful in government purchases perhaps a good deal more than people not in the Service realize. If any other case comes to your attention where you consider there has been undue delay in making purchases we will be pleased to hear from you. I feel, however, that there should be no cause for delay now, provided full information is furnished when the request for a purchase is made.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) W.J.F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your 115-1-5, of the 15th instant, re engine, C. of E. School.\n\nWe have no written request from the Rev. H. Ellis in connection with the engine on our office file. Many of his requests are verbal, usually by phone, and if I remember rightly, the one in connection with the engine was.\n\nHowever, when I received the information I visited the school, inspected the engine, which I found beyond repair, and took immediate action as I considered it an emergency.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Normally its capacity is 2500 gallons per hour, and two hours pumping gave a daily supply, but since the fire the time required for pumping has increased monthly until now, when thirteen hours pumping are required for a day's supply, and it is likely to quit entirely in the near future.\n\nIt is a Fairbanks-Morse production and apparently they do not stock repairs for it.

Indian Residential School at a cost not to exceed $60.00. The information given in my letter of December 15th, re cost, has proved to be faulty. The principal of the school, Rev. H. Ellis, told me that the pump required was a Fairbanks-Morse production and its cost was between $50.00 and $60.00. Upon receipt of the authority I requested Mr. Ellis to make the purchase, stating the amount available for the purpose. He proceeded, and the pump is now installed, but instead of being between the figures above stated, its cost was $191.64.\n\nMr. Ellis obviously did not follow instructions, but he apparently accepted its delivery without knowing the cost. However, the pump was an emergency and had to be purchased. There is still an unexpended balance of $104.91, of the current year's appropriation provided for repairs and improvements at this school. Will it be in order to forward a voucher in payment.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Hill\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 24, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant regarding the pump purchased for the Onion Lake C.E. Residential School.\n\nOur funds are so limited that it will not be possible to consider paying a larger amount than that authorized; namely, $60.00. The balance of the cost of the pump will have to be paid by the school management from their funds.\n\nI cannot understand why you did not purchase the pump yourself. In that event you would have been advised of its cost before it was placed in the school and you could have written to the Department for further authority. As you can understand it is impossible for the Department to administer funds if a greater amount is expended than the amount authorized. This is especially true at the present time when owing to conditions our appropriations are considerably reduced.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. J. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nR.A.

Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIn connexion with the enclosed account from the Canadian Fairbanks Morse Co. Ltd., of Winnipeg, for a pump for our Colon Lake Residential School, I trust that the copies or telegrams attached to the same may furnish all the assurance you require that the pump was ordered by our Commission on the understanding that payment for the same would be made by your Department.\n\nOn the same day (Dec. 11, 1939) that the Rev. Principal Ellis sent his first telegram, he wrote a letter which reads as follows:\n\n\"Anglican Indian Residential School,\nLloydminster, Sask.\nDec. 11, 1939.\"\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian & Eskimo Residential School Commission,\n43 The Bible House,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have telegraphed to you this morning asking that we be supplied immediately with a Canadian Fairbanks-Morse 2500 gallon capacity self-oiling Typhoon pump.\n\"I have taken up the matter with the local Indian Agent who will request authority from the Department at Ottawa to supply the same.\n\nAs we are without the facility of pumping water from the lake to the main school building for domestic purposes or for adequate fire protection, I have asked that the pump be sent to Lloydminster at once.\n\nWe intend to meet the train at Midnight tomorrow (Tuesday) and will install the pump as soon as it reaches here, thus preventing any further inconvenience at the school.\n\nThe old pump went through the fire last year, and though we have changed the gaskets and rubbers on the pistons, of late it has caused considerable inconvenience, hardly pumping 250 gals. per hour, until Saturday last it would not operate any more. Yesterday after pumping all day there was hardly 50 gallons that reached the main compression tank.\"\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd) Henry Ellis\n\nPrincipal.\n\nIn view of the urgent need of adequate fire protection, in addition to the water required for domestic purposes, our Commission feel justified in taking the action they did.\n\nIt was, however, their understanding that the authorization required was being secured through your representative, and I sincerely trust that the Departmental cheque may be issued with as little delay as possible to cover the enclosed bill from the Company which supplied the pump.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nEncs.\nTBRW/KH\nOttawa,\nFebruary 28, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 24th instant with reference to the pump purchased for use at the Onion Lake C.E. Residential School.\n\nIn a letter dated December 15, 1939, Indian Agent Dr. Hill reported to the Department that a new pump was required and could be secured at a cost of approximately $60.00. Authorization was given for this expenditure.\n\nDr. Hill wrote to the Department again in a letter dated January 15 stating that the Principal of the Onion Lake C.E. School had arranged for the purchase of the pump at a cost of $191.64, although Mr. Ellis had previously informed Dr. Hill that the pump would not cost more than $60.00.\n\nWe are prepared to pay the amount of $60.00 toward the cost of the pump but, as you can understand, it is impossible for the officials of the Department to administer funds if expenditures are incurred in an amount so greatly in excess of that requested. This is especially true at the present time when due to conditions of which you are aware it is quite likely that the amount available for repairs and improvements at Indian schools will be curtailed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission,\nM. S. C. C.,\n38-43 The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Ave. East,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have received your letter of the 28th ultimo No. 115-1-5, and regret the misunderstanding which must have arisen between the Principal of our Onion Lake School and the Indian Agent at that centre over the cost of the pump so urgently required and purchased at a greater cost than was originally estimated. If you will kindly furnish our Commission with the Department's cheque for the $60.00 you are willing to contribute towards the cost of this item of equipment, I will ask the members to contribute the balance of $131.64, and thus complete the payment of the bill in full.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW/WH\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa,\nMarch 8, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BAILEY\n\nIn December last the Principal of the Onion Lake C.E. Residential School advised the Department that it was necessary to secure a new pump immediately. This was required to pump water to the school and he stated that the pump then in use was apt to break down at any time. He estimated the cost of the new pump at $60.00.\n\nIn view of the emergency authority was given for local purchase of the pump and later the attached account amounting to $191.64 was submitted for our consideration. We advised the Principal that we could only consider payment of an amount of $60.00 and a letter recently received from the Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada stated that the school management would provide from their funds the balance of the cost of the pump.\n\nIt would, therefore, be appreciated if you would arrange for issuing a purchase order for the amount of $60.00 in order that we can pay our share of the cost of the pump.\n\nR.

We advised the Principal that we could only consider payment of an amount of $60.00 and a letter recently received from the Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada stated that the school management would provide from their funds the balance of the cost of the pump.\n\nIt would, therefore, be appreciated if you would arrange for issuing a purchase order for the amount of $60.00 in order that we can pay our share of the cost of the pump.\n\nR.

School\n\nIn the list of the requirements at our Society's Schools forwarded to you on Oct. 2nd last, a Globe Laundry washer was included for the above Residential School at an estimated cost of $375.00.\n\nI have recently received from the Principal of this School an urgent request that this item of equipment be supplied immediately, as the present washer, after many years of service, is now practically worn-out and is no longer safe to operate.\n\nIn the list of grants available for this School for the current fiscal year as given in Departmental letter of the 30th ult., No. 160-2, I note that the sum of $400.00 is available (for repairs and painting) and I will be glad to know if this amount could be applied towards the purchase of a new washer, (and the repairs and painting allowed to stand over for another year).\n\nThe Reverend Principal Willis has been in communication with Stanley Brook, Ltd., Winnipeg, and in a letter to him on the 19th inst. they make him the following offer:-\n\n\"One only 36\" x 54\" Canadian Globe Wood Washer, with new inside wooden cylinder and new outside wooden case; Belt-Driven; elevated header.\n\nThis washer is thoroughly rebuilt and in excellent shape, guaranteed free from workmanship defects for six months the same as a new machine. On this we quote you a price of $475.00, and we would allow you $25.00 for your old machine.\"\nIn the same letter Stanley Brock Ltd. mentioned that the above washer had been seen by Mr. C.W. Jackson, of your Department, and that he had made a memo of it as suitable for our Onion Lake School.\n\nI will be obliged if you will let me know by telegram or at your very earliest convenience, if you will authorize our Commission to purchase the above washer at a net cost of $450.00, on the understanding that our Commission will pay the carrying charges from Winnipeg to the School.\n\nYou will note that the old washer is to become the property of Stanley Brock Ltd., and they will be responsible for its removal from the School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nOttawa, July 29, 1941.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa.\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF:\n\nOnion Lake C.

August 1, 1941\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe: Need of Laundry Washer at Onion Lake C. of E. School\n\nSince writing to you on the 25th ult., re the above, I have received a letter from the Reverend Principal Ellis of this School, in which he points out that the sum of $400, which your Department is granting for repairs and painting at this School this year, will be required for that purpose. His letter reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"The main steps (outside entrance) and the steps to the chapel will have to be under-pinned this year, otherwise in both cases they will surely collapse. The uprights and supports are completely rotted off and are supported today by poles cased in. We also require storm doors for the outside entrances on both classrooms. It will cost all of the $400.00 allowed. These items of repairs have already been taken up with the local Indian Agent; hence the amount allowed by the Department should not be diverted.\"\n\nIn view of the urgent need of the washer, I am writing to ask that every effort possible be made to provide it, in addition to the $400, already sanctioned for repairs and painting. Should the purchase be made in Ottawa, the Principal requests that it be shipped to Frenchman Butte, Sask.\n\nYour prompt and sympathetic consideration of this important matter will be deeply appreciated by our Commission, as well as by the Onion Lake School management.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTRBW/KH\nMr. D.H. Cameron,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Cameron:\n\nI herewith ask the Department to furnish our School with a new laundry washing machine, in time for the re-opening after vacation. The present one, which has had constant use since 1926 is now completely rotted out, so that a new one will be required at once.\n\nFor your information, I mentioned this in my inventory list recently presented to the Department.\n\nIt is possible that we will be able to obtain a re-conditioned machine ranging in price from $500.00 to $750.00, in the meantime I will endeavour to have prices submitted with the least possible delay.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6322, file 658-5, part 8)\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a letter from the Reverend Principal of the Onion Lake C. of E. Indian Residential School, requesting a new washing machine for the laundry of that institution.\n\nOn the 17th instant I inspected the old machine still in use and found it in very poor condition; and would recommend that a new or re-conditioned one be supplied.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDonald H. Cameron,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 7, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, with reference to expenditures at the Onion Lake C. E. School.\n\nAs you were previously informed, an amount of $400.00 only was provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements and the purchase of new equipment at this school. In your letter of July 25th you requested that the amount provided be used towards the purchase of a new washer and that the repairs and painting be allowed to stand over for another year. As a result of this request, the Purchasing Agent was asked to secure a washer and I believe has already placed the order. This means that there is only available a balance of $25.00 from the amount specifically provided for the Onion Lake C. E. School this year. However, in view of the urgent request of the Principal, it has been found possible to allot a further amount of $100.00 for repairs at this school. This means that a total amount of $125.00 will be available. I am communicating with the Indian Agent with a view to having him discuss the matter with the Principal and decide what can be done with the amount that can be spent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nIndian & Eskimo Res. School Comm., M.S.C.C.,\n38-43 The Bible House, 184 Alexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nOttawa, August 7, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 31st ultimo, the Department had previously received a communication from the Reverend T.B.R. Westgate, Secretary, Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C., requesting us to purchase a re-conditioned washer at a cost of $375.00, for the Onion Lake C. E. Residential School. As you will note from the letter attached, this washer was to be supplied on the understanding that the repairs and improvements would be deferred until another year.\n\nDr. Westgate has again written the Department, pointing out that the Principal insists on certain repairs being made. However, when the washer is purchased there will be only $25.00 left out of the amount specifically provided for the Onion Lake School this year. We have a very small unallotted amount and from this we are taking the sum of $100, making a total of $125.00 which can be allowed for repairs and improvements at the Onion Lake C. E. School. It would be appreciated if you would immediately discuss the matter with the Principal and forward a requisition for the materials required, in order that purchase can be made through our Purchasing Branch. It is quite possible that the total amount can be used for the purchase of material and that the labour can be supplied by the school management.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\n\nMr. Donald H.

Principal Ellis requesting further details, but his absence on holiday will cause a delay in receiving this information.\n\nIn view of the need of the items 1, 2 and 3, he has listed, I have decided to send forward to you at once the attached copy of his letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBRW:A.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa,\nJuly 24, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, enclosing letter received from the Principal of the Onion Lake C.E. Residential School. As the information given in the Principal's letter is not sufficiently detailed for purchase to be made, I am communicating with the Indian Agent, in order to secure the desired information.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission,\nM. S. C. C.,\n38-43 The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Ave. East,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa,\nJuly 24, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI attach, for your information, a letter received from the Principal of the Onion Lake C.E. Residential School with reference to repairs and improvements that he considers necessary. For your information I may say that an amount of $400.00 was provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at this school.\n\nWith regard to the items mentioned in the Principal's letter, you should supply detailed information in order that the materials required can be purchased through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nWith regard to the request for a new set of batteries, you should state the date on which the present batteries were installed in the school, also their capacity and make.\n\nWhen replying you should return the Principal's letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. D.H. Cameron,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nWINNIPEG, MAN. August 4, 1942.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan: Re: Repairs, Improvements, etc. Onion Lake\n\nI received some time ago your letter of the 24th ultimo, No. 115-1-5, re the above, and although I have noted that you were writing direct to the Indian Agent at Onion Lake for more specific information, I have thought it might be helpful to you to have the enclosed letter from the Globalite Batteries Limited. There can be no doubt of the urgent need of the new batteries, and I greatly hope you may be able to supply them.\n\nThe other items mentioned in my letter of July 20 (Mr. Ellis' letter July 9) are also urgently needed, and if the $400.00 grant can be made available for some of them it will be a very great help. Precedence, however, should be given to the batteries.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBW: A.\n\nEnc.\nCopy sent to Mr. Cameron\n\nOttawa,\nAugust 7, 1942.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nYour letter of July 20 addressed to St. Barnabas' School, Diocese of Saskatchewan, Lloydminster, Sask., Attention: Rev. H. Ellis, has been forwarded to this office. Certain statements made in your letter to the Principal do not correspond with the information that we have on file. You state in your letter that the battery at present in the school was bought more than five years ago. As a matter of fact the invoice covering this battery was dated November 29, 1937, and consequently the battery has been in use less than five years. Your letter also suggests that a 210 A.H. battery be installed and you further state that the last battery was a 180 A.H. In order to keep the records clear I may say that the account we received stated that the battery at present in the school was a 168 A.H.\n\nThe previous set of batteries at this school had served for nine years. It would, therefore, appear that the battery at present in the school has not lasted as long as could reasonably be expected. Our experience is that Principals are, in many cases, more anxious to get new batteries than they are to devote time and effort to properly caring for the batteries they have.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGlobelite Batteries Limited,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nAugust 7, 1942.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to official letter of the 24th ultimo, with reference to the request for a new battery at the Onion Lake C.E. Residential School. For your information I am enclosing a copy of a letter which is being forwarded, today, to the Globelite Battery Company.\n\nYou will note from this that the battery at present in the school has been in use for less than five years, whereas the previous set had been used for nine. It is generally understood that these batteries should last at least seven years, if they are properly handled. As the present battery has apparently not lasted as long as we expect, it will be necessary, when replying to official letter of July 24, to state exactly why this condition has arisen.\n\nAn early reply to my letter of July 24 as well as this one would be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. D.H. Cameron,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n### MULTI-LIFE Woven Glass Mats\n\n(a) **MULTI-LIFE Woven Glass Mats** are placed on both sides of positive plates.

A. Hoey.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRef. File 115-1-5.\n\nWe have your letter of August 7th in connection with the battery at St. Barnabas School, Diocese of Saskatchewan. Our Detail Man, who visited the School on September 29, 1941, reported that the battery would be five years old in December, which is the reason for us stating that the battery was more than five years old.\n\nWe have since consulted our records and find that the battery was purchased November 29, 1937 and will be five years old this November.\n\nAt the time this battery was purchased it was known as our Type GD-15 168 Ampere Hours, guaranteed five years. This battery was replaced in 1939 and is now known as our Type GD-15 180 Ampere Hours. We have since adopted the new Dual Insulation consisting of Genuine Port Orford Cedar Separators and Multi-Life Woven Glass Mats which justifies the longer guarantee.\n\nWe would recommend and consider the proper installation our Type W-15 270 Ampere Hours Battery. However, the space that has been provided for the battery is not large enough to handle our W-15 Jars, hence the reason for recommending our Type GD-15 210 Ampere Hours which can be installed in the space provided.\n\nWe pointed out before that in order to take advantage of the Guarantee it is absolutely essential to buy a battery large enough to carry the load and complete information about selecting the proper size battery is shown on Page Three of our Price List enclosed.\n\nNow that so many of the Schools and Agencies are using Globelite Batteries we are endeavouring to inspect each installation at least once a year and help the operator in every way to get the maximum in life and service from the battery.\n\nWESTERN CANADA'S LARGEST BATTERY MANUFACTURERS\n\nIndian Affairs.

School\nLloydminster, Sask.\n\nMr. Cameron,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nPresent bank of batteries are 168 ampere hours, old style Cedar Separators.\n\nInstalled November 1937 and guaranteed for five years.\n\nPresent condition:\nSulphated paste has reached bottom of plates, consequently, it is difficult for the batteries to hold the charge. The plates would crumble to pieces if battery is dismantled to be rebuilt. If batteries are allowed to operate in present condition there is a danger of the batteries short circuiting and perhaps explosion.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nThe 168 ampere hour capacity is not considered heavy enough for Institutional work, and fortunate if they outlive the full guaranteed length of time. A heavier bank would give better service and last longer. Batteries made today have undergone a change and improvement. The cedar separators and glass mats give the new style batteries a dual insulation. Thus the plates do not powder so readily.\n\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nAugust 26, 1948.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF:\n\nOnion Lake Anglican Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE: 76 Allotment 09-622\n\nSHIP TO: Rev.

In this connection, I have also enclosed a statement from the Principal with reference to the batteries now in use. To this I would add that due to the heavy service encountered, the set of batteries in use would receive the normal number of cycles of charge and discharge in a shorter period of time than they would in ordinary service. In case of replacement it might be advisable to install a larger size of battery in order to lengthen the life of the installation.\n\nThe present batteries were installed in December, 1937. They are 56 cells, 168 A.F., 110 volt, Globelite batteries. I do not know why these batteries are in their present condition, but there is nothing, apart from the heavy service already referred to, to indicate that they were not properly handled.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDonald H.

Principal Ellis has recommended that the \"machinery for the lighting plant\" be taken out of the main school building, and placed in a separate house close by, this house to be 22' x 26', and the underground walls to be made of cement. He estimates the cost of completing the cement walls which would be 10' high, at $80.00 for the cement and $150.00 for the labour.\n\nPrincipal Ellis further states that if granted this money now, he could have the work taken in hand at once, and carried forward sufficiently to house the lighting plant during the winter. In the spring, the upper part of the building including a frame or brick wall, with shingled roof, doors and windows, etc., could be completed. The Principal estimates the cost of this superstructure at $245.00, making the total cost amount to $475.00. As some allowance should be made for increases in cost of labour and materials I think an estimate of $600.00 would be safer.\n\nAs the arrangement suggested would not only add to the safety of the school, but provide quite good and suitable space for vocational training at a very moderate cost, our Commission recommend that it be accepted, and that we be authorized to proceed with the work at once.

The stone is on the school campus now.\n\nThe estimated cost of the complete building will be about $500.00 but an additional $50.00 will be required to make the foundations of the machinery when installed.\n\nWe expect to complete the walls in two weeks providing there is no delay.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n(Rev.

If metal shingles could be obtained, then only the rafters, doors and window frames would be of wood.\n\nThis new building would eliminate the vibration throughout the main school building, and completely remove the serious fire hazard, viz: engines, exhaust pipes, gasoline and wooden floors.\n\nThe present engine room could well serve as a vocational department as it is 22' X 26' in size.

M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nNo information is provided, however, regarding the use for which the superstructure is being considered.\n\nTheir estimate for the completed work is in the neighbourhood of $600.00, of which $250.00 would be required for the basement walls.\n\nIn this connection I may say that the immediate cost of the basement portion of such a building, apart from the cost entailed in moving equipment, would be approximately $500.00, while the superstructure would cost approximately $1200.00 if built of frame, or $2000.00 if brick walls are provided. The total cost would therefore be either $1700.00 or $2500.00, depending on materials, rather than the $600.00 estimate of the Church officers. These figures are based on the use of first class materials and labour.\n\nWe have noted the reference of the Church officers and Dr. McGill to fire hazard. In this connection I may say that where lighting plants or other mechanical equipment are operated by gasoline or oil operated engines in a non-fireproof building, fire hazard is always present to a considerable degree, and can only be eliminated by installing such plant in fireproof accommodation isolated from principal structures.\n\nIn the present instance, the fire hazard would be reduced by removing the lighting plant to a separate building of fireproof construction, but until a complete report on the examination made on the existing lighting plant is available, and until we are advised of the site of the proposed new building, no opinion regarding its ability to overcome an added loss in transmission due to the new location can be advanced.\n\nIf manual training accommodation at the school is not satisfactory, it is recommended that the Indian Affairs Branch should give consideration to providing a new building of simple construction adapted to the purpose, if and when funds are available.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6322, file 658-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDecember 21st, 1942.\n\nDr. McGill -\n\nRe: Church of England Indian Residential School,\nOnion Lake Agency, Saskatchewan.\n\nYour memorandum of November 2nd, relative to the above, was referred to our Engineering and Construction Service for a report and for your information I enclose copy of a memorandum from the Chief Engineer, Mr. Mills, dated November 13th, which is self-explanatory.\n\nIn his memorandum Mr. Mills reviews the situation at the School generally. It will be noted particularly that he states that where lighting plants and other mechanical equipment are operated by gasoline or oil operated engines in a non-fireproof building, fire hazard is always present to a considerable degree, and can only be eliminated by installing such plant in fireproof accommodation isolated from principal structures.\n\nHowever, a factor more important than the plant being in the building is the way it is operated. Only a small quantity of gasoline and oil should be kept in the room where the lighting plant is situated, and great care should be taken against spilling gasoline or oil. If such is spilled it should be immediately wiped up. No oily rags or other inflammable material should be left in the lighting plant room, smoking therein at any time should be strictly prohibited, and all electric wiring or fixtures should be kept in good condition. The room should be well ventilated.\n\nIt is our intention to have an engineer visit this school next spring, and he will be instructed to make a report on the lighting plant and the room it occupies.\n\nIt will also be noted that Mr. Mills estimates the cost of the building suggested by the Church officials at from\n\n(over)\n$1700.00 to $2500.00, depending on materials used rather than the $600.00 estimate of the officials.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nDecember 23, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to official letter of the 30th ultimo and previous correspondence, with reference to the proposed erection of a new building in which to place the lighting plant. You have not replied to my letter of November 30 but the whole question has been very carefully considered by the Surveys & Engineering Branch of this Department and they do not see any necessity for the new building at the present time. It is their intention to have an engineer visit the school next spring and at that time he will report to the Department.\n\nThe Surveys & Engineering Branch point out that where lighting plants and other mechanical equipment are operated by gasoline or oil engines in a non-fireproof building fire hazard is always present to a considerable degree. However, the fire hazard may be minimized by only keeping a small quantity of gasoline and oil in the room where the lighting plant is situated and great care should be taken against spilling either gasoline or oil. If such is spilled, it should be immediately wiped up. No oily rags or other inflammable material should be left in the lighting plant room and smoking therein at any time should be strictly prohibited.

The lighting plant is a Fairbanks Morse 25 H.P. semi-diesel engine, Style H, No. C-21832 R.P.M., with a belt drive to a Fairbanks Morse D.C. generator, compound wound, 7\u00bd K.W., 125 volts, 6 amps., 1950 R.P.M. The room now occupied by the plant is a 16' by 25' frame addition to the rear of the room designated in the original plans for lighting plant and pump. The addition has a concrete floor at ground level but is otherwise of wooden construction.\n\n\"The room originally intended for the lighting plant is occupied by an International Harvester engine, Model P.15 Serial No. 2641, used on a belt drive to operate the washer, extractor and dough mixer in the adjoining laundry. This unit may also be connected by belt to an auxiliary 5 K.W. generator, lacking a name plate, for use in the event of the main power unit being out of commission. The original lighting plant room has concrete walls for a height of two feet above the floor, the balance of the walls and the roof being of wood framing. The floor has a concrete strip four feet wide, on which the engine rests, running the length of the room against the inside wall. The rest of the floor is of wooden construction and is dirty with some patches soaked with oil. Two fire extinguishers are kept near the boiler room entrance to this room and all engine fuel is stored in an underground tank outside the lighting plant room.\n\n\"The school principal, Rev. H. Ellis, explained that his plan was to build a 24-foot by 26-foot building to house the lighting plant and the auxiliary. The building would be located opposite and some 120 feet to the west of the present engine room. It would have a concrete floor and concrete walls faced with local stone similar to the gate post work shown in one of the accompanying photographs. The roof would be of shingles on wooden rafters. Mr. Ellis has obtained an estimate of\n\n(over)\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6322, file 658-5, part 8)\n$500.00 for erection of this structure. The present lighting plant room would be used for vocational training and the room housing the secondary power unit would be used as a workshop.\n\n\"Changing the location of the secondary power unit would, of course, require that the laundry equipment and dough mixer be motorized either individually or by one motor using the existing belt drives and shifting. It would be possible to convert the 5 kw. generator to a motor for this purpose as this was proposed by Mr. Ellis, who said that he also had available a 10 kw. generator which I did not see. This would mean that the 7\u00bd kw. generator be used as an auxiliary with the secondary power unit and the 10 kw. generator put into service with the lighting plant. The scheme would involve moving and resetting the two power units, converting the 5 kw. dynamo to a motor, providing new switches and panels and a considerable amount of wiring work and material. This in addition to the cost of erecting a rather expensive building. The benefits obtained would be the acquisition of a room for vocational training, another room as a workshop (for which purpose it is partly used now) and the reduction of fire hazard.\n\n\"Since the Department does not approve the construction of a building for vocational training purposes, the reduction of fire hazard is the governing factor. In this connection, I do not consider that a fire hazard exists other than would be found in any engine room of wooden construction. The room now housing the lighting plant is somewhat isolated from the main building and the fire hazard small. In the room housing the secondary unit, there is greater fire hazard as it is more closely connected to the main building and has a wooden floor for the greater part of its area. However, fire would only be likely to start here by carelessness in operating the unit and the wood flooring could be covered by sheet iron to reduce the hazard. Generally, I consider the cost of the proposed change to be out of all proportion to the benefit resulting and would recommend against it.\n\n\"There is a frame building 40 feet by 18 feet on log sills near the proposed site of the engine room building, that was previously used as a laundry and which was considered by the Indian Agent as a vocational training shop. However, the building is over 25 years old and in such poor condition that I would not recommend its use. If any machine work is contemplated in the vocational training, it would be necessary to provide a floor strong enough to allow a firm tractor or other machinery to be run inside. The floor should preferably be of planks rather than concrete as the latter would cause considerable damage when edged tools were dropped.\"\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Cornish does not consider the present fire hazard to be any greater than ordinarily exists where gasoline engines are operated, but that in the room occupied by the auxiliary unit it could be reduced by covering the wooden floor with sheet iron.\nRegarding the proposal to erect a new building to house the lighting plant and auxiliary unit, Mr. Cornish points out that in addition to the cost of the building and moving the two units to it, there would be costs for new switching equipment, wiring and converting the generator to a motor and drive the dough mixer and laundry equipment. He does not consider that the resulting benefits would justify the cost.\n\nIn this connection please refer also to our memorandum of November 13th last.\n\nOn examining the sewage disposal system it was found that some minor repairs were needed and that the septic tank should be cleaned out. The Principal assured Mr. Cornish that these conditions would be remedied.\n\nChief Engineer,\n\nIndian Affairs.

He points out that to erect a new building to house the lighting plant and auxiliary unit would involve the cost of the new building and the moving of the two units to it. Besides, there would be costs for new switching equipment, wiring and converting the generator to a motor to drive the dough mixer and laundry equipment.

The plaster in the top story might have to be replaced on account of the frost getting into the building, but in the other rooms only a patch here and there will be necessary.\n\n(b) All the walls should be kalsomined.\n\n(c) Replace broken glass in all windows.\n\n(d) Repair some of the storm windows which have been broken.\n\nWith the exception of the purchase of glass, most of the repairs will only mean engaging labour and the supervision of their work. The glass required can no doubt be secured in Prince Albert and, if so, this will permit the repairs to be made at as early a date as possible.

Colleaux of Prince Albert, inquiring about the disposal of the salvage from the Onion Lake Anglican Indian Residential School that recently burned down. I also had a letter from Mr. H.J. Fraser, Barrister and Solicitor of Prince Albert who is also the Provincial Member for Prince Albert, strongly recommending that Mr. Colleaux be given first opportunity in this regard.\n\nUpon receipt of the above mentioned letters I immediately got in touch with the Reverend Mr. Ellis and am now in receipt of a letter from him stating the heating boiler, compression tanks, hot water boiler, and the high pressure boiler have not been damaged in any way. They were drained by the staff immediately after the building collapsed. The sewage system is also intact. The only things to salvage then are the radiators, fire escapes, beds that went through the fire, etc. Mr. Ellis points out there are iron pipes, nipples and unions that could be salvaged together with fire escapes which are badly twisted. I do not know whether our Branch want to salvage the radiators or not. The Reverend Mr. Ellis puts a value of $20,000.00 on the boilers and tanks which were undamaged.\n\nI just thought I would bring this matter to your attention in case you might want to do something about it. In the meantime I have informed Mr. Colleaux that he will have to wait until he hears from me again and that I have written to you in this regard.\n\nM.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 3, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. VINCENT\n\nWith reference to Mr. Hoey's memorandum of the 1st instant, regarding steel tables and a stove surplus to the requirements of the R.C.M.P. at Halifax, we have received a letter today from Indian Agent Rice, who inspected the articles, giving the following detailed information concerning them:\n\n\"I found that only three of the five tables had tops, the legs of all were bent and warped and I considered them all almost worthless. The stove was a very old one, the fire-box linings had been burned and a few bricks placed in. The top was warped, the legs spread out and it too was nothing but junk. The Officer Commanding intimated very strongly that if the material was worth having they could quite easily put it to good use.\n\n\"This material belonged to the Halifax hotel which was taken over by this force as their new headquarters in Halifax.\"\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 1, 1944.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn your letter of the 13th ultimo, submitting information regarding the washing machine, extractor and dryer, you mentioned that the ceilings are too low to permit any shafting with safety. Please let me know the dimensions (length, width and height) of the room, or rooms, which you intend to use for a laundry. This information is required immediately in connection with placing an order for the machinery.\n\nIn your letter of December 31, 1943, you quoted the prices at which you could obtain tables, namely, $28.00 and $32.50 each, and, as requested in official letter of January 4, you advised us in your communication of January 13 regarding the firm from whom these quotations were received. The Purchasing Branch is endeavouring to locate other sources of supply.\n\nWhile they are awaiting replies to their inquiries I would like to know if you can secure competitive quotations from local firms on a cheaper style of table than that offered by the Prince Albert Manufacturing Company. I feel that a considerable saving could be effected by adopting a less permanent style of table than that suggested in your communication. For the time being, at least, trestle tables should serve the purpose and it should be possible to secure such tables at a much reduced cost. This would have the added benefit that, if required, they could be taken down and the room used for other purposes on special occasions.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

On Monday the 31st I again returned there and inspected the material.\n\nI found that only three of the five tables had tops, the legs of all were bent and warped and I considered them all almost worthless.

I assure you that, judging from the clothing and shoes sent here by this force, anything condemned by their interior economy officer, is not much good. This material belonged to the Halifax hotel which was taken over by this force as their new headquarters in Halifax.\n\nI regret my oversight in sending the telegraphic report collect.

Mills, Chief Engineer, Surveys and Engineering Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, I might say that the Reverend Mr. Ellis was down here last week and while he was in Regina he came to the office a couple of times. I knew that we would have to hire some men to get rid of the refuse so that we could get at the material that was worth salvaging. However, I did not want to suggest anything to make an expense and I thought in all probability you would get one of the engineers to go out there and attend to this, and naturally he would have to hire some Indians up there to do the work.\n\nI am writing to the Indian Agent, Mr. Cameron, to see if he can have his farming instructor look after this. Mr. Lockhart is capable of carrying this out because anything of this nature is right in his line. I am also sending the letter to Mr. Cameron with instructions that after he goes over the situation there he wire me an estimate of the cost because of the poor mail service between here and Onion Lake. This would also furnish a little employment to the Indians of that band.\n\nAs soon as I get this information from Mr. Cameron I shall advise you.\n\nM.

Henry Ellis)\nOttawa,\nFebruary 7, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nAttention: Mr. Vincent\n\nI desire to refer to our requisition of January 19 for laundry machinery for the St. Albert's Indian Residential School. Following our telephone conversation of February 1 the Principal was written and, in a reply dated February 4, he gives the following information regarding the dimensions of the proposed laundry:\n\n\"27' 3\" x 6' 10\" x 10'\n\n\"There is, however, a 4' x 5' jog in one corner.\n\n\"I am of the opinion that each unit should be driven by an individual motor, as the joists will not stand any brackets being attached to them.\"\n\nYou will note that individual motors will have to be supplied for each piece of equipment. This will be less expensive than supplying shafting etc.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAIR MAIL\n\nRegina, February 7th, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to refer you to my letter of the 1st instant, No. 309-11 ACE.

I want, however, to assure you that the Department's interest will be safeguarded at all times.\n\nThe matter of wiring the building for the high tension power to operate the machinery, could be held in abeyance until the machinery arrives, if you so desire.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n(Rev.

I note the prices that you quote in your letter were obtained from the Electric Shop, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. When submitting the account for payment you should submit one account for the fixtures and a separate account for the labour. I presume it is unnecessary for me to state that the expenditure should be kept as low as possible. The cost of refitting this building is amounting to considerably more than the Department first anticipated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev.

Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nUnder separate cover I have mailed to you a number of invoices for painting materials. There are over 60,000 square feet surface to be covered either with paint or kalsomine. About 50% of the work is done. Only the worst places requiring renovation have been taken in hand to date. The labour for this work has been covered.\n\nOf the $1000.00 appropriation allowed for labour, there is today a balance of $137.63. Against this, however, there is a plumbing charge of $203.50 for labour and $78.90 for materials and fittings.\n\nWe have now suspended further work until we know if it is possible to receive an additional grant to complete all the work.\n\nCertain small rooms have to be torn down to make a large dormitory for the boys. It is estimated that an additional grant of $450.00 besides the money that we have on hand would cover the following work, viz:\n\n(a) Changing and repairing the dormitory for the boys and painting and plastering the places taken apart.\n\n(b) Fittings for the high pressure boiler and cementing the laundry floor and placing the drain pipes for the laundry machinery.\n\np.t.o\nIf this grant is allowed, would you please advise if this new work is to be completed by the 31st of March 1944.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n**REQUISITION FOR CHEQUE**\n\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\nDEPARTMENT: MINES & RESOURCES\n\nBRANCH: INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nDATE: March 17, 1944.\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE NO. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | Reverend Henry Ellis, Principal, St. Alban's Indian Residential School, Prince Albert, Sask. | $450.00 |\n\nSTATE BELOW WITH DETAILS IN EVERY CASE, WHETHER (a) STANDING ADVANCE, (b) ADVANCE FOR SPECIFIC JOURNEY\u2014ESTIMATING NUMBER OF DAYS, (c) OTHER ACCOUNTABLE ADVANCE OR (d) AUTHORIZED PAYMENT.\n\nAdditional amount required for labour in connection with repairs - St. Alban's Indian Residential School (#658)\n\nVOTE: 76\n\nCHARGE TO: ALLOTMENT\n\nSUB-ALLOTMENT: 10-691\n\nCERTIFY THAT THIS APPLICATION IS MADE UNDER THE REQUISITE AUTHORITY, AND THAT THE EXPENDITURE IS NECESSARY IN THE INTERESTS OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE.\n\nHEAD OF BRANCH\n\nTREASURY OFFICE APPROVAL\n\nDEPUTY HEAD\n\nIndian Affairs.

You have submitted an account for $328.51 for paint purchased from Sherwin-Williams Paint & Wallpaper Store, Prince Albert. We do not appear to have given any authority for the purchase of this paint and, as all purchases are supposed to be made through our Purchasing Branch, it is difficult for us to secure a purchase order after the paint has been purchased, without complete explanations of why Departmental regulations were not followed. In reviewing our files I find that in your letter of January 31 you stated that you had not had an opportunity of checking the number of square feet in the building that required painting, but that you would write more definitely on the matter later. We replied to that letter on February 3 and mentioned that we expected you to forward a requisition for the materials required for painting and kalsomining. We do not appear to have received any further correspondence from you in this matter.\n\n2. Early in March you forwarded us an account from Royal Davis and we replied on March 8 asking for an explanation. Your reply was dated the 13th of March and included two accounts, one for $225.50 and the other for $6.50. You also\n\nRev. Henry Ellis,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Alban's Indian Residential School,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nforwarded a tender that you had received from Mr. Davis but the amounts mentioned in the tender do not correspond with the amounts shown on the accounts. In your letter of March 15 you also stated as follows: \"The labour was paid out of the appropriation allowed by the Department, it being worked out on an hourly basis. The Department will not, therefore, receive another bill, as the labour account has been settled.\" If the labour has been settled we cannot understand why you forwarded us the two accounts just mentioned from Mr. Davis.\n\nI should appreciate an immediate reply to this letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, March 23rd, 1944\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Onion Lake Indian Residential School, Saskatchewan.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of March 3rd, it is noted that instructions were issued under date of February 9th last to Mr. Christianson, General Superintendent of Indian Agencies, Regina, to have the boiler room and engine room cleaned out and metallic equipment removed from the debris of this school.\n\nIt will be recalled that in his memorandum of January 26th last, of which a copy was sent you, Mr. Mills requested that the Indian Agent also be asked to prepare an inventory of equipment which appears to be damaged as well as other material no longer useful.\n\nWe presume that the equipment and other material is now exposed to view and the inventory prepared and if you will advise us that this has been done, instructions will be sent to the Banff Office of our Engineering and Construction Service to have the inspection made and a report submitted as soon as possible.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nMarch 25, 1944.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMr. M.

A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter 115-1-1 of the 24th instant, with reference to the Sherwin-Williams Paint account, I am exceedingly sorry that there has been a grave misunderstanding regarding the purchase of the paint materials, and I realize now on reviewing your letter of the February 3rd that a requisition for materials should have been at first submitted and your authorization obtained through the office of the Purchasing Agent.\n\nAt that time, I was very ill and in the hospital, with a blocked bile duct and badly Jaundice and was for nearly a month under four doctors care.\n\nI was of the opinion that authority had been given to purchase the supplies locally, and I gave permission to purchase the material. I see now that I am in error and sincerely trust that the mistake can be rectified. I accept the full responsibility.\n\nRegarding the Davis account, the extra money for $6.60 was for the repairing of the main chimney, which was recommended by the City of Prince Albert Fire Chief. I had him check over the building.\nAs before mentioned, all labour costs have been paid and the Department is asked only to meet the material bills. The both accounts was sent, to show that the work had been by tender, before I knew that I would be responsible for the paying of the labour. I trust that I am clear on this point.\n\nSorry to have caused you this inconvenience.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nMarch 29, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nI attach the following two accounts:\n\nSherwin-Williams Paint & Wallpaper Store, Prince Albert ............. $328.51\n\nElectric Shop, Prince Albert ....... 248.15\n\nThe materials on these two accounts were purchased in connection with the repairs that had to be made to the St. Alban's Residential School. The Principal was asked to forward requisitions in order that the purchases could be made through your Branch; but, in a letter dated March 27, he stated that he misunderstood the instructions that we had given to him and purchased these supplies, as he wanted to have the work completed at the earliest possible date. Under the circumstances I trust that you will issue purchase orders so that the accounts may be paid. The coding is as follows: 658-76-10-691.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nMarch 29, 1944.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant and, with reference to the Sherwin-Williams account, I am submitting same to the Purchasing Branch for purchase order so that the account may be paid.\n\nIn your letter you state that all labour costs have been paid and the Department is asked only to meet the material bills. Under these circumstances I am returning the account of the Electric Shop for labour amounting to $90. It is true that we suggested in our letter of the 14th ultimo that a separate account should be submitted for the labour, but at that time we intended this to mean that the receipted account for the labour would be attached to the accountable voucher which you have to forward accounting for the $1450 advance which has been sent to you.\n\nI also find it necessary to return the Royal Davis account for $225.50. When I looked at this account first I thought it was for labour, but it appears that it is for material. Before payment of the account can be considered it will be necessary to itemize it. More details will have to be supplied also on the account of $6.50 for repairs to the chimney.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

Plumbing and Heating Co. and the fifth from the Electric Shop. Apparently these accounts have all been paid by you from the accountable advance of $1450 which has been sent to you.\n\nYou should prepare a credit voucher in the manner suggested by the enclosed. To this voucher you should attach receipted accounts for all expenditures made. If there is any balance unexpended, it should be returned, as the money was paid from the appropriation for the fiscal year 1943-44, which closed on the 31st of March.\n\nYou will note that in my letter of March 29 I advised you that an accountable voucher would have to be forwarded accounting for the advances that have been made to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The engine room and boiler room are cleaned of rubbish and all equipment completely exposed to view. The damaged metal articles, such as radiators, beds, piping, etc., have been removed from the wreckage and piled up in the open.\n\nI note it is the intention of our Branch to have a representative of the Surveys and Engineering Branch inspect the premises, and in this regard I wish to point out that when Mr. Cameron wrote his letter, namely on April 10th last, the road to Onion Lake was impassable as the Saskatchewan River could not be crossed from Lloydminster.

The request which you have made for repairs to the roof, the purchase of a steam mangle and the wiring of the building for electric power will have to come under this year's appropriation and will be dealt with in the near future. You will, therefore, return this money to us at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Henry Ellis,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Alban's Indian Residential School,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI have a letter from Mr. Cameron, Indian Agent, Onion Lake Agency, with respect to the Church of England Residential School that was burned down last Fall.\n\nMr. Cameron had a meeting with the Chief and Council of the Onion Lake Band on May 9th and the Indians seemed to be very much concerned about rebuilding the school on the same site on their reserve, in fact they are very anxious that this school be rebuilt there. They pointed out to the Agent that the Reverend H. Ellis, Principal of the School, met them on Sunday, May 7th, and had given them to understand that the school would be rebuilt but that it would be erected on another reserve and they were lead to believe the site for the re-building of the school has already been donated. In view of this they have asked the Agent to make strong representations on their behalf to our Branch to use all their influence in seeing that this school is re-established on their reserve. The Chief, while at the meeting, pointed out the school had been a source of great assistance to the Indians there in many ways. The children received a good education and the influence of the school carried that to the Indian homes. He also pointed out that the land, fences, and all the out buildings which are necessary for the school are still there and the Indians could not understand why the Department is contemplating building the school at some other place. Putting it in Mr. Cameron's words \"They would indeed be very sorry if this should happen and strongly urge...\" that the Agent and myself mediate on their behalf with respect to this matter.\n\nI do not know what the Department is contemplating doing but as this request has been made by the Indians of Onion Lake Reserve I am submitting their stand to you.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, May 28, 1944.\n\nMr. M. Christianson, General Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Building, Scarth & Victoria Streets,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRe: Rebuilding Onion Lake Residential School.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of May 15, in which you discuss the subject matter of a letter received by you from Indian Agent Cameron.\n\nNo consideration has been given by the Department to the rebuilding of the Onion Lake School. Temporary provision, as you are fully aware, has been made for the pupils of this school at St. Alban's College, Prince Albert. No provision has been made for the construction of Indian day or residential schools in our estimates during the last four year period, despite the fact that during this period a large number of schools have been destroyed by fire. It is our hope that, when funds are available, we shall be able to proceed with our construction program by recognizing the claims of the districts where in our judgment the need is most urgent.\n\nThe following schools have been destroyed by fire and should be rebuilt by the Department: the senior school at Caughnawaga, the File Hills Residential School classroom, the Alberni Residential School classroom, the Carcross Residential School, and the Back Settlement Day School, Caradoc Agency, Ontario. In addition to these, it will be necessary to build two consolidated schools at Shubenacadie and Eskasoni, in Nova Scotia, to complete the consolidation of the agencies in that province. In view of these facts, it is not likely that we shall be in a position to proceed with the construction of the Onion Lake School at any time in the\nimmediate future. In the meantime, the officials here would welcome any information that can be supplied us with respect to the type of school that should be built at Onion Lake. If you feel that an educational survey of the reserve should be made, the Department would be glad to employ the public school inspector for this purpose.\n\nActing Director.\nJ. H.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent, Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nWould it be possible for you to help us to solve our problem of refrigeration. It is difficult to keep any quantity of milk, butter and other food on hand without spoiling. I was wondering if you could secure for us a couple of the refrigerators from the military schools that are now permanently closing down. These refrigerators are of a small size and appear to have been placed in each of the cooking huts.\n\nYour continued support and co-operation would be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n(Rev. Henry Ellis)\nOttawa,\nAugust 3, 1944.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Mr. Ellis:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to securing a refrigeration system for the Onion Lake C.E. Residential School now located at Prince Albert. I note you suggest that a couple of refrigerators might be secured from one of the military schools that are now being closed.\n\nWe readily realize that there is a general impression throughout the country that surplus equipment at military camps, air force stations and other such establishments will be available for distribution to other Government projects. This idea, however, is definitely contrary to fact. There have recently been set up two organizations known as the Crown Assets Allocation Committee and the War Assets Committee. Our understanding is that these two organizations will take over all surplus equipment from any of the war camps or departments and will arrange for their disposal in the open market. Due to the great scarcity of consumer goods at the present time there is very little doubt that they will be able to dispose of all surplus equipment in a manner which will reimburse the Government to a great extent for the expenditure previously incurred. If we endeavour to secure any of this equipment for our residential schools or agencies we will be obliged to compete with others endeavouring to secure the same articles. You will readily see that there is no\n\nRev. Henry Ellis,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Albans Indian Residential School,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\npossible chance of our securing equipment free,\nor, for that matter, at a price which would justify\nour competing for it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

As it is imperative that the system be connected before cold weather sets in, may the Commission request that immediate sanction be granted.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nAssistant Secretary-Treasurer.\n\nEWM/GM.\nOttawa,\nAugust 21, 1944.\n\nMr. D.H.

Is the Department to understand that the Indians have their livestock pasturing on the land formerly used by the school? From previous correspondence we were under the impression that the Church of England was still operating this farm. In this connection I would refer you to my letter of August 21, which referred to Mr. Eric Calrow, who had been appointed supervisor of the property.

It is the view that none of the finer machinery could be properly repaired at reasonable cost, particularly as it would be impossible to obtain repair parts in several instances. You will also note the opinion expressed by Mr. Mills in regard to certain equipment like tanks and boilers.\n\nIt is the view that only the first four items offer much promise from the reconditioning standpoint, and that the rest of the equipment has a value chiefly as scrap.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nOctober 14, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nRe: Onion Lake C.E.

Cameron,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch - Ottawa.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your Letter No. 115-1-5, of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the \"Old Anglican Residential School\".\n\nThe site referred to is that of the \"old school\" which was abandoned about 18 years ago when the new school was built. The old site is right here at Onion Lake whereas the new site is located some 6 miles away. There is no reference to the School which was destroyed by fire last December and where the Church of England is still operating the farm with Mr. H. Calrow as supervisor.\n\nThe old school building was pulled down a year ago and left in something of a mess. It is dangerous for stock on account of the old cellar and also on account of nails left in boards. There are no walls standing. The Church authorities sold the building to a \"wrecker\" and I presume he was supposed to have left the premises in better condition.\n\nI enclose a copy of my letter to Mr. Christiansen.\n\nDonald H.

It is impossible for the Department to decide what work is necessary from the information supplied in your letter. However, I imagine that the expenditure will not be heavy and you are, therefore, authorized to incur an expenditure up to $50 for labour in improving the site of this school.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. H.W. McGill.\n\nI acknowledge the receipt of your memorandum of the 14th instant, your file 115-1-5, respecting the condition of equipment subsequent to the fire which destroyed the Onion Lake Indian Residential School, Saskatchewan.\n\nThe reports made by the Director, Surveys and Engineering Branch, and Mr. J.H. Mitchell, Senior Assistant Engineer, Banff, Alberta, have been noted and we are awaiting further direction as to whether your branch will proceed with the reconditioning of certain equipment and the disposal of such equipment as may be found unserviceable.\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nOctober 24, 1944.\n\nAttention Dr. H.W. McGill\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nWhen our school at Onion Lake was destroyed by fire last December we continued to operate the farm until there was some indication as to the measures that would be taken to continue the work of the school. We hoped, and continue to hope, that sooner or later the school will be rebuilt at this site. There is evidence that there are more Anglican children anxious to attend than we have ever been able to accommodate. The site is excellent and a good farm of 640 acres has been in process of development. The Principal's residence, barn and other outbuildings remain in good order and we earnestly hope that when it becomes possible a new school will be built and the work will go forward with this favourable start.\n\nWhen the work of the school was transferred to St. Alban's at Prince Albert, our Commission decided to continue the farm at Onion Lake. We felt that it was necessary to do this to keep the buildings and fences in good order and the land under cultivation. We hoped that some plan might be worked out whereby our older boys could take their turn in working on the farm and so be given the training for which this school has been noted. We also hoped that the farm could produce vegetables for use in the school. Accordingly we transferred one of our most trusted Farm Instructors and made him Superintendent of this farm in the hope that the advantages suggested above might be gained. We also have cherished the hope that an early end of the war might mean that before long the school might be rebuilt, and that the present building in Prince Albert might be used by the Department as a kind of Indian College, a centre to which the more advanced pupils from a number of the schools on the Prairies might be sent to continue their high school work under favourable conditions.\n\nI regret to say that our experience during the past summer has led us to doubt the wisdom of these conclusions. We have been given to understand by officials of the Department that there is little likelihood of any school being built at Onion Lake for some years to come. We have found it impracticable by reason of distances and bad roads to use the older boys on the farm and to supply the school with produce. Our Superintendent has found it impossible to get farm help except at prohibitive costs, and reports that much of the machinery is in poor condition and that considerable expenditures are required at the present time if the farm is to be...\noperated without heavy loss. In these circumstances our Commission has had to give serious consideration to the matter and has concluded that it is not our responsibility to continue to operate this farm. We feel that it will be better for us to aim at securing land within reach of the Prince Albert School where the boys and girls can receive their training and vegetables can be produced economically. As the Onion Lake farm is the property of the Department, is located on the Reserve, and adjoins the Agency farm it seemed to us possible that arrangements might be made through the Indian Agent to continue in operation so that the work already done might be made good and the farm and buildings kept in good order.\n\nI shall be grateful if you will kindly consider this matter and let me know your decision. We have several vacancies for a Farm Instructor at this moment and are anxious to place our Superintendent in one of them as he has strongly expressed his desire to return to one of the schools.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.A. Alderwood\nSecretary.\nOctober 25, 1944.\n\nAttention Dr. H.W. McGill\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nFurther to my letter of yesterday's date, we have just heard from the Bishop of Saskatchewan who desires that action be deferred in regard to this matter until he has been able to discuss it further with our Commission.\n\nMay I therefore, ask you to be good enough to withhold consideration of my letter until we have met with the Bishop and are in a position to write further.\n\nThanking you, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.A.

If this work were undertaken, it would be necessary to purchase a supply of children's lasts. Mr. Ellis was requested to write a letter to the Warden which could be submitted to the department, but did not do so. He telephoned this morning and intimated that he was leaving for Ottawa, and would call at the department. He was advised to get in touch with Mr. J. A. McLaughlin.\n\n3.

We have a second-hand one here which would fill his requirements and he has requested that we write to you.\n\nThe price of this machine is $75.00, f.o.b. Winnipeg.\n\nRev. Ellis would appreciate if you would send us a purchase order for this scale if this is agreeable with you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCANADIAN TOLEDO SCALE CO. LTD\n\nG. E. Brown,\nWinnipeg Agent.\n\nGEB:OP\nOttawa, December 8, 1944.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have a letter from the Toledo Scale Company, quoting a second hand scale, suitable for weighing children, at a price of $75.00, f.o.b. Winnipeg.\n\nI remember discussing this matter with you and my recollection is that we agreed that an ordinary bath-room scale would be sufficient. These can be secured at a very reasonable cost, in most cases under $10.00. If you can secure one of these you may do so. We are not prepared to spend $75.00 for the purchase.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend Henry Ellis,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Alban's Indian Residential School,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to your letter 115-1-5 dated the 8th instant.\n\nSo far I have not been able to locate a set of scales. I tried in Toronto and phoned several places in Winnipeg, and the places were all closed for the half day, I was not able to make personal contact.\n\nThere is no misunderstanding about the type of scale or the price mutually agreed upon.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPrincipal.\n(Rev.

E. Mapletoft, Fort Pitt, Sask., re salvage material and equipment at the C. E. Indian Residential School here.\n\nAccording to my information the Surveys and Engineering Branch were asked by the Director last January (1944) to have an officer visit the site to examine undamaged articles and recommend the best manner in which to preserve them; and at the same time to state what could be sold in order that the matter could be brought to the attention of the Salvage Officer.\n\nThe inspection was made in July, 1944, by J. H. Mitchell, Esq., Assistant Engineer, Department of Mines and Resources, Banff, Alberta. No doubt Mr. Mitchell's report is available and I think his is the report you require.\n\nI enclose a copy of an inventory which I made and forwarded to Mr. Christianson's office in duplicate, under date of April 10th, 1944. The high pressure boiler referred to in the list has been removed to Prince Albert by Mr. Ellis, Principal of the C. E. School there, and one of the compression tanks is in use at the Principal's house at the School site, Onion Lake.\n\nAlthough I am not qualified to pronounce on the condition and value of the articles I am of the opinion there is a lot of valuable equipment and salvage material to be disposed of in some manner. However, we are of the opinion that if this equipment and material are to be disposed of locally, a sale should be called in order to give equal opportunity to all interested parties and avoid public criticism and hard feelings, and at the same time realize the true value of the articles sold. I would not give young Mr. Mapletoft's letter very serious consideration.\n\nDonald H. Cameron,\nIndian Agent.\nSTATEMENT\n\nMarch 15th 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.

Indian Residential School on January 25, February 27 and March 27, Frog Lake Indian Day School on January 12 and March 9, and Long Lake Day School on March 7. The building to be used as a class room for the proposed Day School on Onion Lake Reserve, is being repaired and will be in readiness for school to open May 15th or when the teacher gets here. The C.E. Residential School Farm will be operated by P. Waskawitch, an Indian, this year, who will sow all tillable land to barley and keep the fences in repair. This is considered the best program possible to control the weeds this year. The whole of the cultivated land must be summer fallowed next year. The work this summer will be done with a tractor as P.
