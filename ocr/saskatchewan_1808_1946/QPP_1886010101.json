The tree was beautifully decorated with various ornaments and lights, and was always a favorite attraction. The children were delighted with the gifts they received from Santa Claus.\n\nThe Nomination,\n\nOn Monday there was a very large and representative gathering assembled in A. M. McLane's hall, quizzing and nominating candidates for the offices of councillor for the municipality of South Qu'Appelle. Mr. A. C. Peterson, the clerk, read the names of the officers to be nominated.\n\nRichard D. Bradley, A. M. McLane by W. S. David and J. Milliken, F. Kildy, J. D. Davis and G. Gordon, T. H. Thompson, G. H. Raynor and Leslie Gordon, F. O. Marwood, F. Whittington and D. Redden, John Carroll, N. Fallis and T. Dunn, R. Ross, A. Webster and N. F. Farnham, Joseph Craig, J. Blair and N. F.

Scott.\n\nThe meeting having arrived at its conclusion, the motion being adjourned for the ensuing year, Mr. McLane, who had been elected chairman, called upon Mr. McLane to make the following remarks:\n\nMr. McLane thanked the citizens of South Qu'Appelle for their support and encouragement in nominating him as one of their councillors for the coming year. He would not attempt to outline the future for the year 1888, but the substance of what he said was in his last address. He had always felt that he could do more for the town than he could do for himself, and he would try to do as much as possible to benefit the town.\n\nHe also explained the fact of their being the first council and having to make many decisions, which caused much difficulty, but he thought they had done well under the circumstances.\n\nThe meeting adjourned without further ado.\nHAPPY NEW YEAR:\n\nThis morning we usher in the new year, 1886. May it be a happy one, indeed! The Farmers' Advocate Pioneers for all its readers. In the ending of the old year and the advent of the new, a notch is marked in the ever revolving wheel of time. By it we should realize the fleeting nature of our days, and they are rapidly passing through a period of account. This thought will not be a sad one, if we have endeavored to spend rightly the year that is now drawing to a close. Nevertheless, we may feel that we have not done as well as we might, but the good resolve and the right determination for the new year, will send a glow of real happiness through every part of our hearts, and give a joy that will not be lessened by the thought of regret. Whatever the past may have been, the new year before us will be just what we make it. The Progress is determined to help on the most beneficial and harmonious prosperity of its readers, and its hearty wish again is that all may have\n\nA HAPPY NEW YEAR.\n\nTHE FARMERS UNION AND THE C.P.R.\n\nThe Farmers Union of Manitoba has become a remarkably dependent institution. At its inception it was looked upon as a good movement, and the best men of the country gave it their support. The publication of this paper was at one time on the point of establishing a newspaper in its interests, but being entirely committed himself, saw that there was no advantage in doing so, and therefore abandoned the plan. Mr. J.W. Astley has written a letter to the Toronto Mail which goes to show that Riel was not exactly a disinterested patriot, Mr. Astley says: \"What made me sit down and write this letter to you, sir, you will shortly discover why 'who is a splendid critic.' How could he direct his attention to the action of the Subd. Board, or put his shoulder to the plough, when he could see that the Union had become a mere tool of the government? And again, when he thought about striking my life for his especial benefit in carrying out his message to God and Mankind, during the Battle of Red River, he told me not to mention the matter to anyone, and said he would do what I could for him about the same thing. If I mentioned the people's claims it might weaken anything I might do for him.\" This, with the $25,000 demand, would pretty well remove all further pretense over the hanging of Louis Riel.\n\nMedicine Hat Times Judge Travis' course is commendable by the respectable portion (by no means the smaller portion) of the community. He was sent to Calgary for the purpose of maintaining the dignity and giving effect to the law of the Territories. In every instance his action will bear the closest scrutiny and reveal that he has not been swayed by personal feelings or the public attractions of such persons as Bleeker, Davis, and men of that ilk, to harm. We are sanguine the beneficent effects of Judge Travis' residence in Calgary will be felt throughout the district, and those who persist in acting as \"barbarous savages\" will be forced to take themselves beyond his ken. Success attend you, Judge Travis, in the wish of the Medicine Hat Times.\n\nCorrespondence,\n\nATTAINED ITS MAJORITY\n\nTo our readers who use agriculture as an art to be followed by the light of intelligence rather than superstition, we say, for their encouragement, that the Farmers' Advocate and Western Home Magazine. This journal, which was first edited in 1879, is now in its seventh year of publication, and is the organ of the Farmers' Advocate, which is the leading agricultural journal in Canada. It is published weekly, and contains a large amount of valuable and entertaining reading matter. The annual subscription is free to applicants.\n\nCONSUMPTION CURED\n\nAs all physicians, resident in Canada, are aware, there is a great demand for a remedy for consumption. The following recipe is given by Dr. J.M. Macdonald, of Montreal, and is said to have been used successfully by him in many cases. It is as follows:\n\nTake two cups of milk, half a cup of sugar, and a pinch of salt. Boil the milk until it is thick, then add the sugar and salt, and boil for five minutes longer. Take off the fire and let it cool. Drink this mixture three times a day, and soon you will find yourself recovering from consumption.\n\nA BUFFALO HUNT\n\nA Great Hunt Chased Hundred Miles into Montana by Buffalo Hunters.\n\nPeople (Montana X.Y.S. No. 6)\n\nMontana, Dec. 31, 1885.\u2014Buffalo hunters, who were surprised the other day when they heard a herd of buffalo running, rushed out to see what was going on. They discovered a herd of buffalo running away from them, and the animals appeared to be well run. The hunters chased the buffalo, and finally cornered them near the banks of the Missouri River. The hunters then loaded their guns and started for home, having killed several hundred buffalo.\nNEW GOODS - NEW GOODS\nAT J. P.

Mr. Jelly stated that he could not collect the money from the owners of the animals destroyed.\n\nOne day Mr. Jelly did not take the collected compensation. Mr. Jelly.\u2014He didn\u2019t say.\n\nMr. Hooper wished for legal remedies, but Mr. Jelly contended that he would not expect a cent from the people whose animals were destroyed.\n\nHis Honor.\u2014The ordinance requires to be read.\n\nAt this point Mr. Hooper wished for an immediate vote by every surgeon present in the council.\n\nThe committee resolved that resolutions for amendments to resolutions Nos. 1879 and 1877 be sent to Ottawa through Mr. Justice Eburne. The judge preferred a resolution for the late publication of Justice Eburne regarding the election results.\n\nThe House then adjourned until Tuesday morning.\n\nJUDGEMENT\n\nJudge Moore delivered his opinion on Mr. Markland\u2019s charge against him. Mr. Markland was charged with assault and battery of Mr. Moore. Mr. Markland was found guilty and fined $5.\n\nThe House then adjourned until Tuesday morning.\nRapid City Ripples.\n\nD. McNaughton, V.S., who has heretofore acted as district veterinarian for the counties of Rapid City, Red River, Birtle, St. Vital, Souris Lake and Russell will in future act for the counties of Morden and Hilda.\n\nTo get the best hot coffee for the holidays everybody should use Lyman's Extract of Coffee which is the finest coffee extract ever made. It is the easiest to use and can be served up piping hot, in a moment. We wonder why more than the Great Medal Favorite Essences are unrivaled for purity and strength.\n\nThe sequel to the shooting accident that occurred on the Red River a short time since at the hands of the victim, Mr. Alex. Boich, who was well known for winning as a contractor and builder, about three months since he married a Miss McNaughton, daughter of Mr. McNaughton, the little matchstick maker, Rev. Mr. Best performing the ceremony. It appears that he was killed by a gun from the hands of his wife. It exploded the charge entering his arm. Not having an opportunity to have it properly attended to, his whole system soon became affected with the foregoing result.\n\nSafe From Intrusion.\n\nJames: \"Has Ever been here again?\"\n\nSmith: \"Yes, he made a great noise when he came back and I thought he was going to break something.\"\n\nJones: \"I'm sure he would be able to do so if he had any chance.\"\n\nSmith: \"Well, of course it would be hard for him to have a shot at his own square which nobody ever thinks of doing. But he has dropped in here twice now.\"\n\nJames: \"He wants play do you think?\"\n\nSmith: \"That's what I thought. He had a lot to say.\"\n\nJones: \"A story might be told by his remarks.\"\n\nSmith: \"I'm sure he would be able to do so if he had any chance.\"\n\nOne day recently Henry Bishop, a young man of thirty, lost a watch while playing cards at a gaming table.
