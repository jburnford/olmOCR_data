But several of the sisters remember well my giving it in. It is a mystery to me, and regret the inconvenience it has caused you. I am sending another in case you don't come across the original.\n\nIn regard to repairs on premises, which I must impress.\n\nAug. 28, 1934\n\nIndian Affairs.

We had no idea we had to do all repairs on our salary. Though I must say he has done much repairing. Whatever he could do he has done. For instance the fence. He has fixed it so often now that it is so rusty it breaks right in his hands. Of course too, we understand times are hard, and Mr. Phillips is ready to repair the fence without cost but he must have new wire.\n\nThe well too is unsafe. Mr. Phillips thought a cement platform would be stronger, safer, and more permanent than lumber. But if you find it too much for you, he'll fix it the way you want it.\nBy the way, the loose lumber your man saw is lumber bought by Mr. Phillips when they tore some buildings done at Nelson. He bought it to make a shelter for his car and some vehicles for the winter.\n\nThough the stable was in bad condition when we came, Mr. Phillips thinks if we put off repairing it now, there won't be much chance of saving it later. That is why he asked to have it raised. It has caused him a lot of trouble as the building has sunk deep and in the spring when there is so much water it is always flooded, and speeds the decay. Of course he'll do what he can, but he doesn't see how he can have it\nraised without cost, so I guess he will will leave that part of it out.\n\nThough we earn a salary we too, sometimes feel the depression, as we pay a good sum out for things I think necessary, yet cannot get otherwise, as to prizes for the children, Christmas tree and an occasional thorough cleaning of the school, and closets. I am telling you this not because I regret it, but because we don't want you to think us so very hard and selfish, and we are grateful.\n\nYours Sincerely,\nMary K.

Phillips, for services rendered during the past school year at the Caughnawaga Bush School, as janitor at the rate of $35 a year. This account was also covering the cleaning of three closets at $6 each and including a charge of $20 for five cords of wood. You stated in your letter that the cost of cleaning the closets, viz., $5 per closet, was considered too high. Regarding the wood, you pointed out that the school was furnished with coke and that it was not understood why such a large quantity of wood was supplied.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that I interviewed Mr. and Mrs. Phillips who claimed that the Department has for several years been paying $5 for the cleaning of the closets, once a year. As this charge used to be considered as extra work, owing to the fact that the salary of janitor was only of $35, these people are claiming that they will not accept any amount less than $5 for this kind of work. Relative to the supplying of wood, I beg to say that they claim to have used the five cords of wood as kindling wood. They stated that since they are supplied with coke instead of coal, they are using more kindling wood.\n\nI would recommend that the charge of $5 for the closets be reduced at $2.50 and that only three cords of wood be paid out, as it is considered that three cords of kindling wood is sufficient for the need of the school. I would also ask you to send me a communication stating if you are willing to pay an additional amount for the cleaning of the closets for any school at Caughnawaga, if so, the price you intend to pay for such work. In the case of the kindling wood, I would suggest that no more than three cords a year be allowed for the Bush School.\n\nI am returning you herewith the original account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, as much as he would want to do it again this year, he cannot do so. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the present church and everything is being done to put Caughnawaga on the map. You probably will hear more of this with time. Our school children have been invited to present a pageant showing what the Department has done for the education of the Indians of Caughnawaga.\n\nWould you approve our hiring some Indian to travel these children on those days when the R.C.M.P. will not be able to go for them with the sisters' car? Naturally, we cannot count only on the M.P.'s for they may be called at any time, for other work.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention to this matter, we beg to remain\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSisters of Saint Ann\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, April 18, 1945.\n\nDear Sister George:\n\nAt the present time I am unable to decide in what manner we could meet the extra expense mentioned in your letter of the 11th instant. However, I suggest that you keep in mind what you expend in this regard.

Part of the roof is gone, the supporting beams have rotted away and the walls etc., are in a very bad condition. This stable is an eye sore and I would recommend that it be sold to a nearby indian farmer, Michael Day, who would give us the sum of TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS for it. Day would take the building down and would salvage whatever lumber that he could for use in repairing his own stable, and would clean the site.\n\nMay I say that even if a shed was needed at that School this building could not be utilized owing to its precarious condition.\n\nWould you be kind enough to let me know if the above suggestion is acceptable to the Branch?\n\n(Frs.

Favourable consideration should be given to this request when Mrs. Beauvais sends her requisition to the Agent in the spring.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI beg to inform you that the plaster at the teacher's residence of the Caughnawaga Bush School, is falling off from one of the walls of the front room. It is certainly annoying for Mrs Beauvais at this time of the season. Unless that the plasterers now working at the Caughnawaga Church could have that repair made during this winter; otherwise, temporary repairs could possibly be made with paper-board or other suitable material until next spring, when the re-plastering inside of that house has to be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, December 11th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, regarding the condition of the plaster in one of the front rooms of the teacher's residence at the Bush school on the Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if you can make satisfactory arrangements with the plasterers who are now working at the Caughnawaga Church to undertake the repairs required at the teacher's residence, you may do so. No unnecessary expenditure, however, should be incurred in making the repairs to the plaster. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded by you covering the cost of any work carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nB. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th ultimo, I beg to inform you that in view of the plaster recently completed at Bush School's teacher residence, and as suggested by the plasterers who were working at the Caughnawaga Church, I have ordered one laborer from the village of Caughnawaga to go and keep that teacher's residence heated during about 10 days until the plaster is entirely dried out. Salary paid is to be $3.50 per day and it is understood that at the same time this laborer is to scrub and clean the floors in this building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, January 14th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, relative to the repairs required to the plaster in the teacher's residence at the Caughnawaga Bush School.\n\nIn your letter of the 5th ultimo you stated that the plaster was falling off one of the walls of the front room, and you were instructed to have one of the plasterers working at the church building undertake the repairs at the teacher's residence. It is not understood why it should be necessary to engage a labourer to keep the residence heated for ten days. It is considered that Mrs. Beauvais, the teacher, should be responsible for keeping fires in the residence and also that she could do any cleaning required after the repairs to the plaster are made. You should immediately discontinue the services of this man, as the Department is not prepared to pay his wages for keeping on fires in order to dry out the plaster. You should have one of the plasterers working at the church make the repairs required only, as that is all the Department is prepared to pay for, and no unnecessary expense should be incurred in carrying out the actual replastering required. This matter should receive your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL.

(RG 10, Volume 6072, file 303-S, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Paget,\n\nMr. MacKenzie has just sent in the signed pay lists covering the amount of wages paid by him for the repairing of the teachers' residence at the Bush School, Caughnawaga. These have been duly certified to by Indian Agent Letourneau.\n\nI would state for your information that the increased cost of this work was due to the necessity of hiring a man to keep this building continuously heated from the time the plastering was commenced until completely dried, also the distance the materials had to be transported from Lachine to the School building.\n\nThe few materials for which no receipted accounts have been furnished were supplied by the contractor from his stock at the Caughnawaga church.\n\nI beg, therefore, to recommend that a cheque covering the amount of the voucher be sent to the contractor to his address, 141 Waverly St., Ottawa.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nBefore this account can be paid it should be explained what arrangement was entered into with Mr. McKenzie as to the remuneration he was to receive. If he was to be paid on a percentage basis, receipted accounts and pay-lists will be required. The only receipted account submitted amounts to $74.90. No pay-lists for the wages paid are submitted. Please state also how many rooms were plastered and give size of rooms as nearly as possible.\n\nI cannot take the responsibility of paying this account in its present form unless the Deputy approves of it.\n\nChief Accountant.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This state of deterioration became almost intolerable to the teacher until last December when a large portion of the plaster came off in one of the front rooms. It would have been less expensive to have the work partly done, but, this work was urgent and it was necessary to have it thoroughly done while both the material and plasterers were on hand. I may add that it has always been noted that the plaster in this building was never satisfactory. The school teacher has always been complaining about the bad condition of the walls in the various rooms of her residence. I am enclosing herewith voucher No 760 amounting $554.26 in favour of Mr. MacKenzie for the above mentioned work and beg to recommend the same for your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n**Return of Labour on the Refugine to Bush School Carriage**\n\nFor week ended December 27th 1924\n\nAll payments to be made in presence of person signing as witness.\n\n| NAMES          | Mon. | Tue. | Wed. | Thur. | Fri. | Sat. | No. worked | Price per day | Amount of wages | RECEIVED PAYMENT |\n|----------------|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Cain Thomas    | 8    | 8    | 8    |       |      |      |            |               |                 |                  |\n| Cain Bill      | 8    | 8    | 8    |       |      |      |            |               |                 |                  |\n| Hunt Walter    | 8    | 8    | 8    |       |      |      |            |               |                 |                  |\n| Hallamby J     | 8    | 8    | 8    |       |      |      |            |               |                 |                  |\n| Watson Geo.(Ed.)| 8   | 8    | 8    | 8    | 4    | 6    |            |               |                 |                  |\n| Murphy Art.    | 5    | 5    |      |       |      |      |            |               |                 |                  |\n| Watson Geo.

The Department cannot understand why it should be necessary to move the teacher's household effects into the school room. It is thought that any plastering required could have been done without it being necessary to interfere with the classroom work. Please furnish a report as to the amount of plastering that is being done in the teacher's residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that on account of the work recently done by the plasterers at the Teacher's residence, Caughnawaga Bush School, Mrs A. Beuvain, teacher, might not be able to re-open this school until or about the 30th of this month, because all her household effects have been removed from her residence into the school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 15th instant, I beg to say that on or about the 15th ultimo, according to your instructions contained in the letter dated 14th ultimo (Dept. File No. 5-3-8) I had arranged with the plasterers who were at the time working at the Caughnawaga Church to undertake the repairs required at the teacher's Residence at the Bush School on the Caughnawaga Reserve. It had been understood that these repairs to the plaster had to be made in one of the front rooms. On the 9th instant I have been informed that instead of the only one front room repaired, the work had been done in every room of the teacher residence because, according to the man in charge, repairs were required in each room.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 20, 1925.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, regarding the closing of the Bush School on the Caughnawaga Reserve on account of the plastering which is being carried out in connection with the teacher's residence.\n\nRegarding this matter I beg to say that the Department is not aware of the amount of work that is being done. In a letter from Mr. Agent Letourneau dated the 5th of December last, he stated that the plaster was falling off one of the walls of the front room, and he requested authority to have temporary repairs made until next spring when the replastering of the inside of the house would be done. The Agent was authorized to have this temporary work done by one of the plasterers who was working in Caughnawaga village. We were next informed by the Agent that he had ordered a labourer from the village to go and keep the teacher's residence heated for about ten days until the plaster was dry and also to scrub and clean the floors in the building. We had no knowledge that you had moved your furniture into the schoolroom and had left the teacher's residence. It is, therefore, considered in view of the fact that only slight repairs were authorized to the plaster that it was not necessary to engage the services of a man for ten days to keep on fires and do the cleaning. We are not yet aware as to the amount of plastering that has been done. The question of paying for the cleaning of your residence after the plastering is done will receive consideration when we have been informed as to the amount of plastering carried out. In the meantime it is hoped that your residence will be in condition at an early date for you to remove your furniture from the schoolroom and reopen the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

I want the floors to be painted; we will do the work if the Indian Department would supply the paint.

On 26-5-47 information was received from the office of the Indian agent here that someone had smashed the glass in the windows of the above named teachers residence.\n\n2. On 29-5-47 in company with John Bush, caretaker, this writer patrolled on foot to the captioned noted place. It is situated on the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve, near the C.P.R. tracks some 2 miles south east of the village of Caughnawaga. The school and the teachers residence are two separate buildings and have been vacant and unused since June 1946. The area surrounding the school and teachers residence is farmland and there is only one family living within sight of the school and residence.\n\n3. On arriving it was determined that considerable damage had been done to the aforesaid residence. Approximately 50 panes of glass, various sizes, had been smashed. As well, 6 lengths of stovepipe, 2 green window shades, 1 medicine cabinet and 1 small table had been destroyed. Some of the windows had been smashed from the outside and others from the inside. Entrance had been gained by forcing the rear door.\n\n4. Enquiries were made at the home of Jimmie Jacobs who lives within sight of the school. They stated they believed the windows were intact on Sunday May 25th and first noticed they were smashed on Monday May 26th. They were not able to supply any information which would give indication of the party or parties responsible for the damages aforementioned. Two other farmers living some little distance from the school and residence, Mike Day and Frank Goodleaf were also interviewed. Neither was able to give any information as to who was responsible for the incident.\n\n5. The investigation will be continued and some reliable contacts interviewed.

He states that a church, school, residence and teacher are required and would like to know to what extent the Department is prepared to assist in this.\n\nThe Methodist Church will erect the church building but the Dr. thinks the Department should put up the other buildings and maintain the teacher.\n\nI would like a full report on this, showing what churches, schools, residences, teachers, etc., there are now on the Caughnawaga Reserve and a statement in detail showing to what extent the Department is a contributor to the support of these, distinguishing between Band money and Departmental money.\n\nDr. Griffith's address is 17 St. Luke St., Montreal, Que., but he will go to Toronto at the end of this week and a letter addressed to him in care of Dr. R. C. Griffith, 12 Macdonnell Ave., Toronto, will reach him for a week or two afterwards.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nFor the Deputy Supt. General of I.A.\n\nI beg to state that the following are the respective establishments of the Methodist and Roman Catholic Churches as aided by the Department on the Caughnawaga Reserve:\n\nMethodist.... salary of teacher.......$125.00\n\nThis is all the assistance the Department gives to the Methodist Church or any other Protestant denomination upon the Reserve. The attendance is 20 on the roll and an average attendance of 7. The school is held in a building either owned or rented by the Church authorities in which they also conduct evangelical services. Our census returns show that there are 31 Methodists upon the Reserve.\n\nThe Roman Catholics have a large stone Church and a commodious residence for the Priest, and two school buildings. The building for the boys' school is a two-story edifice of stone, and the girls' school is a frame building with school room on the first floor and rooms for the teacher on the second. The Church and the Presbytery were not erected from funds of the Dominion of Canada. The schools were built partly from Indians funds and partly from grants by the Dominion. We provide the salaries of four teachers as follows:\n\nBoys' School, 1 teacher........... $65.00\nAssistant teacher.................. $30.00\nGirls' School, 1 teacher.......... $50.00\nAssistant teacher.................. $50.00\n\nThe attendance of the boys' school is 126 on the roll, average 40; the girls' school, 38 on the roll and average attendance 43. There are 1,984 Roman Catholic Indians on the Reserve.\n\n(OVER)\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nIn view of the very small following the Methodist Church has upon this Reserve, I think the Department is doing all it is called upon to do by furnishing the salary of a teacher. I think that this salary should be increased to $500.00, and that beyond that amount no aid should be given.\n\nDr. Griffith asked for a great deal more than this, but it is not the custom of the Department to ask for an appropriation of public funds to assist any church in its missionary work. Whatever funds are provided for a church and residence must, therefore, come from the Exchequer of the Church. To my mind it is a question which should be very carefully treated; when there are so few Methodist Indians upon the Reserve, we might easily create the impression that we are endeavouring to proselytize, and it is almost certain that the impression would get abroad upon the Reserve that the Department is using not only Government funds but Indian funds for this purpose.\n\nI would therefore beg to recommend that the salary of the school teacher be increased to $500.00, with the understanding that the teacher is to be fully qualified, and that no assistance be given to other Church work or school buildings on the Reserve.\n\nAccountant.\n\nOTTAWA, July 16th-1903.,\nDept. of I.A.\nReverend Dr. Griffith of Montreal, who I believe succeeds the Reverend Dr. Williams as Superintendent of Methodist Missions for the Montreal District, called here a few days ago and asked that further assistance be given by the Department in connection with educational work on the Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nOur Census returns show that there are 31 Methodists on the Reserve, the number on the school roll being 20 with an average attendance of 7. The school is held in a building either owned or rented by the Church authorities, in which they also conduct religious services. We pay a teacher for this school $125.00.\n\nOn the other hand there are 1,984 Roman Catholic Indians on the Reserve and they have a large stone church, a commodious...\na commodious residence for the priest and two school buildings. The church and presbytery were not erected from funds of the Government but the schools were built partly from Indian funds and partly from grants by the Dominion.\n\nFor the Roman Catholics we provide four teachers, as follows:\n\nBoys' School, 1 teacher $450.00\n\" \" , Assistant Teacher 300.00\nGirls' School, 1 teacher 300.00\n\" \" , Assistant Teacher 200.00\n\nTotal $1250.00\n\nAt the boys' school there are 126 on the roll, average attendance 40, at the girls' 88 on the roll, average attendance 43.\n\nDr. Griffith states that it is the intention of his Church to extend their work on this Reserve and for this purpose a church, school, residence and teacher are required. He states the church will erect a church building but thinks the Department should put up the other buildings and maintain the teacher.\n\nI presume that there is no question that the Department will not assist in the church buildings and it is doubtful how far it would be advisable to assist in the erection of a school house where the number of pupils is necessarily so limited.\nso limited. I think though, that it is not unreasonable to ask that the school teacher's salary should be raised to $300.00 provided that he is fully qualified, and if this meets with your approval I will have the necessary action taken.\n\nAs Dr. Griffith is now in Toronto to discuss this, among other things, with his Board he asks for an early reply.\nDear Mr. Redley,\n\nI have been looking for your promised letter re Canadnawaga Indian School & Mohawk Administrative Meeting here on Friday afternoon at 3 o'clock and it is most important for me to have your Communication before then. In looking over the reports of your Department I find the salary you pay teachers is almost invariably three hundred or at the rate of $300 per year. The matter of school house we are very anxious to own the property. We are quite willing the government should own it all we want is a building to work in. I think there is a disposition to take up the work with vigor. I hope you will be able to advise me by return mail or tomorrow if you have not time to communicate by letter.\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nRev. Thomas Griffiths\n\nP.S. I did not get your Christian name & will have to trust to an imperfect address. T.C.\nOttawa, July 22nd, 1905.\n\nDear Dr. Griffith,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the 8th instant, with reference to the application for increased assistance by this Department in connection with educational work on the Caughnawaga Reserve, and to say that since your interview here a few days ago the matter has been under the careful consideration of the Department and it is regretted that at present it is impossible to contribute anything further for this work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nReverend Thomas Griffith,\n786 Queen St. West,\nToronto, Ontario.\nMontreal, August 27th, 1903\n\nRev. Thos. Griffith, Ph.D., Pastor\nDouglas Methodist Church\nParsonage, 17 St. Luke Street\n\nMr. Bailey Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nIndian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of the 27th ultimo reached me in due course. However, I have been unable to respond earlier.\n\nYour reply was a great disappointment to me in many ways. It seems that as far as the Indian School is concerned, there has been good work done by the desire of the people & hence their children attend this school. It is true there are some Catholics attending but it is because they consider it a good opportunity or not affiliated with any one.\n\nWe have a roll of about thirty-five more than fifty have attended our school regularly\u2014some of them only occasionally. But there is a good average school and we mean to have a first class teacher for the work. Surely you are willing to give some reasonable degree of support & enable us to earn five hundred dollars is already an extraordinary amount. Your blue book shows a salary of $500 per year in addition to expenses, or at least half of the year. If you can't provide for us, we will find another place. We will continue our plea by word of mouth. Our trustees are willing but cannot have a teacher and we will supplement this and secure a pool one.\n\nThis is so Donald & request your help. Sure it will be taken as a great favor without hesitation or delay. Better promptly. We urge you to come again. We will be most grateful.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Dr. Griffith of Montreal on behalf of the school conducted by the Methodist Missionary Society on the Caughnawaga Reserve, I beg to say that this Department is already paying the sum of $125.00 per annum to the Missionary Society as a contribution towards the maintenance of this school.\n\nTwo years ago when the Department took over the schools which had been carried on under the auspices of the Methodist Missionary Society in Ontario the schools in operation by the Methodists in the Province of Quebec were purposely left out of this arrangement. If the Department were called upon to pay the full salary of a teacher of the Caughnawaga Methodist school it could only do so on the understanding that it would become undenominational and I claim that there is no need for an undenominational school on this reserve as all the members of the Caughnawaga Band which numbers 2017 are all Roman Catholics, with the exception of two Anglicans and thirty-one Methodists.\n\nThere are two large Roman Catholic Schools on the reserve with two teachers for each school and it is doubtful to my mind whether the Department would be justified in maintaining a protestant school for the small number of Indian children who are not Roman Catholics.\n\nDr. Griffith claims that they have about thirty children.\nchildren on the roll and that more than fifty have attended with more or less regularity. The annual report for last year shows the average attendance to have been only five, which would include nearly all the children of school age on the Reserve.\n\nIt seems to me that the Methodist Church is carrying on a school on this reserve on sufferance and I think the Department has gone as far as it would be justified in going in allowing the grant that they now receive.\n\nI may call your attention to the fact that the Rev. Dr. Sutherland, as General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society has charge of all the Indian School work carried on by the Methodists, and any applications for increased grants should, properly speaking, come through him.\nOttawa, 15th September, 1903.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 27th ultimo in further reference to your application for increased assistance to the educational work carried on by the Methodist Missionary Society on the Caughnawaga Reserve, and in reply I beg to say that as you have already been informed the Department regrets that nothing can be done at present to meet your wishes in this direction.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRev.

To avoid the danger of spreading the disease on the one hand and prevent needless delay in opening the school on the other, I shall beg that you will appoint a medical officer to examine the children concerned.\n\nYours most respectfully,\n\nRev. Wm. Timberlake.\nOttawa, September 16, 1908.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Timberlake, President of the Montreal Conference of the Methodist Church, has applied for the appointment of a medical officer to examine the children enrolled at the Methodist school on the Caughnawaga reserve. He says that the school has not been reopened since the summer holidays on account of the prevalence of measles, and to avoid the danger of the spread of the disease and prevent needless delay in reopening the school, he makes this application. This is the first official intimation we have had of an outbreak of measles on the reserve. The three Roman Catholic schools have opened and I can see no reason why the Methodist school should not have started at the regular time. The Methodist missionary and the teacher should have been able to find out what families, if any, are affected and order them to stay away from the school.\n\nThe children are better at school than running loose on the reserve and less liable to contract the disease. We have no regular medical officer on the reserve as the Indians generally are able to look after themselves in this respect, and I do not see why the Department should be called upon to pay for examining 35 or 30 pupils. I think Mr. Timberlake might be advised accordingly.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The two Roman Catholic schools in the village were opened after the summer holidays at the usual time, and the Department considers that the Methodist school should also have been reopened at the same time, as it was only necessary to keep children away who were affected.

Sir,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of the 25th of June, 1909, in which you called attention to the fact that the two teachers at Oka and the one at Caughnawaga were in receipt of smaller salaries than any other similar employees, and asked for an increase of $50.00 in each case, stating that you would be prepared to bear your share of the advance. I beg to remind you that these are the schools in which one-half of the salary is paid by this Department and one-half by the Missionary Society.\n\nAn officer of this Department, who was in Caughnawaga last week, requested the teacher to state the exact amount of salary she is receiving. She replied that she is paid at the rate of $250.00 a year. As this Department has been sending you a cheque for $68.75 every quarter since the first of July, last, for the teacher of this school, it considers it is only fair that she should receive the whole of that amount, in addition to whatever your society considers its half of the salary.\n\nI am glad to say that the Department is in receipt of a very favourable report on the Methodist school in this village, now in charge of Miss Young, who is a capable teacher and worthy of a much better salary than she is now in receipt of.\n\nThe Department will continue to pay at the rate of $275.00 as its portion of the contribution to Miss Young's\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\nsalary, if you will agree to make it up to $400.00 and pay\nthe difference.

McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Sir:\n\nFor some time I have been wondering what I could do for the good of the people here. At last I have thought of a plan I cannot carry out (if the people would be willing) without help from you. I will tell you my plan, then in what way I want you to help.\n\nIt is this: to organize a Girls club to meet once a week, charge a small fee for running expenses such as lighting & room, or other expenses that might arise. If any sickness I could teach them...\nknitting or fancy work so far as I know myself; or we might do bead work sell it and buy materials to make some gifts for the poor children of the place to be remembered at another Christmas gathering. Once a month we could have harmless games, as young people must have amusement, and I would like to keep them away from such amusement as dancing and card parties if possible. We also could have sewing as they seem very fond of it.\n\nOf course after talking it over with the people, new ways of working might arise but this will give you some idea of what I want to do.\nNow I have no place of meeting the girls. The help I would ask you to give me would be to allow us to meet in the school-room.\n\nDo you approve of my plan? Of course they might not come but I do want to try and do something for the Indians who once before have I tried to gather the young people together to teach them fancy work, that alone did not appeal to them, but I think the idea of the club working for the poor children of Saginawagay would inspire them to work.\n\nOne more question as I am...\nwriting, for a couple of years I have been wondering what literature I could get on the Indians. In all, this will be my seventh year among them, and I don't know as much about the Indians as I ought, or as I would like. I also think I should tell the school children more about their own race than what comes up in their studies.\n\nHave you a circulating library on the Indians' work or Indian people? I should say? If so, what are the conditions, and would you be willing to send the books so far away?\n\nI wanted to write about the books before, but I know you are very busy people, and did\nI don't want to trouble you too much, but I had to write you about the use of the school, as I did not feel it would be right for me to use it without first getting your permission.\n\nIf you have any suggestions to offer, they would be most gladly received.\n\nThanking you in advance for your trouble in answering this letter,\n\nI am\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nC.W. Young\nOttawa, January 11, 1911.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department will be very pleased to have you organize a girls' club on the Caughnawaga reserve to meet once a week. The school-room will be placed at your disposal for this purpose and the Department is prepared to bear the expenditure, to a limited extent, for the lighting of the room and the purchase of the necessary material with which to teach sewing, etc. I have to ask you to be good enough to submit an estimate of the cost of the material that you would require.\n\nIn reference to the library I regret to say that the Department has no circulating library which could be placed at your disposal.\n\nFurther information in regard to reports, etc., will be given you when you write concerning the material and meanwhile you may commence holding your meetings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMiss E. M. Young,\nTeacher,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, January 11, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the teacher of the Protestant school on the Chughnawaga reserve has been authorized to use the school building for the purpose of a girls' club which will hold meetings on one evening each week.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

It has worried me so much and yet I did not see what else I could do in the face of all.\n\nOn Friday at 3 Jan. 13th I got a message from Syracuse saying my sister was dying and to come.\n\nI did not know what to do. I wanted to see her before she died and I knew she wanted to see me, yet leaving school troubled me. Though I would\nnot even think of leaving without making up for lost time. Friday P.M. The agent called, I told him about the message and asked him if he thought I could go intended of course coming back on Monday. He said he did not think the Dept would mind so that I had already taught Labor Day so I felt Monday was made up anyway but even so though it would be made up, it was going away without first getting your permission that troubled me but it all happened so suddenly that I did not know what to do and if I went I must go on the evening train.\nWhen I got there I found things in a troubled state and sister died Sunday with funeral Wednesday & Monday. Then I still intended coming Monday but my brother was so worn out and half sick himself from sitting up at night and his grief was so great he asked if I could not stay that week. I told him I had not a chance of getting permission from the Department of Indian Affairs and they would suppose I was teaching just to have them in that state seemed so hard. I tried to think of someone to take my place, and if I could get one.\nI did not think you would mind quite so much.\n\nThere was a Protestant Indian here Mr. John R. Splicer who had taught in an Indian school some time before (there were no others here who had taught) and wired him to take it this week, also to wire answer. His answer was \"your request is granted\" and he remained until last night (Friday) So Monday there was no school, Tuesday Wednesday, Thursday and Friday Mr. Splicer taught for me.\n\nDid I do right in this case? It troubled me so because I would never give up school for anything before unless I had\nTo close on account of the building being needed for the church services, for as I said I was only a servant and my duty was to do my work first. This thought was in the case of death.\n\nWhat do you think about what I have done? Did I do wrong or do you think I had a right to do it in that case?\n\nPlease write me no matter what the answer may be for it has worried me so much I have often wished I had the Department near.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Timberlake:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant re Miss Young. By all means pay her salary in full to the end of the term. I am deeply grieved at the information which you have given about Miss Young's health. She has become known to us during the past year as one of the most effective teachers in connection with the entire Indian work in Canada. This is indeed a great loss to the Indian work and I fear that it will be very difficult to replace here. As I have not her home address I would be greatly obliged if you will convey to her the deep sympathy of the officers of the Missionary Society and our gratitude for her faithful and earnest service during the years in which she has taught the school at Caughnawaga.\n\nI believe that you will be able to do more in Montreal towards securing an efficient teacher for this school than I can do in Toronto. It is the province of the Missionary Society to nominate the teachers for the schools in connection with our Methodist Missions. If you require to do some advertising for the securing of a teacher for this school, we will be responsible for this expense. Kindly let me have the correspondence which you may receive from applicants.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nT. E. Egerton Shore.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Shore, M.A., B.D.,\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto:\n\nDear Mr. Shore:\n\nMiss E. May Young, who has so satisfactorily taught our school for so many years at Caughnawaga, has been obliged to give up her school in consequence of ill health. I advised her to get a supply if possible for the last two or three weeks of the term. She tried and failed. Evidently she has tuberculosis. The Inspector visited her school early in June and told her to close the school at once. I secured for her an examination in the King Edward Institute for tuberculosis patients, and tried to get her admitted as a patient, but as she was anxious to go to her home, the doctor thought it best for her to go and so she has gone. I fear she will never return. For this I am very sorry. She loved the Indians and devoted her life to their improvement. Until two years ago she received but $250 per year, and I would be glad if I might be permitted to send to her the $40.00 for the month of June. The schools about here close on the 21st, the day before the Coronation, so that it would not be a very great act of generosity after so many years of such splendid service to pay her in full. In the city here a teacher is allowed full pay for ten days in a year if sick and half pay for forty more days. Since I have had charge of the school the last three years Miss Young has not before lost a day through sickness. I hope, therefore, I may have your consent to pay her in full. She needs and deserves it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) Wm. Timberlake.\n\nP.S. I had sent in my schedule before I knew of Miss Young's illness and reported as paid out the full year's grant, as in the case of the other teachers.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter #152218-1, dated September 18th. I have to say that I had no knowledge whatever of Miss Stevens' appointment as teacher of the Caughnawaga Protestant school until I received the information through your letter.\n\nIn connection with the Methodist Church we have a system of organization, which includes Chairman of Districts. Rev. William Timberlake of Montreal is the Chairman of the Montreal District, which includes a considerable district outside of the city of Montreal, as well as the city itself. Mr. Timberlake is therefore in touch with the work of our Church at the Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nI received a letter from Mr. Timberlake on June 15th, to which I replied on the same day. I enclose herewith copies of the two letters I sent, so that you may have before you the circumstances of Miss Young's retirement from the school and the instructions which I gave to Mr. Timberlake in connection with securing applications for the school. You will note that I requested Mr. Timberlake to forward to me the correspondence which he would receive from applicants. I regret to say that I have not received any of the correspondence.\n\nI am writing to Mr. Timberlake today, requesting a statement of the case, and drawing his attention to the procedure which I requested him to follow and also to the fact that it was not within his jurisdiction to make the appointment of the teacher.

Egerton Shore, M.A., B.D.,\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto.\n\nDear Mr. Shore\u2014\n\nAs I was out of the city during August, I asked the Rev. E. S. Morrison, who for nine years had charge of our Indian Mission at Oka, now in the city, to advertise for a teacher, stating that the salary would be $400.00. He received several applications, forwarded them to me, and I made the selection of Miss Stevens, and returned to him the correspondence in case she might need it. When your letter of the 26th ultimo came to hand, I at once wrote him for the necessary papers; and by the very same mail that these arrived I received a letter from Miss Stevens, stating that owing to letters she had received from the Department, she had closed the school and was going home. I at once wrote her, expressing my sorrow that she had so done, as there was no need for such a step, and asking her to let me know without delay if she were willing to continue the school, and it is only within the last hour that I heard from her. For some reason my letter did not reach her at the right time and she has just phoned to say she is willing to continue. She evidently misunderstood the enquiries of the Department and regarded them as undue interference, and needlessly felt insulted. Miss Stevens sent to me the last letter she received from the Department. It was very courteous, simply asking by whose authority she was teaching and stating just what you had told me, that it was the province of the Board to nominate and of the Department to affirm and appoint, also that she necessary information was probably in possession of the Board, but had not reached the Department, that when it came through the proper channel the nomination would no doubt be approved, and wishing her success in her work.\n\nI am enclosing the application of Miss Stevens, and her credentials, also Mr. Morrison's acceptance of her application. The salary agreed upon according to advertisement was $400.00. No further agreement was signed. Miss Stevens will return to her school on Monday morning.\n\nI am sorry for this irregularity, but as I said in my last letter, I never before heard of the Department having anything to do with the engagement of teachers, and I had overlooked the reference to it in your letter.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gertrude Thomson of Crapaud, P.E.I., as teacher for this school. Miss Thomson is a qualified teacher with Normal training, successful experience and good recommendations; she also possesses considerable musical ability. Her family connections, social standing and personal character are all satisfactory. In addition, she has a special interest in Indian work and I believe that the Department would find her in every way a desirable person and efficient teacher to put in charge of the school at Caughnawaga.\n\nIn making this nomination, I beg to call to the attention of the Department, the fact that the salary previously paid to the teacher at Caughnawaga was exceedingly small. With the present cost of living, it is well nigh impossible for a young person living away from home to make reasonable provision for herself on $400.00 a year. The former teacher at Caughnawaga was a member of the missionary's family and therefore placed in a somewhat more advantageous position. With the prospect of securing the sort of teacher for this position whom I think we have in Miss Thomson, I hope that the Department will be able to give favorable consideration to the question of increasing the salary of the teacher of the Caughnawaga school to say $500.00 per year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

The Protestant community there is already very small, and does not seem to be growing. The position of either teacher or missionary seems scarcely adequate as an occupation for a capable person, and the expense to both the Indian Department and the Missionary Society seems considerable for the amount of service rendered. It has been proposed that we should withdraw our resident missionary and supply the work from some other point. This arrangement, however, would seem to make it impossible to secure a teacher who would live there in the absence of any other White family. In fact, we have already experienced considerable trouble in keeping a teacher at this point. Without having reached any definite conclusion, I am enquiring as to the probable attitude of the Department in case we find it possible to secure a suitable married man who would take full charge of the work as missionary-teacher. The combined expenditure would afford sufficient remuneration for the full time of a man with satisfactory qualifications in both directions.\n\nI may say that we are now making enquiries as to\nthe probable fitness and availability of the present missionary, Mr. J. K. Matthews for this work. Mr. Matthews has taken a real interest in the people, and within the limits of his opportunity has been a rather successful missionary. He has, however, been carrying on this work while attending college in Montreal. He is now finishing his college course and it has been suggested to me that he might make a very desirable man for the dual position, if his services could be secured. I am putting this forward, not as a recommendation, but in order that the Department may be possessed of all the facts, and in a position to make any independent enquiry into the situation which may be deemed advisable.\n\nOn the general question of adopting the policy of a married missionary-teacher for Caughnawaga, I should be glad of an expression of opinion from the Department before taking any definite action.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJHA/M.\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nJ.

G. Thomson:\n\n\"I believe Mr. Radley mentioned in a letter to you my dilemma regarding my plans for next year. I would like very much to return, but the salary seems insufficient. I love my work at the Village, and frankly I have nothing else in view for the ensuing year. Circumstances have made me rather late in placing my position before you, but in view of the great increase in the cost of living since I took up my work two years ago, I think I must make this try for a change for the better. You will know if there is any chance of the necessary increase in salary, or if there is any other position, more satisfactory financially, open to me.\"\n\nThe question herewith presented is one which only the Department can answer. Every report which has reached me from representatives of either the Indian Department or the Missionary Society is uniformly favorable to Miss Thomson. She has training, ability and to an unusual degree a personal interest in all that concerns the children under her care. I should personally very much regret the loss of her services, and shall await with keen interest your decision as to what increase, if any, the Department is able to endorse. I am of the opinion that a salary of $600 would be satisfactory to Miss Thomson for the present, but one can scarcely hope to secure any competent teacher at a lower rate.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D.

Smith to the Protestant School on the Caughnawaga Reserve is to hand. The explanation is as follows:\n\nOwing to their distance from our office and certain conditions which bring their work into very close relation to that of the Church, the Missionary Society has followed the plan of having the schools at Caughnawaga and Oka looked after by the chairman of the Montreal South District of the Methodist Church. According to former practice, the former chairman has corresponded directly with the Department on a number of matters including the appointment of teachers, although of course keeping in touch with the office of the Missionary Society.\n\nSome time before Christmas I was notified by the Rev. Robert Smith that Miss Thomson, the former teacher, was likely to leave the Caughnawaga School. Later there arrived a similar notice from the Department, accompanied by the recommendation of the inspector that the school should be closed. About the same time I received further information from the chairman of the District that Miss Etta Smith had been secured as teacher. She is not, as the name might suggest, a member of the family of the chairman, Rev. Robert Smith. Owing to our practice as reported at the beginning of this letter, I am not surprised that a teacher had been appointed without the matter being definitely submitted to me. In fact I was rather relieved to find that the work was done. It did not occur to me that the nomination had not been submitted to the Indian Department in the regular way. On thinking over the matter I find that there has been no change of teacher in this school since Rev. Mr. Smith became chairman of the Montreal South District, which accounts for the fact that he was not aware of the exact form of procedure in this matter, and so engaged Miss Smith instead of submitting her name in nomination to the Indian Department.\n\nI am writing this explanation without an opportunity of consulting Mr. Smith but from my knowledge of the circumstances I am sure that it is the correct one. I will send a copy of this letter to him in order that my statements may be confirmed or corrected. He will also be able to furnish a statement of the qualifications of the teacher.\n\nJ. D.

(RG 10, Volume 6073, file 304-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIn connection with this whole matter, allow me to say that the Executive Committee of the Missionary Society, which was in session last week, considered the question of closing both the school and mission at Caughnawaga, and gave authority to a small committee, of which Rev. Mr. Smith and myself are members, to go into the whole matter and take such action as their investigations seemed to warrant. I am going to Montreal in less than two weeks and soon after that time hope to be in Ottawa in order to discuss the matter personally with representatives of the Indian Department. In the meantime, I hope that this explanation may be accepted and the present temporary arrangement at Caughnawaga allowed to continue until we have an opportunity to furnish the Department with a personal report.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary.\nOttawa, February 4, 1919.\n\nRev.

A. George MacKinnon, Minister of St. Andrew's Church, Lachine, Que., making inquiry regarding one of our schools on the Caughnawaga Indian reserve, and stating that on the invitation of the Protestant people of the Indian village he had visited them and conducted a religious service.\n\nThe school to which he refers is one owned by the Department. It was closed last year for lack of attendance and at a later date the Methodist Church, under whose auspices the school had been conducted, withdrew from the mission field on that reserve. The building was unoccupied for some time and this year the Department decided to utilize it for a Continuation Class, the object being to provide a commercial course for Indian boys and girls who had completed their studies in the other schools of the village. Mr. MacKinnon appears to think that the Department handed this building over to the nuns; such however is not the case. The Department previously owned and still owns the building. I may add that all the village schools in Caughnawaga are taught by the Sisters of Ste. Anne.\n\nWe are very well acquainted with conditions on this reserve and we know that there are few, if any, consistent Protestant families.

Protestant children attending are given every facility to practise their own religion, and no effort is being made to retain them in the classrooms during the religious exercises conducted by the Sisters.\n\nI might add, for your information, that school matters on the Caughnawaga Reserve are controlled entirely by the Department of Indian Affairs, and all expenses in connection with the system are met by the Parliamentary Appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Me\n\nLawyer\n\nMontreal\n\n24th July 1923\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing to you today to inform you that there is a possibility of the people there getting a public school. I wrote you last summer on the matter and your reply was that the situation there was quite satisfactory. I knew that such was not the case but could not at that time see any use of entering into any direct with the government.\n\nHowever I personally know a large number of people who are not satisfied to be forced to attend.\na Catholic school.\n\nThere are a few plain and important reasons why they are right in this matter. First, it is contrary to the spirit of religious and political liberty for people to be forced by law to adhere to principles to which their mind cannot subscribe.\n\nSecond, the result in mental accomplishments is not satisfactory. There is so much time taken up with religious formalities in the school, that the true object of instruction is not attained. In ordinary everyday language\u2014child of fourteen stand where children of nine ought to stand as to natural rank. That is they are retarded about five years in\ntheir progress.\n\nLooking back over the past sixty years, from the time of thirty-five to thirty-eight years, I see that most of those I knew cannot read or write simple letters, much less understand mathematics, grammar, literature.\n\nPlease try to visualize yourself as being deprived of the joy of intellectual achievement. The pleasure derived from art and literature and having to pass through life with all these chambers of the mind empty would be absolutely shocking and painful.\n\nThere is a chance now to let the light into the minds of the present generation.\n\nProviding the language Indians can do so, I am sure that they are capable of\nbecoming the very finest type of citizen if given the proper chance. I am ready to do anything in my power to help them. I am a school teacher at the old school. Know my subjects absolutely, and have had years of experience in training the child mind. So I know what I am talking about.\n\nI am also a descendant of the race. Having a generous streak of their blood flowing in my veins. I would like nothing better than to live in my lot with them for the rest of my life. I am a graduate of the New...\nEnglant Conservatory of Music, Boston, Mass.\n\nI play the organ and will choir, teach piano & harmony or play numerically well. In fact anything my money acquaintances I do not know anyone as well fitted as myself to help in such a matter. If you come to Longman's I wrote I could arrange to see you. You can reach me by telephone at St. Louis, 2792. Any day at home practically all the time. I enclose an original letter from the Lawrence Church - N. Alberta. I wish you would have heard. Please return it. Close give this matter.\nyou cannot attend personally. I can try to take through the laws of governmental ceremony to catch your attention and any time something radical will be done.\n\nI understand that a representation of the Catholic Church has lately been trying to prevent action in this matter. Will you not listen in this case to the small or weak minority, who are nevertheless persistent in their right of doing anything?\n\nVery sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This Department is quite well acquainted with conditions at Caughnawaga, and we know that there are very few consistent Protestant families.

(RG 10, Volume 6073, file 304-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 20th instant, with regard to a request for the re-establishment of a Protestant school in Caughnawaga, I beg to enclose herewith a statement as to the age of each of the twenty-five children mentioned in your letter, the recognized religious status of their parents and the approximate location of their homes in the Indian village or Reserve of Caughnawaga; also as to the membership of the parents to their Reserve. I may add that I have prepared this list with an entire impartiality and considerable care. It has been impossible for me to find out the exact age of the protestant children because it seems that there is no registers of birth or baptism available in Caughnawaga for them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA\nOttawa, August 30th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, with enclosure, being a statement relative to certain children mentioned in official communication of this file number of the 20th instant.\n\nI have to thank you for the despatch with which you have prepared this comprehensive and satisfactory report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\nOttawa, August 30th, 1923.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have to refer further to petition received by the Department on the 15th instant, in which certain Methodist members of the Caughnawaga Indian band asked for the establishment of an undenominational school.\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. Agent Letourneau has made a comprehensive report, and I wish to acquaint you with the Department's opinion that there is not a sufficient number of Indian children of the band, of school age, of bona fide Protestant faith, to warrant the establishment of a separate school.\n\nI wish to refer in detail to the parents who signed the petition in question:\n\nAngus Skye is the guardian of but one child between the ages of 7 and 15, inclusive, viz: Angus Skye, his grandson, who is reported to be a Roman Catholic.\n\nJoe Norton has three children of school age, Marie, Florence and Minnie. These are recognized as Protestants, but our Representative reports a rumor current in the band that they intend to become Roman Catholics at their majority.\n\nThos. Patton has one child, Helen, of school age, and he is recognized as a Roman Catholic by our Agent.\n\nPeter J. Montour's children, Jacques and Michael, are considered Protestants, in view of certain documentary evidence submitted in the past. The Indian Agent, however, considers the family Roman Catholic, and as you are, no doubt, aware the two boys attended the Spanish Residential School and most likely imbibed religious opinions at that time.\n\nMike Johnson has two children of school age, Nora and Paul. The Department is prepared to recognize Nora's religion as Protestant, in the light of earlier correspondence, but Paul is reported to have continued attendance at the Roman Catholic services, and our Representative considers the family as Roman Catholic.\n\nMessrs. L. Swan and Thos. Patton,\nCaughnawaga,\nQue.\n\n- Jas. Nolan -\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6073, file 304-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nJas. Nolan has one child, Rose, of school age, and is recognized as a Protestant.\n\nJas. Phillips has four children of school age, but he is reported to be a sincere Roman Catholic.\n\nAngus Horne, with his family, are no longer resident at Caughnawaga.\n\nH. Moses is situated over four miles from Caughnawaga Village Schools, and appears to have only one child in any case.\n\nA recapitulation of the above statements shows that there are three children of Joe Norton, one child of Mike Johnson and one child of Jas. Nolan, who would attend a Protestant school regularly. The grandson of H. Moses is too far away to attend regularly, and the children of Peter J. Montour are doubtful Protestant. It is the Department's opinion that there is not a sufficient number of Protestant children on the Caughnawaga reserve to make a separate school success. I regret to inform you that favourable consideration cannot be given to the petition submitted on the 15th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nDear sir: In replying to your letter Aug. 30th #551 in answer to our petition regarding the establishment of an undenominational school in Caughnawaga. Permit me to say that we consider the Indian Agent's report being most unsatisfactory, unfair, and unjust.\n\nUnsatisfactory in that he did not consult any of the families herein mentioned as to their views on the matter. Not one single person was approached individually to ascertain their wishes. Unfair and unjust because he stated his own private opinions and based a number of his reports upon mere rumors. Furthermore we know that the agent is entirely partial to the Catholic church, and for that reason we cannot expect him to give a fair report in any matters, not pertaining to Catholicism.\n\nMichael Skye, son of Angus Skye, and father of two (not one) children of school age, named Angus & Josephine, stated to me today that he does not intend to send his children any longer to the Catholic school.\nNow re. J. Norton, we find that you representatives of the Government of Canada recognize the immature reasonings of a child rather than the legal authority of a parent who alone has absolute control over said children until they are of age. What they do after that has no bearing on the present question. Besides, the father is well known as being a strict Protestant.\n\nRe. Thos. Patton, The agent's decision in this case is a most flagrant distortion of the truth. Because Thos. Patton has formally withdrawn his name from the Catholic Church's records and is a consistent member of the Protestant Congregation, and wishes his children to have only Protestant instruction. This is supposed to be a free country, and surely if he wishes to be a Protestant, there is no law that can force him to still remain a Catholic.\n\nMonsieur Peter J. Montour's case, we admit that in the past they did attend the Spanish school. But we think you should recognize the fact that at the present time, Mr. Montour is sending his children to a Protestant school in Montreal, and in the event of a like school opening here, would send them to this school. May be ask what bearing any religious opinions they may have exhibited in the past has upon the question at issue? We could just as easily say, well, they are exhibiting Protestant opinions now.\nIn Mike Johnson's case, we notice you base your decision upon a mere rumor that one child attended Catholic services. His mother today states that this is not the case, and in any event the parents' authority should have prior recognition, rather than the probable chance going and coming of a child. The parents are the most eager and only in looking forward to a protestant school, and we might add they have three children of school age (instead of two) more, namely Victor who will be 7 yrs. old on the 8th of this Feb.\n\nRev. J. Phillips, the very fact that he has signed the petition is sufficient evidence to show that he wants a school established wherein his children can get protestant training. He also requested the priest to take his name away from the Catholic church records.\n\nIn Mr. Moses' case, in event a school is being established, there is no doubt but what he would arrange to have the chief board with relatives in town, so that the child would be able to regularly attend this school.\n\nWe also wish to state that a large number of families not mentioned in this petition have expressed a desire for a protestant school, and have stated that in event one opening here, they would send their children there.\n\nTherefore we can positively state that there is a sufficient number of children ready to attend school to fulfill the requirements of the law.\nFurthermore we wish to add, that the present members of the protestant congregation are going up in a body to the prairies, and request to have their names taken off their records.\n\nSo that in future the priest or agent may not be able to take advantage of this mere technicality.\n\nIn conclusion we would say we cannot accept your decision as final.\n\nForeseeing our petition, we request that your Department send down a representative to interview each petitioner individually.\n\nWe are ready to go to the extent of making a sworn affidavit, as to the truth every statement contained herein.\n\nRequesting you will let us know at your earliest convenience, what is to become,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nThos. Patton.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nThos. Patton, Esq.,\nCaughnawaga,\nQue.\nTeachers' Residence,\nGaughanwage, Que., Sept.12, 1933.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nPlease pardon the liberty I take in writing you concerning a very puzzling question, but your great kindness, your courtesy to dear Sister Mary Gabriel, former Principal, the interest you take in our work, your appreciation of the untiring efforts and the heroic patience of the Sisters, and, above all, the interest and welfare of our Indian schools, your encouraging reports, make me feel I can approach you with confidence.\n\nSome people have been carrying a campaign of proselytizing in the village and some weak-minded Roman Catholics have abandoned the Church or are wavering. Such a course of action is very contrary to a settlement. Willing Catholic Indians may be specimens of any other faith and in the end they will turn out to be pagans. I have the deepest respect for Non-Catholics, but I have no use for those who change religion to suit their whims and their fancies. Therefore a few apostates have been sent to a Protestant school. Yesterday Mr. George, Mr. Leboeuf, Mr. Fournier, Mr. James Habourne, Mr. Montreal, came together over the duties lately performed by you; and undoubtedly he will decide whether or not the Protestant school shall be opened.\n\nI must admit, Mr. Gilman, I do not know what to think of that movement. Why should a perfect stranger to the condition of affairs and a mentality of the flickled Indians attempt to straighten our difficulties that are revolving themselves and that were so well settled by you, January 20, 1930. Allow me to relate a sentence in your letter of the above date when you ordered the school to be closed. You said: \"It was useless and a waste of funds.\" Can it be possible that after many years of strenuous work to train the children, to lead them to do what is good, just and honorable, we will have to turn out forty-eight little children of between six and ten years old to give room to six renegades and four Protestants? I am sure the Government does not realize what a source of trouble and disorder it may lead to. Our children, in general, inherit the warlike disposition of their fathers and always eager for a revolt; therefore, at the least little imposition of ideas they will throw to the Protestant school.\n\nDear Sir, I hope you will not think I have gone beyond my limits in communicating to you my feelings concerning the matter in question. I have taken my task at heart since the moment of my appointment to the office of\nPrincipal and it is my earnest desire to work in accordance with the requests of the Government and to continue the wonderful work being done in our Schools, and I count on the support of the Officials of the Department.\n\nAt any time you or any gentlemen of the Council wish to visit us, you will be most heartily welcome.\n\nMight I ask you to be good enough to relieve me in my anxiety as soon as possible.\n\nWith sentiments of profound respect,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSister Mary Rose (signature)\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Luther A. Gilman,\nCowansville,\nQue.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, Que., Sept.14, 1925.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nLast week, you wrote to Mr. Agent Letourneau to inform me that Mr. James Kabon was to visit our schools.\n\nI wrote Mr. Gilman concerning the matter, and knowing your hearty co-operation in our work, I feel I should send you a copy.\n\nHoping that I will have the pleasure of meeting you in the near future,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSister Mary Rose Alma\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Sept. 17, 1923.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, relative to the appointment of Mr. James Mabon to the position of Inspector of Indian Schools at Caughnawaga. I have read the enclosed copy of your letter to Mr. Inspector Gilman who, because of ill health, is unable to continue his duties.\n\nI hasten to assure you that the question of the re-establishment of a Protestant school at Caughnawaga is outside the province of Mr. Mabon's duties. An officer from the Department will be in Caughnawaga in the very near future, to look into the subject matter of certain petitions that have reached Ottawa of late. The Protestant school was closed in 1919, after careful consideration by the Methodist Missionary Society and the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nWhen Mr. Mabon arrives in Caughnawaga for his semi-annual inspection, please give him every assistance, so that he may carry out the services, so ably performed by Mr. Gilman.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Some of the petitioners who are likely to be interviewed may be working or otherwise engaged at this time, but if we knew just when your agent was coming, everyone would be prepared and on hand, to enable the Officer to complete the enquiry all the sooner.\n\nAlso if the investigation is to be carried on in any special place, such as the Council Hall or elsewhere, please let us know.

The Superintendent of Indian Education has lately returned from a visit to the reserve and he reports that there are 7 bona fide Protestant children of school age and 11 children whose religion is more or less uncertain from the Department's standpoint.\n\nMr. Ferrier informs me that he explained the difficulties attendant upon a re-opening of the Protestant school, which was closed in 1919. I regret to state that the Department cannot give favourable consideration to your request at the present time. Our officer has informed several of the other petitioners of this decision.\n\nThe Caughnawaga Village Schools are open to any Protestant children of the reserve and the Rev. Sisters have been instructed to excuse them from the study of the Roman Catholic catechism. The Department will also help, when funds can be found for the purpose, or when accommodation is available, any bona fide Protestant children in Caughnawaga to secure an education in a Residential school, if the parents are willing to assist.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nThos. Patton, Esq.,\nCaughnawaga,\nQue.\nDecember 13, 1923.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nThe Protestant Day School at Caughnawaga, which was conducted in a government-owned building, was closed in June, 1919, with the full concurrence of the Methodist Missionary Society, who were associated with us in the management. The main reason for the closing of the school was the poor attendance.\n\nAt the present time the building is used as a classroom for the Caughnawaga R. C. Indian Day School, as all the accommodation available had to be used to care for the large enrolment.\n\nWhen I visited Caughnawaga in September, last, I decided there were seven bona fide Protestant children of school age and eleven children of parents whose religion was doubtful in that they had lately broken away from the Roman Catholic Church. Our petitioners at that time were informed there were so many school causes more important than a Protestant one at Caughnawaga that favourable consideration could not be given to their request for such a school.\n\nThe Caughnawaga Village Schools are open to any Protestant children of the reserve and the Sisters have been instructed to excuse them from the study of the Roman Catholic Catechism. The bona fide Protestant children have been promised an education in Protestant residential schools, when funds can be found for the purpose and when the parents are willing to assist.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, Dec. 15, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department has decided to give a Protestant Day School in Caughnawaga a fair trial, and I shall be pleased if you will advise the Protestant parents of the children of school age that Mr. Ferrier will be in Caughnawaga on Thursday for the purpose of making the arrangements. You should request the Protestant parents to meet in the Council Hall on Thursday next, the 26th instant, at 7 o'clock.\n\nIt is proposed to rent a classroom that will be suitable for the purpose; to equip it and secure the services of a teacher in the near future. If you, or any of the other parents interested, can suggest a suitable house or other building, where we can rent a classroom, please inform Mr. Letourneau, the Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nThos. Patton, Esq.,\nCaughnawaga,\nQue.\nOttawa, Dec. 15, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department has decided to provide, in the near future, educational facilities for the Protestant children of Caughnawaga. It is our wish that a Separate Indian Day School for these children be given a fair trial; and the Superintendent of Indian Education will be in Caughnawaga Thursday afternoon and evening, next, to discuss with you and the interested parents the opening of the Protestant school.\n\nIt is the intention to rent a classroom, to provide desks and other equipment and to secure the services of a properly qualified teacher. I should be pleased if you would make enquiries concerning houses or other buildings that would be suitable for the purpose and be prepared to assist Mr. Ferrier to make a selection.\n\nThe Protestant parents only should be requested to meet our officer in the Council Hall on Thursday evening at 7 o'clock. A nominal roll of the children of school age of Protestant parents will be prepared and these only will be allowed to attend the new school, when established. You should ask Constable Jocks to notify the parents concerned.\n\nThe Department is writing direct to Mr. Thomas Patton and I am enclosing, for your information, a copy of official communication to him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In official communication No. 5-5-5 of today's date, you have been authorized to make certain repairs and purchase some equipment.\n\nI am enclosing a list of children who may attend this school. It should be clearly understood that no other children may attend the Separate school without permission of the Department. If any of the children on the enclosed list do not attend the Separate school during the opening days, and are in attendance at the Roman Catholic schools, you should inform the Department, and their names will be struck off. It is not my intention to ask the children whose names appear on the enclosed list to attend the Separate school, but they must attend the school with which they enroll after the Separate school is opened. Children must not be allowed to attend, first, the Separate school, then the Catholic school, at will. The Superintendent of Indian Education explained this to the Protestant parents at the time of his recent visit to the Reserve.\n\nThe Department is endeavouring to secure a suitable teacher, and you will be advised when one is appointed.\n\nPlease give a copy of the enclosed list of children who may attend the Separate school to Constable Jocks, the truant officer, and to the Sister Superior of the R. C. schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL.

Please give the Department your recommendation in this connection. It might be advisable to ask the Rev. Father Lacouture if he considers these parents adherents of the Roman Catholic Church. Please attend to this at the first opportunity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nOttawa, Jan. 19, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department has decided to provide in the immediate future educational facilities for the Protestant children of Caughnawaga. I am writing to you for your assistance in the matter of securing a suitable teacher. I am in receipt of applications for this position from Howard Oke of Oka, Matthew Splicer of Caughnawaga and Mrs. Mary A. Dixon of 678 Gilford St., Montreal. The Superintendent of Indian Education reports that none of these applicants is suitable in all particulars.\n\nThe classroom activity will be conducted in the Methodist Church, which is contiguous to one of the Roman Catholic school buildings and it is necessary that the Department secure for the Protestant school an incumbent who is not only qualified as a teacher but is possessed of considerable tact. I am prepared to offer a salary of $700 for the ten teaching months, plus any bonus allowed by law. At present the bonus is at the rate of $15 per month.\n\nI should be grateful if you would make an effort to secure a satisfactory teacher without delay, as the Department wishes to open the Protestant school as soon as possible. I am making this request, knowing that you are interested in the Protestant cause at Caughnawaga.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev.

(RG 10, Volume 6073, file 304-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 10th instant, I beg to inform you that Mr. and Mrs. P. D. Horne are no more practising the Roman Catholic religion, but their children seem to always follow it; however, I would suggest that Mr. & Mrs. Horne's children be permitted to attend the Separate School.\n\nMrs. Angus Deer is a steady Roman Catholic and her children the same, but in spite of her faith her husband has ordered her to have their children sent to the proposed Separate School. Angus Deer has been and is still away from the Caughnawaga Reserve since the 3rd of September last, on account of a warrant of arrest issued by me against him for having taken part in the theft of a wampum valued at $25,000.00, the property of the Caughnawaga Band, which wampum was into the custody of the Missionary of the Caughnawaga Church.\n\nI have asked the Reverend Father O. Lacouture whether he considers these parents adherents of the Roman Catholic Church; he answered negatively for the former and affirmatively for the latter family.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, Jan. 26, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer further to your letter of the 5th instant, in which you ask permission for your children to attend the Protestant Indian Day School at Caughnawaga.

The Department has made enquiries and is informed that you are Roman Catholic in religion and your children have worshipped with you. It is also stated that your husband has ordered you to have the children sent to the proposed Protestant school. In view of the fact that your husband is no longer on the reserve and that you are now responsible for your children, the Department is prepared to give prominence to your wishes in this matter. Please communicate with me over your own signature and indicate your wishes relative to the religion and education of your children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMrs. Angue Deer,\nCaughnawaga,\nQue.\nOttawa, Jan. 26, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, relative to the religion of Mr. and Mrs. P. D. Horne and Mrs. Angus Deer. I have noted your recommendation and the Department has informed Mr. P. D. Horne that, upon receipt of the names and ages of his children, those of school age will have their names placed on the roll of the proposed Protestant Indian day school.\n\nWith reference to the case of the Deer children, upon receipt of your letter I have directed a communication to Mrs. Angus Deer, asking for a second expression of her wishes. In view of the fact that the father is no longer living on the reserve, the Department considers the wishes of the mother should have some prominence. You will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nLachine Methodist Church\nLachine, P.Q. Jan. 29th., 1924.\n\nMr. R.T. Ferrier,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have taken some days to make inquiry for a suitable applicant for the Protestant School at Caughnawaga, in addition to the names you mention. I have not been successful to the present.\n\nAs one interested in the welfare of these people I am pleased to learn that the Department is devoting this attention to the reestablishing of a Protestant school on this reserve, and wish you success.\n\nI venture to add a suggestion or so upon the situation, that has developed in Caughnawaga. As for the teacher employed: As the one responsible for the spiritual leadership of this people I hope the Dept. will see the wisdom of securing the educational leadership of a white and not an Indian. It is inevitable that we are recognizing the principle of two systems of education, as we do two systems of religion. We are forced to this conclusion, because a Protestant school cannot properly take care of itself under the leadership of an Indian with white leadership as a competitor. That is the situation that obtains at Caughnawaga. When we had the situation under our own denominational control we could safeguard this principle. Now we rely upon the Department to grant us this guardianship. In the next place, we have to recognize, that as the agitation for a Protestant school emanates from the deeper question of a religious faith, to make this a success a neutral teacher such as is always sought for by the State which is purely secular is not desirable here. This is far from being a school where religious propaganda is taught the pupils. It will give a cohesion to the work that will be the surest protection against failure in the present plans.\n\nI have noted in your letter that none of the applicants\u2014two Indian and one white\u2014fully satisfied the Department. I have called upon my own responsibility of course the white applicant, Mrs. Dixon, out to my home for an exchange over the whole situation. After an exhaustive conversation I give it as my judgment that the Dept. is fortunate in securing an application for a position as unique educationally as the one at Caughnawaga.\nShe seems peculiarly adapted to work among the Indians. She seems to be in her element with them. She seems to make their interests hers without affectation. Her gifts and apparent qualifications are an important accomplishment in creating that moral atmosphere that counts for so much in character training. She has maturity of judgment, which ought to hold her in good stead in any delicacy of situation that might arise. And added to these is the consideration that her whole life's interest is at stake in this venture. She cannot afford to think of failure. Viewing the situation from its different sides there seems to be sufficient in her favor to justify the hope that she would wisely adapt herself to her environment. Possibly some of these suggestions may meet the fears of the Department as to her qualification.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nConfidential\n\nMrs. Dixon's relations with certain members of the Kawchewanaga Band are questionable. She talked with Rev. Mr. Davis in this connection.\n\nIn addition she is too militant a Protestant to conduct a school west door to R.R.

J. J. Oka, taking our children of course with us into that Church. We are still members in good standing in that Church.\n\nMy husband is not at present resident on the reserve as he is the sole bread winner of the home, and is obliged to be away for our support.\n\nIn the matter of our children attending the Protestant school now being opened here, and your request that I write you instead of my husband, I wish to inform you that I am bringing up my children in the Protestant faith, and desire them educated in the Protestant school at Gaughnawaga.\n\nYours,\n\nMRS.

I got in touch with Miss Good Martin who was willing to fill the vacancy and who corresponded with your Dept. However, it seems that there was some difficulty regarding the salary as she asked for $50 a year. The white man was here from his nation and informed me that Miss Martin has reconsidered her attitude and would come for $850 as initial salary. Since then I have had word from her to the same effect, so she is awaiting word from your department regarding the offer to come down on notice.\n\nThe school furnishings are practically complete except for the blackboard and the school will be ready for occupation this week. The parents have been having considerable difficulty keeping their children whom they cannot coerce into coming to the Catholic school; at home.

A list of articles that are missing will soon be requisitioned by her.\n\nI am sorry to report that a family trouble arose with the opening of this school. You are no doubt aware of the fact that Thomas Patton, of Caughnawaga, was probably the most active instigator of the move towards the opening of a Separate school in Caughnawaga; he is a Roman Catholic, his wife who was Protestant before her marriage with Patton, became a Catholic for their marriage. They now have four children, the youngest being two years old, two are of school age, Irene and Doris who are on your authorized list for attendance at the Protestant School. On the forenoon of the opening day, Irene and Doris were directed by their mother to the R.C. School, but in the afternoon of that same day their father, Thomas Patton, went mad and, as to Mrs Stalk's statement (Mrs Patton's sister) he ill-treated his wife and ordered his two daughters to the Protestant school in the afternoon. Mrs Patton is now living with her sister, Mrs Stalk; her sorrow is distressful, she wants her four children away from her.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nhusband. I have advised her to try to have the two youngest in her care, but to leave Irene and Doris at the Protestant school until you have decided whether or not these children who were born and brought up by a very well educated mother, and I do not hesitate to say a real good mother who is now crying after her children, are to be left into the custody of their father who does not seem to realize nothing but a point blank.\n\nI have ordered a merchant to supply Mrs Patton with relief until further advised.\n\nMrs Patton would greatly appreciate an immediate attention in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, Feb. 22, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant and have noted with satisfaction that the Protestant Day School at Caughnawaga has had a successful opening. I have learned with regret that the opening of this school has been the occasion of domestic trouble in the family of Thomas Patton. I should be pleased if you would endeavour to have the father and mother come to some agreement as to the school which their children should attend. As you have been informed, the Department does not wish to dictate concerning the children whose names appear on the list forwarded to you under cover of my letter of the 7th ultimo. The parents will have to decide this matter and, when a decision has been reached, the children should continue their attendance at the school chosen.\n\nI have also to inform you that the Department has received a letter from Mrs. Mary Deer, in which she states that she and her husband have definitely decided to transfer their names to the Methodist Church. In view of your letter of the 23rd ultimo in this connection, the Department hesitates to make a decision and I should be pleased if you would again discuss the matter with Father Lecouture. Upon receipt of a further report from you, I can give more intelligent consideration to the question of placing their names on the eligible list for the Protestant School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Lewis,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe attendance of the Protestant Separate School has been very good. Of the twenty enrolled, the average attendance for the first two weeks is 18.8. Those absent were kept at home on account of sickness, and three of the younger pupils did not attend one day when school was badly blocked through a heavy storm.\n\nThe general spirit of the parents, as yet, shows a fine interest in their children and loyalty to their cause; there is one exception of course, that is Mrs. Mrs. Patton whose actions have been shameful. However she is not a Protestant.\n\nIt is evident that the need of help for these pupils has been great. There is not one of the twenty who is higher than an Ontario second class. Their discipline also needs a wonderful reformation, although they seem good-hearted and anxious to learn.\n\nThis task is truly difficult but I feel certain that when the difficulties are overcome much good will be gained.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nGrace Martin\n| Name                  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |\n|-----------------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|\n| Mary Norton           |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\n| Florence Norton       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\n| Minnie Norton         |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\n| Lena Patton           |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\n| Doris Patton          |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\n| Paul Johnson          |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\n| Victor Johnson        |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\n| Louis Phillips        |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\n| Frank Phillips        |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\n| Emma Phillips         |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\n| Mary A Phillips       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\n| Angus Skye            |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\n| Josephine Skye        |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\n| Rose Nolan            |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\n| Sarah Nolan           |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\n| Joe Home              |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\n| James Home            |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\n| Theresa Home          |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\n| Andrew Home           |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\n| Josephine Home        |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\n\nNote: Some of the names here are different to the list given me, which are only corrections marked +\nOttawa, March 6, 1924.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo reporting on the attendance at the Caughnawaga Protestant Indian Day School.

It seems also unneedful to discuss upon this matter with the parents, specially when they have already brought forward any false arguments against the good administration of the Roman Catholic schools.

Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that at the date of 19th February last, while I was visiting the Protestant Day School, at Caughnawaga, I have been asked by the Teacher whether it would be preferable to release the Junior class early in the afternoon. As this is usually done in the schools for the benefit of the younger ones, I was then, under the impression that this meant at least for the ones under the age of 10 years (7 to 9), but I now find that among those that are released at 2.30 o'clock P.M., seven out of the eighteen pupils are from the age of 10 to 14 inclusively. In fact, these seven pupils are of the Junior class, but, on account of their age, I now feel uneasy for having permitted the recess, as this may be of a bad example to the ones of other schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nDear Sir,\n\nI received a letter from Mr. Bettsman, the agent, about two weeks ago, which was sent to him from the Department by Mr. McLean. This was his answer to a request I made to him to know the Municipal and Provincial holidays (of this place) mentioned in the regulations at the back of the school register, and for a school regulation, which, in other schools, is made by a school board, if I have not mistaken, and is supplementary to its regulation in the school register. I was aware that there was no board or trustees for this school but thought that there would be something provided for the teacher's benefit along this line. However, there seems nothing like that for this school, and since I know I am prepared to do the best I can without it.\n\nIn the letter I was referred to the school register for regulations, and was advised to keep the regular holidays of the village (several of which are Catholic holy days) and to consult the district supervisor on the matter. I did this and it was agreed that this school being Protestant could keep the holidays, in other Protestant schools of the Province and would not offend by so doing. This was a great relief to me as it prevented possible trouble.\n\nThe work has exactly described when said to be \"very difficult,\" but there is much to be thankful for too. Although difficulties have been met with, no\nhave been escaped. There may be trouble with Mrs. Thomas, also. Her husband is away at work and she has charge of the children. I have had to be very patient with her. I do not wish to be harsh but may be compelled to use authority for the sake of the school. There is one thing I do wish to know\u2014If at any time I am unjustly accused of doing wrong, and the accusation disproved by false witness, have I any protection? Since I have realized how very difficult and dangerous this position is, I would have been glad to leave, as soon as possible. This is just one thing that has made it possible for me to face it, and that is, the great need of help, of these people, who are my fellow sufferers, but it is wholly self-sacrifice. I am ready for troubles but would like to have some assurance of safety. I have gone to the sisters according to your advice, but from my reception, I felt that I was intruding. If it is not absolutely necessary that I be sent to them again, could you kindly excuse me from that, for a while at least? I expect better things in the future, but I do believe that a spirit of cooperation must have time to grow.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nGrace Martin\n\nP.S. I believe I reported to you before the low standard of efficiency of the pupils of this school which you will see by the quarterly report. This has only made the work harder than an ordinary school instead of being easy as it may appear, as junior classes need so much individual attention. I have been accustomed to spending a great deal of my class work time on the junior pupils and diminishing them at the expense of the seniors and with the Indians' consent I continued the practice but he seems to have changed his mind and wishes me to take care of the seniors and to help myself with the juniors.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Thomas Patton, the father, has telegraphed and written, on the 30th ultimo, insisting upon his paternal right to determine the religion in which his children shall be educated, and I have to instruct you to inform Mr. Chapman, of the Protestant School, that these two children are to remain on his roll.

He informs the Department that he left the key of the school with the caretaker and also full directions to his successor regarding the grading of the various pupils in their classroom work.\n\nWe are endeavouring to obtain the services of another teacher, and, in the meantime, we regret that the Protestant school will have to remain closed. As soon as we obtain a teacher you will be advised as to the name and salary allowed and the date on which the new teacher takes up duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

She appeared to be well satisfied with the results. She had already arranged for a suitable boarding accommodation just in front of her school. I have also asked her to fill in a requisition form for any required material or school supplies that are to be authorized by the Department through my office. I have noted on her roll that a young Indian girl, who was previously attending the Roman Catholic School, in the Caughnawaga Village, was present for a permanent attendance at the Protestant School, the girl's name is Annie Jacobs. I have advised the teacher that she should not accept any other children, than the ones already listed, before an application from these children's father, or guardian, be made to the Department for approval. The teacher appeared to be surprised of the arguments, however, I have advised her not to accept that child before your authorization be given.

Schools, which is a cause of discomfort to the latter; furthermore, the pupils of the Protestant School being on their play grounds after the R.C. bells have rang, it happens that some of the R.C. pupils are kept under the impression that every pupils are at play and that the R.C. classes are not yet open. Some parents are also complaining that their children, of school age, are truant by the fact that they arrive at school when it is 11 o'clock A.M.; I beg to ask that a strict recommendation be made by the Department to the Truant Officer, in order that each and every child of school age be conveyed to school during school hours.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, June 6th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, relative to the irregular hours classes are conducted by the teacher of the Protestant school on the Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you should give the teacher, Miss Nettie V. Green, definite instructions that she is to open the school promptly at the regular hour each teaching day for both the morning and afternoon sessions. If she does not comply strictly with the requirements as to the periods the classroom work should be conducted, the Department will be under the necessity of taking serious notice of her disregard of its requirements either by a deduction in salary or a request for her resignation. You should also inform the truant officer that he is to see that the children are in attendance at the hours the school should be opened, and instruct Miss Green that it is expected she will be prompt in opening the school and keeping the classes in session during the regular periods as set forth in the regulations.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Ferrier\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs the school term is almost finished, I feel it my duty to give you a report of the work.\n\nI have thirty-eight pupils divided into eight different classes. Most of the pupils will be fitted to advance one class next term. The work here has been a great success this term and there are far greater possibilities ahead of us.\n\nI love both the work and the children. The children are a beautiful, healthy, clean group capable of being real citizens. If my work is considered satisfactory, I would like very much to return in the Autumn.\n\nI feel sure that you are aware of...\nthe fact that I have suffered greatly from the limitations of the school room which is a great handicap to efficient work. The playground too is very small for the children to play in and is full of holes and stones.\n\nOwing to the increasing number attending the school I have found it impossible for one teacher to do justice to all the classes. In view of these facts I feel I must say that to carry on efficient work an assistant should be provided also another class room.\n\nTrusting the Department will see its way clear to restore, to the Protestant children, the school which was built for them some years ago and is now being used by \"The Sisters.\" I beg to remain\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nNettie V. Green.\nOttawa, June 9, 1925.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, reporting on the academic year's activity at the Caughnawaga Protestant Indian Day School. The Department realizes that the present building is hardly large enough to accommodate the present enrolment; but it will not be possible to use the school formerly for Protestant children, until such time as funds are available for a new building for Roman Catholic work. There is a probability of several children being enrolled in residential schools during the next few months and the Department will not make any decision regarding an assistant at the Protestant School until the fall term opens.\n\nWith reference to your re-engagement for another school year, I am writing to Mr. Agent Letourneau for his recommendation, and you will receive notice of the Department's wishes from him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nDear Sir:\n\nI was very shocked to see a letter addressed to Mr. Agent L\u00e9tourneau following a complaint that I have been calling school at irregular hours. I wish to deny this charge as I ring the bell to call the children in promptly at 9:00 AM and 1:30 PM by my watch. We have no clock at the school but I have been getting the time over the radio and it does not vary more than two or three minutes from the bell at the Catholic Church.\n\nI have interviewed the Sister Superior and Constable Jocks and neither has heard any complaint of this nature against me. The Sister Superior can hear my bell every time it rings.\nI am very sorry that this has occurred as this is the first time, during the time I have been teaching, that I have been charged with breaking school laws. I like my work and it is not my intention to shirk it at any time.\n\nThere were a few times during the very cold weather when I could not call school at nine o'clock as the room was much too cold. Probably these are the times that were referred to.\n\nAgain expressing my regret but denying the charge I wish to remain your obedient servant,\n\nMillie V. Green\nOttawa, June 18th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 4th instant regarding the complaint made as to the irregular hours classes are conducted by the teacher of the Protestant School on the Caughnawaga Reserve and our reply thereto of the 6th instant, I beg to inform you that a communication has been received from the teacher in which she takes exception to the complaints that were made. I enclose herewith copy of her letter for your information.

That no adequate playground is provided the children under conditions, with the result that they are compelled to play on the public highway with resultant danger to life and limb.\n\n3. That we were definitely assured by Mr. Ferrier when the Protestant school was re-opened that the other school which was formerly the Methodist Mission school would be returned to us.\n\n4. That the present building is wholly unsuited for a school building such as is outlined in the regulations regarding such buildings, because -\n\n   (a) It is unsanitary and unsatisfactory\n\n   (b) It is badly ventilated and the lighting system is poor, with a dark gloomy interior.\n\n   (c) It is draughty and cold in winter and lacks proper blackboard space.\n\n5. That our Band Council and other public spirited men are wholly in sympathy with our demands.\n\n6. That this school was started as an experiment and we believe the experiment has proven successful.\n\n7. That in Miss Green we have found a capable and efficient teacher, but who cannot render the best service under the present conditions and without the assistance among so many children.\n\nWe the undersigned submit these facts believing that the Indian Affairs Department would remedy these conditions, were they acquainted with the situation.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\nL.

It has been a real aid to our mission and its work for which I am partly responsible.\n\nI have however noticed several difficulties in our teacher's way. Of course the language difficulty is a very real one, and then too the crowded condition of the school is very hard for one teacher. I believe that a way out would be the appointment of an assistant to Miss Green if we could get one speaking our language. It would be better for the little ones. In this way the school would accomplish a greater work.\n\nIndian Affairs.

There is a cement foundation under this house and a good furnace, also plenty of store room for fuel, food supplies, etc. There will be living accommodation for the two teachers in the upstairs part of the building. The Department is allowing the church authorities rental at the rate of $150 per annum.\n\nAbout the middle of August next you should arrange for the transfer of the desks and school equipment in the house rented from Mrs. Atenho to the frame building owned by the United Church, any extra hand in the cellar of the house or in the shed should also be transferred.

Indian Day Schools at Caughnawaga and in this connection I wish to state that after having interviewed Reverend Sister M. Francis, Principal of the R.C. Schools, there were so many reasons from her in contradiction to the complaint made by Mrs. John McComber that I have finally begged from her to prepare a written statement of the facts. This document is enclosed herewith, together with the original of Mrs. McComber's letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, September 22, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, reporting on the communication received by the Department from Mrs. John McComber.\n\nMrs. McComber's son will be sixteen years of age next month and you should inform her that the Department is not prepared to approve of his attending the Caughnawaga Prot.

Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nOttawa, May 14, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Miss Viola M. Daly and Miss Eleanor M. Culton, teachers of the Caughnawaga United Church Indian Day School, expressing a desire to remain at that school for another year.\n\nBefore answering their letter, I would appreciate your advising if you have any objection to these two teachers returning to Caughnawaga for the academic year 1934-35.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B. A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Teachers - Caughnawaga Indian Day School.\n\nAs it would be extremely difficult to replace Miss Daly and Miss Oulton with teachers of the same character, educational qualifications and missionary purpose, it had never occurred to us that there would be any change at Caughnawaga this year. I cannot understand what kind of rumors can have been reaching those two young women to make them think there was any intention of superseding them by new appointees. They signed the regular form of application for appointment as missionaries under our Board and, so far as we are concerned, until the engagement is broken by mutual consent, it is good for a term of years.\n\nI hope that this does not mean, in addition to all the other uncertainty about the appointment of teachers to Indian Day Schools at the present time, that those already in our employment and whose services are eminently satisfactory are to have their positions subject to review annually.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MLT\nOttawa, May 25, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to the teachers at the Caughnawaga United Church Indian Day School.\n\nThis Department would not have written to you if Miss Daly and Miss Coulton had not communicated with us. In view of the contents of your letter, they are being advised that the Department is satisfied to retain their services for the academic year 1934-35.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B. A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 12th instant I beg to say that this afternoon, while I was visiting the Caughnawaga Reserve I have met Miss Daly, Teacher of the Protestant Indian Day School, who, after a talk about the date of closing the school year, I have learned from her that instead of James Montour, as stated in my letter to you this morning, it is Mr. Lloyd Jacks' 21 years, living at No.4330 -Harvard Avenue, Montreal, and a Graduate of MacDonald College, who has acted as substitute teacher, yesterday all day and this forenoon, and that he desired to be compensated by the Department for 1/2 day of teaching. I regret to have misunderstood Miss Daly.\n\nAs stated in my letter, this morning, the Junior class will remain closed for the present school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nDear Sir,\n\nI taught at the Campbellton School for one and a half days replacing Miss Oulton. The days were June 14th and 15th. Mr. Robertson, the agent for the Reserve was to make the report. Up to date I have not heard from the Department so I am writing this letter.\n\nI am a graduate of Macdonald College and twenty-one years of age. I hold a first class Intermediate Diploma.\n\nI hope that I may hear from you soon regarding the salary for these days.\n\nYours truly,\nLloyd D. Jack.\nMr. Letourneau,\nSt. Constance, Quebec.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI taught at the Caughnawaga Reservation Protestant School for one and a half days, replacing Miss Culton.\n\nI have been in touch with the Department of Indian Affairs.\nand they tell me you must pay\nthe salary or make a report to\nthem. I was under the impression\nthat you made that report some\ntime ago.\n\nI wish you would let me\nknow who is going to pay\nme for my work, as soon\nas possible.\n\nYours truly,\nLloyd D. Jack\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to my letter to you of the 15th June last in the matter of a substitute teacher of the Protestant Indian Day School, Caughnawaga, and to enclose herewith a letter dated yesterday from Mr. Lloyd D. Jack, Montreal, requesting a compensation from the Department for his services as sub-teacher, during 1\u00bd day, at the above mentioned School.\n\nMay I ask whether I may be authorized to issue a voucher for a certain amount which you may determine in favour of Mr. Jack?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncl.,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, August 27, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, enclosing a letter received from Lloyd H. Jack requesting payment for his services as temporary teacher at the Caughnawaga Protestant School during the absence of Miss Culton.\n\nMiss Culton was allowed salary for the full month of June, and, consequently, she should pay Mr. Jack for his services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Miss Kenner's qualifications have been noted and are satisfactory. The Department will approve of her appointment as senior teacher, to begin duties when the school re-opens after the present summer holidays, on September third, next.

Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nJune 12th, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nRe: Senior Room, Caughnawaga Indian Day School\n\nWe have received the resignation of Miss Naomi Kenner, B.A., the senior teacher at the Caughnawaga Indian Day School, who is leaving to be married. We desire to nominate as her successor Rev. C. C. Dean. It is unnecessary for me to outline Mr. Dean's qualifications and experience, as the record of his work at Christian Island is well known to the Department.\n\nI am wondering if there is any possibility of getting the salary allowance for the Senior Room increased to $1,000. I feel a little bit diffident about putting a man in as Principal on the same salary as the teacher in the Junior Room, and it would, I think, be a fine gesture which he would deeply appreciate, if the Department could see its way clear to increase the rating of that room.\n\nOur Board is spending $1200 on the missionary residence which has been rented to your Department as a Junior Classroom, so that it will be comfortable for the Deans. It will be necessary for the Department to find some other accommodation for the Junior Room by the 1st of September. I hope that we can arrange to accommodate the junior teacher in the residence when the alterations and repairs are completed, thereby saving the Department the $10 a month rent which is being paid to Mike Skye for the house which the teachers have been occupying.\n\nI expect Miss Daly to call on her way home before the end of the month and will write you definitely in regard to this matter after I have had a conversation with her.\n\nThanking you for your co-operation,\n\nI am Yours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MT\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6073, file 304-1, part 3)\nOttawa, June 18, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe authorities of the United Church of Canada have forwarded to the Department the resignation of Miss Naomi Kenner as teacher of the senior room in the Caughnawaga Protestant Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department is approving the appointment of Rev. C. C. Dean as principal of the senior room, to take charge on September 1st, next. Mr. Dean will be allowed salary at the rate of $95 a teaching month, and I trust that you will give him every possible assistance.\n\nStaff Questionnaire form is enclosed, which Mr. Dean should complete and return to the Department as soon as possible.\n\nIt is understood that you are aware of the fact that it will be necessary to secure new accommodation for the junior room of the Protestant School for next year, as the Church authorities intend to use the residence for a home for the missionary. Please give this matter your immediate attention and advise the Department what accommodation you can secure and the rate per month.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. Brisebois, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant advising me that Miss Naomi Kenner, teacher of the senior room in the Caughnawaga Protestant Indian Day School, had resigned and that the Department has approved of Mr. Dean's appointment at her place.\n\nMr. Dean requested me to communicate with you in order to be informed whether he has any authority over the teacher of the junior class or if that teacher is on an equal standing with him. Mr. Dean claims that Miss Daly intimated that in the past, the two teachers of the Protestant Schools had never taken any orders from each other, and that it was her intention to follow the same course in future.\n\nIn connection with the renting of a house for the junior class, I beg to let you know that four houses were visited last week by Rev. Mr. Dean, Miss Daly and myself, but none of these houses was found suitable for the purpose.\n\nMr. Dean is now away for a couple of weeks on vacation, and before departing, requested me to wait until his return before renting a house. As soon as he returns immediate attention will be given to the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nActing Superintendent of\nIndian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nIt is our considered judgment that you should inform the Indian Agent in response to his question that we consider there should be no change in the status of the teachers at Caughnawaga on account of the appointment of a new teacher to the Senior room. The classes must for the present continue to be taught in separate buildings.\n\nMiss Daly has demonstrated that so far as her classroom is concerned, in the matter of teaching, discipline and relationships with the parents, she is thoroughly competent, and has earned the confidence of both the Department and this Board.\n\nUntil the time comes when we have a new school building and it becomes necessary to appoint one of the teachers as Principal, we believe the present arrangement should stand.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB:BJ\nR. D. William Murray\n1198 Dorchester St W.\nAmerican Presbyterian Ch. Aldg.\n\nGuy Tomlin -\nR. D. McVaggart.\nAugust 13, 1936.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDR. McGILL,\n\nAs the United Church has now placed a missionary on the Caughnawaga Reserve, their missionary's residence, which has been used as the junior room of the Caughnawaga United Church school, will not be available for the coming academic year.\n\nAgent Brisebois and Rev. Mr. Dean visited several houses in Caughnawaga but could not find a place suitable for the school. The Sister Superior of the Caughnawaga R. C. School kindly offered to allow a room in the Eastern School for the junior room of the United Church School.\n\nApparently, this arrangement did not suit the United Church authorities, as Reverend Dr. William Munroe, head of the United Church mission work in the Montreal district, visited the Department last week and requested that an official of the Department come to the Reserve and meet the United Church authorities.\n\nWith the approval of Mr. Williams, I went to Caughnawaga on the 10th instant, and Rev. Dr. William Munroe, Rev. A. McTaggart and Mr. Guy Tombs came to Mr. Brisebois' office at 10 o'clock that morning.\n\nWe discussed the matter carefully and visited - the Eastern\nthe Eastern School, where it was proposed to have the room, but finally the United Church officers requested that they be allowed to conduct the junior room in their church.\n\nWhile this will be a considerable inconvenience to them, I could see no objection on the part of the Department, and I therefore informed them that I would recommend this arrangement to you for the academic year 1936-37. Mr. Brisebois can arrange to have the desks moved into the church without cost.\n\nThe United Church authorities consider that the Department should either enlarge the present United Church school, to provide another classroom, or erect a separate building. In this regard Rev. Mr. A. McTaggart intends to interview you some time next month and request that funds for the above purpose be provided in our Appropriation for the fiscal year 1937-38.\nResolution H 796\n\nIt is proposed by Andrew Delisle seconded by Frank D'Allbeurant to ask the department through its School Branch to construct a new school of two rooms and playground for the school children of the United Church of Canada in the Carling town area.\n\nA favorable consideration shall request the prayers of the council.\n\nJoseph A.

Hill\nMrs. L.F. Hill\nOttawa, September 10, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter signed by L. F. Hill and wife, which reads as follows:\n\n\"Would you please inform the Department of Indian Affairs that we decided to send our son, George Paul Hill, to the Protestant Day School at Caughnawaga.\"\n\nThe Department presumes from the above that this boy has been attending the Caughnawaga R. C.

According to the Doctors, of that Hospital she will be at least three weeks before being able to take back her duties as teacher.\n\nI would kindly ask you to arrange for a substitute teacher to take Miss Daly's place, for the time of her illness. It does not seem possible to find anyone on this Reserve.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOctober 20th,\n1936.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nRe: Caughnawaga Indian Day School\n\nI have just received a telegram from Rev. C. C. Dean, saying that Miss Viola Daly, B.A., the junior teacher at Caughnawaga, is ill and will probably be off duty for a month. I do not know how much sick leave a teacher is allowed. Miss Daly has, so far as I know, never had any since she began to work for the Department.\n\nAs a supply teacher, I would like to suggest Miss Alva Elford, B.A., who taught the junior room at Norway House Indian Residential School last year. Just at present Miss Elford is engaged in working on her M.A., but she is prepared, I understand, to go to Caughnawaga for a month, if it meets the wishes of the Department and there are funds to pay her. I presume you never had anything to do with her directly, but she is a sister of Florence Elford, who has taught under the Department in several places with great success.\n\nAs the school is probably closed, I would appreciate an answer to this by telegram.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J.

Miss Daly left for Winnipeg and will be back only after the Christmas holidays.\n\nMiss Elford who is substituting has started teaching on October the 22nd last and will carry on until the end of December.\n\nMiss Elford claims not to have received any salary since the date of her arrival (October 22nd) here and would like to be informed whether she is to expect her money from the Department or from the Church.

I have not quite finished High School on account of ill health, but am willing and want to make a little money to help out on my rent year board.\n\nI have taken the school here at times when the teacher was in bed ill and feel that I could fill the position satisfactorily.\nI understand that it is a junior school or I would not think of asking for it but I would certainly appreciate it if given a chance.\n\nI have been living here on this reserve for over a year since Daddy became your agent. We are a long way from town and communication is slow and I would certainly like to get away and help myself for a while.\n\nHoping to hear soon whether or not I have a chance.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIsabel Lumsden\nDear Sir,\n\nHaving heard through a friend that the Junior School at Caughnawaga Reserve will be in need of a teacher for a period of maybe three months as the teacher has to undergo a serious operation which will necessitate her being absent from duty. I wonder if there would be any possible chance of my daughter Isabel getting the position.\n\nShe is fourth form high school and has had some experience teaching here at Island whenever the teachers have been ill. She also has been running the Homemakers' Club and quite understands Indian children and enjoys the work. It would help her very much to continue her studies next year and incidently would help me. If you care to ask Mr McGookin as to her personality he has met on his trip to Island. Hoping this will meet with your favor.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 24, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to your daughter, Isabel, securing appointment as substitute teacher at the Caughnawaga U. C. Indian Day School. We have, also, received the letter which she forwarded direct to the Department.\n\nThe Missionary Society of the United Church of Canada has always been allowed to nominate the teacher for this school and, in the event of the present teacher finding it necessary to give up duties through illness, the Department will favourably consider the substitute teacher nominated by the United Church.\n\nI note that your daughter has not yet completed the teacher's course and, in view of the number of qualified teachers that are available at the present time, it would not be possible to favourably consider your daughter's application.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG. A.

It is understood that Miss Bryan will be prepared to reopen the school after the Easter holidays, on April 5th. Cheque in payment of Miss Bryan's services will be issued direct to herself.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev.

It was very gratifying to find that the missionary and the teachers and the people all felt that the alterations were satisfactory and that the new building gave them not only a good school, but a fine building for community purposes.\n\nDuring the evening a vote of thanks to the Department of Indian Affairs for their interest in the people as shown in the provision of this school, was moved by Mr. Horn, one of the Indians, and adopted by a standing vote. I was asked to convey to you the appreciation of the people for your interest and that of other members of your Department. I do this with a very great deal of pleasure.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD.MT\nMay 16th,\n1939.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nMiss Edith Mann, teacher in the junior room, is resigning at the end of this school term. Miss Bryan would like to be transferred to the junior room, and she will take some summer course to help her fit herself better for this position. That will leave the position of senior teacher open.\n\nSome time ago you wrote about the desirability of transferring Mr. Smith from Oka to some place where he would have educational facilities for his boy. We would, I think, be prepared to nominate Mr. Smith for the senior room at Caughnawaga, if such a nomination were viewed favorably by your Department, and if Mr. Smith were prepared to make the move. We have not yet approached him, because we believe that consideration must be given to providing suitable living quarters for Mr. Smith and his family at Caughnawaga. That, of course, is in the sphere of your Department.\n\nWe must also think about the work at Oka, in which Mr. Smith has been more than usually successful. If such a transfer met with the approval of your Department, we should be prepared to nominate for the Oka Country School Mr. John Stanley Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy holds a permanent, first-class intermediate teaching diploma from Macdonald College, and a senior music certificate from Quebec, and would, I think, in every way be a suitable appointee. I am writing to Inspector Brady concerning his professional qualifications.\n\nI shall be glad if you will take this whole matter under your consideration and let us know what you think about it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian day school.\n\nWhile we would like to see Mr. Smith obtain some other school at the same time it is felt that it would not be advisable to transfer him to Caughnawage at the present time. As you mention in your letter such a transfer would involve securing a residence for him on the Reserve. This would be extremely difficult and besides another situation that has arisen on the Reserve recently makes it inadvisable for us to take such action.\n\nWith the above in mind Mr. Hoey feels that for the academic year 1939-40 at least the best course to take would be the nomination of a qualified female teacher who would take charge of the senior room. I note from your letter that Miss Bryan desires to be in charge of the junior room.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. Geo.

The children involved are:\n\nJoyce Williams, 12 years\nMyrna Williams, 11 \"\nElmer Horne, 13 \"\nOrval Williams, 9 \"\nPeter Williams, 6 \"\n\nAll these children are resident on the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve. The only reason for the expulsion of these children is that of not saluting the flag. I understand that the children's teacher, Miss Nesbitt, reported the refusal of these children to salute the flag to the Indian Agent, Mr. Brisbois, who reported the matter to Ottawa. The Department of Indian Affairs instructed that the children be suspended. The teachers, Miss Nesbitt and Miss Bryan were interviewed and have had the situation explained to them, and it has also been explained to Mr. Brisbois.\n\nOur local representative at Ottawa, Mr. Chas. Morrell, has taken up this matter with Mr. Phelan, of the Department of Indian Affairs, in an effort to explain the action and attitude of the\nchildren, but he was treated discourteously in not being permitted to have any kind of hearing by the Department concerned.\n\nTherefore on behalf of these children and their parents, and in the interests of liberty and justice, I am appealing this decision to you. I trust you will give this very serious case your personal attention, and that you will see your way clear to remedy this great injustice which has been meted out to these children.\n\nThat you may be in a position to appreciate the reason for the children's stand, I suggest the following to you:\n\nThat the children's loyalty is not at all in question. It is merely the manner of expressing it.\n\nThat in their belief the mode of expressing it is repugnant to the law of Almighty God and hence to the children's freedom of conscience and freedom of worship. They sincerely believe it to be a violation of the law of Almighty God. Should it not have been allowed that the children should have been given a hearing before being expelled?\n\nThat it is correct for each one to worship the Lord according to the dictates of his own conscience provided that in so doing they do not violate good morals, infringe on other's rights or jeopardize the safety of the State.\n\nThat each person should be allowed to decide for himself whether his belief is right or wrong.\n\nI also suggest that if this condition regarding these children remains unaltered they will be deprived of their education and such being the case, then surely such teacher should cease teaching that there is freedom of conscience and freedom of worship.\n\nThis matter should now be faced fairly and honestly. Should the teacher, or those higher in authority, be permitted to\nmake hypocrites of children of the land? Or shall the parents be denied the liberty to teach them the Word of God?\n\nCan you properly take away the right of private judgment of school children or parents? Can you rightfully deny school attendance to a child who without injuring anyone puts allegiance to His God ahead of school regulations?\n\nI further suggest that no one will be harmed by the children being permitted to attend school and stand mute while others salute. In such a case the result is that the right of the children to adhere to their conscience is upheld. No one is hurt and the country is not endangered.\n\nI trust that this entire matter will receive your earnest, unbiased, courageous consideration and that your decision will be in accord with the true worship of Almighty God and with the principles held dear to democracy.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCharles F. Royton\nOttawa, May 4, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of April 29, in which you submit, for departmental consideration, the claim of a group of pupils for re-admission to one of the Indian day schools on the Caughnawaga reserve, P. Q.\n\nThe records here indicate that the Indian agent in charge of the Caughnawaga reserve reported to the Department on April 2, 1940, that a group of students attending the Indian day school, operated under the auspices of the United Church, had been causing trouble at that school by refusing to join with others in the singing of The National Anthem and by refusing to salute the flag. The agent, in a letter sent to him from the Department, dated April 8, 1940, was instructed to advise the teachers in charge of that particular school that any pupil who refused to recognize constituted authority and who disobeyed reasonable orders should be immediately discharged from the school.\n\nYou can readily realize how necessary it is to have strict regulations governing the conduct of pupils attending Indian day and residential schools throughout the Dominion. You will fully appreciate, also, that it would be utterly impossible to conduct schools at all if every religious denomination or sect insisted upon regulations in conformity with their own religious tenets and beliefs. Such insistence would simply lead to confusion and chaos. The aim in a democratic country such as Canada is to carry out a policy acceptable\n\nCharles F. Roynon, Esq.,\n4425 LaSalle Blvd.,\nVerdun,\nP. Q.\nto the will of the majority while at the same time doing everything humanly possible to safeguard minority rights.\n\nYou are no doubt aware that educational institutions are provided by the taxpayers of Canada for the education of Indian pupils, without cost to the Indians themselves. This also applies to school equipment, text books, etc. I must state, therefore, that unless the group of students on whose behalf you have written are prepared to observe the rules and regulations now in force, they cannot be re-admitted to the Caughnawaga school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs.\nRNA47 34 DL GET REPLY\n\nTORONTO ONT 11 945A\n\nR A HOEY\n\nSupt of Welfare and Training Indian Affairs Branch Ottawa\n\nHave suitable minister in west for Caughnawaga Church if he has assurance that his daughter age 11 grade four can be suitably accommodated in the school please wire if you think this possible\n\nR B COCHRANE\n\nOttawa, May 11 1940.\n\nReverend Robert B.

It is noted that the subject matter of this resolution relates to literature which, it is alleged, has been distributed by the Witnesses of Jehovah among the Protestant Indians on the Caughnawaga reserve.\n\nIt is my intention to discuss with the Director the best ways and means of dealing with this matter, just as soon as I can conveniently do so.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.

Cochrane, D.D., Secretary of the Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada.\n\nYou will note that Dr. Cochrane submits for departmental consideration copy of a resolution passed by the Montreal Presbytery of the United Church at their meeting held on Tuesday May 7, 1940.\n\nIt would appear that Indian Agent Brisebois reported to the Department on April 8, 1940, that a group of pupils attending the Indian day school operated under the auspices of the United Church on the Caughnawaga reserve had been causing trouble at the school by refusing to join with others in the singing of the National Anthem and by refusing to salute the flag. The Agent in a letter sent forward to him from the Department dated April 8, 1940, was instructed to advise the teachers in charge of that particular school that any pupil who refused to recognize constituted authority and who disobeyed reasonable orders should be immediately discharged from the school. It is my understanding that since these instructions were issued two pupils have been discharged from the school.\n\nIn my monthly report for April I referred to my visit to the Caughnawaga reserve and to the urgent need for greater police patrol work and protection at Caughnawaga. I am still of the opinion that in times as serious as the times in which we are now living an R. C. M. P. officer should be permanently located on this reserve. If, however, funds are not available to adopt this recommendation, I would recommend that the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police be asked to make a quiet investigation, preferably by a plain clothes detective, of conditions at the United Church school, the distribution referred to in the resolution sent forward by Dr. Cochrane and the activities of the Indian Chief at Caughnawaga, as well as a number of other matters that may be brought to his attention by the Indian Agent.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nCaughnawaga, May 7th, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR MONTH OF APRIL 1940.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nThe attendance was good. Unfortunately four Indian children had to be sent away from the U.C. Indian Day school for having refused to obey the teachers. Of the four children one went back to school and consented to act in accordance with the instructions of the teacher. The action of these children followed the appearance on this reserve of the members of sect known as the \"Witnesses of Jehovah\" who have succeeded in getting some adherents among the Indians.\n\nFrs.

She was for a year or two on the staff of the residential school at Nancey. Then she took the Ontario Normal course. During the last year she has been teaching school at Scugog, where her father is the minister among the Indians. Miss Joblin has to teach for another year or two before she can obtain her permanent certificate, but she is intensely interested in the Indians and prefers, meanwhile, to teach in an Indian School.\n\nI feel it is a great privilege to be able to submit the name of a young lady in whom we have such great confidence. Her father and mother have given their whole lives to missionary work among the Indians, and although her father has been on less than the minimum salary for most of the time, he has been able to help educate three sons for our ministry. The eldest son is our missionary on the Nancey Reserve; the second son has been Assistant Minister at Deer Park United Church, Toronto, and has just been called to Westminster Church, Weston; and the third son is to succeed his brother at Deer Park Church. Another daughter is just graduating from the University of Toronto. We are sure that Miss Joblin will not only give satisfaction to the Government Inspector as a teacher, but that her presence on the Reserve will help the minister in his work for the higher life of the community.\n\nI shall be glad to have your acceptance of this nomination as soon as possible.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nRBC.MT\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Day School for the academic year 1940-41.\n\nShe will be allowed the same salary as the previous teacher; namely, $95.00 a teaching month.

This amount is deposited and interest is allowed at 4% per annum. Principal and interest will be paid to Miss Joblin when she gives up duties as teacher of an Indian school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

Do you not think that it would have been courteous, at least, for the Department to have notified Church Departments which nominate teachers of this new Order-in-Council? The cut in the per capita allowance for Indian residential school was made without consultation with the Churches, which, under a special agreement, are carrying on Indian residential school work in conjunction with your Department. The cutting off of one month's salary of teachers in Indian day schools was done in the same way. Of course, this Order-in-Council is action of a different kind, but I do think that we might have been notified when it was passed, if for no other reason than that we should have been in a position to pass this information on to teachers whom we were approaching with the offer of an appointment. The present procedure, I submit, is hardly fair to them or to us. I know this is war-time, but even in war-time one expects courtesy and businesslike procedure even from the Government!\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nRBC.MLT\nOttawa, August 21, 1940.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nRetirement Fund Ch.#1569, Jul. 23/40 - $9.52\n\nMcNesbitt\n\nI am enclosing Statutory Declaration and Undertaking form in connection with the above-noted cheque, which apparently was never received by you.

We feel that more work could be covered in the two weeks in September than in the corresponding two weeks in June. Children and teachers are rested after the holidays; examinations and reports are not claiming so much time; Exhibition of the year's work and programme for school closing would not be crowding our time-table.\n\nIn order to save any re-adjustments in the book-keeping, we would be quite willing to wait until the end of June for our last cheque and until the end of October for our first.\n\nFor the above reasons we are requesting that the Department of Indian Affairs grant us permission to open school on September the fifteenth of this year.\n\nMiss Bryan and I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the members of the Department of Indian Affairs and yourself for the splendid co-operation which you have shown us during our period of teaching in Caughnawaga.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(per E.B.)\n\nIndian Affairs.

If they intend to do the same this year approval is granted for the U.C. School opening on the same date and, of course, in that event they would be able to close on June 15. I think you will agree that it would be advisable to have the two schools open and close on the same dates. No doubt you can arrange this.\n\nIn any event the first month's salary will not be paid until October 31 as to do otherwise would cause considerable inconvenience.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F. Brisebois,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nOttawa,\nNovember 6, 1941.\n\nDear Miss Joblin:\n\nIn reporting on his recent visit to your school Mr. Doucet intimates that he stressed the practical side of education rather than the strictly academic phase. You are probably aware that Mr. Doucet has had very wide experience as an instructor both in vocational and academic subjects and was, prior to his appointment to this Department, an instructor at the vocational school in Regina.\n\nThe Department's aim is to prepare the pupils to cope with the exigencies of life as they are found in the community in which they reside. The school programme, we believe, should begin with social settings that surround the community. Education is really an affair of action and not simply an affair of acquiring ready-made responses through mechanical repetition. We incline to that process of education by means of which meaningful experiences prepare for life.\n\nAs a result we are anxious to have manual training wherever possible. We are certain that you will do your best to introduce and encourage this phase of educational effort in your school.\n\nI realize that carrying out our wishes will necessarily involve a considerable departure from the provincial curriculum but our experience in Indian work has proved to our satisfaction that the policy we now suggest is best suited to Indian children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMiss Gladys Joblin,\nTeacher,\nU.C.

Mr. Wheeler, our minister at Caughnawaga, writes to say that Miss Bryan is likely to leave at the end of June to become the head of her own household. He makes the interesting suggestion that we should nominate as her successor Miss Doris Diabo who is one of the local Indians. She evidently, at a good deal of sacrifice, has fitted herself for a teaching position and is now employed in a school in some white settlement near Buckingham, Quebec. I wonder what you would think of our recommending her for Caughnawaga. I hesitate to do so - not because she is an Indian, but because it is her own village. You probably know more about her than I do, and we shall be guided to a very large extent by the personal opinion which you express in your letter in reply to this.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\nCaughnawaga, Que., June 20, 1942.\n\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\n\nDear Mr. Brisbois,\n\nWould you kindly transmit the following petition to the Department of Indian Affairs?\n\n\"Last year we were granted permission to open school September the fifteenth and close June the twelfth, nineteen hundred and forty-two.

Quebec\n\nDear sir,\n\nI have seen the Indian agent in Brisebois over a month ago about the transportation of my children to school.\n\nWell I'll tell you the way it is. I'm renting a farm on St. Victor last spring that at the end of the reserve and it's a good four miles to school. As we are not of the catholic faith we don't care to send our three children to that school on St. Victor road which is the closest one.\nRight now they travel by bus and it cost me 40\u00a2 return that comes to over $12.00 a month now before the fall term. I asked Mr. Bisbri for some help from the department and he told me that he doubted that I could get help from your department since I chose to change religion we were of the catholic faith he said that I would have to take the consequences and take my children to school the best way I could, but he said that he would write to you and its over a month now and I have no answer. I would like to know if its that hard to change religion.\nI think he should use some of that love thy neighbour like yourself stuff and let me have a square deal at least if I'm not entitled to some help like people that lives on Chatanquay road and cote st chelten road then let me know because the provincial transport bus is due to stop any time now and I certainly don't intend to let my children walk over 4 miles each way and since I'm not of the catholic faith they certainly not going to the catholic school on st Bridgwater Rd they'll have to miss school and according to the ordinance a child is not suppose to miss school until she or he is 16 yrs of age\nand according to the constitution of this country a person is not obligated to be of one faith in particular and my children are not going to catholic school for nobody agent or no agent matters or not. I don't believe in that faith and they are not going to walk around nine miles a day to go to school if the department can't do anything about my case please let me know.\n\nYours Truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6073, file 304-1, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Dept., of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nThis will acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th of October last, enclosing the original of a letter received at the Branch from one Peter Diome, an indian of this Reserve, who was requesting the Branch to pay for the transportation of his children from his place of residence near the St.Isidore Rd., School, to the local U.C., Indian Day School, located in this Village, four miles from his home.\n\nIn reply I wish to say that Peter who was living in the Village, up to last summer, had in the course of the winter requested to have his children transferred from the R.C.School to the U.C.School. His reason was that he had left the R.C.Church to join the Long House or had became an aboriginal believer.\n\nAt the time he made his application, same was refused because children are not allowed to change from one School to another in the middle of the academic year. When a child start going to school in September at a certain place he has to finish the school year at that same place. This ruling has been established for obvious reasons.\n\nThis last September, Diome and his family had moved to a farm on the St.Isidore road and he sent his children to the Village U.C.School instead of sending them to the St.Isidore Rd.,School (half a mile from his home) and consequently applied for their transportation to be paid because we do pay the transportation of children living in the area of the Bush Rd.,School, which was closed last year because of the limited number of pupils and also for lack of a teacher. Peter claims that his case is the same and that if we pay for some we should pay for everyone regardless of the circumstances.\n\nThe fact....\nThe fact that he has changed his religious beliefs is considered as being strictly his own business but in this case it is wondered if it would be fair for the Branch to pay for the transportation of these children to attend a certain school when they have one located close by.\n\nMay I say that the hiring of a taxi would entail an expense of at least $2.00 a day and when the road closes for the winter the hiring of a man with a horse or horses will amount to not less than $4.00 per day. No children of that vicinity are coming to the Village Schools. Diome's letter is herewith returned.\n\n(Frs. Brisebois)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 27th, 1947.\n\nMr. Frs.

What she actually has in mind is one of the welfare supervisor positions which we hope to set up in the Department. As it will be some time before these positions are established, I feel there is little need to worry about replacing her as Principal at Caughnawaga.\n\nI have heard further from Mrs. Ross, whom you will recall as the teacher we discussed for the primary room. She is quite willing to go to Caughnawaga but in her letter she stated as follows:\n\n\"I will accept your position at the Caughnawaga United Church Day School from the fifth of January until Easter; then, if I like the work and am able, I will stay with you until June.\"\n\nI have written to Mrs. Ross today and told her that we would expect her to agree to stay at least until the end of June.\n\nYou will remember that Mrs. Ross is of your denomination and her father was a missionary in Brazil for many years. I will advise you as soon as we have a definite answer from her.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

It is noted that she was not paid on voucher for the months of November, December and the latter part of October. Therefore we have requested our Chief Treasury Officer to pay her at the rate of $162.00 a month for the period from October 21 to December 31. We have asked that this cheque be forwarded to her at 4311 Harvard Avenue, Montreal (28), Que.

Neary;\n\nSupply Teacher Caughnawaga United Church School:\n\nFurther to the above, your letter of January 8th 1948 to Indian Agent, Mr. F. Brisebois, at Caughnawaga, a copy of which you kindly sent to me, in which you indicated my rating as Teacher supplying in the Caughnawaga United Church School, October to December 1947, had been established at $162.00 per month, and at which amount your Chief Treasury Officer had been requested to issue cheque in my favor.\n\nUnder date of January 15th cheque No. A-2 J 024238 was issued and duly received by the undersigned, for which I tender my sincere thanks.\n\nThe stub of the above cheque shows \"Gross Earnings $381.48\", \"Deductions Income Tax $26.60\", \"Net Earnings $354.88\", which was the amount of the Cheque received.\n\nUpon compiling a Dominion Income Tax Form T-1 Special 1947, I find my total personal earnings for 1947 are $743.45, slightly under Single Status exemption amount of $750.00. You will note I made intimation to this effect in the latter part of Second paragraph on page 2 of my letter (Dec. 30) to Mr. Brisebois, which he forwarded to you. Hence I understand submission of Income Tax Form T-1 Special 1947 is not required or necessary, in fact if submitted would just one more Form for the already burdened Income Tax Staff to handle, and there is no knowing when they would get around to refunding the $26.60, over-deducted at source.\n\nThe difference between my actual personal income during 1947, -$743.45, $250.00, allowable deduction for spouse on Married Status basis, viz $493.45, will be taken care of in my husband's Return-T-1 Special 1947, as deduction from Married Status exemption amount of $1500.00.\n\nI shall therefore greatly appreciate if you can consistently arrange for your Chief Treasury Officer to issue cheque for $26.60 short paid for services rendered, direct to me, as was the original cheque. Thank you.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMrs. Eleanor M. (W. A.) Freckleton\n\nIndian Affairs.

This summer school is intended for teachers holding elementary and intermediate certificates or diplomas valid in the Province of Quebec.\n\nThe purpose of this summer school is to enable certificated teachers to supplement their previous training, to become better acquainted with modern educational movements and methods, and to qualify for more advanced diplomas, in accordance with the regulations of the Protestant Committee of the Council of Education.\n\nElementary and intermediate certificates shall remain interim until the holder thereof shall have taught for two years successfully and shall also have successfully completed one summer session at an approved professional summer school, when the interim certificate shall be exchanged for a permanent diploma.\n\nAdvanced elementary diplomas shall be issued to holders of permanent elementary diplomas who have taught successfully for at least two years and have successfully completed three sessions at an approved summer school, one of which must be professional in character.\n\nIntermediate certificates or diplomas shall be granted to teachers holding elementary certificates or diplomas, provided they have obtained the senior high school leaving certificate. The senior high school leaving examination may be taken in two sections for this purpose.\nAdvanced intermediate diplomas shall be issued to holders of permanent intermediate diplomas who shall have taught successfully for two years and completed satisfactorily three sessions, one of which must be a professional summer school, at one or more approved summer schools.\n\nTeachers whose certificates have lapsed are eligible for attendance at summer school only after receiving special permission from the Director of Protestant Education.\n\nApplicants will be admitted who for some sufficient reason are unable to take the whole course in one year but could take one complete course in two sessions of the summer school. No credit or bonus can, however, be given unless a complete summer school requirement is fulfilled. Applications for admission will be considered from students who wish to take partial courses without regard to credits or bonus.\n\nEach application must be accompanied by a preliminary deposit of $10. Money orders or cheques for this amount, with the bank charge included, must be drawn in favour of the Secretary, Macdonald College.\n\nCandidates will be admitted, subject to available accommodation, in the order of the receipt of their applications, preference being given, if possible, to students who have attended previous summer sessions.\n\nAll applications must be made on or before June 18, 1949.\n\nStudents who apply for and receive admission certificates, but who for good and sufficient reasons find themselves unable to attend the summer school, may ask for and obtain a refund of their preliminary deposit at any time up to June 18, 1949. This date for withdrawal is necessary in order to allow vacant accommodation to be made available for other applicants.\n\nThe total living expenses from noon, July 4, to noon, July 30, will be $38 for board and room (two in a room) including registration and medical fees. Those desiring a single room may obtain one, if available, at a small extra cost, by writing in advance to the Secretary, Macdonald College. The preliminary deposit is accepted as part of the total charge. The balance only is required to be paid on the first day of the session. All bed linen, towels, etc. will be supplied by the College. Personal laundry work will be done by the College laundry at a reasonable charge.\n\nArrangements have been made whereby Dr. R. F. Kelso or his locum tenens will attend the College daily to give medical attention to students who may require professional service. The medical fee will cover the charges of ordinary sickness while at the College but not of infectious diseases or major operations.\n\nStudents will be expected to provide themselves in advance with the books and materials required in the different courses in accordance with the subjects chosen.\n\nGeneral Information\n\nStudents should arrive, if possible, during the forenoon of Monday, July 4, for registration between 9 A.M. and noon. Immediately upon arrival students should present their certificates of admission at the Secretary's office, Room 11, Main Building, for the purpose of completing payment for living expenses. Only after this has been done will rooms be assigned in the residence.\n\nAll classes will open at 1.30 P.M. in the College Assembly Hall on Monday, July 4.\n\nA certificate of attendance will be sent each year to successful students.\n\nAgain this year the Railways and Steamship Lines, members of the Canadian Passenger Association, are putting into effect for Summer Schools special reduced fares on Certificate Plan, i.e. one-way fare and one-half for round trip for teachers, pupils and dependent members of their families when accompanying them, travelling from stations in Canada east of and including Armstrong and Fort William.\n\nIn order to take advantage of this reduction, it will be necessary for each passenger to purchase a one-way ticket at full fare from his home station to Ste. Anne de Bellevue, Quebec, obtaining then from the ticket agent a \"Standard Convention Certificate\"; the\ngoing journey must commence between June 30 and July 6, both dates inclusive. Upon surrender of the certificate, properly signed by the authorized officer of the summer school, to the ticket agent at Ste. Anne de Bellevue, Que., not later than August 3, 1949, a ticket for the return journey may be purchased at one-half of the regular one-way fare; it will be valid until August 29, 1949, and will permit of stop-overs.\n\nCourses offered\n\nIn planning their work students attending the Summer School for the first time should arrange to take at least one of the professional subjects that are offered and, avoiding undue concentration in familiar fields, should choose such other courses as will help to broaden their cultural horizons. Those, however, who are working for advanced diplomas may find some degree of specialization advisable. The combination of courses to be taken by any student must be approved by the Director of the Summer School.\n\nArt and Crafts:\n\nCourse I \u2014 Elementary Work One Unit\n\n1.

Hierlihy. We should be very happy to see this man appointed to Caughnawaga. I understand it will be necessary to make an almost complete change in the staff, but I wonder whether Miss Daly would be prepared to continue to teach, with Mr. Hierlihy as Principal.\n\nI should be glad if you would let me know what plans you have in mind for making the change at Caughnawaga. You know that we are very anxious to co-operate with you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMay 31st,\n1949.\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nA.S. Hierlihy\n\nI have received an application from the above teacher. He is twenty-five years of age, and is at present teaching at Alberton, P.E.I. He has a First Class P.E.I. Teaching Certificate and seven years teaching experience. He is United Church in denomination and has submitted a reference from one of the Trustees of his local School District. He is now the Principal of the school, and the Trustee asserts that he is of reputable character and comes of a Christian family known and respected in the community for many years.\n\nI would suggest that he might be the type of man you could use in one of your day schools in Ontario, and I would suggest that you write to me concerning a position. In fact, he might do very well at the Caughnawaga School, unless you have someone else in mind.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. C. Dorey, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nBoard of Home Missions\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St., West,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nBFN/HM\nMay 17, 1949.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have answered your letter of May 12th and note that you are more keenly interested in the Northwest Territories than in the provinces.\n\nI am writing to Western Canada as we already have most of our schools in the Territories filled. I will write to you immediately I hear from our officials in Manitoba and Saskatchewan.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard V. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. A.S.

Murray,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThank you very much for the information contained in your letter of May 9th, file 1-1-IX E.\n\nI may say that I am deeply interested in the opportunities afforded and would like to be advised of any possibilities either in the provinces or territories, preferably the latter.\n\nOne matter came to my mind was the duration of contract. I wondered if it was a continuous type or a type to be renewed annually.\n\nAgain I thank you for your very lucid explanations.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nA. S. Hiebert\nMay 9, 1949.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have answered your letter of May 5, and will answer the questions raised by you.\n\n(1) At the present time, the annual increment is $60 per year. Our new salary schedule, now under consideration will provide for higher increments. These increments are the same for all provinces of Canada. In the Northwest Territories, you are entitled to a Northern Living Allowance, in addition to your salary. This amounts to $900, for a single man and $1500, for a married man, less standard deductions.\n\n(2) You are classified as a Grade 3 teacher because you hold a First Class Teaching Certificate and fall within the salary range of $1500 - $2220. You are given credit for five years' experience in Provincial Schools (the maximum allowed by our schedule). This brings your starting salary to $1800 a year.\n\n(3) You would receive $180 a month for a ten month year, unless you were placed in a Welfare school. In this school you would receive a salary for twelve months in the year.\n\nI presume that the latter is the type of school in which you are particularly interested.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. A.S. Hierlihy,\nAlberton, P.E.I.,\n\nMFN/HM\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nDept. of Indian Education,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of May 2nd (file 1-1-1 X E) and I wish to thank you for your prompt reply.\n\nOriginally it was my intention to seek service with your department as a teacher in the Northwest Territories as I did not contemplate any opening in other parts of Canada or Indian Bureau.\n\nI would like to have information on the increments accruing to teachers in your service and if the ratios of pay differ for different areas, kindly quote same for respective areas (Ontario, the Prairie Provinces, Northwest Territories).\n\nAnother point on which I am rather vague is the matter of being classified as a grade III. Does this mean I am qualified to teach only grade III? Also, does the matter of free furnished lodgings, fuel and light apply to areas outside the Territories.\n\nFinally, the salary was quoted as $180 a teaching month. I am wondering if this applies as a ten-month year or if one would be paid $180 for twelve months and act as a local administrator of family allowances, etc., as described in the press.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nArnold S. Hirstley.\nMay 2, 1949.\n\nMr. Arnold S. Hierlihy,\nAlberton, P.E.I.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 28 with attached application forms and letters of reference. I am returning the copy of your School Supervisor's report.\n\nI am now making enquiries concerning a suitable vacancy which you might like to consider. I presume that you would not want to go to the Prairie Provinces but would prefer a school in Ontario. We do not pay travelling expenses except for teachers proceeding to our schools in the Northwest Territories.\n\nAs a teacher you would be classified as a Grade III with a starting salary of $180.00 a teaching month. If a principalship were available, your salary would be at the rate of $192.00 a month. In most of our schools, we offer free house, fuel and light in addition to your salary.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nBFN/AM\nMay 2, 1949.\n\nRev.

As reference he has given the name of Mr. J.W. MacLaucht, M.P., and has included references from the Trustee of the Alberton High School and the School Supervisor's report on his school.\n\nYou will recall our conversation concerning the Caughnawaga School.

Indian Day School\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nMr. Doucet has just returned to town from an inspection trip to Quebec and the Maritimes. He has informed me concerning the situation which exists at Caughnawaga concerning Miss Roberts, and I understand that Mr. Kennedy is entirely in agreement with our officials in recommending that she be transferred from the school. I presume that Mr. Kennedy has written to you by now concerning this transfer. I feel that Miss Roberts has been a little indiscreet but that her actions do not warrant any drastic action on our part. I have mentioned to Mr. Doucet that she could be transferred to either the St. Clair School at Sarnia or even to the Gibson School.\n\nConcerning Mr. Hierlihy, I agree that Miss Daly may not like to be replaced as principal at Caughnawaga. However, Mr. Hierlihy might possibly consent to work under Miss Daly for a year, and then we could consider promoting him to principal there or elsewhere.\n\nWith this in mind, I will write to him at once and find out if he is willing to go to Caughnawaga next year. I appreciate very much your offer of cooperation, and you can rest assured that we will\ndo everything possible to help fill these positions by next September.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Indian Day School.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have just returned from an inspection trip of the Gaughnawaga and Oka Schools and have made the following recommendations concerning the transfers of the three teachers at the Gaughnawaga School:\n\n(1) That Miss Daly transfer to the Mount Elgin Indian Day School to handle the vacancy presently existing there for a teacher in grades 7 and 8. Due to her auxiliary class training, she may also be able to help Mr. Joblin with the auxiliary class.\n\n(2) That Miss Roberts and Miss Resor transfer to the two vacancies which exist in the intermediate and junior rooms at the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School. Both Mr. Kennedy and the teachers are prepared to accept these transfers and I am therefore taking the following action, previously discussed with you, concerning the appointment of new teachers:\n\n(a) Writing to Mr. Hierlihy, offering him the position of Principal of the Gaughnawaga United Church School,\n\n(b) Writing to Miss Freda Patton concerning the intermediate room (your letter of June 6 refers).\n\n(c) Writing to Miss Fairservice concerning the primary room (if she is undecided or if her health has not improved, would\nyou consider Mrs. Ross of Portage for this primary room?\n\nI have also discussed at some length with Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Brisebois the alterations necessary to the buildings which will be used next year for your teacherage and classroom. We hope to have these alterations and repairs completed by school opening in September.\n\nI hope the above arrangements are to your satisfaction and that everything can be arranged in the near future.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard N.

I have just returned from an inspection trip to the Caughnawaga Reserve at Lachine, P.Q., and am writing to you immediately upon my return to Ottawa.\n\nI am pleased to be able to offer you the position of principal of the Caughnawaga United Church Indian Day School at a commencing salary of $1,920.00 an academic year. We have a revised salary schedule in course of preparation now and your salary may actually be higher than this if the scale is approved by 1 September, 1949.\n\nYou would be responsible for the teaching of the upper grades, namely 7, 8 and 9, and would have two other teachers under you for the intermediate and primary grades.\n\nIn addition to this salary, we will provide a furnished teacher's apartment. I do not believe that I have raised the question of whether you are married and have any family. In any event, there would be accommodation for both your wife and yourself and family. If you are not married, then I believe we can arrange for another male teacher to share the apartment with you. Our appointments are of a continuous type and are not renewed annually.\n\nIf it is at all possible for you to accept this position, I would be glad to provide you with any further details. In conclusion may I point out that this school is 30 minutes by\nbus from the centre of Montreal and that you will be able to take university courses at McGill without any inconvenience as the bus service is half-hourly.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nSince the enclosed Monthly Report of Attendance for October was returned to me for correction due to the fact that I accidently counted two white children who are attending this school, I decided that this would be an opportune time to enquire about the status of these white children in this school.\n\nAt the same time as I received the incorrect report, I received the new school requisition forms for supplies. At the top of these forms it says: \"These supplies are for Indian children only\". The white children, who are attending this school, are evidently allowed to do so because their parents lease farms on the reserve, and are supposed to farm. But I do not see why they should be given free supplies.\n\nSome time ago Miss Burden, the junior teacher, was short of Pre-primers. Knowing that the white children were not supposed to be furnished books, I told her to write to the parents of one of the white pupils in her room and ask them to buy a Pre-primer for him. The following is a copy of the note which Miss Burden received from the parent:\n\n\"When we rented this farm, we were told by the Indian Agent, that white children could go to the Indian school, with free transportation and school supplies as the Indian children. So we do not see why we should buy books for Frankie, when we never did for the other two children.\"\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) William J. Skinner.\n\nIf we have to supply these white children and others with texts and other supplies then we will have to requisition for supplies counting them in, even though the \"supplies as for Indian children only\".\n\nI would also like to enquire if anything is going to be done about getting better transportation for the children who are being transported to school? It is nearly five o'clock every night before the last of these children leave the school. At the request of some of the parents, and also out of charity, we have been keeping the children, who go by bus, in the school until the bus arrives. This necessitates one of the staff staying each night till five o'clock to supervise. Since the cold weather began, I have also been allowing the children from the R.C. Day School, who wish, to come into our school to wait for the bus. It is far too cold for them to stand out on the road for an hour waiting for the bus.\n\nI have talked with Father Bechard, Principal of the R.C. Day School about this matter and he is of the same mind as I about the\nWe both think that it is criminal to have the children walking around until such a late hour. They do not get home until five-thirty or later, and this is far too long a day for any child.\n\nThere is one other thing that I would like to ask about. I spoke to both Mr. Brisebois and Mr. Doucet about this matter: Viz., the question of supplying a hot drink of hot soup for the children who must bring their lunch to school on account of the distance they live from school. As you know, a hot lunch was provided at Shawenaga after I requested Mr. Devlin to ask the department for it. I think that the children here, who have to bring their lunch should also be provided with a hot cup of cocoa or a cup of soup. Even though some of them can afford to buy milk or soft drinks every day, there are others who can't.\n\nThe two female members of my staff both stay to supervise during noon hour anyway, and they would be willing to look after the making of the soup if the Department will be good enough to supply it.\n\nIf the Department would consider providing soup for the 30 children who regularly bring their lunch, we would need the following amount of soup and also these supplies:\n\n**Soup Five Days a Week for January, February & March for 30 Pupils**\n\nSoup\u20146 cases of 48 cans each\u2014Aylmer or Campbell's or Heinz Soup which can be diluted\u2014Vegetable, Veg.\u2014Beef, and Tomato\n\n1 Hot-plate\u2014on which to heat the soup\n\n1 large aluminum preserving kettle and cover\n\n30 white enamel cups\n\n30 teaspoons\n\n1 large soup ladle\n\n2 sets of large salt & pepper shakers\n\n1 can opener\n\n1 dishpan\n\n6 tea towels\n\nSoap flakes or bar soap\n\nAn answer as to your decision on the above three matters will be greatly appreciated, at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga U.C. Day School.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTo the wanted sentences on the first page of the letter, I am unable to say whether any such advice was ever given from this office and if Brebner in fact made such a statement it was without authority from R.T.\n\nAm I correct in stating his statement may have been a carry over from pre-war practice.

Kenner.\nDecember 2nd, 1936.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\n\nRe School No. 304.\n\nThe regular teacher of the junior classroom at the Caughnawaga U. C. Day School, Miss Viola M. Daly, was obliged to give up duties on the 21st of October, owing to illness and the Department is today informed that she will be unable to resume duties until the month of January. Her name should, therefore, be removed from the paylist for the month of December.\n\nWith the approval of Dr. McGill, Miss Florence Elford was appointed substitute teacher from October 22nd, 1936, at a salary of $90 a teaching month. No payment of salary has yet been made to Miss Elford and she is, therefore, entitled to 10/31 of salary for October ($29.02); plus salary for November ($90.00) and salary for December ($90.00) or a total of $209.02. The following entry should, therefore, appear on the December paylist:\n\n304 - Florence Elford - Caughnawaga, Que. - $900 - $209.02\nJanuary 13, 1937.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\n\nRe: School No. 304.\n\nMiss Florence Elford, who was acting as substitute teacher at the Caughnawaga U. C. Indian Day School from October 22, 1936, to the end of December, 1936, has given up duties and her name should not appear on the paylist for the month of January, 1937.\n\nThe regular teacher, Miss Viola M. Daly, has resumed duties on the first instant and the following entry should, therefore, appear on the January paylist:\n\n304 - Viola M. Daly - Caughnawaga, Que. - $90.00\nApril 12, 1937.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\n\nRe School No. 304.\n\nMiss Viola Daly, teacher of the junior room at the Caughnawaga U. C. Indian Day School, was obliged to give up duties owing to illness at the end of March.\n\nApproval has been granted for the appointment of Miss Ella Bryan as substitute teacher from April 5th, 1937, at the same salary as paid Miss Daly, viz., $90.00 a teaching month. Miss Bryan should, therefore, be paid 26/30 of salary for April (26/30 x $90.) or $78.00 and the following entry should appear on the April pay list:\n\n304 - Ella Bryan - Caughnawaga, Que. - $78.00\n\nMiss Bryan's services will be continuous from the above date until such time as you receive further instructions from this Branch.\n\n(Copy of letter of appointment attached).\nOttawa, May 21, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Brisebois,-\n\nYou will remember that, when I was on the reserve on the 11th instant, Miss Daly told me that she intended to return to duty immediately as teacher of the Caughnawaga U. C. Indian Day School.\n\nPlease let me know if she has again taken charge of the junior room and, if so, the date on which she began duties. This information is required in order to decide what amount should be paid to Miss Bryan and to Miss Daly for the month of May.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nF. Brisebois, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nMay 27th, 1937.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\n\nRe: School No. 304.\n\nThe Department is informed by Indian Agent Brisebois that Miss Ella Bryan discontinued teaching at the Caughnawaga U. C. Indian Day School on May 16th, last. She is, therefore, entitled to 16/31 of salary for May ($90.) or $46.45.\n\nMiss Viola M. Daly resumed duties at this school on May 17th, last, and she should, therefore, be paid 15/31 of May salary (15/31 X $90.00) or $43.55.\n\nIn view of the above, the following entries should appear on the May paylist:\n\n| School | Name          | Payee                  | Amount |\n|--------|---------------|------------------------|--------|\n| 304    | Ella Bryan    | c/o F.

As you were informed by the Superintendent of Indian Education, the Department desires to give this school activity a fair trial; but we do not wish to incur heavy capital expense until the success of the undertaking has been assured. Mr. Ferrier promised that the building would be floored and that a Quebec heater would be installed. No other expense, that is not absolutely necessary, can be undertaken at this time. Desks, a blackboard and other classroom equipment will, of course, be supplied.\n\nYou should write to the Department, formally offering the church for school purposes on these conditions. The Indian agent will be asked to report on the need for outdoor closets and certain other repairs that are mentioned in your communication, but the Department cannot undertake to expend a large sum from Parliamentary Appropriation, on a building that it does not own, before a separate school has been given a fair trial.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMr. Mitchel Lt. Deere,\nCaughnawaga,\nQue.\nOttawa, Dec. 27, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department has decided to give a fair trial to a Protestant school at Caughnawaga. Four years ago, with the concurrence of your office, this activity was discontinued because of poor attendance. There are at present a few bona fide Protestant children of school age and certain other children, whose parents have stated that they are now Protestants and would like a separate school. Mr. Mitchel Deere, the lay preacher, has offered the Methodist Church building for school purposes and my object in writing to you is to have you confirm this offer. The Department intends to put in a new floor, properly heat the building and equip it with the necessary classroom furniture.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. C. E. Manning, B.A., D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary of Home Missions,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nWesley Buildings,\nToronto, Ont.\nDecember,\nThirty-first,\nNineteen-twenty-three.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nI duly received your letter of December 27th, notifying me that the Department of Indian Affairs had decided to give a fair trial to a Protestant school at Caughnawaga, that Mr. Deere, the lay preacher, had offered the Methodist Church building for school purposes and that your object in writing me was to have this offer confirmed.\n\nI am not familiar with the situation at Caughnawaga but will make enquiries from our representatives and write you in a few days.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory,\n\nI am,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nC. E. Manning.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMr. J.D. McLean,\nIndian Dept.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter No. 5-5-5, dated Dec. 27/23, I have the honor to grant to the Dept consent to use the Methodist Church here as a trial Protestant school. In this I have the consent of the Chairman of the District Rev. Robt. Scott of Montreal, under whose supervision I have the powers invested in me.\n\nThis building will require considerable repair, but we are sure that the Department will render it a comfortable, healthy and sanitary place for the children to be in, before school opens.\n\nThanking you for your consideration of my Protestant people here,\n\nYour respectfully,\n\nMitchell L. Deer.\nJanuary,\nFourth,\nNineteen-twenty-four.\n\nMy dear Sir;-\n\nRE CAUGHNAWAGA PROTESTANT SCHOOL.\n\nReplying again to your letter of December 27th, re the opening of a Protestant School at Caughnawaga and using the Methodist Church building there for school purposes, - I beg to say that I have made enquiries relative to this matter from the Rev. Robert Smith - Chairman of the Montreal District of the Methodist Church - and find that he concurs in your proposal, providing it be understood that, insofar as it may be necessary, the building shall be used for both school and church purposes.\n\nI do not know of any reason why our Society should object to using the church for school purposes for the time being at least, and we will, consequently, raise no objection to your doing this.\n\nI am,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nC. E. Manning\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, January 7, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to authorize you to arrange for the purchase and installation of maple flooring for the Methodist Church building at Caughnawaga. Permission has been received from the Methodist Church authorities, and the Department intends to conduct a Separate school in the building. You are also authorized to purchase a Quebec heater and have it installed as soon as the flooring is laid. You might have all labour performed by the members of the Band. Mr. Thos. Patton and Mr. Mitchell Deere informed Mr. Ferrier that they could arrange for the labour quite easily.\n\nPlease report on the need for outdoor closets, and intimate whether any other repairs to the building are necessary before classroom activities can be satisfactorily conducted.\n\nThe Department is ordering desks, and you will be advised in this connection at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nOttawa, January 7, 1924.\n\nRev.

Letourneau, Esq., Indian Agent, Adirondack Junction, Que., the following school desks, teacher's desk, chairs and bookcase, viz:\n\n| Item                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|-----------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| No. 5 Single Desks    | 6        | $6.25      | $37.50      |\n|                      | 6        | $6.50      | $39.00      |\n|                      | 2        | $6.50      | $13.00      |\n| Teacher's Sanitary Desk | #120   |            | $2.00       |\n| Chair, #76           | 1        | $6.00      |             |\n| Visitors' Chairs, #74 | 2        | $.50       | $1.00       |\n| Bookcase, Wood Panel Doors | #20 |            | $2.00       |\n\nTotal: $185.75\n\nThis equipment should be supplied at the same rate as charged for the desks ordered for delivery at Wallauesburg, Ont., as per our letter of the 8th instant. The desks should be shipped set up; ing wells to be supplied with each.\n\nThe desks, etc., should be supplied at the above price, viz: $185.75, F.O.B. Adirondack Junction, Que., and when shipment has been made, please forward your account, in duplicate, to Mr. Letourneau, whose post office address is St. Constant, Que. He is being informed that this order has been placed with you, and requests, upon receipt of this equipment, if in good condition, to certify the account and send it to the Department, when payment will be made.\n\nI shall be pleased to receive an acknowledgment of this order and the date when shipment will go forward.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. H. Paet,\nAccountant & Purchasing Agent.\n\nJ. Oliver & Sons Ltd.,\n21 Oliver St.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 9, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the repairs and equipment required to fit up the mission building to be used as a classroom in connection with the Protestant day school which it is proposed to re-open on the Chuksnaga Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that authority has already been granted you to purchase the maple flooring required, also the Quebec heater and the necessary stove pipe.\n\nYou may arrange for the installation of the 4 double windows required, and you may also arrange to have the inside walls burlapped to a height of about 5', and given two coats of paint.\n\nRegarding the erection of an outside coal bin and closets, it is considered that a building having a compartment of sufficient size in the centre for the coal and wood and a closet at each end\u2014one for boys and one for girls\u2014would be the best arrangement. You may, therefore, arrange to have a building of the required size erected. No unnecessary expenditure should be incurred, and you should purchase all materials required after competitive prices have been obtained. Padlocks should be installed on the door of each closet and on the door of the fuel compartment. The Department will leave the erection of this building in your hands, to see that satisfactory and ample provision is made for closets for both the boys and girls and for the storage of the fuel. You may also arrange to purchase the quantity of wood and coal required for the balance of the present winter, and competitive prices should be obtained, if possible.\n\nI have to request that you will state as soon as possible the dimensions of the blackboards required. You should measure the wall space on which it is proposed to place the boards, and state the length and width required. As soon as this information is received, an order will be placed here for the blackboards required.\n\nAs you have been informed in a separate communication, the Department is placing an order for the school desks and other furnishings required. A supply of books, stationery, etc., will be forwarded from the Government Stationery Office.\n\nThe labour required should be performed by members of the Band, under the charge of Mitchell Deer as foreman. Proper time sheets, in duplicate, should be kept for the labour employed.\n\nWhen the above work has been completed, you should forward\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nproperly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of the material purchased, together with a memo showing the names of the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted, as well as time sheets, in duplicate, for the labour, properly certified.\n\nYou will be good enough to attend to the repairs required in order to have the building ready for classroom purposes as soon as possible. No unnecessary expenditure should be incurred, and the Department will expect you to see that the work is performed and the material supplied as cheaply as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, January 9, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that we are today placing an order with Messrs. J. Oliver & Sons Ltd., Ottawa, to ship, addressed to you at Adirondack Junction, Que., the following school desks, teacher's desk, chairs and bookcase, for the use of the Protestant school which it is intended to open on the Caughnawaga Reserve:\n\n5 No. 5 Single Desks ......................... $6.25 ea. - $31.25,\n6 No. 4 \" .................................. 6.50 \" - 39.00,\n5 No. 3 \" .................................. 6.50 \" - 32.50,\n4 No. 2 \" .................................. 6.75 \" - 27.00,\n1 Teacher's Sanitary Desk, #120 .............. 25.00,\n1 No. 1 Chair, #76 ........................... 6.00,\n2 Visitors' Chairs, #74 ....................... 3.50 \" - 7.00,\n1 Bookcase, Wood Panel Doors, #20 .......... 20.00,\n\n$185.75.\n\nThese desks will be shipped set up. Ink wells will be supplied with each desk.\n\nThe above firm have been requested to make immediate shipment, and to forward their account, in duplicate, to you. When the goods have been received, if in good condition, you should attach the account to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and send to the Department in order that payment can be made.\n\nWhen the desks arrive, you should arrange to have them taken to the school and set up in the classroom. The smaller desks should be placed in front and the larger at the rear.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. B. McLean,\nAest. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, I beg to inform you that the dimensions of the two blackboards required for the use of the Protestant School at Caughnawaga, would be 8 feet long for each and a height of about 3 feet. I intend to have these blackboards placed one at each end of the classroom.\n\nIt is suggested by the man in charge of the alterations to be made at the mission building, (an Indian named Mitchell Deere) that a door be placed near one of the corners at the rear of the classroom, in order to facilitate the exit of the pupils and the getting in of the wood and coal from the proposed building that is to be put up towards the rear of the school lot. I believe that this idea is recommendable, and if approved by your Department I beg to ask your authorization to purchase the necessary material. In case of this new opening at the rear of the building, it would be necessary, as stated above, to have one of the blackboards placed at each end of the classroom, otherwise, it would be preferable to have them both placed in front of the pupils, but, at one end or the other the dimensions are the same as stated above. The Indian labourers are commencing Monday the 14th instant to work on the necessary alterations. Two men will be at work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, January 16, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, and in reply beg to inform you that an order is today being placed with the Government Stationery Office to forward addressed to you at Adirondack Junction, Que., 2 beaver plate blackboards, each 8' x 3' wide, with the necessary chalk trough and moulding, for the use of the Protestant school on the Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to authorize the placing of a door in one of the corners at the rear of the classroom. It is considered that by so doing it would interfere with the placing of blackboards in their proper positions in the classroom. It would be unsatisfactory to have one of these boards placed at the rear of the classroom, it being preferable to have them both placed in front of the pupils.\n\nWe note that the repairing of this building commenced on the 14th instant.

I note that you consider the grant requested from Band Funds is exclusively for a church building. I have to inform you that the funds of the band are extremely limited, their capital amounting to approximately $2,000. It is, therefore, impossible to give favourable consideration.\n\nIt is the Department's intention to relieve the present crowded condition of the church and classroom combined, as soon as funds are available for the extension of our educational programme on this reserve. The Roman Catholic schools are also very crowded and it is hoped that funds will be provided within the next few years for a building with several classrooms. This will release for the Protestant Day School the building formerly used for this purpose and which provides ample accommodation. When such action has been taken, the question of allowing church services in the school will be given favourable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Manning,\n\nDear Doctor:\n\nI was in Ottawa a week ago Tuesday and brought before them the matter of the former parsonage site for sale. They were very hesitant to commit themselves one way or another. I intend to follow it up however.\n\nOur immediate problem, however, in Caughnawaga is how to facilitate the return of that school to us. If this could be secured before the school term opens it would solve in the meantime our difficulties.\n\nI did not feel it my duty to ascertain from the Department their attitude regarding this matter. I felt that this should properly come from you.\n\nIf we could give our people at Caughnawaga some definite assurance upon this point, I am sure we could easily control and direct the enormous surplus energy; without it this energy will be a danger and a menace.\n\nI hope you will see the Department if you have not already done so, regarding this matter. The return of this building as you see will partly meet the present demands of our work, as the present situation and conditions down there cannot be continued much longer. I believe furthermore, if the conditions were generally known in the United Church it would not be tolerated.\n\nI am yours fraternally,\n\n(Sgd.) J.J. Oke.\nBrandon Industrial School,\nJuly 30th, 1926.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed is a copy of a letter written to Rev. Dr. Manning and given to me to deal with. It is written by the Rev. J. J. Oke after a visit to Ottawa. The Department will know that Mr. Oke's visit was not prompted by the Church authorities, at the same time it raises a question that appears to be of importance as it touches a question of policy. I would be pleased to know the situation from the Departmental point of view.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6073, file 304-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, August 5, 1926.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to the Protestant Indian day school at Caughnawaga. I note that the Rev. Mr. Oke has written to Dr. Manning concerning using for Protestant school purposes the building in which was conducted up to six years ago a school under the joint auspices of the Methodist Missionary Society and this Department. This building belongs to the Department, but shortly after the Protestant work closed, it was used for the purposes of the Roman Catholic school on the Reserve, which is, of course, a Roman Catholic one. When the Protestant school was reopened in 1923, there was, of course, an agitation to use the former building. However, this was now urgently required for the satisfactory conduct of the Roman Catholic Indian school system, and the Department made temporary arrangements to try out the Protestant school again in the Methodist Church. In January, 1924, the Chairman of the Methodist District authorized Mr. Mitchell L. Deere to offer the church to the Department for school purposes, and Dr. Manning concurred in this arrangement. We undertook repairs, and fitted up the building as a classroom.\n\nI believe more classroom accommodation is needed at Caughnawaga, and, as soon as funds can be provided for the purpose, what is considered necessary will be erected. At that time the question of returning the Protestant activity to the building formerly used by them will be given consideration.\n\nThe Department yesterday received a communication from Mrs. Margaret D'Ailleboust, of Caughnawaga, in which she states that she speaks on behalf of the trustees of the local United Church. Our correspondent asks us to remove the school desks and the Department's other property from the old Methodist church, as it is to be demolished in the immediate future. I have written Mrs. D'Ailleboust, in part, as follows:\n\n\"The Department had planned to use the building for the coming academic year for Protestant school purposes, and there are no funds for the purpose of providing further accommodation. I have to inform you that the school may have to be closed for the time if the church building is not available. In view of these circumstances, cannot the demolition be postponed? Is it absolutely necessary that the old building be torn down to make room for the new church?\"\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T.

I wish to point out that in January, 1924, the Chairman of the Methodist District authorized Mr. Mitchell L. Deere to offer this building to the Department for school purposes. The Methodist Missionary Society concurred in this arrangement.\n\nThe Department had planned to use the building for the coming academic year for Protestant school purposes, and there are no funds for the purpose of providing other accommodation.

Also, what is the prospect of a grant being made from funds belonging to the Caughnawaga Indians to assist in building a church at Caughnawaga for the use of the people who are members and adherents of the United Church of Canada?\n\nWith every good wish,\n\nI am,\nFaithfully yours,\n\nC.E.

It seems a great hardship to the people that they have to restrain one-half of their people from attending divine service while the other half are occupying the full capacity of their only place of worship.\n\nFor about two years there has been a very marked spiritual movement among the Indians there and they are clamoring for suitable accommodation to take full advantage of this favorable condition.\n\nWe find a very fine spirit obtaining among the Indians and we believe with the Public School being placed at their disposal for the education of their children and a suitable place of worship, there is promise of a marked advance in the general uplift of this people.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary of Home Mission Com. of Montreal Pres.\nJune 28, 1927.\n\nDear Dr. Cruikshank:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant, with reference to the school building at Caughnawaga that is to be made ready for Protestant activity for the beginning of the coming academic year. At the request of the Missionary Society of the United Church, I have already taken steps to arrange that the local United Church Missionary have the use of this building for church purposes for July and August. The school desks which are in the old church building will, of course, be moved over for the use of the Protestant School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. W. R. Cruikshank, D.D.,\nRoom 256,\n277 St. Catherine St. W.,\nMontreal, P.Q.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 28th instant, concerning allowing the Protestant Missionary at Caughnawaga to use the St-Anne's School as a place of worship for the summer months.\n\nIn reply I am sorry to say that I had unperceived that part of your letter of the 6th instant relating to my recommendation to that effect.\n\nI beg to say that your instructions have been thoroughly carried out in connection with the transportation of the Department's desks and other equipment from the St-Anne's school into the basement of the Boys' school.\n\nI now beg to recommend that the Protestant Missionary at Caughnawaga be permitted to use the building as a church for the summer months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, July 5, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo and I note you recommend that the Protestant Missionary be allowed to use the St. Anne's School as a place of worship for the summer months. In future, this building will be known as the Protestant School, and I should be pleased if you would turn the keys over to a local responsible member of the United Church, so that the desks from the church and any benches or other equipment needed for the summer months can be moved to it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

CHENE\n\nRelative to the general repairs that are at present being carried out at the Caughnawaga R. C. Indian Schools, it is advisable that you visit and inspect the work being done at an early date. You should report as to what further work is required to complete the erection of the fence around the central school property, stating the material and labour necessary for the completion of this work. You should also visit the Protestant School building and report as to the repairs, painting, etc., that you would recommend in order to place this building in a satisfactory condition, giving, if possible, an estimate of the cost of any work which you would recommend be carried out. Further, you should furnish a report regarding the erection of a new fence around the property, the removal of the swings and the fitting up of the ground around the school. Please report, also, on any other matters requiring attention at these schools.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, May 2, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, relative to the erection of a fence around the grounds at the Protestant School on the Caughnawaga Reserve and the removal of the swings on the ground. In reply I have to say that Mr. Chene, of this Department, will likely visit Caughnawaga next week, and he will report concerning the fencing and also other repairs and renovations required at the Protestant School. You will be advised in due time of the date of Mr. Chene's visit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant,\nP. Q.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. Scott & School Branch,\n\nIn compliance with instructions given me on the 2nd instant by the Acting Deputy Superintendent General I beg to give you the following information concerning the work required for the repairing of the Protestant School at Caughnawaga, Que.\n\nThe building is in need of painting, inside and outside. The estimated cost of this is $250.00. The porches of the entrances are badly demolished and should be reconstructed at a cost of $60.00. A pneumatic water supply system should be provided at a cost of $150.00. The swings which are now on the school grounds should be removed to give more space for a playground at a cost of $10.00. The outside closets are absolutely useless and two separate new ones should be provided at a cost of $120.00. There is no fence around the ground. The cost of erecting a good strong fence around the school lot would be in the neighborhood of $95.00 including the price of two single gates and one double one, also new doors with glazed panel for proposed entrance costing about $20.00.\n\nWhile at this school my attention was brought by the teacher, Mr. Ray, to the lack of space for a playground. The playground is only about 70 feet square. There is in the rear of the present school grounds a vacant lot measuring about 160 x 70 feet which belongs to the United Church, and which could provide an ideal playground for the pupils. This enlarging of the school property is most advisable for the reason that the road in front of the school will be transformed this year into an international highway, which means that the traffic will be very heavy and I notice that the pupils are now using the highway as a playground. I would, therefore, recommend that some means be taken to provide this school with adequate playgrounds.\n\nI should recommend that if the work above mentioned is authorized that the agent be requested to obtain competitive prices from local contractors and that the work be performed by contract under his immediate supervision.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nMonsieur,\n\nEn pr\u00e9vision des r\u00e9parations qui sont \u00e9videmment n\u00e9cessaires et qui doivent \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es dans le cours du mois de juin prochain \u00e0 la maison de l'\u00e9cole protestante ainsi que la r\u00e9fection de la cl\u00f4ture qui entoure le terrain de cette \u00e9cole comme aussi la reconstruction des cabinets de toilette qui doivent \u00eatre plac\u00e9s au fond de ce terrain, je d\u00e9sire vous informer que samedi dernier, le 25 courant, je suis all\u00e9 \u00e0 Caughnawaga afin d'engager un ou deux menuisiers comp\u00e9tents pour faire ces travaux, lorsque j'avais presque retenu les services de Thomas Patton, un des membres de l'Eglise Protestante \u00e0 Caughnawaga, mais au moment o\u00f9 je faisais \u00e0 M. Patton l'enumeration des travaux qui doivent \u00eatre faits \u00e0 la journ\u00e9e, j'ai alors rencontr\u00e9 M. Chas. Rae, l'instituteur de l'\u00e9cole protestante \u00e0 Caughnawaga qui m'a fait remarquer qu'il croyait inutile de faire faire ces travaux de r\u00e9parations puisque l'agrandissement de cette \u00e9cole s'imposait avant l'ouverture des classes au mois de septembre prochain. M. Rae pr\u00e9tend que l'inscription des \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui est pr\u00e9sentement au nombre de 40 sera probablement \u00e0 75 lors de la prochaine ouverture des classes. Alors j'ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Patton de ne pas commencer ces travaux de r\u00e9parations jusqu'\u00e0 nouvel ordre. Je lui ai demand\u00e9 cependant de prendre les moyens d'avoir de l'eau, si possible, du puits art\u00e9sien qui est sur le terrain de cette \u00e9cole afin de faire analyser cette eau par le Bureau Provincial d'Hygi\u00e8ne quant \u00e0 savoir si cette eau est potable.\n\nM. Rae m'a aussi fait remarquer que lors de la visite de M. Chene, ing\u00e9nieur du D\u00e9partement, il lui a indiqu\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de l'agrandissement du terrain qui entoure pr\u00e9sentement l'\u00e9cole protestante. Voulez-vous bien m'informer si des arrangements \u00e0 cet effet ont \u00e9t\u00e9 conclus avec les\n\nLe Secr\u00e9taire,\nD\u00e9partement des Affaires des Indiens,\nOTTAWA.\nautorit\u00e9s de l'\u00c9glise Protestante \u00e0 Caughnawaga ou si nous devons faire construire la cl\u00f4ture ainsi que les cabinets de toilette sur le terrain tel qui existe actuellement.\n\nJe devais ajouter que le syst\u00e8me de chauffage de cette \u00e9cole est en tr\u00e8s mauvais \u00e9tat et des travaux assez consid\u00e9rables s'imposent avant l'ouverture des classes en septembre prochain.\n\nEn m\u00eame temps que des am\u00e9liorations seront faites \u00e0 cette \u00e9cole, je crois que l'installation pour un service de lumi\u00e8re et de pouvoir \u00e9lectrique devrait aussi \u00eatre fait.\n\nJ'attends maintenant de nouvelles instructions du D\u00e9partement avant de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 ces travaux.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nAgent des Indiens.\n\nLe Secr\u00e9taire,\nD\u00e9partement des Affaires des Indiens,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nIn regard to the repairs which are evidently necessary and which must be done during the course of the time next at the Protestant school house, as well as the rebuilding of the fence around the school grounds and also the reconstruction of the privies which must be placed at the extremity of that ground; I wish to inform you that last Saturday, the 15th inst., I went to Caughnawaga for the purpose of hiring one or two competent carpenters to do this work. I had almost retained the services of Thomas Patton, a member of the Protestant Church of Caughnawaga, but while I was enumerating the work to be done by day labour to Mr. Patton I met Mr. Chas. Rae, the teacher of the Protestant School who remarked to me that he thought it was useless to have all these repairs done since the enlargement of the school was imperative before the reopening of the classes in September. Mr. Rae contends that the registration which is at present up to 40 pupils will reach 75 when the school will reopen. I thereupon requested Mr. Patton not to start the work of repairs until new orders are received. However, requested him to take the means of getting some water if possible from the artesian well situated on the school grounds so as to have it analysed by the Provincial Board of Health, so as to know if it is drinkable.\n\nMr. Rae also remarked that when Mr. Chas. the Departmental Engineer visited the reserve...\nhe indicated to him the necessity of enlarging\nthe land at present surrounding the Protestant\nSchool. Would you kindly inform me if\nany arrangements were concluded to that\neffect with the authorities of the Protestant\nChurch of Osgoode, or otherwise should\nI have the fence built as well as the privies\non the present ground.\n\nI must add that the heating system of\nthat school is in very bad state and some work\nof considerable nature must be done before\nthe reopening of the school next September.\n\nWhen these improvements are made\nat this school, I believe it would be well to\nlook into the lighting and electric power sys-\ntem.\n\nI am now awaiting new instructions\nfrom the Department before any work\nis started.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have to request, however, that you obtain competitive prices from local contractors, including Mr. Barssion of Laprairie for the following work which should be performed at this School.\n\nThe demolishing and reconstruction of the entrance porches at both entrances which are now reported to be in a dilapidated condition.\n\nThe replacing of the present exterior doors by new ones with glazed panels divided into four panes at the top of each door.\n\nThe removing of the swings.\n\nThe cleaning of the basement and repairing of the heating apparatus throughout the building, also the painting of the walls with water colour paint.\n\nThe erection of two outside closets, single compartments, of similar construction to those erected at the boys' school, painted with two coats of paint.\n\nThe furnishing and erecting of a galvanized wire fence all around the school lot, similar to that now in place in front of the boys' school, with the exception of the front of the lot where the fencing should be the same as that previously installed. A single drive gate and two single gates for pupils' entrance.\n\nCleaning and painting with two coats of paint of the interior and exterior metal and wood work. The plastering to be painted with semitone paint same as the Central School. The adjusting of windows and interior doors and other parts of the building requiring attention.\n\nIt will be necessary that you prepare a specification describing the amount and nature of the work to be performed and it should be understood with the contractors that the work will have to be carried out under your immediate supervision and to your satisfaction. It is desired that you obtain separate prices for the wiring and installing of a complete system of electric lighting in the above mentioned buildings, with five drop lights in the attic rooms, two in the clock rooms, two in the basement, with separate switches for each room, also special wiring to\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6C73, file 304-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWater Pan\n\nThe water pan is conveniently located at the front where it belongs. It holds a bountiful supply of water and furnishes the necessary volume of humidity. Being placed immediately under the feed door, it is in the easiest possible position for refilling and cleaning.\n\nEnterprise Wood Grate\n\nWhen wood is burned a special grate is supplied which rests on top of the regular grate bars.\n\nHot Water Coil\n\nA coil with ample capacity to heat a thirty gallon tank can be readily attached at any time. You will observe that the feed front of the furnace is built to accommodate this coil and connections.\n\nLarge Doors\n\nThe extra large feed door on this furnace is a great convenience as it enables even large pieces of coal to be put on the fire without trouble. The ash pit door is also roomy. See page 5 for actual sizes.\n\nCasings\n\nHeavy gauge galvanized iron and black iron are the two materials used in the casings of the 600 Series All Cast. The illustration on page 4 shows the Pipeless Furnace casing construction. Outside casing consists of one sheet of galvanized iron whereas the inner casing is constructed of a galvanized iron sheet, a one inch circulating air space and then heavy black iron. The Pipe Furnace, of course, has only one casing consisting of galvanized iron, a circulating one inch air space and heavy black iron lining. The casing construction in both instances is recognized as the most efficient possible to produce. It means heat upstairs where you need it and a comparatively cool cellar.\n\nMade in Both Pipe and Pipeless Style\n\nThe 600 Series Enterprise All Cast Furnace is made in two sizes, Nos. 618 and 620 and in two styles \u2014 Pipe and Pipeless. In both cases the internal parts which have been described on the previous pages, are the same, the only variation being in the method of casing. The illustration on page 2 shows just how the Pipeless Furnace appears in the cellar. It has one large register in the floor above it. On page 5 you will find the Pipe Furnace shown. Of course, numerous heat pipes are taken off the top casing and cold air brought in at the bottom, the number and size of these pipes depending on the layout of the house or building to be heated. The plan of the building and numerous other factors determine whether the best results can be secured with a Pipeless or Pipe Furnace. To give accurate advice regarding these matters the Enterprise Heating Engineering Department is maintained. They request that a plan be sent them showing the building to be heated. In return they will supply a report stating exactly what type of furnace should be used, what size and explain in detail the layout. This service is FREE and obligates no one to buy. It makes absolutely sure of satisfactory heating and means that when their recommendations are followed the Enterprise Foundry Co. positively guarantee in writing that complete satisfaction will result.\nThe Last Word\n\nIf possible, before buying it would be desirable to see one of these Furnaces. In that way you could verify the statements which we have made. You would find that not in any respect has the case been over-stated. This Furnace will give you heat\u2014lots of it even in the coldest weather. The heated air will contain moisture and no dust or smoke\u2014prime essentials for health and cleanliness. Owing to its all cast construction it will continue to give this service year in and year out.\n\nFuel consumption will be at least one fifth less than with other Furnaces.

He also states that the ventilation is poor and recommends that the windows be fixed to open at the top.\n\nDuring the coming Christmas holidays you should arrange to have the floor of this school thoroughly scrubbed and, when dry, given a coat of floor oil. Please keep the expense for the purpose as low as possible.\n\nRelative to the suggestion of the Inspector regarding the ventilation, please report the alterations that would be necessary to permit the windows in the classroom to open at the top, and state the approximate cost of having these alterations made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It is now impossible, for instance, to close one of the outside doors because it was put almost out of use by these children. The outside closets are in an untolerable state and it is quite admissible that slovenliness is the proper of the larger number of those children.\n\nAs to the question of ventilation, I beg to say that the windows are well provided with ventilators, but, I wonder if they are used or not. A ventilator is also placed unto the chimney at one end of the classroom, it was only lately when this ventilator was forced open for use.\n\nPermit me to add that when this building was used by the R. C. children, there was plenty of ventilation given through the same ventilators which could also be used for by the present class of pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, December 13, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, and note that you have made arrangements to have the floor of the Caughnawaga United Church Indian Day School thoroughly scrubbed, and, when dry, given a coat of floor oil.\n\nWith reference to the ventilation, it is noted that the windows are provided with ventilators and that a ventilator is also placed in the chimney at one end of the classroom. You should see that all the ventilators are in a workable condition and that they are used by the teacher in the ventilation of the schoolroom. You should inform the teacher that it is expected she will see the classroom is kept well ventilated.\n\nRegarding the outdoor closets, I have to request that you will arrange to have them placed in a good, sanitary condition. No unnecessary expense should be incurred, but you should see that they are thoroughly cleaned. It is expected that the teacher will also impress upon the pupils the necessity of keeping these closets in good condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Le feu a origine dans un des tuyaux d'air pour se propager dans un des murs int\u00e9rieurs. Nous croyons que les enfants avaient jet\u00e9 du papier dans ce tuyau d'air.

I wish to make the following report.\n\nThe fire started almost immediately after the furnace man had lighted the furnace in the cellar. The fire originated in one of the air ducts to appear in one of the interior walls. We believe that the children had thrown paper in that air duct. Fortunately the alarm was given immediately and it was necessary to break the exterior door and demolish that wall where the fire seemed to extend to the ceiling.\n\nThe fire was extinguished but the damages reached about $400.00. I thought I could authorize Miss Cullen, the teacher, to suspend the teaching until she is advised to the contrary. I requested the guardian of the Catholic School, Mr. Robert, to place boards in the broken door as well as the windows so that no one would get in.\n\nWe now await your instructions before the school is repaired to reopen the class.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Cullen, senior teacher of the Protestant Indian Day School on the Caughnawaga Reserve, in which she requests that a supply of classroom material, wool, dental towels and two chairs be supplied.\n\nIn reply I have to say that an order has been forwarded to the Government Stationery Office to send to Miss Cullen's address the classroom supplies asked for. The wool for mittens, etc., and the dental towels were purchased here and have been sent to Miss Cullen.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of a small supply of Dustbane and two chairs of a type that would be satisfactory. It would be advisable for you to consult Miss Cullen as to the kind of chairs required, and you could then arrange for the purchase from a firm on the list to receive consideration, in accordance with departmental instructions. While serviceable chairs should be obtained, it is not intended that an expensive type be secured.\n\nAfter you have purchased the Dustbane and chairs, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nST. CONSTANT, P.Q.\nMarch 2nd, 1932.\n\nDear Miss Cullen,\n\nThe dental towels were ordered for you yesterday, also heather mixture wool. I would suggest that your C.G.I.T. should sew tabs on each towel, with the names of the pupils done in coloured thread. Each pupil would have two towels. I would give marks on laundry day for those who wash their hands properly and do not leave too much dirt on the towels. I am sending you under separate cover a package of heavy brown envelopes in which the pupils can keep their towels, etc., in their desks. I feel sure the girls of the C.G.I.T. will have bits of coloured thread that they can embroider the names with.\n\nRegarding the office chairs, I believe the Indian Agent will receive instructions in this connection, but I think it would help him if you would tell him just what you want. I think light-weight dark brown dining room chairs of some soft wood would be inexpensive and quite satisfactory.\n\nWhen you are making the cocoa syrup please paste on the jars for Miss Simons the enclosed labels. If Miss Simons mentions anything about the tomatoes you may say that in view of her limited space it has been decided to keep the store of these goods in the basement of your school.\n\nHoping everything is working out well for you, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMiss Jean Cullen,\n6137 Durocher Ave.,\nOutremont, Que.\nON HIS MAJESTY'S SERVICE\n\nTHIS COCOA SYRUP IS MADE WITH WATER,\nBUT IS NOT TO BE THINNED WITH WATER.

W. McGill, Esq., M.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nOn the Caughnawaga Reserve, near Montreal, the Board of Home Missions owns a lot next door to the church, on which is erected a comfortable square frame house. A few years ago when Mr. Oke was the missionary, he asked for permission to live in Lachine, because he had several children of High School age. This was granted and the house at Caughnawaga rented. On two or three occasions I discussed with Mr. Russell Ferrier the possibility of using this property for the junior class-room in connection with the day school. The difficulty in the situation arose from the fact that it was rented and the congregation were retaining the rentals. However, we have now succeeded in getting the tenant to vacate and I am writing to suggest that it would be in the best interests of all concerned if, when school opens in the fall, the Department were to rent this building from us. The West half on the ground floor would make a very much better school-room than the present one which is in use. The room on the North-East corner would make a good cloak-room for the children and the two teachers could be made very comfortable upstairs. The building is not in good repair, but we are prepared to put it in shape.\n\nThis arrangement would be very much more convenient from the standpoint of the teachers, as this building is the first one on the West side of the church, while the senior class-room is the first building on the East side of the church. All the work would then be consolidated in one place.\n\nWill you please be good enough at your earliest convenience to let me know what the attitude of the Department would be towards this proposition and what rent you would like to suggest.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MT\nOttawa, April 25, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, relative to the renting, from the United Church of Canada, of a frame house, situated on a lot next to the church on the Caughnawaga reserve, to be used as a junior classroom in connection with the Protestant Indian Day School. It is noted that the authorities of the United Church would be pleased to have this building placed in good repair and ready for classroom purposes when the school re-opens after the summer holidays on September first, next.\n\nAt the present time, the Department is renting from an Indian a building which is used as a junior classroom, for which a rental is paid at the rate of $150 per year. We will have no funds to pay any increase in this amount for the renting of the building referred to by you, and I shall be pleased to be advised if the Church would accept a rental at the above rate or even less. Further, I should request that you inform the Department how this building is heated, whether by stove or furnace, and if there would be storage facilities for fuel, etc.\n\nI may add that the Department is favourably disposed to consider your suggestion for the rental of this building. I should be pleased if you would state the amount of the rental that would be charged and furnish the other information requested. It is noted that, besides a classroom and a cloakroom for the children, comfortable living accommodation could be provided for the two teachers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B. A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nDear Mr. MacKenzie:\n\nRe: Day School Accommodation, Caughnawaga.\n\nOne hundred and fifty dollars a year seems to be a very small rental for a building as large as the one under consideration - especially in view of the fact that it will provide not only classroom accommodation but also living accommodation for the teachers. However, we are more interested in the work at Caughnawaga and in the progress of the School than in any other factor at the present time. The two teachers who are there now have created an entirely new atmosphere in the village and, with better accommodation and equipment, will undoubtedly be able to do a superior type of work - both educationally and in extra-curriculum activities. We agree, therefore, to accept a rental at the rate of $150.00 a year beginning September 1st.\n\nI am asking our Superintendent of Missions for a report as to the cost of the alterations which will be required. Just at present the building is being resurfaced. There is a splendid cement foundation under the whole house and a good furnace, with plenty of store room for fuel, food supplies &c. The tenant who has been occupying the building has not been using the furnace. I doubt if it has been in use for the last two years. The reason he gave was that the ground is low and a certain amount of water came into the basement in the spring and fall. Whether this is due to faulty construction or insufficient drainage, we will have to investigate. My personal opinion is that the tenant was heating the building with stoves because it is cheaper.\n\nOur Board will not be in a position to spend any large sum of money in renovations and improvements during 1933, and it may be that we will have to be content with using stoves for the first year. The removal of the partition downstairs and the painting and decorating of the whole house will cost us quite a sum.\n\nTrusting that this information will be satisfactory and assuring you that we appreciate your cooperation, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKJB.MLT\nOttawa, May 2nd, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department is making arrangements with the authorities of the United Church of Canada for the rental, as from the first of September next, of a frame house situated on a lot on the west side of the United Church - the senior classes being conducted in the first building on the east side of the Church. The west half of the ground floor of this building will make a much better classroom than the one which is at present in use and which is rented from Mrs. Atreno.\n\nI have to request, therefore, that you will give Mrs. Sak Atreno notice that the department will not require the building which was rented from her for classroom purposes after the first of September next. At that time, you should forward a voucher, in triplicate, properly certified for the balance of the rental due her to the date the lease terminates.\n\nThe United Church authorities will arrange to have the necessary repairs and alterations carried out to the frame house. There is a cement foundation under this house and a good furnace, also plenty of store room for fuel, food supplies, etc. There will be living accommodation for the two teachers in the upstairs part of the building. The Department is allowing the church authorities rental at the rate of $150 per annum.\n\nAbout the middle of August next, you should arrange for the transfer of the desks and school equipment in the house rented from Mrs. Atreno to the frame building owned by the United Church. Any coke on hand in the cellar of the house or in the shed should also be transferred. No unnecessary expense should be incurred by you in removing the classroom equipment to the building owned by the church authorities and fitting same up for classroom purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant,\nP. Q.\nOttawa, May 2nd, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, relative to the renting, from the United Church of Canada, of a frame house situated on the lot next to the United Church on the Caughnawaga reserve, to be used as a junior classroom in connection with the Protestant Indian Day School. I note that, while you consider the rental offered, viz.: $150 a year, to be rather small, the Church authorities will agree to accept same at this rate as from September first, next.\n\nThe Department is informing Mr. Agent Letourneau accordingly and requesting him to inform the owner of the building which is at present used as a junior classroom that the lease for same will terminate on the above mentioned date. The Agent is also being requested, on or about the middle of August, next, to arrange for the transfer of the desks and all other classroom equipment to the building which is being rented from the authorities of the United Church.

No doubt, you will be present at the Closing Exercises, when you should arrange to see Mr. Phelan and discuss the matter of supplying screens. I may say that the quotation which you forwarded is considered excessive, as the Department has no funds to incur so large an expenditure in providing screens for the windows of the church.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant,\nP. Q.\nLe Secr\u00e9taire,\nD\u00e9partement des Affaires Indiennes,\nOTTAWA.\n\nMonsieur,\n\nPermettez-moi de referer \u00e0 votre lettre du 2 du mois dernier relativement \u00e0 la nouvelle installation des pupitres, etc., qui devra \u00eatre faite dans le cours des deux mois prochains dans la Maison de la Mission de l'Eglise Unie, \u00e0 Caughnawaga.\n\nAu troisi\u00e8me paragraphe de votre lettre vous m'informez qu'il y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 une bonne fournaise au sous-basement de cette b\u00e2tisse. En effet cette fournaise existe mais \u00e0 moins que les calorif\u00e8res qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9s ne soient re install\u00e9es, cette fournaise sera d'aucune utilit\u00e9 pour le chauffage de l'\u00e9cole.\n\nAu moins que le D\u00e9partement ait l'intention d'installer dans cette nouvelle classe la fournaise (Quebec heater) qui servait l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re dans la maison de Dame Atrenho, cette fournaise du sous-basement serait alors inutile et ce serait en plus une \u00e9conomie sur l'achat du charbon, parceque je pr\u00e9vois que si la Mission soit tenue de refaire l'installation des calorif\u00e8res, cette fournaise du sous-basement devra consommer une grande quantit\u00e9 de charbon, alors que l'usage de la fournaise Quebec dans la classe seulement n'exigera qu'environ six ou sept tonnes de charbon.\n\nCependant, il y a aussi la question de savoir si les institutrices habiteront le haut de cette maison et si dans ce cas le D\u00e9partement sera tenu au chauffage de toute cette habitation, il faudrait alors que la fournaise du sous-basement serve au chauffage de toute la b\u00e2tisse et qu'en cons\u00e9quence les calorif\u00e8res soient re install\u00e9es.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nAgent des Indiens.\nDear Sir,\n\nPermit me to refer to your letter of the end of last month concerning the new installation of desks, etc., to be made during the course of the next two months in the building of the United Church Mission at Caughnawaga.\n\nIn the third paragraph of your letter you informed me that there is already a good furnace in the basement of that building. In fact there is a furnace, but unless the radiators, which were removed, are reinstalled that furnace will be of no use for the heating of the school.\n\nUnless the Department intends to install a new kind of furnace (Quebec heater) which was used last year in the house of Mrs. Atrenho, this furnace would be then useless and it would be, furthermore, an economy in the purchase of coal, because I foresee that if the Mission is to reinstall the radiators, the furnace in the cellar will consume a large quantity of coal, while the use of the Quebec Heater in the classroom would only need from 6 to 7 tons of coal.\n\nHowever, there is also the question of knowing whether the teachers will dwell in the upper part of this building, and if such is the case the Department will have to heat the whole building. It would then be necessary to use the furnace in the cellar for the heating of the whole building and consequently the radiators would have to be installed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLorenzo Lestourneau,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 7, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th ultimo, regarding the fitting up of the building situated on the lot next to the United Church on the Caughnawaga reserve, to be used as a junior classroom in connection with the Protestant Indian Day School.\n\nWith reference to the heating of this building, I have to say it is considered that the stove, a Quebec heater, which is at present in the building rented from Mrs. Atrenho, could be moved to heat the new classroom. I may say the Department understands that the teachers will not be living in the upper part of this building, as they have arranged for boarding accommodation elsewhere. Therefore, it will not be necessary to have the radiators installed and the furnace in the basement placed in order. It is thought that it would be satisfactory to heat this building by stove.\n\nYou should arrange in due time to have the desks, school equipment and stove removed to the house which is being rented from the United Church for classroom purposes. If any cleaning, etc., is required, you can have all work done so all equipment transferred so that the classroom will be ready to carry on the work when the school reopens after the present summer holidays. The Department will expect you to see that all expenses in removing the equipment, stove, etc., and setting up of same in the new classroom will be carried out at the lowest possible cost.\n\nThe Department understands that the church authorities were undertaking certain repairs and alterations to make a satisfactory classroom. You might discuss this matter with the Missionary, the Reverend Mr. Whitebeans, under whose charge the work in connection with the repairs and alterations is being done. Please have him see that all work is completed and the classroom ready for occupation in due time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nL.

Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant,\nP. Q.\nOttawa, August 2, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nRev. Mr. Whitebeans, of the Caughnawaga Reserve, visited the Department yesterday and stated that he could purchase wire screening and have the windows of the Caughnawaga United Church properly screened at a cost not exceeding $30 for material and labour. This is considerably less than the estimate submitted in your letter of June 10th, and Mr. Whitebeans was authorized to have the work done and hand you accounts, in triplicate, which you should forward to the Department for payment.\n\nMr. Whitebeans also pointed out that some of the smaller windows in the church were broken last year by the children attending the Caughnawaga Protestant School while playing at recess. The Department understands it will not require a large expenditure to replace these, and you might make arrangements with Mr. Whitebeans to have this work done also, and submit an account for the glass for our consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The house was first rented from November 1st, 1930, and payment of rental up to November 1st, 1932, was previously made. The amount due, therefore, was for the period November 1st, 1932, to September 1st, 1933, at the rate of $150 a year, or $125. You should, therefore, inform Mrs. Atremho that there is no further amount due her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nL.

Je recommande qu'une somme d'environ $2.00 me soit autoris\u00e9e pour les r\u00e9parer.\n\nDans la classe r\u00e9cemment install\u00e9e dans la maison de la Mission tout me semble complet. Cependant, comme la ventilation se fait pr\u00e9sentement en soulevant les ch\u00e2ssis int\u00e9rieurs, il n'en sera plus ainsi lorsque les ch\u00e2ssis doubles seront pos\u00e9s \u00e0 l'automne. Ces ch\u00e2ssis doubles n'ont pas de carreaux de ventilation et \u00e0 moins que les propri\u00e9taires de cette maison soient tenus d'y pourvoir, il en co\u00fbterait environ $3.00 au D\u00e9partement pour installer deux carreaux de ventilation dans deux ch\u00e2ssis doubles, \u00e0 l'avant et arri\u00e8re de la maison.\n\nEn faisant la visite de la classe install\u00e9e dans la maison de la Mission, j'ai constat\u00e9 qu'il y faisait trop chaud pour les enfants qui baignaient. Le gardien de l'\u00e9cole, Matthew Lazare, est en m\u00eame temps venu me demander de lui procurer une corde de bois. Je lui ai r\u00e9pondu de s'adresser pour cela \u00e0 M. A. Robert, le gardien des \u00e9coles Catholiques qui en a une provision \u00e0 l'abri pour livraison aux \u00e9coles contre un recu de la main des Institutrices. Je lui ai fait remarquer qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de chauffer continuellement les salles de classe au bois, qu'un peu de feu dans la matin\u00e9e suffisait pour en chasser l'humidit\u00e9, mais mes suggestions ne semblent pas fort l'impressionner.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nAgent des Indiens.\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI respectfully submit that yesterday while making an inspection of the Protestant Schools at Longueuil, I noticed that the swings on the play grounds were in bad shape and accidents might happen to the children. I recommend that the authorities be asked to spend about $2.00 to repair them.\n\nIn the class rooms recently installed in the Mission building everything seems to be complete. However, the ventilation is so poor that even by opening the interior windows, this will become impossible when the double windows are set in the fall. These double windows have no ventilating panes and under the provisions of the law are obliged to be kept closed during the hot weather.\n\nI visited the classrooms in the Mission building and notice that the atmosphere was too hot and that the children were suffering. The teacher of the school, Mrs. Laroche, informed me that she needed me to get her a case of beer. I told him to address himself to Mr. Robert, the guardian of the Catholic Schools who has a surplus on hand to be delivered at the schools on presentation of a receipt from the teacher. I remarked it was not necessary to heat the class rooms continued to work, that a small fire in the morning was sufficient to get rid of the dampness but my suggestions do not seem to impress him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

With that understanding, I visited the reserve, made arrangements to rent a house, owned by Mr. Skye, next-door to the senior school building, from September 1st, for $10.00 a month. The house has since been completely furnished by the United Church and the teachers have been living in it for four months. A proper lease was drawn up and turned over to the Indian Agent early in October.\n\nUp to date, Mr. Michael Skye has received no rent and he is beginning to feel that I have \"put one over on him.\" When the teachers approach the Agent about it, he says that the rent cannot be paid except through him, and that he has had no orders regarding requisitioning for these payments.\n\nWill you please be good enough to look into the matter at your convenience.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J.

The local Indian Agent has been requested to forward vouchers for the rental due at the rate mentioned, at the end of each quarter.\n\nWe have received a copy of the lease which, it is noted, is for a period of twelve months from the first of September, 1935.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.

Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland: Re: Accommodation, Junior Room,\nCaughnawaga Day School, P. Q.\n\nIn connection with the meeting of the Executive Committee of our Board, which was held last week, we had a discussion with the Superintendent of Missions for the Montreal-Ottawa area concerning the accommodation for our missionary on the Caughnawaga-Oka field, Rev. C. J. Dean. He is finding the cost of working his field prohibitive and we are being asked to spend a considerable sum of money in renovating the Caughnawaga house, now being used as a school-room, so that it will be available for his use by September lst. It will therefore be necessary for the Department to find some other accommodation for Miss Daly's class, which is now being housed in that building.\n\nI would like to make a suggestion, namely, that your architect seriously consider re-modelling the senior class-room, now being used by Miss Kenner. By lowering the ceiling 3 feet and putting an extension of about 6 feet on the back of the building, two splendid class-rooms could be provided on the ground floor and an excellent apartment prepared for the teachers upstairs. The Department is now paying $22.50 a month rent to provide for the junior room and the teachers. The change could be effected for an expenditure of about $3500.00.\n\nI hope to be in Ottawa on Monday next and to have the privilege of discussing this and some other problems with you.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKJB.MLT\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6C74, file 304-5, part 3)\nOttawa, February 4, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, addressed to Mr. Sutherland, of this Department, relative to the providing of accommodation for the junior class of the Protestant School on the Caughnawaga reserve for the academic year beginning on or about September first, next. It is noted that the building now rented from the church authorities for this room will be required for the use of the missionary on the reserve.\n\nIt is extremely doubtful if there would be funds available to remodel and enlarge the building used by the senior class, in order to provide a second classroom and living accommodation for the teachers. The Department is requesting the local Indian Agent to make enquiry concerning the possibility of renting a house that would be suitable for the junior class. As there is ample time to make arrangements for classroom accommodation, the matter will in the meantime be kept in mind. I understand that Mr. Sutherland discussed this matter with you during your visit to the Department yesterday.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Heaton, B. A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, February 4, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from the authorities of the Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, in which they state they will require, as from September first, next, the building which is now being rented for them for classroom purposes for Miss Daly's class, on the Caughnawaga reserve.\n\nThe Department will have no funds to remodel the senior classroom, now being used by Miss Kenner, in order to provide additional classroom space and living quarters for the teacher. It will therefore be necessary to consider what arrangements can be made to provide accommodation for the class now being taught by Miss Daly. It is thought it might be possible to rent a suitable house on the reserve that could be fitted up for classroom purposes. I would request that you make enquiry and, in due time, inform the Department what arrangements you would recommend be made to rent a suitable house or otherwise provide for the extra classroom. As stated, it will not be necessary to have the classroom ready until the school re-opens after next summer holidays, on or about September first.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

Mr. Dean and myself were not found suitable for the purpose required.\n\nRev. Mr. Dean expressed his dissatisfaction of not being provided with a place meeting with the standards and specifications required for the number of pupils of that class etc., and gave me to understand that he was leaving everything to the Department, stating that there were no private dwellings which could be used as a school.\n\nHowever, owing to the situation in regard to the matter I interviewed Reverend Sister M. Cleophas, Principal of the R.C. Schools, in order to find out if room could not be found for Miss. Daly's class, for at least a year, at any of the R.C. Village Schools.\n\nThe Rev. Principal advised me today, that in order to oblige the Department, it would be possible to accommodate the Junior class of the Protestant School, at the Eastern School. The Sister states that by combining the two preparatory classes of the Eastern and the Kathari Schools together, she could manage to let Miss. Daly have the use of one class of the Eastern School. It being understood, however, that this arrangement will only be temporary, as the Sisters will badly need this room for the 1937-38 school term.\n\nI would recommend the acceptation of the Rev. Sister's offer for the next school year. In the meantime, it might be possible to find some other quarters for 1937.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Agent has, therefore, arranged with the Sister Superior of the Caughnawaga R. C. School to combine two of their preparatory classes. This will leave a vacant room in the building known as the Eastern School. This building is the closest school to the present United Church School, and should be very suitable for the pupils of the junior room of the United Church School.\n\nIt should be understood that this arrangement only pertains to the academic year 1936-37.\n\nTruly,\n\nT.

The steel fence of about 60 feet long, in front of that school would also require one coat of grey paint, as its original paint is now gone and the fence rusted. Mr. Phelan of the Department has noticed the condition of the woodwork at his last visit here. The labour for the above work would be of approximately three days' work, at 30\u00a2 an hour. No varnish will have to be purchased, as we have recently received some from the Salvage stock of the St. Vincent de Paul Penitentiary. We also have the necessary paint for the steel fence.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 27th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd instant, you may arrange for the varnishing and painting required at the Caughnawaga United Church Indian Day School.

Mr. Dean, however, is refusing to consider the payment of the account and states that the Church will not make any disbursements for electricity, as long as the Church building is used as a classroom. Mr. Dean claims that the light is almost entirely used during the school hours, as the building is not well lighted, and that they only use the light for about one hour a week for religious meetings.\n\nOwing to the attitude of Mr. Dean on the question I would kindly ask you to let me know your final decision in the matter in order that the Shawinigan be advised accordingly.

I brought the matter up at our Board, and authority was given to the Executive to deal with the matter when we had before us the formal application from your Department, together with the plan of the proposed extension.

C. Indian Day School.\n\nArrangements have been made to have two of our officials visit the reserve next week and, as soon as they report, I will be in a position to decide what additional amount of land will be required and I will then communicate with you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. George Dorey, D. D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, May 14, 1937.\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nAccompanied by the Departmental Architect, Mr. Phelan visited the Caughnawaga Reserve on the 11th instant, in connection with the proposed erection of an addition to the Caughnawaga United Church School.\n\nMr. Dean told Mr. Phelan that the Indian trustees of the land held by the United Church are opposed to using any of the church land for a new school, as these Indian trustees state that it is their intention to erect a community hall, and they feel that if a new school building is erected on the property and additional land made available for playground purposes, there will not be sufficient land left for the erection of a community hall.\n\nMr. Phelan pointed out to Mr. Dean that we were only able to provide the sum of $3,500.00 in the current year's appropriation for the erection of a new building and there are no funds available to consider purchase of a site for the purpose. Unless a site is made available on the church property, it will not be possible to proceed this year. I feel you will agree with me that it would be unfortunate if building operations this year were prevented by a dispute regarding the site.\n\nI am therefore submitting the whole matter to you as we would appreciate having a definite statement on file, indicating that the Missionary Society of the United Church of Canada formally grants permission to the Department to erect a new building on the land now used for school purposes and that an additional part of your property will be made available.\n\nRev. George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nmade available for school grounds, if required.\n\nAfter considerable discussion, Mr. Dean expressed the opinion that, if the new building was joined to the present school building, there might be no objection on the part of the Indian trustees. This suggestion was carefully considered by our Architect, but, in view of the amount of money available, it is not considered feasible to do so. Our Architect suggests a new building, at right angles to the present school building and parallel with the fence separating the school lot from the church. He considers that a classroom with dining room and kitchen and two bedrooms upstairs could be erected for the amount of money that is available. Preparation of plans and further consideration of this work, of course, will be delayed until your reply is received.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI have your letter of May 14th and I have written to Mr. Dean, our Missionary on the Reserve, saying that, while I am of the opinion that technically the land belongs to the Board of Home Missions and that we can do what we like with it, we shall not overrule the decision arrived at by the officials of the congregation. I have also definitely told him that it is my considered judgment that if they refuse to give permission for the use of this land it means that there will be no School built this year and that the only people who will suffer are the children themselves. I am of the opinion that it might be the best way to let them see what their obstinacy will lead to, although, with a much wider knowledge of Indians than I possess, you might say that they will just be glad that the children cannot go to School.\n\nI have urged Mr. Dean to do what he can to get the matter settled shortly. I expect to be in Montreal the first week in June and will personally look over the matter, if it has not been settled previously.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD:EWS\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Mills.\n\nRE: INSPECTION OF DAY SCHOOLS AT RESTIGOUCHE AND CAUGHNAWAGA, QUEBEC.\n\nThe United Church Day School at Caughnawaga, Que., at present is comprised of a one room school building.

I have had an interview this morning with the Architect, but I hesitate to proceed with the construction until I have had an opportunity of discussing the matter more fully with a representative of the Church.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.

Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, July 9th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs you have previously been informed, the sum of $3,500.00 is available in the current year's appropriation for the erection of a second classroom at the Caughnawaga U. C. Indian Day School. Information reaching the Department indicates that the Indians are opposed to the erection of a new school unless this building is so constructed that the building could be used as a hall for community gatherings.\n\nOur Architect has carefully inspected the present building and it is found that, if an addition were added to the building in such a manner as to make it suitable for community gatherings, the cost would be considerably more than the amount provided in the current year's appropriation. This sum, namely $3,500.00, cannot be exceeded and, in view of the attitude of the Indians, I regret that no further action can be taken this year.\n\nUnder these circumstances, I would appreciate your advising if it is possible to rent a house at a reasonable cost to serve as the second classroom of the Caughnawaga U. C. Indian Day School for the academic year 1937-38.\n\nIt should be understood that the sum available this year would be sufficient to erect a new classroom, but this would have to be a separate building and located on the same lot as the present building.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Indian Day School and advising me that due to the informations received at the Department to the effect that the Indians are opposed to the erection of a new school, unless it is constructed to be used as a community hall, the Department will not erect the building this year as the present funds are not sufficient.\n\nIn reply, I wish to say that this office is not aware of any opposition from the Indians towards the construction of an addition to the present building and that, if the opposition comes from the Indians only, the work should be started as soon as possible, as a new classroom is very much needed for that school. If, however, a few Indians are really opposed to the addition, their opposition would, I am positive, only last a few days, as has often happened in the past. Too much attention should not be paid to Indians as this construction would be for the benefit of their own children.\n\nRelative to the renting of a house to serve as the second classroom of the Caughnawaga U.C.

Information, however, reaching the Department from other sources, is rather definite regarding such opposition.\n\nIn order to have the matter settled definitely and avoid any likelihood of trouble if building operations were commenced, I have arranged for Mr. Phelan and Mr. Dudley to go to Caughnawaga either on Tuesday or Wednesday, next, in order to meet the adherents of the United Church and discuss the matter fully with them.\n\nPlease arrange this meeting and advise me which day would be more suitable and if the meeting can be held in the afternoon. The gentlemen mentioned can reach the reserve in the early afternoon.\n\nAs mentioned above, only the Indians who are adherents of the United Church should attend such a meeting.\n\nIn the meantime, you should continue your efforts with regard to locating a house which might be rented, in the event of the Indians objecting to the construction of a second classroom.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

However, as several of the Indians members of the board of management of the local United Church, are working, it would be more satisfactory to have the meeting held in the evening instead of in the afternoon. This would also be preferred by Rev. Mr. Dean.\n\nIt is understood that only the Indians adherents of the United Church will be admitted to the meeting.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa, July 17th, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Brisebois,-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, Mr. Dudley and myself will go to Montreal via Canadian Pacific Railway on Tuesday afternoon next. We will reach Windsor Street Station at 6.40 p.m., daylight saving time. I would appreciate very much if you would meet us and take us to the reserve. You can arrange for the meeting to be held at either 7 or 7.30 p.m., whichever you consider most suitable.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF.

Dudley, I visited the Caughnawaga Reserve last night and met the Board of Management of the United Church of Canada with reference to the proposed new classroom.\n\nThere were present at the meeting Reverend Mr. Dean, Mr. Skye, Mr. Patton, Mr. Delisle, Mr. Lazore, Mr. Moses Diabo, Sr., Mr. Montour and Miss Skye. Mr. Dean acted as Chairman and Miss Skye as Interpreter. Indian Agent Brisebois also attended.\n\nI first explained to the meeting that we had $3,500 available for the erection of a new classroom but that our Architect felt that this amount was only sufficient for the erection of a building separate from the present school and that it would not be possible, with the amount at our disposal, to erect the second classroom in such a manner that it would provide a community center. Mr. Dudley also explained to those present the reasons why it was only possible to erect a separate classroom.\n\nReverend Mr. Dean expressed the view that the Department was endeavoring to side-step its responsibility for a minority group inasmuch as he did not make any attempt to purchase a site and erect a school. I pointed out to him that the amount at our disposal only allowed the erection of a building and that we have no funds for the purchase of a site. He further expressed the opinion that the Indians felt that the Department should not expect them to provide a location for the school on the church property. I replied to this by stating that we were endeavoring to provide proper educational facilities for their children and we felt, therefore, that they should cooperate to the extent of allowing us to build on the church property which is not being used for any other purpose.\n\nMiss Skye, speaking for the Indians, expressed the opinion that it would be preferable not to erect another building on the church property as the Indians hoped to erect a community hall on this property in the near future.\n\nAfter considerable discussion it was quite apparent that the Indians were opposed to the erection of a new single classroom on the church property and, furthermore, Mr. Dean stated that they had recently decided to request the Department to again rent the church as a second classroom for the academic year 1937-38.\n\nIn view of the above, I can see no advantage in giving any further consideration to the erection of a second classroom for the Caughnawaga U. C. School this year and I would recommend that the matter be dropped for the present.\nJuly 21st, 1937.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. R. A.

Wardle,\nDirector, Surveys & Engineering Branch.\n\nOttawa, July 26th, 1937.\n\nIn my memorandum of April 1st, 1937, I directed your attention to the provision made in the Special Supplementarys for the fiscal year 1937-38 for the expenditure of $3,500 in the erection of a day school at Caughnawaga, P.Q.\n\nAt the time provision was made for this building, the Department was under the impression that a site could be secured on the property of the United Church. However, the Indians concerned objected to the Department erecting a building on this site. The matter was carefully discussed with them last week when Mr. Dudley and Mr. Phelan visited the reserve.\n\nIn view of the objection of the Indians and the impossibility of purchasing a proper site in Caughnawaga village, it has been decided not to proceed with the erection of this building this year. It will, therefore, be unnecessary for you to make any further arrangements in connection with this.\n\nDirector.\nJuly 26, 1937.\n\nMemorandum: Mr. Mills.\n\nRe: Proposed Day School at Caughnawaga, Que.\n\nAs requested I accompanied Mr. Phalen of the Welfare and Training Service, Indian Affairs Branch, to Caughnawaga in connection with the above school. The proposition submitted for the existing school is to connect an additional room to the present schoolroom, using a folding partition, so that the two rooms could be used as one large room.\n\nThis building is situated on the North-east corner of the lot, excluding any possibility of additions to the North and East sides of the building. The space on the West side of the school, which would be the logical point of extension, in view of the construction of the school, is but 20 feet. This length combined with the width of the building would not be sufficient to provide a classroom for 40 to 50 children. An addition to the South wall would necessitate placing the classrooms side by side in order to secure light. This would require a width of at least 44 feet, and as the main portion of the building is only 30 feet wide, it would require complete rebuilding of the south side of the building. The expense of this work would be excessive of the funds provided.\n\nObjections were raised to the crowding of the existing Church located on the West side of the school, and the question of the addition was left in abeyance pending a decision on a site, and the advisability of attempting to alter the existing building.\n\nI understand from Mr. Phalen of the Welfare and Training Service, Indian Affairs, that the Indian Affairs Branch will advise the Survey and Engineering Branch that this work is to be cancelled.\n\nAssistant Architect.\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWe have a letter from Rev. C. C. Dean, our Missionary on the Caughnawaga Reserve in which he refers to the renting of our Church again for School purposes. The following is an extract from the letter:\n\n\"About a week ago the Agent informed me that he had a letter from Ottawa stating that it would be impossible to build a new building this year. The Official Board met, and reconsidered the question of renting the church. It was felt that in order to secure another building the Department would be obliged to give a lease of at least 5 years to make a building suitable for school purposes, and we would have to wait that long for a school. Our Board is very anxious to secure pews for the church, and if the $400 for the two years' rental is available at the end of next year for this purpose they would be willing to rent the church on the same conditions as last year - that is, the Department paying for lights, coal and janitor service.\n\n\"We have already 4 tons of hard coal which cost us $50.40 in the basement, which we would like the Department to buy as there is no room to store it for another winter.\n\n\"The Board felt that $12.50 per month was small pay for a caretaker who had to look after two furnaces, move all the seats twice every week, sweep and dust and shovel snow for two buildings. They hoped that would not be asking too much if you would approach the Department to see if even a little more could be secured for this.\n\n\"Mr. Phelan met the Board tonight and explained that the Department were still prepared to build a separate building on the same lot if the church would grant them more land, but the type of building requested for would cost too much. This was not...\"\nsatisfactory to the Board so the matter stands as it was before.\"\n\nPerhaps the Local Board has written directly about this matter, but if not we will be glad to know what you think about the rent of the Church and the increase for the services of the caretaker, as well as your reaction to the proposal about the coal they have on hand.\n\nBelieve me\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nRBC:BJ\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

C. Indian Day School.\n\nTwo of the departmental officials visited the Caughnawaga Reserve on July 20th and met Reverend Mr. Dean and a number of the Indians interested in this school. Objection was taken to the Department erecting another building on the school site and, although the matter was fully discussed, it was impossible to obtain their approval. Under these circumstances, it has been decided not to proceed with the erection of an addition to the Caughnawaga U. C. School this year.\n\nIt is noted that the Church Board is willing to allow the use of the church for the second classroom for the academic year 1937-38. This arrangement is approved and the Department will allow the same rent as last year, namely, $200.00.\n\nAs the church will only be used part of the time for school purposes, it will, no doubt, be necessary for the Church Board to have a certain amount\n\nRev. R. B. Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\ncoal on hand which they can use when religious services are being conducted in the building. Under these circumstances, I do not see the necessity for purchasing the four tons of coal which Mr. Dean states is in the basement.\n\nFor your information, I may say that the Department supplied a very large quantity of coke last winter in order to heat this building for school purposes. We will supply what is necessary for this purpose during the coming winter.\n\nThe caretaker is paid $150.00 a year for his services in looking after the two classrooms. This amount is paid on a basis of ten teaching months in the academic year and means that he is allowed $15.00 a month for each month that he is actually employed. He does no work for the schools during the months of July and August. This rate compares favourably with the amount allowed for other Indian day schools and, therefore, the Department is unable to make an increase in this connection.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nCaughnawage, August 4th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to refer to previous correspondence in connection with the renting of a house for use as a class-room for the Caughnawage Indian United Church Day School, and to say that one has finally been found, which would be suitable for the purpose.\n\nThis house is located in the center of the Village on Holding No. 354. It is a two storey frame building in good condition. There is a garden in the back which could be used as a playground. There are two rooms in the house which are not separated by a partition and the size of these two rooms combined would provide one of 35' X 12', which is considered large enough for the number of pupils attending the junior class of that school. This house belongs, and is presently occupied by Mrs. Louise Edwards, and the rental asked for is of $150.00 for the period comprised between September 1st, next, and July 1st, 1938. In addition to the rental, Mrs. Edwards is requesting that the chimney be repaired. The cost of the work is estimated at approximately $20.00.\n\nI would recommend the renting of that house as no other building more suitable for the purpose can be found here.

Payment of this amount will be made from time to time on receipt of properly certified vouchers from you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nF.

Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nOctober 19th,\n1937.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Caughnawaga\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mr. Dean, the missionary at Caughnawaga, in which he says that no fuel has as yet been supplied for the two rooms of our School. This would seem to indicate that not only has no fuel been supplied for the church, but that none has been supplied for the school building. He says that the children are missing school because it is too cold. He also states that the teachers have sent word to the Agent several times, but no one can see him, as he is ill. Would you kindly have this matter attended to.\n\nWhen I saw you in Ottawa I mentioned that a number of the small panes of glass in the windows of the church had been broken by the children playing ball. The Department was good enough to instruct the Agent to have strong wire placed in front of the windows, so that this would not occur again; but I understood from you that the broken panes of glass would be replaced. Mr. Dean says that this has not yet been done.\n\nI trust that it will be possible to have implemented the promise which you gave me that this would be attended to.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6074, file 304-5, part 3)\nOttawa, October 21, 1937.\n\nRe: Caughnawaga Fuel Supply\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th instant and to state by way of comment that the Indian Agent at Caughnawaga was authorized by letter sent forward to him from the Department on the 11th instant to purchase the coal necessary for the church and schools on the reserve. It is just possible that the Agent may have been prevented through illness from making the purchases immediately. I am communicating with him today in respect to the matter.\n\nThe Agent was also authorized early in June to purchase the glass necessary to replace certain panes broken in the church by the children in attendance at the day school. I am asking him again to make this purchase. I can only express regret that there has been delay in the purchase of this glass. I was informed, when I visited the reserve early in the summer, that the cost was almost negligible. It would appear that there is a good opportunity here for a little more cooperation between the agent and the missionary in charge.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, October 21, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Reverend Geo. Dorey, D.D., Associate Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church, in which he states that no fuel has yet been supplied for their two classrooms at Caughnawaga.\n\nI note from the records here that you were authorized to purchase this fuel on the 11th instant. It is my hope that the fuel has already been purchased and delivered.\n\nYou may remember that when I visited the reserve early in the summer I authorized you to purchase the panes of glass necessary to restore the church windows. Dr. Dorey informs me that this glass has not yet been purchased. Would you please purchase this glass and have the windows repaired immediately, sending forward the account, in triplicate, to the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nF. Brisebois, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nCaughnawaga, October 23, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st, instant, with regard to a letter received at the Department from Rev. George Dorey, D.D., of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church, dealing with the fuel requirements for the Caughnawaga U.C. classrooms and also to the replacing of panes of glass for the windows of the church.\n\nIn connection with the fuel requirement I wish to say that on receipt of your authorization, on the 14th instant, purchase was made and the coal delivered at once. These two classrooms were the first ones to be supplied with fuel. Regarding the replacement of the panes of glass, to restore the church window, I beg to say that these panes which are colored and set in lead cannot be replaced locally. It had been understood between Rev. Mr. Dean and myself that these windows would be taken off by the church janitor when I was to be advised, so that the windows be taken to Montreal for panes replacement.\n\nThis was not done, but I am taking immediate steps so that the necessary repairs be made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\n| TAUx NO | DEMANDE | LECTURE ACTUELLE | LECTURE PRECEDENTE | CONSOmATION | SERVICE | MONTANT AMOUNT |\n|--------|---------|------------------|--------------------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| 192    |         |                  |                    |             | EL      | 2.49           |\n\nUn R\u00e9frig\u00e9rateur Electrique est un PLACEMENT AVANTAGEUX parce qu'il conserve les denr\u00e9es FRAICHES.\n\nMODERNE - COMMODE ECONOMIQUE\n\nAn Electric Refrigerator is an INVESTMENT because it saves food every day by keeping it FRESH.\n\nMODERN - CONVENIENT ECONOMICAL\n\nLES TAUX SONT REPRODUITS AU VERSO.

C. C. Dean, our missionary at Caughnawaga, as follows:\n\n\"Have been informed architect coming to begin work this week. Stop. Can you inform us if agreement has been accepted and lease signed as requested by Board's resolution. Stop. Can you come to make agreement or shall I ask Presbytery Home Mission Convener. Stop. Please advise.\"\n\nI have written him to say that the Presbytery Home Mission Convener is authorized to act on our behalf. In that connection, may I refer you to my letter of April 18th. We do not seem to have had any written acceptance of the conditions laid down nor any modifications. You will remember that I discussed the matter with Mr. Phelan and yourself and understood that you accepted the proposal to lease the land and that you would provide the playground fence. My recollection is that you said you would give serious consideration to the water and indoor toilets request and that naturally the blackboards would be of the very best type, whether slate or not.\n\nWill you kindly clear this matter with whatever section of your Department is involved so that there will be no hitch in the erection of this building?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD:EWS\n\nJuly 11th, 1938\nJuly 14, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, in which you refer to your communication of April 16th, regarding the motion passed by the Trustee Board of the Montreal Presbytery, United Church of Canada.\n\nOn reviewing this motion, it is felt the request for us to lease the land for a period of fifteen years is rather unusual. The Board of Home Missions of the United Church has been associated with the Department for several years in the conduct of various schools and always dealt very fairly with us. In the present instance we feel that any additional land that may be necessary in view of the erection of the new addition to the school should be transferred to us without cost for use for school purposes as long as required. Otherwise the Department could hardly be expected to erect a building on land to which we would only have title for a limited term.\n\nGood blackboards will be placed in this school and a fence will be built. If funds will permit, indoor toilets will also be provided. You have already had an opportunity of reviewing the plans, which provide for a building that should not only be a credit to the Department and the Board of Home Missions but also be very comfortable for the Indian pupils and, in addition, will permit the Indian adherents of the United Church of Canada at Caughnawaga to have a suitable building for community gatherings.\n\nWe are practically ready to commence construction\n\nand if -\n\nReverend George Dorey,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto, Ont.\nand if Mr. Dean and those associated with him at Caughnawaga are not satisfied with what we propose to do, there is no alternative but to cancel the instructions already given for the remodelling of the present building. I trust, however, that the apparent interference at Caughnawaga will be withdrawn at once in order to permit us to proceed, and I should appreciate receiving your assurance to that effect.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

They have not raised the point about the amount which is to be paid, but I have taken it for granted that it will be the nominal rate of $1.00 a year.\n\nYou will note the suggestions that have been made in my letters from time to time that if at all possible water will be installed in the school.

I am glad to notice that you think the United Church has always dealt fairly with the Department and we hope that this will continue. Personally, I would be prepared to recommend a ninety-nine year lease to the Department, if that would be satisfactory, but we have to consider the fact that this property seems to be under the control of a local trustee board. I am writing at once to them, sending a copy of your letter. I hope that this matter will be adjusted very soon.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD:EWS\nOttawa, July 21, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the Caughnawaga United Church Indian Day School, the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada wishes, for record purposes, to have us sign a lease of the land. I would appreciate it if you would consult Mr. Dean and draw up a lease, in duplicate, have it signed by the authorized officials of the United Church and returned for our signature.\n\nThis should show, by metes and bounds, the area of land which is being leased to us. It should also contain a clause stating that the land is leased to us for a period of fifteen (15) years from September 1, 1938, at a rental of One Dollar ($1.00) a year, and, at the end of that time, if still used for the purposes of the Protestant School, the lease will be renewed for a further term of 15 years on the same terms.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nF.

I understand that these can be placed in the basement of the present building, and I am also informed that water can be secured from an artesian well located at a short distance from the school.\n\nI would appreciate it very much if you would issue immediate instructions to the officer in charge of the reconstruction of this school to carefully consider the request that we have received, and if the work can be done at a reasonable cost, please give him the necessary authority to proceed.\n\nActing Director.\nDear Sir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st instant dealing with the wish of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada to have the Department sign a lease of the land where the Senior class of the local U.C.

Dean of this Mission left the reserve on the 20th instant for his annual vacation and I am informed that he will only return at the end of next month.\n\nAs soon as Mr. Dean returns he will be consulted and the proposed lease will be drawn up, as requested.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nP.

Indian Day School will not be completed for the re-opening of the schools at the beginning of September. It is expected that this addition will be completed for the first of October.\n\nHowever, I would like to know if the Department intends to rent elsewhere for the two classes for September, or if it is the intention to delay the re-opening of the U.C. School for one month. I have to point out that it will be difficult to rent only one house for both classes as we do not have around here houses large enough and suitable for two classes, and it is believed that it would be necessary to rent two separate buildings.\n\nKindly let me know what your intentions are.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nCaughnawaga, August 25th, 1938\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 19th instant dealing with the difficulty of a local where the two classes of the Caughnawaga United Church Indian Day School could be taught.\n\nIn this connection I beg to advise that Reverend Sister Mary Cleophas called today at this office and offered the use of one or two classes for the pupils of the United Church School, where Misses Bryan and Mann could teach until the new addition is completed. The Sister states that owing to the fact that this would only be temporary, she and the other teachers could manage to accommodate us without being disturbed too much. She claims to have discussed the matter with Mr. Phelan while at Ottawa, yesterday the 24th.\n\nI would strongly recommend the acceptance of this offer which, under the circumstances, is the best that can be made.\n\nKindly reply at your earliest convenience in order that the two teachers of the United Church School be informed accordingly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 19th and 25th instant in connection with securing class rooms for the Caughnawaga United Church School until the new building is ready for occupation.\n\nWhen Sister Cleophas visited the Department on Wednesday she discussed the matter and if it is possible for her to provide two class rooms in one or other of the Catholic Schools the Department will appreciate it very much. If the Reverend Sister can only provide one class room it might be possible to again secure the Church. In any case, it is understood that the arrangement will only be a temporary one for a month or so as the new building should be completed by the end of October at the latest.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nF. Brisebois, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nDirector of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSeptember 1st,\n1938.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWe are in receipt of a letter from Rev. C. C. Dean, of Caughnawaga, in which he says that the new school is not ready and that it is proposed, in the meantime, to use a room in the separate school for half a day at a time. This may not be correct, but, in any case, it would be a very unsatisfactory way of dealing with the educational requirements of these children.\n\nIn his letter, Mr. Dean states that the Board would be perfectly willing to allow the school to be held in the church until the new building is ready. In any event, the school desks, cupboards and supplies are all in the church auditorium, which can be used quite satisfactorily until the building is completed. I presume that they would expect the same remuneration, namely, $10.00 a month for the period of occupation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6074, file 304-5, part 4)\nOttawa, September 3, 1938.\n\nRe: Caughnawaga.\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the first instant, in which you refer to school accommodation at the Caughnawaga reserve.\n\nI may state that the Principal of the R. C. School at Caughnawaga visited the Department a few days ago. In the course of conversation with the officials, she intimated that she would be glad to re-arrange her classes to place a couple of rooms at the disposal of the children who have been attending the United Church school, until the school building is completed. In submitting this offer she informed us that the relationships between the United Church teachers and the teachers under her supervision were the most cordial and satisfactory that they had been at any time in recent years. The officials accepted the offer and thanked her very heartily for her willingness to cooperate with us in providing accommodation for the pupils. The Agent was then instructed that accommodation would be provided for the pupils at one of the larger schools on the reserve.\n\nI learn from your letter that \"the Board would be willing to allow the school to be held in the church until the new building is ready\". It is difficult for me to see how both classes could be conducted in the church -\n\nReverend George Dorey,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto Ont.\nchurch building. If, however, you are opposed to the arrangements we have made, I shall be glad to review the matter and suggest to the Agent that one class be accommodated in the church and that the other class be allowed to remain out of school until the new building is ready. I am not prepared, however, to make this change on the recommendation of the local missionary. I cannot for the life of me see how the pupils can be inconvenienced in any way by attending fully equipped and up to date classrooms at the Catholic school. You might let me hear from you again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nCaughnawaga, September 1st, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo dealing with the securing of classrooms for the United Church Day School pupils until the new building is completed.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that the Reverend Sister Cleophas could let us have the use of one large classroom in the Kateri School. This classroom can accommodate forty-eight pupils and has its separate entrance on the east side of the building.\n\nIn view of the fact that only one classroom could be obtained, Rev. Mr. Dean was approached and the use of the Church building obtained for the junior class at $20. a month, which is at the rate of $200. a year paid for the last two years, for a period of ten months.\n\nHowever Mr. Dean is strongly opposed and he states that the local Board of the U.C. Church is also very much against any of their pupils being taught in school buildings used by the R.C. pupils, although the U.C. teachers would have been in charge. He claims that the children would likely quarrel or fight on their way to and from school, etc., and that inconveniences would result.\n\nMr. Dean offered, as an alternative, one room of his private residence, which he states, is large enough for the senior class of the U.C. school. He would rent it to the Department for $20. a month.\n\nOwing to the attitude taken by Mr. Dean and the Board of the Church, I would ask you to let me know,\n\nR.A.

Consequently it was inadvertently presumed that the information desired referred to the United Church Day School.\n\nDirector.\nCaughnawaga, September 9th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to my letter of the 1st instant dealing with the temporary arrangements made for the two classes of the United Church Indian Day School and to your telegram dated September 3rd, in which approval was given to the use of the U.C. Church building for one class and the use of one room in the Kateri School for the other. In this connection I beg to make the following report.\n\nOn receipt of your telegram I communicated with Miss Bryan, teacher of the Senior class and instructed her of your decision. She was quite pleased with the arrangements. Rev. Mr. Dean was also informed. He expressed the opinion that the parents might not be willing to send their children at that school.\n\nThe school opened on the 6th and on that day only four pupils out of 22 went to the senior class, on the 7th, only two, on the 8th and the 9th three were present.\n\nSeveral meetings of the parents whose children are attending that class were held in the course of this week at which meetings it was apparently decided not to allow their children to attend. It seems that if the parents do not send their children to school it is due to the fact that they have not been advised to do so very strongly, if at all advised in that way.\n\nAnother aspect to the situation is that there seems to be a campaign going on against Miss Bryan, who teaches in the above school and who has tried hard to persuade the parents of the children to send them to school. She is accused of disloyalty, etc., because of her willingness to teach in this building.\n\nThe contention\nThe contention is that she should have refused to teach at the Kateri School. This is unfair if we consider that the teacher is simply cooperating with us and following her instructions.\n\nWith regard to the attendance I would ask you to send me specific instructions to that effect. Should the parents be notified in accordance with the Indian Act and arrested if they fail to comply with their notifications? Or should matters be allowed to remain as they are, that is, to teach to the few pupils attending, instead of discontinuing. The first above mentioned course would have been followed under ordinary circumstances but owing to the situation nothing was done, as it would have likely brought unpleasant and unnecessary publicity.\n\nKindly let me have your views in the matter.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nR.A.

The arrangement of your Department to have one of these classes taught in our Church building is entirely satisfactory but the provision for the other class in a room at the Roman Catholic School is proving the occasion of embarrassment and serious disturbing of our work.\n\nThe difficulty is a local one and arises from advantage being taken of the arrangement, to press the claims of the Roman Catholic Church on our Protestant children. We recognize that this has its roots in what one of your assistants described today as an \"old feud\", but feel that we have to face the conditions as they exist and set ourselves, by constructive and non-provocative means, to bring the conflicting elements into relationships of good will.\n\nTo this end we are prepared to place at the disposal of the Department a large room in our Mission house where a larger class than the present one was housed on a former occasion. There would be no cost to the Department other than the necessary remuneration for the janitor for the care of the room, and our groups would be centred about our own property and the unity of our work maintained.\nAny further details regarding our position came out in the discussion today and are familiar to you. We understand better than before our visit to you, the actions you have taken so far, but we regret that our interests were not consulted before anything was done.\n\nWe trust this matter will have early and sympathetic consideration of the Department and thank you for your kindness and courtesy in receiving us today.\n\nI am,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nChairman,\nThe Montreal Presbytery.\nSept. 17, 1938\n\nMr. R.

Deere, Matthew Lazare and James Nolan, the following property,\n\nTo Wit:\n\nThat parcel of ground situated in the Village and Reserve of Caughnawaga, Province of Quebec, Dominion of Canada, bounded as follows; On the North by the public street of said Village called the Leprairie Road and leading to the Canadian Pacific Railway station, on the East by the property of Angus Skye Jr., on the South by the commons, and on the West by the property of the said United Church of Canada. The dimensions of the said parcel of ground are approximately as follows: Sixty-six (66) feet in width on the North side, Two Hundred and Forty-four (244) feet in length on the East side, Eighty-four (84) feet in width on the South side, Two Hundred and Sixty-two (262) feet in length on the West side, and containing about Nineteen thousand and Five Hundred square feet; the said Agreement being on the following conditions, namely, the said lease is for the period of fifteen (15) years from the first day of September, 1938, at a rental of one dollar ($1.00) a year, and for the purpose of a Protestant School; and at the end of that time the lease will be renewed for further terms of fifteen (15) years on the same terms and conditions.\n\nParty of the First Part.\n\nParty of the Second Part\n\nRepresenting the United Church at Caughnawaga.\nOttawa, September 20, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your consideration, copy of a letter received by me from the Reverend James D. McCrae, Chairman of the Montreal Presbytery of the United Church of Canada. This letter was written in response to a suggestion I made when a delegation representing the United Church discussed with me and certain officials of the Training Division the available school accommodation at the Caughnawaga reserve. This delegation interviewed me on Monday the 12th of September.\n\nI may state by way of explanation that provision was made in the estimates of this year for the construction of an additional classroom at the Indian Day School conducted by the Department in cooperation with the United Church on the Caughnawaga reserve. The work of reconstruction was undertaken the latter part of July by the Surveys and Engineering Branch and will, in all probability, be completed toward the end of October. In the meantime, provision had to be made for the pupils of the senior and junior classrooms. It was finally decided that one class should be conducted in the United Church and the other in a classroom offered by the Principal of the large school operated by the Department in cooperation with the Catholic Church.\n\nThe members of the delegation representing the Montreal Presbytery protested rather vigorously against this arrangement. It was their contention that\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6074, file 304-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nthe senior classroom, now conducted in the Catholic school, should be conducted in the home of the Missionary. A room in this home had been offered to us at a rental fee of $20.00 a month. I informed them that I was not prepared to abandon the present arrangement and adopt their suggestion. I did promise, however, that if they presented their request to me in writing, the matter would be sent forward to the Minister for consideration and final decision.\n\nIt should be pointed out that the present arrangement is a temporary one and that the building in the classroom of which the senior pupils are now receiving instruction is the property of the Government. The agent informs me that the present arrangement is quite satisfactory to the teachers and particularly the teacher of the senior classroom, who naturally prefers a regular classroom to a room in the home of the Missionary.\n\nAs a department, we are not primarily interested in missionary effort on Indian reserves, and I cannot remember that we have ever at any time sought to dictate to the churches how their missionary work on our reserves should be conducted. The matter now under consideration is purely one of educational administration and is one which, in my judgment, lies wholly beyond the jurisdiction of the United Church and its officials. If we concede the right of a particular church to dictate or even give direction with respect to the use of school buildings, the task of administering our schools will become an exceedingly difficult and exacting one.\n\nI may state that immediately following my discussion with the members of the delegation the officials communicated with the Surveys and Engineering Branch and obtained from them an assurance that the work on the school building would be pushed forward with the object of having the building completed at the earliest possible date.\n\nI shall await your instructions and the decision of the Minister with respect to this matter.\n\nDirector.\n\nRAH\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, as it is always the case, when enlarging an existing building, more work had to be made than at first expected.\n\nBeams had to be replaced to support the building and the entire roof re-shingled etc. The engineer in charge of the work is confident to have the work completed this month.\n\nFr.

He further recommends that this roof be stripped and reshingled.\n\nYou will recall that we were informed by the Director of Indian Affairs in a memorandum of May 3rd last that the Indian Agent advised him it would not be necessary to reshingle the roof of the existing school, but only to reshingle the portion connecting with the new addition, as the roof of the present school was in first class condition.\n\nIn view of this latter information, no allowance was made for the reshingling of the existing building in the estimated cost of the work.\n\nIt is evident that the old roof should be reshingled, and I would be pleased to be advised whether this work may be undertaken.\n\nThe estimated cost of this item is about $150.00 and as the proposed expenditures on this building amount to only $4,800.00 it may be possible to carry out this extra work within the amount of $5,000.00 provided for this project, No. 1, under Vote 76-64.\n\nWith reference to the installation of inside toilets as requested by the Indian Affairs Branch in their memorandum of July 26th, I am advised that the cost of installing inside toilets, complete with sewage disposal and water supply systems, is estimated at $1,600.00.\n\nAs additional funds will have to be provided for this work I would be pleased to be advised whether the inside toilets should be installed, and, if so, whether the sum of $1,600.00 is to be provided from the unallotted funds remaining under Vote 168 of the Indian Affairs 1938-39 Estimates due to the cancellation of the Metagami School.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.

It will be noted that our Engineer considers that the roof on the old section of the school is in such a condition that it should be re-shingled. This is contrary to the report of your agent as contained in your memorandum of the 3rd May last but in view of Mr. Chene's report our Engineers consider the work should be done. It is noted the expenditure connected therewith is $150 and that it may be possible to include this with the other expenditures of $4,800 in the total amount provided namely $5,000.\n\nIt will also be noted that the installation of inside toilets and other work connected therewith will cost approximately $1,600. This additional work was requested in your memorandum of the 26th July last. Will you kindly advise where this amount should be taken from.\n\nDirector.\nIn accordance with an agreement entered into between the United Church of Canada, party of the first part, and the Department of Indian Affairs, party of the second part, said agreement bearing date of September the first, nineteen hundred and thirty eight, the party of the first part hereby leases to the party of the second part, the said lease being confirmed by the congregation of the United Church of Canada at Caughnawaga, Province of Quebec, represented by Mitchel L.

Hooey,\nDirector of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hooey,- Re Caughnawaga\n\nI understand that the Agent made some agreement with the local trustees to rent the church for four months or for such period as would be necessary, at the same rate as in the past. A letter from Rev. C.C. Dean, leads me to infer that this is some sort of a local arrangement, and I have written to say that it would be very much better if the rent were paid here in the same way as has been done in the past. I presume that this would also be acceptable to your Department, and that we can expect the cheque whenever the arrangement comes to an end, that is when the new building is completed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD/EB\nOttawa, October 19, 1938.\n\nDear Mr. McCrae:\n\nMay I refer to your letter to me, dated September 13, 1938, in which you submitted for departmental consideration the desirability of having a number of Indian day school pupils removed from the Kateri School to a room in the home of the United Church Missionary on the Caughnawaga reserve?\n\nYou will probably remember that you discussed this matter with me and two of the officials of the Training Division at my office a few weeks ago. I informed you then that it was my intention to submit the matter to the Minister for consideration and for his decision.\n\nI am now in receipt of a memorandum from the Chief Executive Assistant, in which he states that the matter was discussed with the Minister and the Deputy Minister on the 20th of September. In view of the fact that construction work on the new classroom would be finished in a few days, the Minister took the position that no change in the present arrangement should be made.\n\nMr. Phelan, Chief of the Training Division, visited Caughnawaga yesterday, with the object of expediting, if at all possible, the work of construction. He informs me that the building will be completed and ready for occupancy toward the end of the month. I was somewhat disappointed to learn from him, however, that the parents had steadfastly refused to send their children to the Kateri School. Only two were in attendance at the time of Mr. Phelan's visit. This attitude on the part of the Indians renders Indian administration exceedingly difficult and exacting on a number of our reserves.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. J. D.

It was necessary to install this new well to replace the old one which had been abandoned owing to its contaminated condition and other causes. It was carried down to a depth of 65 feet in order to obtain an adequate quantity of water to supply the new plumbing system in the new addition, toilets, etc.\n\nAs I understand that no bacteriological or chemical analysis has yet been made of the water from the well in question, it is suggested that the Indian Affairs Branch be advised to have an analysis made of the water from one of the taps in the school. This could be attended to by obtaining the regular sterilized sample bottles from the Quebec Ministry of Health, 80 Notre Dame Street East, Montreal, P.Q. The samples of the water could be taken by the Indian Agent in company with the Reserve Doctor. I might say that there is no harm attached to such analyses and the two samples necessary could be taken to the Provincial Laboratory in Montreal by either the Indian Agent or the Chief Constable, who, I understand, make daily trips to Montreal on departmental business.\n\nShould the results of the analyses be found unsatisfactory, this Service could, if requested, give some directions as to the manner in which the new well could be disinfected at a very low cost.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M.

I need hardly point out that this is not only desirable but essential, if the missionary is to have any use of a garden.\n\nMay I ask if instructions have been given to proceed with the erection of this fence and provision made for the purchase of the necessary materials?

Crepin, a merchant from Chateauguay Bassin who is on the approved list. These estimates are for a fence 5 feet in height. Estimate No. 1, is for a fence as shown on page 6 of the enclosed catalogue and is comprising steel posts, steel frame, completely installed by the Company.\n\nEstimate No. 2, is for the wire only, and in connection with this estimate I wish to say that this could be put up by using wooden fence posts and wooden frame. In addition to the wire the following material would be required: 56 posts of 6\" x 6\", 8 feet long at .90 each; 1150 linear feet of scantling 2\" x 4\" at $2.50 per thousand feet. If a first class job is wanted it would be advisable to set the posts in cement and it is estimated that half a bag of cement per post would be required at an approximate price of $.65 or $.70 a bag. The sand and the crushed stone would be available without cost.\n\nThe labour for the erection of the fence by Indians is estimated at about $55.00.\n\nThe prices obtained were from J.F. Crepin of Chateauguay Basin and Leduc & Fils of Beauharnois, Que., both dealers on the approved list. It will be noted that the fence to be made is on the east, west and south part of the lot as only the front part is in good condition.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nAugust 8, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo with reference to fencing the grounds of the Caughnawaga U.C.

At the same time you should state if it would not be possible to have Indians on relief do the work without extra charge, especially those who are adherents of the United Church.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

You requested to be advised as to the cost of same and also if it could be made here by an Indian.\n\nIn reply I wish to say that Frank T. Johns a carpenter member of this Band has submitted a price of $25.00 each for the cupboards which will be of 6 by 4 by 18 inches. The materials would amount to $36.00, lumber, paint, hinges, locks etc., and he estimates that it would take him 3 days at $4.00 per day to make the two cupboards.\n\nKindly let me know if this price is acceptable.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 24, 1939.\n\nRe: Cupboards, United Church Indian School,\nCaughnawaga, Quebec.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant and to state that you are authorized to proceed with the construction of cupboards at the above noted school.

Indian Day School ground.\n\nAs the estimates already submitted were found too high, I wish to submit you other estimates at reduced cost.\n\nChain link fencing 4' high, 2\" links, would cost $24.48 a foot for a total of $131.76 galvanized before being cut. The previous estimate was for a 5 feet high chain link fence. Instead of 56 square posts 6\" x 6\", 8 feet long at $.90 each, ordinary fence posts as used on farms could be purchased at $.15 each for a total of $8.40. In order to further reduce the cost the wooden frame could be eliminated and approximately 150 feet of scantling used for bracing. No cement will be used for the posts.\n\nAs to the possibility of having Indians on relief to do the work without cost I may say that this is not considered possible as they do not even do any work for their church without being paid. If the framing, the cement are eliminated and shorter posts used it is estimated that the cost of labor will be of $30. only instead of $55.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nFile No. 5-5-5\n\nSeptember 7, 1938\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nGaughnawaga U.C.-Indian Day School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 13-493\n\nSHIP TO Mr. Brisebois, Esq., Indian Agent, Gaughnawaga, Que.\n\nPurpose for which required: New fence around school grounds\n\nNOTE:\u2014Requisition for non-consumable equipment, state if New Issue or Replacement.\n\n\"consumable equipment and supplies use columns 1 and 2.\n\n| Quantity | Quantity on hand (1) | Quantity used per month (2) | Unit Price | TOTAL |\n|----------|---------------------|-----------------------------|------------|-------|\n| 540 Lin. ft. chain link fencing 4' high, 2\" links, galvanized before being cut |\n\nNote: The Indian Agent estimates the cost of the above-mentioned fencing at $131.76.

Brisebois,\nIndian Agent,\nGaughnawage, Que.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWould you please be so kind as to forward the following suggestion and request to the proper authorities in the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Board of Stewards of the Gaughnawage United Church is interested in buying a 16mm sound projector for the presentation of motion pictures. From the church viewpoint the reasons are as follows: 1) It can be used to show religious pictures; 2) it can also be a means of providing proper entertainment for our people on the reserve.\n\nThe main reason for our interest, however, is in the education of our children. If the United Church School had the use of a projector for educational purposes, we can provide an even better education than is possible at present. As you may know, many of our children are hoping to attend high school on the Island of Montreal. If we do not have the necessary aids to education here, they are decidedly handicapped when they have to compete with other youngsters who have had better opportunities.\n\nSince the provision of educational aids is the responsibility of the Department of Indian Affairs, we feel that it is only reasonable to request that the Department of Indian Affairs should pay at least half the costs of the projector. I feel sure that when the Department gives this suggestion the consideration which it deserves they will be pleased to assist us in our work of raising the educational and living standards of our people.\n\nHaving had four years experience with all makes of 16mm projectors, there are only two which I would recommend - the Bell-Howell and the Audio-Visual Educator. These machines are by far the best in the field. Of the two, I would buy the Audio-Visual Educator for the simple reason that it is a Canadian machine made in Canada by Canadians. The Audio-Visual Educator is manufactured by the Northern Tool and Gauge Limited, Eastview (Ottawa), Ontario and is distributed by the Audio-Visual Educator Limited, 160 McArthur Road, Eastview, Ont. The price complete is $585.00. However, they have a special price of $465.00 for schools and churches.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. Stanley Kennedy,\nStudent-minister in charge.\nGaughnawaga, Que.,\nJune 4, 1947.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Dept., of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI beg to forward herewith the original of a letter received at this office on this date by Rev. J. Stanley, Minister in Charge of the local United Church Mission, which is dealing with the acquisition of a Sound Projector to be used both at the Church and at the U.C., School.\n\nI would kindly ask you to take the granting of this request into consideration. Mr. Kennedy who is newly appointed at Gaughnawaga is showing much interest in young people of this Community and has extended valuable help towards the administration of this Reserve.\n\n(Prs. Brisebois)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 6th, 1947.\n\nMr. Frs. Brisebois, Indian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\n\nI have read with care the letter written to you by J. Stanley Kennedy, Student-minister in charge of the Caughnawaga United Church. I am pleased to see the interest and co-operation which he is tendering you in the administration of the reserve.\n\nI regret to say, however, that due to the heavy expenditure we have had for this year, it will be impossible for us to help in the purchase of a projector.\n\nThe Department is buying apparatus for visual education; we have started with the larger schools and intend to cope with the others as money is available.\n\nfor Bernard F.

Lefebvre.\nThey occupy part of this house, less two rooms which are not\nquite finished.\n\nThese rooms would be needed to accommodate the third\nteacher and the owner is quite willing to have them completed\nwith electricity, beaver board, paint etc., but is requesting\nfor additional rental owing to the expense that he will have to\nincur.\n\nMr. Lefebvre would undertake to put everything in\nfirst class condition for a rental of $30.00 per month.\n\nThis would appear to be reasonable in view of the\nfact that this house is partly furnished.

In addition to the 60 pupils on the roll, we know of 14 more who will be attending the United Church School this September. As you well know, a total of 74 pupils would be practically impossible to handle in the present facilities.\n\nThe breakdown into classes next term will be:\n\nGrades 1 & 2 - 27 pupils\nGrades 3 & 4 - 23 pupils\nGrades 5, 6, & 7 - 24 pupils.\n\nWith the classes divided in the above manner, it would be possible for the teaching staff to do much better work in providing the education which is so badly needed on this reserve.\n\nTherefore, I would ask that you request Col. Neary to consider our problem carefully in the expectation that the Indian Affairs branch will see fit to rent an additional room\u2014which is available\u2014and authorize the employing of a third teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. Stanley Kennedy,\nStudent-minister,\nLaughnawega United Church.\nGaughnawaga, Que.,\nJuly 17, 1947.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Dept., of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI wish to transmit you herewith the original of a letter received at this office of this date from Mr. Kennedy, Pastor of the local U. Church dealing with a third classroom for the U.C. Indian Day School at Gaughnawaga.\n\nRelative to the renting of a building for the classroom needed I wish to inform that a suitable one, was found. This building is located on Main Street, next, to the one which we are renting for the baby class, from Mrs. J.K. Jacobs. There would be a room of 25 by 20 for the class, fairly well lighted during the daytime.\n\nAs to repairs I may say that one partition would have to be taken down, the room painted, the building of some shelves for the books and electric lights installed, (the building is already wired) and it is recommended that fluorescent lights be installed which could be removed when the building is located, for use elsewhere. This was done for the H.C. classroom at Mrs. Jacobs.\n\nEighteen additional desks for pupils would also be required, together with a teacher's desk and chair and also some blackboard.\n\nPlease advise us to the above at your earliest convenience.\n\n(Frs. Brisebois)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 18th, 1947.\n\nMr. Frs. Brisebois, Indian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, the Department approves you renting the building on Main Street which you consider would be suitable as a third classroom for the Caughnawaga U.C. School.\n\nYou may arrange for the necessary repairs to this building keeping the cost as low as possible.\n\nWith reference to the eighteen additional desks, please let me have the size required - large, medium or small.\n\nBernard F.

We took this matter up with your Department and sometime later were advised to ship the desks in Walnut finish.

Mr. Kennedy of the local United Church Mission has on this date applied to be supplied with the necessary materials for the construction of a skating rink on the grounds of the U.C. Indian Day School for use of the pupils and also of the adults of this vicinity.\n\nAs you are aware there are no rinks for the children attending the local Schools nor are there any other outdoor amusements. It is believed that this request is in the best interest of the children.\n\nThe cost of the boards, scantlings, nails etc., for the proposed rink of 150 by 60, would be approximately $170.00, exclusive of labour. It has been suggested that the boards be made in panels of 12 feet long which could be used every year thus doing away with any carpenter work.\n\nMr. Kennedy would undertake to supervise the activities of the children and others using the rink.\n\nWill you please advise if this request could be granted.\n\n(Frs.

Indian Day School is now out of order and cannot be repaired. It is a stove which has been in use since over 30 years. This stove is not the property of the Department but that of the owner of the house, Mr. Jos. Lefebvre.\n\nMiss Daly the Principal of the U.C. School informs that she has found a stove suitable for their use at J.A. Tessier, Lachine, Que., which could be delivered immediately.\n\nSaid stove is made by \"Belanger Ltd.\", model Marina, white enamel, six lids, water tank and dish warmer etc., The price complete would be of $170.00. Without hot water tank the price would be of $150.00.\n\nI would appreciate being informed if this purchase would meet with your approval so that the teachers be informed accordingly.\n\n(Frs.

Breebold,\nSup't Indian Agency,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\n\nDear Mr. Breebold,\n\nWe, the undersigned teachers of the Day School under the auspices of the United Church of Canada, wish to thank you for the kind attention you gave to supplying recently, through the Department certain repairs and equipment necessary for efficiency and our personal comfort, in the schoolrooms as well as in the dwelling house supplied to us.\n\nWe would particularly draw your attention to the satisfaction we now have in the janitor service. Mr. Whitebean, who has replaced Mr. Pendle, has by his efforts changed the whole atmosphere of our classrooms. He has scrubbed and disinfected floors, walls and ceilings throughout, which has not been done for years. Each week he scrubs one classroom in turn with disinfectant, which is necessary for the health of the pupils. Since Christmas he has painted the floors of the senior school. Mr. Whitebean's willingness to co-operate in the interest of our children is commendable.\n\nHowever, with all this satisfaction realized, we feel justified\nin appealing to the Department through your good offices for further consideration\u2014this time more especially as to our personal comfort.\n\nAs you are aware we are housed on the Reserve in quarters rented furnished from one of the Indians of the Band. The furnishings while moderately comfortable are not complete by any means.\n\nNow that there are three of us living here it is almost imperative that we have an adequate refrigeration unit in order to properly keep our food.\n\nLaundry facilities have been most inadequate. So far we have sent our heavier pieces to a laundry in Montreal which has proved unsatisfactory and expensive. We understand that this expense is being taken care of for other teacherages by the Department. In lieu of this we request the Department to give consideration to supplying us with an up-to-date washing machine.\n\nThis request then is for the following:\n\nOne electric refrigerator of a capacity of at least 7 cubic feet.\n\nOne electric washing machine\u2014standard type.\n\nWe have not made such a request previously because it has been generally known that such equipment has been in short supply.\n\nThese articles, along with others already supplied, being Departmental property, will be useful for years and transferable to a new teacherage when such a building is available.\n\nAn extra copy of this letter is supplied, if in your judgment, a copy should be submitted to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.W. Roberts\nMrs. E.C. Ross\nV.M. Daly.\nGaughnawag, Que.,\nFebruary 20, 1948.\n\nENCL.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Dept., of Mines and Resources, Ottawa,\nOnt.,\n\nI wish to transmit you herewith the original of a letter remitted at this office on this date by Miss Viola Daly, Principal of the local U.C. Indian Day School, requesting that an electric refrigerator and a washing machine be supplied for their residence.\n\nWill you please advise if the Branch will give consideration to this request so that Miss Daly be advised accordingly.\n\nF. B. (signature)\n\n(Frs. Brisebois)\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency.\nFebruary 25, 1948.\n\nMr. Frs. Brisebois, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Caughnawaga, P.Q.\n\nWe have your letter of the 20th instant enclosing letter received from the teachers in charge of the Caughnawaga U.C. School requesting certain equipment for their residence. Owing to lack of funds it is not possible for us to consider purchasing this equipment at the present time. However, you may write us again after April 1st and the teacher's request will have further consideration at that time.\n\nIn writing you should give more specific information regarding the type and size of equipment that you think is necessary and if possible I suggest that catalogue number be given.\n\nBernard F.

However, if ice can be obtained --- we are prepared to supply an ice box on the understanding that the teachers would purchase their own ice.\"\n\nOn the strength of your letter dated February 25th, 1946, the teachers for the United Church Day School were advised that in all probability their request would be granted in the fiscal year 1946-47, and information was received with much pleasure and anticipation. In this connection I wish to point out that the teachers for this school have done through the years, been very moderate in their requests, and have not always had all the comforts which their position may warrant.\n\nThe request for an Electric Refrigerator does in our judgment warrant favourable consideration for the following reasons:\n\n(a) The fact that nearly all the uptodate homes on this reserve have Electric machines, the demand for ice delivery has fallen so low that the convenient supply is not available, and no deliveries appear until June, and usually close down after September 1st.\n\n(b) There are now three lady teachers living in the U.C. Teacherage, with the prospect that a fourth will necessary for the next term.\n\nIt should not be considered unreasonable for these women to desire to have necessary uptodate conveniences such as they would have in their own homes, especially, when ice is purchased in more or less large quantities, a week's supply - either in Montreal or the convenient small towns, and these women are required to live on the Reserve, and in these modern days refrigeration is considered an all year round daily necessity.\n\n(c) Further to the fact that most homes today are equipped with Electric Refrigerators, it may be well to recognize that the other Teacherage on the Reserve, as\nwell as the residence leased for the Royal Canadian Police on the Reserve, have already Electric Refrigerator supplied by the Department, installed and which have been and are now main-\ntained by our Department.\n\nI would, under the circumstances most strongly recommend a reconsideration, and that the request for an Electric Refrigerator be granted, especially when, as previously indicated one may be purchased wholesale by the Department.\n\nFrs. Brisebois,\nIndian Agent.\nMay 4, 1948.\n\nMr. Frs. Brisebois, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Caughnawaga, P.Q.\n\nWe have your letter of the 28th ultimo\nwith reference to the refrigerator requested by the\nteachers at the Caughnawaga U.C.School.\n\nAs stated in our letter of April 21st, we\nare not prepared to supply an electric refrigerator.\nWe feel we are dealing fairly with the teachers at\nthe Caughnawaga School if we offer them an ice box\nand make them responsible for securing their own ice.\n\nAs you are aware, the salaries of teachers\nof Indian day schools have been increased to a con-\nsiderable extent during the last two years and we make\nno deductions for living quarters as is done in the\ncase of other Civil Servants either permanent or\ntemporary.\n\nBernard F.

Shortly after, early in October, I supplied 2 days in the Senior room for Miss Daly.\n\nAfter a considerable lapse of time, December 7th, to be exact, I received a cheque from the Commissioner of the Treasury for $15.00, for the three days in September; and on December 22nd, I received another cheque in amount of $10.00 for the two days in October.\n\nMy expenses for the 5 days amounted to $5.10. Presumably you can take care of this, as you so kindly did on the previous occasion, when I supplied 3 days following Miss Bishop's resignation.\n\nWill you please send me a cheque for this amount?\n\nThanking you,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n(Mrs) Eleanor M.

We have just received a letter from the Student Missionary at Gaughnawaga, Mr. J. S. Kennedy, reading as follows:\n\n\"Since the heating unit in the present United Church school will have to be changed; and since our Board of Home Missions must renew the heating unit in the church building this year; and since the heating unit in the minister's residence must be replaced within two to five years, therefore, we feel that there might be some way in which your Department and our Board of Home Missions could cooperate in installing a central heating unit for the three buildings.\n\n\"This suggestion is feasible due to the short distance between the buildings.\n\n\"As you know, it is less expensive to heat three buildings from one central unit than from three...\"\nunits. The cost of operation to your department, to the church, and to the house could be determined quite easily from the cubic content of each building.\n\n\"If this suggestion is of interest to you, we would be pleased to have a qualified and reliable heating engineer inspect the three buildings and recommend the type of heating unit which would provide the most efficiency with the least cost. By the time this would be done, Dr. Dorey should have returned to Toronto and details of installation cost could be arranged between yourself and him.\"\n\nWhen your engineer visits this school, we would appreciate his comments concerning the feasibility of Mr. Kennedy's suggestions.\n\nDirector.\n**PURCHASE ORDER**\n\n**TO**\nPyrene Mfg.

I wish on behalf of these people, to protest the actions of the present Council, by passing resolutions and By Laws without discussion and without the consent of the individual Councillor. These resolutions and By Laws are passed without translation or explanation so that there are some who don't know what is going on. These under-handed actions must stop in order to get the full co-operation of the Council and Band.\n\nOn behalf of these people I wish to protest a Resolution passed at this month's meeting, in which the New School was mentioned. This Resolution asks for a Catholic School and to be controlled by the Church, I protested this.\n\nWell, what will become of the children of other faiths? Our representative before the mixed committee requested a Public School, that will be of benefit to all our children without discrimination as to faith. Our representative at that time carried out the wishes of the Band, and we wish that nothing be changed.\n\nWe wish this institution to be a symbol of Democracy (freedom of religion) to be of benefit to all. Thanking you in advance for your co-operation.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) C. Albany.\n\nCOPY\n\nORIGINAL ON\n\nFile...63-5\n\nCopied: V.S.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Day school and Teachers Residence.\n\nAllow me to point out that although there is just a little over six weeks left until the next school term, nothing has been heard of from the Branch, so far, as to when the repairs are to be made at the Eastern School and the alterations to the building which is to be used as a teacherage for the U.C. teachers.\n\nMay I say that the authorities of the United Church are much concerned over the delay and are frequently calling at this office in these matters.\n\nWill you be kind enough to let us know if anything will be started in the near future, so that all interested parties be advised accordingly.\n\nFr. Brisebois,\nSuperintendent.\n\nJUL 19 1949\nJuly 22nd, 1949.\n\nMr. F. Brisebois,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\n\nRe: Caughnawaga U.C. Indian Day School\n\nWith reference to the telephone account for the above school, we have been caused considerable trouble because the Treasury does not seem to be able to adjust the long distance charges and satisfy themselves that we are not paying any long distance charges.\n\nYour Voucher No. 549 dated May 19th was issued in an amount of $14.64 and cheque was sent to the Bell Telephone Company. Your Voucher No. 661 is being paid in an amount of $1.75, which is the service charge. With this information you will be able to decide if your office has been given credit for the total amount that you forwarded to Treasury for payment you received for long distance telephone charges. If not, let me know this amount and I will have it refunded to you.\n\nIn order to avoid inconvenience for all parties concerned, in future the charge for telephone service at this school should only be for the service charge, namely $1.75.\n\nBernard F.

Some superficial structural repairs should be made to the porches and stairs. Painting and decorating repairs would add greatly to the all round appearance, both inside and out.\n\nThe heating system was reported to be unsatisfactory. The first floor can be kept reasonably warm but the second floor is almost impossible to heat. This condition has existed for many years according to information given to our officer.\n\nThe system is a conglomerate combination, one and two pipe low pressure steam, served by a square sectional cast iron steam boiler and it was installed when the building was erected. The distribution piping was connected in a haphazard and unorthodox manner, and the pipe hook-up at the boiler is incorrect to say the least. In addition to the foregoing, the boiler is unfit for further service, as leaks have developed and the base has failed.\n\nIn a previous memorandum from Major Mackay, it was suggested that the Superintendent of Indian Education be contacted before this inspection was carried out. As a consequence, Col. Neary, verbally requested our officer to investigate the possibility of installing plumbing and water service in the building.\n\nOur engineer found a 180 gallon water pressure tank in the basement in apparently good condition with a nearly new water pump and this equipment was functioning quite satisfactorily. The well has produced water in ample capacity to date, and there seems to be no doubt of a continued supply.\n\nFurther investigation revealed that it would be possible to install toilets and wash basins in the cloak rooms together with a kitchen sink and a separate lavatory for the teachers. The student missionary, Mr. J.S. Kennedy, agreed to the use of this space and suggested to our officer that cloak room accommodation could be found elsewhere. It remains only to carry out a soil absorption test to determine the nature of the soil in order to design a septic tank and sewage disposal field.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nCommenting on the third paragraph in Major Mackay's memorandum of March 29th, it can definitely be stated that it would not be practicable to attempt to heat the present United Church School and the Ministry Road Transit Testing plant of the Eastern School. The initial cost would be prohibitive, and it would involve extensive operations which could not be economically justified in a set up of this kind. As a result of the investigations, it is recommended that the following operations be carried out at the Eastern School with reference to the plumbing and heating.\n\nInstall new plumbing fixtures in cloak rooms where shown including 3 W.C.'s and 3 basins on boys side and 3 W.C.'s basins on girls side with a kitchen sink. These fixtures shall be piped from the existing pressure tank. Provide one domestic hot water storage tank of approximately 100 gallon capacity with immersion electric heaters.\n\nProvide concrete septic tank and sewage disposal bed.\n\nInstall new cast iron boiler, new steam and return mains with necessary traps and other accessories, new condensation pump and new return risers to the existing radiators on the second floor.\n\nWhile it is impossible to form an accurate estimate of the cost until a detailed layout has been made, it is felt that the above operations will involve an amount of approximately $6,500.00.\n\nThis Division will prepare plans and specifications covering the above work as soon as other commitments will permit at which time you will be further advised.\n\nChas. H. Buck,\nFor Chief, Engineering and Construction Division.\nMr. B.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nRe Staff - Saughnawage U.C. School.\n\nMiss Burden sounds like a fairly good prospect and I shall be pleased to give her any information she may desire.\n\nMiss Ratton visited Saughnawage on Saturday morning, July 16th. I must say that she seems somewhat better than average. However, with only the one interview I am not jumping to any rash conclusions. I do think that she will be a definite improvement.\n\nMr. Morris visited Saughnawage on Saturday afternoon, July 16th. I was quite favourably impressed and think that he should do much to improve the standard of our school.\n\nThe Building Changes.\n\nI was at the agent's office yesterday when Mr. Doucet checked the plans for the Eastern School. Frankly, I was amazed that any person in the Architects Dept., could have been so ignorant of school construction. The plans were entirely different to those which Mr. Margreaves had sketched roughly while here.\n\nThe necessary work in the Eastern School could be completed within a month so I am hoping that the mistakes will be rectified more rapidly than the original plans were prepared.\n\nAs things stand at the moment there seems to be no hope whatsoever of having the new residence ready for September. There is a slim chance but it looks bad. Would it be possible for Mr. Brisebois to make temporary housing arrangements for the new staff sometime in the near future? If we wait until the last minute we will be unable to make any suitable boarding arrangements.\n\nSorry to be such a nuisance but time is flying.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

If you refer to the Purchase Order you will note that it was issued in an approximate amount of $1,555.00. It is presumed that you found it necessary to purchase more materials than you originally mentioned on the Purchase Order. However, the Treasury will not pay the account in an amount of $2,209.31 in view of the fact that the Purchase Order was issued for a much smaller sum.\n\nThe best way of handling the matter would be for you to obtain from the firm an account on which should be shown the articles mentioned on Purchase Order No. 47714. These items of course should compare with the prices quoted on the Purchase Order and the total amount of the Voucher should not exceed $1,555.00.\n\nYou should obtain another account for the balance of the items and attach this latter to a separate voucher. When forwarding this you should explain the reason for purchasing items in excess of those mentioned on the Purchase Order.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nPP: MMcN\nPayments to:\n\nBrandam Henderson Ltd\nV# 864 - P.O. 46309 - *191.63\n\nR.E.

We wish to draw your attention to the fact that sufficient men should be employed in order to benefit by the capacity from this compressor. In other words the Department wishes to have this work done as rapidly as possible in order to reduce this expenditure as much as it is reasonable possible.\n\nWe wish you to inform the contractor, Mr. Hamel, that the Department is relying on him for the efficiency of this operation. We also wish to have you take a personal interest in this work.\n\nFollowing your interview with the contractor we would like to know when this particular work will be completed.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nAJD/MMcN\nCaughnawaga, Que., December 8, 1949.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Dept., of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nRe: Caughnawaga U.C.

Beauvais of this Reserve for the electrical work and material at the above School, as per Plan 906 and attached specifications, in the amount of $3,984.70.\n\nUpon receipt of your letter Mr. Beauvais was informed of its content and will be starting immediately in order that the other repairs be proceeded with as soon as possible.\n\nMr. Beauvais has requested us to ask you if an advance of $1,200 for the payment of wages could be sent to this office to be administered by us. He states he does not have the necessary cash to meet the payrolls, as the materials required will take considerable expenses. Please consider this request favourably. We are quite willing to handle his payrolls every week.\n\n(Frs.

Weir,\nChief, Engineering and Construction Division.\nMemorandum:\n\nCHIEF, EDUCATION DIVISION\n\nRe: Caughnawaga U.C. Indian Day School\n\nAlterations\n\nIt will be remembered that due to an error in the plans the alterations to the former Eastern R.C. School were delayed. The heating and plumbing were completed in good time but could not be operated because the electrical work was not provided for. The electrical plans were ready at the beginning of this month and the contract was awarded this week. As heating was necessary to protect the equipment, Mr. Beauvais, the local electrical contractor, was authorized to make temporary connections so that the heating plant could be operated.\n\nThere will be some extras at this school caused by the oversight of a sump pump for the furnace pit in the basement. The plans called for a pit approximately two feet deep to allow for the return. This excavation collects all overflow water and being so low cannot be drained except by means of an electrically operated pump.\n\nAnother extra is necessary for the septic tank. The plan on which the contractor bid would not operate due to the conditions of the soil. The school yard is quite level and a siphon as designated in the original plan could not operate. This was drawn to the attention of the Engineering Branch who prepared another plan which requires a small cabin to provide for the operation of the pump. These plans were delivered to me personally on the 9th of November and...\ndelivered to the contractor the following day. At this time the soil is frozen to approximately four inches. When the contractor bid on this it was to be summer work but because of this change, which is no fault of his, there will be surplus labour and also surplus equipment. The top of the soil will have to be broken by means of a compressor, rental of which I believe is $3.00 per hour. To estimate what these extras will be is very difficult, but the work should be followed very closely so that the expenditure will be kept at its minimum.\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nSupervisor of Vocational Education.\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nPlease find hereunder a report from Mr. Doucet concerning his recent visit to the Caughnawaga U.C. School.\n\nPlease note that a delay on the part of our Engineers has resulted in a much higher expenditure at this school than would have been necessary had the plans been ready by the time requested.\n\nBernard F.

(Requisition No. IA-1073).\n\nAs it was the intention to fill this position as a result of a competition, temporary arrangements were made for the operation of the heating equipment, water system and electrical system. However, on January 11, 1950, when an Official from the Indian Affairs Branch Headquarters paid an inspectional visit to the Caughnawaga school, it was discovered that one of the motors had burned out and one of the boilers had been permitted to go dry.\n\nAs it was evident that the services of a man with the necessary qualifications were required immediately, Mr. Alfred K. Rice, an Indian of the Caughnawaga Reserve, was placed on duty on January 11, 1950.\n\nAs we have Mr. Rice's application on file here, I am forwarding it to you direct and advising Mr. F. Brisebois accordingly. It will be appreciated,\n\n.............\ntherefore, if you will kindly issue the necessary Referral Form in favour of Mr. Wilfred W. Rice with effect from January 11, 1950.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSgd. W.J.F. Pratt.\n\nW. J. F. Pratt,\nGeneral Executive Assistant.\n\nG. R.

Morris, principal at the local U.C. Indian Day School, advises, in writing, this morning that he had to dismiss two of the classes at his school this morning as the temperature was only 50 and 54.\n\nWhen advised we immediately communicated with Mr. Rice, Chief Janitor, who called at that school and interviewed Mr. Morris.\n\nIt would appear that due to the fact that there is no automatic control to the boiler it is difficult to maintain an even temperature in this building. It is either too cold or too warm and in order to give satisfaction to the teachers it would require the full time of a man at that school as the Principal declines to have anything to do with the regulating of the furnace.\n\nIn order to remedy this situation Mr. Rice is suggesting that an automatic electric control be installed at that school. This could be done at an approximate price of $50.00 and would do doubt give satisfaction and at the same time save fuel.\n\nWould you be kind enough to take this suggestion into consideration. Mr. Morris' letter is herewith enclosed.\n\n(Fra. Brisebois)\nSupt., Indian Agency.\nJan. 25, 1950.\n\nDear Mr. Brisebois:\n\nI have dismissed two of the rooms at the school this morning on account of cold rooms.

Immediate purchase had to be made so that the renovation of the building would not be unnecessarily delayed, and I attach for your information a letter received from Superintendent Brisebois.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would issue Purchase Orders in order that these accounts may be paid.

School\nis nearing completion, and this building will be\nready for occupancy on September 1st.\n\nAs a result, the school building known as\n\"Caughnawaga Eastern School\" will be vacated, and\nas the present Caughnawaga U.C. School is too small,\nwe are making certain renovations to the Eastern\nSchool to provide the extra classroom accommodation\nthat is required.\n\nBy vacating the present Caughnawaga U.C.\nSchool we propose making renovations to convert this\nbuilding into a proper residence for the three\nteachers who will be in charge of the school.\nDepartmental officials have visited the Caughnawaga\nReserve, and have prepared sketches of what is\nrequired, and we are anxious to have these renovations\ncompleted by September 1st if possible.\n\nThe Departmental Purchasing Agent is being\nrequested to secure the materials. The firm of Jean\nBedard, Limited, 480 Lafleur Street, Ville Lasalle,\nP.Q., are prepared to supervise all the wood work,\nengage the men required, and supply the services\nof an engineer for an amount not exceeding $10.00 a\nday. The total number of days this firm would be\nemployed would not exceed 40.\nWe understand that this is a very reliable firm and they can start work immediately. Enquiries were made in the vicinity of the Reserve by one of the officials from Head Office and by Superintendent Brisebois, but they were unable to locate anyone else who was prepared to start work immediately.\n\nUnder the circumstances, it would be appreciated if you would approve the employment of Jean Bedard, Limited.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP/ST\n\nAPPROVED\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\n[Handwritten note]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is understood Mr. Faubert has been previously employed by this department.\n\nOttawa, Ontario,\nAugust 8th, 1949.\n\nJ. G. Levy,\nPrivate Secretary.\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nCaughnawaga United Church Indian Day School,\nProvince of Quebec, Electoral District of\nBeauharnois-Laprairie.\n\nOn August 4 we submitted a memorandum concerning the\nstructural changes required at this school. We received in reply\na memorandum from Mr. Levy, recommending that we approach Mr. Alphonse\nFaubert of Chateauguay. One of our officials has interviewed Mr.\nFaubert and I attach his report.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Faubert would charge $1.50 per\nhour whereas Mr. Bedard would charge $10.00 per day for supervision.\nAs Mr. Faubert has no engineer, our official has recommended the\nacceptance of Mr. Bedard's tender.\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

School. Mr. Faubert seems to be very active and very anxious to do a good job.\n\nThe prices for his labourers is the current charges. He himself as supervisor would charge $1.50 per hour. I have no doubt that Mr. Faubert would give us his best services. However he has no engineer on his staff which might prove a drawback.\n\nMr. Bedard who has submitted his price, estimates his supervision at approximately $10.00 a day. That is he charges 10% of his labourers daily salary.\n\nBesides Mr. Bedard has a qualified engineer on his staff who would be available when necessary.\n\nMy personal feelings is that we would get a better service and greater satisfaction with Mr. Bedard.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAtt.

Mr. Forbes, missionary, promised me to attend to the matter at once. I shall send you the applications as soon as I receive them.\n\nI have, etc.,\nCaughnawaga Agency,\nBy T.R., daughter of the late A. Brossard.\nOTTAWA, 19TH August, 1903\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWhen Mr Delisle, teacher of the Caughnawaga Boys School, was in Ottawa last month, I had a long talk with him on school matters on that reserve, and he suggested that the best way to secure a better attendance would be to get the pupils interested by attracting them to the schools, and he said that this could be done by providing scholarships and giving a preference to children who attend regularly when drafting recruits for the Wikwemikong Industrial school. He considers that the scholarships should be sufficient to provide a college education for a certain number of the best pupils every year.\n\nThe school might be made more attractive by providing for the recreation of the pupils. He thinks that a toboggan slide would draw more pupils to the school than other means that could be devised.\n\nThe usual grant for prizes last year was not made as the application came in too late, and he recommends that this money be spent in the purchase of lumber for the erection of a slide on the school grounds, which could be used by both the boys and the girls.\n\nMiss Street, who is in charge of the Girls school, thinks that this attraction would bring more pupils to the school than any enforcement of the regulations could possibly do. The parents are\naverse to compelling their children to go, and if the school were made pleasant for them, they would naturally go of their own accord.\n\nMr Delisle has furnished an estimate of the improvements and repairs required for his school which includes a complete outfit of new desks, which the Inspector says are necessary. The Canada Office Furniture Co. of Montreal has given Mr Delisle a quotation of prices providing for 32 desks, one teacher's desk and chair, at a total cost of $156.20, which with the other work would bring the total cost up to placing the school in good shape, up to $178.30.\n\nModern desks are a necessity and if funds can be found for the purpose, I would recommend that they be supplied. It would be much better to purchase in Montreal than from Beauharnois, as was done when buying desks for the Girls school, which were said to have arrived in a damaged condition and only a few at a time.\n\nForty single desks were purchased last year for the Girls school but 15 more are required to provide seating capacity for the average number in attendance. A new stove is needed for the junior class room in this school as well as two wash stands and two small tables. The outlay for these articles would be about $75.00, making the total cost of re-fitting and furnishing both the Caughnawaga schools some to about $250.00.\nSir,\n\nVeuillez donc me dire si le d\u00e9partement a pris en consid\u00e9ration les r\u00e9clamations que je lui ai donn\u00e9es au sujet de l'ann\u00e9e blanche des \u00e9coles de Cap-Chatanaga ?\n\nSi je peux m'attendre \u00e0 ce que le d\u00e9partement, outre pour cette fois m\u00eame, manque d'attention et consid\u00e8re la bonne qualit\u00e9 des ma\u00eetres et la parfaitement ex\u00e9cute bien accomplit le Compte des \u00c9coles.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am also ready to supply my diploma under separate cover. It has been promised by the Department that if there were any changes in the teaching staff here, I would be given the privilege of filling any vacancy, as I was on my last trip to the District last week for the same purpose. I am of the opinion that the District is of the same opinion.\n\nI only hope this will be given your early attention and to receive a favorable reply.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJoseph Phillips\nOttawa/ May 29, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant applying for a position as teacher on the Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that as you are no doubt aware there are at present no vacancies, but should a vacancy occur your application will be kept in mind.

I would ask you to have the Principal of the school provide Mr. Twoaxe with a list of those who are irregular in their attendance and also with a list of the children not enrolled. If the parents will not send these children to school regularly, Section 7 of the Regulations will have to be enforced. The Department will expect to receive at a later date a report from you as to the action taken and the results.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL.
