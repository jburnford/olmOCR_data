St. Michael's Indian Residential Schools, Alert Bay; Junior and Senior Classrooms Alert Bay Indian Day School; Campbell River Indian Day School; Cape Mudge Indian Day School. Campbell River Indian Day School has been decorated both interior and exterior.

Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nDec. 29th, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nThe Department will please note that Miss Saunders was away thirteen days during the Quarter ending December 31st. The reason for writing this letter is to explain why it was necessary for Miss Saunders to be absent so long.\n\nMiss Saunders is a diabetic and although her health is good generally speaking, nevertheless, it is necessary for her to be admitted to hospital two days every two months for special treatment, and this has always been done during week-ends, Saturday and Sunday.\n\nWhen Miss Saunders came to Alert Bay she was under the impression that she could get this special treatment when needed but later found out that owing to the lack of facilities and doctors it was not possible to have this treatment in Alert Bay. She then found it necessary to proceed to Vancouver and be admitted to a hospital for two days, and expected to return on the following boat but found it was impossible to get transportation home and was delayed in Vancouver until transportation could be arranged.\n\nSince then we have had another change of doctors who are now permanent, and they have made the necessary arrangements to give Miss Saunders this special treatment she requires.\n\nIt is no fault of Miss Saunders but rather that of the Columbia Coast Mission, and in view of this I would strongly request the Department not to make any deductions in her salary as it is not anticipated there\n\np.t.o.\nwill be any more sick leave during the term, as we now have definite arrangements for her to get her special treatment during week-ends when the school is not in session.\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 31st January, 1946.\n\nMr. M.S. Todd, Indian Agent, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo regarding Miss Saunders, teacher of the Alert Bay Indian Day School, no deduction has been made from her salary.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI am advised by Mr. Indian Agent Todd that Miss Anne Saunders, teacher of the senior room, Alert Bay Indian Day School, is ill in the hospital and on the recommendation of her doctor is going to resign from her position. Mr. Todd has not advised the date on which the school was closed, but I am writing him for this information and will advise you in due course.\n\nFor D. M.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to Miss Anne Saunders. Please forward her resignation as soon as you receive it.\n\nMiss Saunders was absent for 13 days during the December quarter, owing to the necessity of proceeding to hospital for medical treatment. This information was supplied to us by Indian Agent Todd in a letter dated December 29, 1945. We made no deduction from her salary and consequently she has already been allowed 13 days' sick leave with pay during the current academic year.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, March 8, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Alert Bay Indian Day School, No. 300.\n\nNo further payment of salary should be made to the teacher, Miss Anne Saunders, until you hear further from this branch.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\nMarch 146.\n\nMr. Todd,\n\nDue to circumstances over which I have no control, I feel that I must resign as teacher of the Senior Classroom, Alert Bay Indian Day School effective March 146.\n\nA.E.

There is a very heavy attendance at this school, and as Mrs. Massey, teacher of the junior room, has an enrolment in her class of over fifty, she is unable to carry on alone.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would endeavour to nominate a qualified teacher to replace Miss Saunders as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFor D.

Todd, Esq., Indian Agent, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of March 16th in connection with the resignation of Miss A.M. Saunders, teacher of the senior classroom at the Alert Bay Indian Day School, I am advised by Bishop Sexton that he is unable at the moment to nominate a suitable teacher to replace her. It is very doubtful if we will be able to secure a teacher for this classroom at this time of the year, particularly as the Easter holidays will soon be here which will leave only 2 teaching months. If, however, you should hear of a suitable qualified teacher please advise us immediately so that we can refer the matter to Bishop Sexton, secure his nomination and proceed with the appointment.\n\nFor D.

C.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 22nd last, file #6-11-2, in respect to the resignation of Miss A. E. Saunders.\n\nAs we have upwards of fifty children wandering around on the streets here who should be in school, I am wondering if your office is taking any action to secure a teacher. It is most important that we have someone if at all possible, even if only for the remainder of the term. I would like to suggest that you put an ad in the Vancouver Paper to see if it would not be possible to obtain a teacher, so that this year's work will not be lost entirely.\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am forwarding an exchange of correspondence between this office and Mr. Indian Agent Todd and Bishop Sexton in connection with a teacher to replace Miss Anne Saunders who resigned as teacher of the senior classroom at the Alert Bay Indian Day School, and would refer you to Mr. Todd's suggestion that we advertise in a Vancouver paper for a replacement.\n\nIt is understood that the United Church and the Roman Catholic Church have in the past advertised for teachers for the schools under their auspices and I would appreciate information from the Department with respect to our responsibility for securing teachers in this way. If the Department considers that this office should advertise for a teacher in this case will you please authorize me to do so, or otherwise I might suggest to Bishop Sexton that he advertise if he has not already done so.\n\nD.

Skaftfeld from the Kitwancool Indian Day School to the junior room of the Alert Bay Indian Day School. On approval of this transfer it was ascertained that Miss Skaftfeld would much prefer to teach at Massett and as I am in receipt of a telegram from Mr. Indian Agent Phillips advising that Miss Vivian Sing and Mrs. Ida Conroy have submitted their resignations as teachers at the Massett Indian Day School, this would be satisfactory. As the services of a teacher to undertake the work of the Junior Room at the Alert Bay Indian Day School are available we are now in the position of being able to provide for one of the rooms at Massett and two teachers for the Alert Bay Indian Day School in the persons of Miss Gladys Findlay whose appointment as teacher of the senior room has already been approved, and Miss Leanna Chemago whose application for the Junior Room is attached.\n\nIt will be noted that Miss Chemago holds a Second Class Permanent Certificate valid for life and has had 9\u00bd years teaching experience and in addition to this as she is a personal friend of Miss Findlay and will have to share accommodation with her, her appointment would be most convenient. I would recommend her employment at a salary of $100 a teaching month plus bonus and would appreciate confirmation of her appointment by airmail.\n\nIt is anticipated that Miss Skaftfeld will visit this office shortly and in the meantime it would be appreciated if you would advise also by airmail if her transfer to the Junior Room at the Massett Indian Day School is approved. I may say that her appointment to Massett is approved of by Bishop Gibson.\n\n[Signature]\n\nD. M. MacKay\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAIRMAIL\n\nOttawa, August 23, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M.

The two-room Alert Bay Indian Day School is open with a very large attendance. Miss Chemago, the teacher of the junior room took suddenly ill and could not open her classroom until September 9th. Good progress is being made in both these classrooms under the supervision of Miss Findlay in the senior room and Miss Chemago in the junior room.\n\nW.S.

Davey's Report on the Alert Bay Indian School, dated March 8th, 1947.\n\nOriginal on 156-29-6\n\n---\n\nMiss Leanna Chemago.\n\nThe work of this teacher shows little or no preparation and the methods used by her are poor particularly in reading. The pupils point to the individual words as they \"read\" them. The passages covered in this way are not understood by the pupils. No attempt is made to develop reading readiness with the beginners.\n\nThere is little to indicate any attempt at organization. If a timetable has been prepared it is not posted.\n\nThe discipline in the class is very poor. This condition results from the teacher failing to provide an adequate supply of seat work particularly for the beginners.\n\nThe attendance in this room is poor.\n\nSome attempt is made to give instruction in phonics and oral language.\n\nThis teacher has a large class but she has made little effort to cope with the situation.\nOttawa, April 11th, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIt is evident from Inspector Davey's report on his inspection of the Alert Bay Day School that the services of Miss Leanna Chemago are not satisfactory.\n\nAs previously stated, you will receive shortly a new schedule of salaries for teachers in Indian day schools, effective from September 1st, 1947. As soon as you receive this, I would appreciate it if you would communicate with Bishop Saxton with a view to having him secure a qualified teacher if possible, for this school for the academic year 1947-48.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nAll members of Agency staff were on duty during the past quarter. Accommodation for teachers and staff has become a serious matter in this Agency. Recently the old building housing the teachers and one member of the staff was destroyed by fire, leaving these employees homeless and with considerable loss to them. In this isolated place it has always been difficult to get accommodation for Department employees, and today the situation is impossible. I am bringing this to the Department's attention just as formally as I can because I know that unless we get some suitable accommodation for employees in this place we are going to have our schools closed and lose other members of the staff. An isolated place like Alert Bay is far different from a city or other centre where employees can either live at home or have a greater opportunity of obtaining accommodation.\n\nIn this place there is nothing. If it had not been for myself, with no authority from Ottawa, making an arrangement whereby we could get this old building which was just burned down for accommodation for staff members, our schools would have been closed long before this. I cannot afford to go on doing the things that I have been forced to do in order to get staff members reasonably housed. There is no reason why accommodation cannot be provided when we own the buildings and it is just a matter of having them moved to this location and suitably re-modelled for living accommodation. As far as I know now, all our teachers are assigned at the end of the term where they have no accommodation provided, as their present accommodation has only been temporary and they can no longer stay there. Teachers will not accept employment in outside isolated districts without accommodation being provided. This not only applies to the Indian Department but to the Provincial Schools as well. If the Department will provide the funds and give me authority and instructions I will have these buildings moved here from the Army Camp, Port Hardy.\n\nM.S.

This cheque represents a refund of Miss Benton's contributions to the Retirement Fund. Repeated attempts to locate Miss Benton have failed and we are returning the cheque for deposit.\n\nW. Leechlan\nChief Treasury Officer.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C., Department of Mines and Resources, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nThe attached requisition is for $3,000 f.b.m. #1 Edge Grain Fir Flooring necessary to lay a new floor in the Alert Bay Indian Day School. This flooring has been recommended by the Surveys and Engineering Branch as well as officials of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nI am anxious to get immediate approval of this purchase so that we can start laying the floor immediately school closes June 24th as I have someone who will be available at that time to do the work and that is the reason why I am specially asking for immediate consideration.\n\nWhen I requested sometime ago that Edge Grain Fir Flooring be purchased for the Residential School Auditorium, you advised me after many weeks that it was unobtainable in Vancouver and, therefore, purchased Hemlock Flooring which was not suitable and of an inferior quality, and this cost $200.00 per M., plus freight, which is a great deal more than the quotation I am submitting for Fir Flooring.\n\nI would, therefore, specially ask that you give this requisition priority so that we can accept the tender while they have material on hand. It will greatly assist me if you will give this requisition your early consideration.\n\nEncs.\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nDear Mr. Alfred:\n\nI was very much surprised and concerned to have Mrs. M. Scanlon, Principal of Alert Bay Indian Day School, forward me your letter addressed to her, which read as follows:\n\n\"Alert Bay, B. C.,\"\nMay 23rd, 1949.\n\n\"Just to let you know that all my children taking this afternoon off till after the holiday is over.\"\n\n\"M. K. Alfred\"\n\nMrs. Scanlon informs me there was no good reason for your children not attending school. She pointed out that on the afternoon of May 23rd your children Philip and Moses accompanied you to the playground where they were just fooling around with the workmen employed there, and could have been in school. Mrs. Scanlon also informed me that four of your son Alvin's children were also absent.\n\nAs you are one of the principal as well as influential members of the Nimipish Band, you must readily see how difficult you are making it for the school where regular attendance is essential to the progress of the individual child. During past years when the Government (through no fault of their own) found it impossible to provide adequate educational facilities for the children here, you were one of the most critical members of your people. The Department has and is doing everything possible to give your children a good education. A new school has been built and efficient teachers employed, and there is no reason why every child of school age in Alert Bay does not attend school regularly. The Government by law requires every child to attend school each day unless he or she is ill, and it is my responsibility as Indian Superintendent to see that all children attend regularly.\n\np.t.o.\nI wish to point out to you that you have no right whatsoever to dictate to the Government and inform the Principal that you are going to keep your children out of school just when you see fit. During the month of May your son Philip was absent 9 days, and the teacher reports \"No good reason\".\n\nAs this is a serious matter I felt it was best to write you fully so that you will know what the Government regulations are in respect to children attending school regularly. Please be advised no parents have any right to keep children out of school unless they are ill and this illness must be reported to the teacher; or special permission is given for a child's absence from school.\n\nThe Department feels that you should be one who is setting an example to others and I trust you will co-operate with the Principal and the Department in the future, so that there will be no repetition of what has taken place. Would you kindly give me this assurance.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n(M. C. Todd)\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nMr. Moses Alfred,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nAttached please find Monthly Day Returns for the months of May and June, 1949, respectively for the Alert Bay Indian Day School.\n\nThis special report is being made in respect to poor attendance of some children, part of which was blamed on the teacher by the parents. The teacher is now being transferred and insofar as these children are concerned I do not anticipate any difficulty in respect to attendance when the new school term opens September 6th.\n\nIn regard to the following children Louis, Jasper and Mary Joseph, we have reached the point where we do not know what to do. The family's home is at Turnour Island but live most of the time at Alert Bay. Because of poor attendance at the Day School I put them in the Residential School, thinking we could control them, but they have refused to stay in the school and ran away and upset the school so much that they were finally discharged. Since then we have been trying to force them to go to the Day School. The father and mother are very low type, both of them spend considerable time in Oakalla Prison. At the moment the father is just back from Oakalla but the mother is now there. To cut off their Family Allowance cheques would mean depriving these children of about the only means they have on which to exist; therefore, I have refrained from recommending their suspension.\n\nThese comments are made to justify why I cannot bring myself to the point of taking their Family Allowance away from them. We are still hoping now that we have more office assistance to improve their attendance.\n\nIn respect to the Alfred children listed on the May Report, I made a previous report under date of June 11th last, which evidently had the desired effect.\n\n(M.

Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: ALERT BAY INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nDuring a visit to my office today, Mr. Indian Superintendent Todd of the Kwawkewlth Agency, gave me the following information:\n\n1. The two-room school now being built from prefabricated buildings of the Port Hardy camp will be used for some pupils from the Alert Bay Residential School.\n\n2. To complete our requirements at Alert Bay, a four-room classroom block is required. This would give 10 classrooms as follows, and would provide adequate educational facilities for all pupils, both day and residential, at Alert Bay:\n   - 4 classroom block, recently completed,\n   - 2 classroom block, under construction,\n   - 4 classroom block, as required.\n\n3. On the mainland of Vancouver Island at Port Hardy, the Provincial School Board is having erected a four classroom building at a cost of approximately $140,000.00. This will give an indication of building costs in the Alert Bay region.\n\n4. With this in mind, Mr. Todd and Mr. Westerlund, a local contractor, thoroughly examined the old girls' block of the former residential school. They found this building to be in fairly good condition and both agreed that it could be modernized and with a slight addition could provide 4 classrooms and teacher's apartment. The classrooms would be down stairs and the teacher's apartments upstairs.\n\n5. The cost of this unit being modernized would be about $30,000.\n6. It would be necessary to have a qualified architect or engineer from the Department thoroughly examine this old building and report as to the advisability of using it as a classroom block rather than the erection of a new building.\n\nBernard F.

Cook,\nIndian School Administration,\nM.S.C.C.,\n102 Bank St.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAlert Bay Residential School\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nA contract has now been let for the moving over from Port Hardy of another building which will provide two additional classrooms to the Alert Bay Indian Day School. It is therefore likely that some of the children from the Alert Bay Residential School may be transferred to the Day School at a date earlier than we had anticipated.\n\nI would also like to discuss with you the possibility of converting the girls' dormitory building into a Day school block. Mr. Todd had Mr. Westerlund thoroughly examine this building and he reports that it could be converted to classroom use at a cost much less than that involved in erecting a new building.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Lamperson for the position of teacher at the above mentioned school. It will be noted that this teacher holds permanent Second Class Certificates for both British Columbia and Saskatchewan. However, I am informed that she anticipates completing her work for a First Class Certificate through the Summer School of Education Course for which she has already enrolled. If Mrs. Lamperson is successful she will make application for re-classification.\n\nMrs. Lamperson will teach Grades IV and V and her addition to the staff of the Alert Bay School is due to the increase in enrolment which will result from the consolidation of the class-room work of the Day and Residential Schools.\n\nThe following teachers have been appointed or recommended for appointment to the Alert Bay Day School.\n\nDivision One - Mrs. M.M. Scanlon, Principal - Grades VII and VIII\nDivision Two - Teacher not appointed as yet - Grades VI and VII\nDivision Three - Miss D. Lucas - Grades V and VI\nDivision Four - Mrs. M.I. Lamperson - Grades IV and V\nDivision Five - Miss L. Adams - Grade IV\nDivision Six - Miss Core Merritt - Grade III\nDivision Seven - Teacher to be appointed Grade II\nDivision Eight - Mrs. Katherine Bridge - Grades I and II\nDivision Nine - Miss Elizabeth Hadley - Grade I\n\nIt is anticipated that there will be approximately 360 pupils enrolled at the Day School. These will be divided into nine classes with approximately forty pupils in each. Of these nine class-rooms, six will be accommodated in the rooms in the existing Day School. The remaining three classes will be...\nJuly 3rd, 1950.\n\naccommodated temporarily in rooms at the Residential School. Although this is not an ideal setup, it will serve until the proposed Day Class-room block is completed.\n\nTemporary arrangements have also been made to accommodate two of the additional teachers at the Residential School and two in the teacherage block. It is still necessary to find accommodation for the ninth teacher. It is hoped that the Superintendent will be able to make some arrangement for this person before the beginning of the school term.\n\nEnd.\n\nW.S.

I have had prices from Marshall-Wells and also from McLennan, McFeely & Prior of Vancouver, one offering a stove at $23.50, and the other at $23.75, F.O.B. Vancouver. In looking up the various stoves quoted, I am inclined to favor the one given by Marshall-Wells Company, as it is all made of riveted steel, and has no rods on the inside to burn out, and the price is slightly lower.\n\nFor your information, I may say that it is very difficult to get a heating stove or pipes that have any degree of durability in this climate. The chief reason is that the wood supplied has been in salt water for a longer or shorter time according to circumstances, a good deal of it being drift wood, and it becomes saturated with salt, and only takes a short time until the stove is completely rusted through, particularly one of a type which is fastened together with rods. The stove at present in use is not safe, and I would recommend the one offered by Marshall Wells B.C. Ltd..\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M.

The roof should be stained and the outside of the school painted at that time.\n\nOne toilet was burned down years ago and the other has not been in a condition fit for use for a very long time. It is kept locked. Two new toilets are urgently needed.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nIn view of the good work done at this school, I wish to recommend that Mr. Luther be given the sum of $5 a teaching month for Janitor Work.\nOttawa, May 18, 1931\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Barry, Inspector of Schools for the Province of British Columbia, in a report on his recent inspection of the Alert Bay Indian Day School, states that the roof of the building requires reshingling, and that it should then be stained and the outside of the school painted. He also states that one toilet was burned down a number of years ago and the other has not been in a condition fit for use for some time, and that two new toilets are urgently needed.\n\nOur funds for the present fiscal year are extremely limited, and it will not be possible to carry out the reshingling, painting, and erection of new toilets. The Department will, however, consider the authorizing of the minimum amount of work required in repairing the roof of the school building in order to prevent leakage during next fall and winter. You should furnish a detailed statement of the repairs needed and the approximate cost of same. You should also furnish an estimate of the cost of the material and labour in the erection of new toilets, if you consider same to be necessary this year. When we have full information, consideration will then be given as to whether funds can be provided or not.\n\nThe Inspector recommends that the teacher be paid for janitor services, in view of the good work done at this school. Please report regarding the Inspector's recommendation and state the amount per teaching month, if any, you would recommend be allowed the teacher for this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. H. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJune 6, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of May 18, regarding the matter of the Alert Bay Indian Day School. Yesterday I examined the building, and I think that with very slight repairs, the roof could be made to last another year. The belfry requires entire new shingling, as many of the shingles have blown off, and the shingled cornice on the front end of the building need a few, but one thousand shingles would easily put the roof in condition for another year.\n\nRegarding the painting of the School, seeing that the Department is so very short of funds, for the present time, the School could be easily left for another year. It is now twenty years since the building was erected, and it was well painted at the time, and so far as I can recollect has not been painted since, but the paint is still in reasonably good condition.\n\nWith reference to the toilets, I would recommend that two entire new toilets be built with a cess-pool underneath. The total expense for everything should not be over fifty dollars.\n\nRegarding that portion of your letter referring to janitor services, I would recommend that the sum of five dollars per month be given to the teacher in connection with this work. He has done up to the present time, the bulk of the work himself, with a little help from the children, and he has purchased soap and washing powders at his own expense. I have talked the matter over with him, and he would be quite satisfied with five dollars a month for each teaching month to cover this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M. Halliday)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, June 16, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, relative to the repairs required to the roof at the Alert Bay Indian Day School building and the building of new toilets.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will approve of you incurring an expenditure not exceeding approximately $50 in the purchase of the materials required in having the belfry reshingled and the cornice on the front end of the building repaired. You may also arrange for the erection of two new toilets, with cesspool underneath. You should purchase the shingles and other materials required and arrange for the labour in having the work carried out. It is noted that with these repairs the building and general conditions at the school would be satisfactory for a further period.\n\nYou will be advised in a separate communication regarding payment to the teacher for the janitor services which he has been performing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

If possible, I would like to obtain authority for this work to be done, as there is always more or less of an interim in the fishing between the sockeye and fall fishing, which would give a good opportunity to get the work done. There are a number of people at Alert Bay who are in need of a little work, and could be obtained at cheap wages. This work was recommended by Mr. School Inspector Barry last year, and was put on the estimates for the current year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M.

In this connection I have to say it is regretted that the Department will have no funds to provide the expenditure required in the painting of this building this year.\n\nRegarding any repairs to the roof, I have to say that you may arrange to have any minor repairs required carried out, in order to prevent leakage. Only the work absolutely necessary, however, should be performed. You may arrange for the purchase of any material that will be required and for the labour. If possible, you should have an Indian do the work. Accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering any expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.

He informed me that it had been the custom for a good many years to allow him ten dollars for the purchase of presents for these children who otherwise would probably have no treat at all; I looked up the office records and found his statement correct, so gave him authority to expend that sum, vouchers for which are herewith enclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[E.G.

In the case of the Alert Bay School, it has been decided to make an exception, and the account is being paid. I would point out, however, that you should conform strictly to the instructions contained in circular letter of November 14th, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE.

I have advised Mr. Newnham that as no provision was made by the late Indian Agent Halliday in his Estimates for 1933-34, I am unable to approve of the expenditure but that I have submitted the matter to the Department with a view to obtaining its instructions, and that when the Department is heard from he will be duly advised.

The total cost of this is so small as to be almost negligible, when it is possible to have a pole cut in the woods near the school and only the purchase of a rope and small pulley would be necessary.

Today I am in receipt of an account handed me by Mr. Alvin Alfred of Alert Bay for the cost in connection with this in the amount of $26.00, and which I enclose herewith.\n\nThis arrangement was made before I took office and upon looking up the files it appears the Department did not expect this to cost very much. When this statement was rendered to me I made enquiries as to what arrangements Mr. Newnham had made and Mr. Alfred informed me that Mr. Newnham told him to go ahead and get the pole and present his bill. It is apparent that a misunderstanding has taken place, as I gather the Department thought the pole could be obtained close to the school, which, however was not possible.\n\nI would, however, like to point out the pole was donated to the school as well as the pulley, and the entire cost is made up of labour getting the pole and preparing it for erection. It is a very good pole, some fifty-three feet long, has been well seasoned and given five coats of paint, and I would recommend that a cheque be forwarded Mr. Alfred for this amount.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.

It is realized, of course, that authority to proceed with the erection of the flag pole was given before you took charge of the agency.\n\nThe regulations of our Accounting Branch will not permit payment of the account in the manner in which it has been presented; and therefore the account is being returned. Receipts will have to be forwarded, covering the cost of the gasoline included in the item of $16.50. The account will also have to show the number of days the three men were employed and the rate per day. The Department does not consider it was necessary to give the flag pole five coats of paint. Before again submitting the account, you should arrange with Mr. Alfred to reduce it by a considerable amount, as it will not be possible to pay $26 for this service.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It is located at the Agency headquarters and with no other building available to be used for certain meetings, the Department is forced to use the school at times.\n\nNothing has been done to this school with the exception of repairing the roof, for a great many years; the floor is worn through, the steps are falling down, and the fence is in a most dilapidated condition. In the interests of the health of the children it is necessary to redecorate the interior, and to preserve the building it is badly in need of exterior painting.\n\nI hope the Department will use every effort to provide funds to have this necessary work done as this is one school which is badly in need of repairs. Would the Department kindly advise me their wishes as early as possible as we are anxious to have the work done during the dry season.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M. J. Ford)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo, with reference to repairs and painting at the Alert Bay Indian Day School.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, it is not possible to consider any exterior painting this year.\n\nThe Department is prepared to provide a sum not exceeding $250 for repairs at this school. This amount must include the cost of a new floor in the classroom, repairs to steps, lobby and fence and decorating the interior of the school. Please give this matter further consideration and let me know if the work can be done for the amount stated, which is the total that is provided in the current year's appropriation for this school.\n\nYou might also state what proportion of the total amount will be required for material and for labour, also what material will be required and where you would recommend that it be purchased.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nS. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nSir,\n\nIn my Estimates for 1936-37 I requested an amount of $440.00 for repairs to the Alert Bay Indian Day School, and under date of May 6th the Department replied to my letter of April 23rd advising they had only provided a sum not exceeding $250.00 for this school, also advising owing to lack of funds it was not possible to consider any exterior painting this year.\n\nSince receiving this letter I have gone to considerable trouble in obtaining prices from various sources as well as cost of labour for all the schools which require repairs. Recently while at Village Island I discussed the matter of the Village Island Day School with the teacher and it was decided owing to this building belonging to the Church and requiring more repairs than was possible to do this year, to let it stand over until another year. The teacher has agreed to leave the building thoroughly cleaned and we have definitely decided to get along at this school with just a good cleaning for this year, and we do not intend to ask the Department for any expenditure in connection with this school for the present year.\n\nThe Alert Bay Day School, as the Department knows, is one of the largest and most important schools we have in the Agency. It is located at the Agency headquarters and has a large attendance, a great many children also coming from the outlying districts and attending school for short time while their parents are in the village. This has necessarily caused the school to be used more than any other school in the Agency. The building itself is over twenty-five years old, and nothing has been spent on it with the exception of the roof being reshingled last year. The building has also been used for meetings and Church services, which has helped to hasten its deterioration.\n\nAt present we have old home-made desks in the school which I am arranging to replace with modern desks to be obtained from the Residential School, which are extra for their requirements, and I have arranged to have them put in the Day School as soon as the decorating and repair work is completed.\n\nWe feel this school should be one of our best kept schools and a credit to the Department in view of it being located in a central place, and would therefore like very much for the Department to approve of having the exterior of this building painted as well as the interior. As there will be some of the alterations new material will be supplied to the stoves and a portion of the building, and if we do not paint it it will be extremely unsightly as well as not being kept in a good state of preservation.\n\nWe have gone to a lot of trouble in getting various prices, and I wish to submit to the Department for their approval the prices as follows:-\nTo complete the interior decorating, new floor, steps, repairs to windows, new fence and labour, also including one coat of paint for the exterior and labour, it will cost in the neighborhood of $375.00.\n\nHardware prices were obtained from Marshall-Wells B.C. Ltd of Vancouver, and came to approximately $75.00. Building materials were obtained from three different lumber firms, the cheapest being from Telegraph Cove Mills Ltd., a local concern, in the amount of $132.17, and the total cost of labour would be $170.00.\n\nI would like very much to give the school one coat of paint on the outside, and for the Department's information the total cost of this including labour is $87.19. In my opinion it is well worth it as it will preserve the building and it was only through having other work done that I could obtain as good a price as this as the same man would be doing the work.\n\nIt is almost impossible to start the necessary work at this school without completing it, and in view of the fact that we have decided to leave the Village Island School for this year, I would urgently request the Department to approve of an expenditure of approximately $375.00 to complete the repairs to the Alert Bay Day School.\n\nThe price of building materials has gone up since a year ago when the Estimates were compiled, which is making it a little difficult to keep within our figures, but we feel $375.00 is a very reasonable figure for this work.\n\nWould the Department kindly advise me of their decision in regard to this school. As it will take a little time to get the materials ordered and delivered, I would appreciate a reply by return of mail as we are anxious to have the work completed before the school re-opens at the first of September.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, July 9, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant, you may expend an amount of approximately $375.00 at the Alert Bay Indian Day School. It is noted, from your letter, that the amount stated will cover the cost of material and labour for interior decorating, new floor, steps, repairs to window, new fence, and one coat of paint on the exterior.\n\nIndian labour should be employed as far as possible, but, if any white labour is required, the Department will depend on you to obtain this from approved sources. All material should be purchased from firms on the approved list.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. S.

Every effort was made to keep the cost of the repairs as low as possible, but when repairing an old building it is almost impossible to estimate the exact figures as you invariably find other small repairs required which could not be determined before the work started, and I felt it was better to make a complete job rather than leave something undone just to keep within the amount specified for the sake of a few dollars.\n\nMy first plan was to repair the present fence, but when we started to work on it we found it was in such shape that it was not practical to do this, but rather build a new fence on three sides of the school grounds. We should have build a new fence entirely around the grounds, but I did not wish to go to any further expense without taking it up with the Department, it would cost approximately $30.00 to complete this fence, and if the Department would approve of it still feel we should build this fence this year; it could be done by Indian labour, and then the school would be in excellent shape. If the Department agree to this, would you kindly advise me and I will arrange to have the work done.\n\nFor the Department's information, I would like to give them a short report on the actual work done at the school and the changes carried out. When the building was originally erected the windows were placed on both sides as well as the end, and the classroom has always been arranged so that the children were facing the north side of the building with the light behind them. This has been very detrimental to their work and health, and it was deemed advisable when making the repairs, to remove all the windows on the north side and west end and place them on the south side of the building.\n\nThe entrance to the building was also at the west end, making it necessary to have about ten steps leading to the entrance. This made the building very cold. This entrance was closed up entirely, the steps removed, and an entrance put into the building at the rear of the south side of the school. A small porch was built over the doorway, and the classroom seats now face the west end of the building whereby the light comes over the children's left shoulder.\nA new floor was put in the building, and as it was found the old blackboards were in very bad condition, these were all re-arranged. We now have on the west end of the building a blackboard 4 x 12' and along the north side a blackboard 3\u00bd x 24'. When the Campbell River School was built I had one blackboard over which was not required, and I had that shipped to Alert Bay and this has been used in the Alert Bay Day School. It was found necessary to purchase one blackboard 3\u00bd x 8' to match the one brought from Campbell River. These are some of the items which were not figured on in the original estimate but were found necessary to complete the work.\n\nSome time ago I discovered in the Residential School some twenty-eight school desks which were not in use at that time, and the Principal, Mr. Anfield, offered to loan them to me for use in the Alert Bay Day School, but when I went to get them owing to the necessity of using extra desks in the Residential School this term I was only able to get about fourteen, and these were badly in need of repair. We repaired them and are using them temporarily along with the old wooden seats which have been in the school for the last twenty-five years.\n\nNow that this school is properly equipped, I feel the Department should purchase modern desks as the building is going to be used for only school purposes from now on. The old hand-made desks are very dilapidated, which no doubt Mr. Phelan will remember from his visit to the school last year.\n\nThe building has been decorated inside and out, repairs have been made to the windows, and the building is now in first-class shape and a credit to the Department. I would appreciate if they would advise me if the $30.00 estimated to finish the fence around the school grounds could be approved.\n\nIt will be noted we are forwarding the charges for labour on one voucher in the total amount of $189.75, and if the cheque is sent to me, made payable to the Kwawkewlth Indian Agency Trust Account, separate cheques will be made from this office for the workers whose names appear on the time-sheet.\n\nI trust the accounts will be found in order, and would recommend that cheques be forwarded as shown by the attached vouchers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Mrs. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, September 24, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, forwarding accounts covering the cost of work that was carried out at the Alert Bay Indian Day School and giving a report on the work and alterations effected to the building. The Department is pleased to note that this building is now in first class condition.\n\nThe accounts which you submitted will be paid in due course, with the exception of the amount for labour. You will be sent, under separate cover, an accountable cheque, to the amount of $159.75 for this purpose. I am enclosing the labour returns, and, when you pay the individual labourers, you should have them receipt each copy of the returns. You should then forward same to the Department in accounting for the expenditure of the cheque which has been sent you. It is noted that the expenditure was in excess of the amount authorized but that the work performed was necessary to place this old building in a satisfactory condition. You may incur a further expenditure of approximately $30.00 to complete the building of a new fence. When this work is finished, you should forward an itemized account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nRegarding the desks, it is noted that you have obtained a number of second hand desks from the residential school, which you have had repaired. You\n\n- might advise\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nmight advise the Department of the number of new desks that you would recommend be supplied. The size of the desks and the number of each size should be stated. If any new desks are supplied, they will be of the single type. For your information, I have to say that school desks are manufactured in the following sizes:\n\n| No. | Size          |\n|-----|--------------|\n| 1   | Adults       |\n| 2   | pupils ages 15 to 18 years |\n| 3   | \" 12 \" 14 \"  |\n| 4   | \" 10 \" 12 \"  |\n| 5   | \" 7 \" 9 \"    |\n| 6   | \" 5 \" 7 \"    |\n\nYou might consult the teacher and ascertain the number of desks of each size that would be satisfactory. When this information is received, consideration will be given as to whether funds can be provided to supply this equipment this year. If so, the order will be placed from here.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter No.156-29-5 dated Ottawa, September 24th, in connection with the Alert Bay Indian Day School, I beg to advise an accountable cheque in the amount of $189.75 has been received and cheques for wages are being issued and the returns will be sent the Department in the course of a short time.\n\nWe are very pleased that the Department have approved of a further expenditure of $30.00 to complete the building of a new fence around the school grounds; this work will be carried out shortly, and a report forwarded the Department.\n\nIt is noted the Department are considering the purchase of new desks for this school, and as requested, I have consulted the teacher as to the sizes of desks required, which are as follows:\n\n5 only desks size No.3, for pupils 12 - 14 years\n10 \" \" \" No.4, \" \" 10 - 12 \"\n10 \" \" \" No.5, \" \" 7 - 9 \"\n\" \" \" No.6, \" \" 5 - 7 \"\n\nI am very pleased indeed that the Department are considering this purchase as we have a serious problem on our hands in regard to desks at the present time. The quarterly returns for this school are going forward today and the Department will note there are fifty-four pupils on the register. This year we had twenty-two beginners, something unusual for here, and it was necessary for us to get out again all the old forms and desks which had been previously used and put them back into use to accommodate these children, seating as many as four or five in one seat.\n\nIt is true there are quite a few children here from other villages, and they may only be temporary, but as I see it there will be upwards of fifty children attending this school during the next term. Since the school has been altered and made into a first-class schoolroom, the Indian families appear very much pleased and interested and are sending their children to school regularly without any difficulty.\n\nIn view of this situation, I hope the Department will do their best to supply the desks required as we are anxious to make this a modern little school and the children cannot do justice to their work when the seating capacity is so overcrowded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S.

The matter was reported to Major D.M. McKay, Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, at Vancouver, with a recommendation requesting authority to make the necessary repairs. On December 14th instructions were received from the Commissioner's office to proceed with the necessary repairs. Owing to our inability to get a suitable person to do the work, the repairs were not commenced until December 16th when Mr. George Skinner was employed as foreman. The work was further delayed on account of a large fall of snow and very severe weather. On December 30th Mr. Skinner informed me that he was unable to complete the job as his family were all ill at home, and it was necessary for me to arrange for someone else to finish the work. This was done, and the work again started on January 2nd and we hope to have it completed shortly. Owing to our difficulties it was not possible to re-open the school on January 3rd, but it is hoped that the building will be ready for use so that school may commence on the morning of January 6th.\n\nM.

Peterson, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nfor supplies for the Alert Bay Indian Day School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental\n\nLetter No. 156-29-4 dated August 20th, 1938.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nof Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nForm No. 518\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nNovember 19, 1938.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn your recent visit to the Kawkawlin Agency I drew to your attention the overcrowding of children at the Alert Bay Indian Day School. At that time there were 72 children on the register with only seating accommodation for 47, and this necessitated more than one child to a seat. Since then the attendance has increased, and today we have an impossible situation with 88 children on the register.\n\nI have made a survey and find about sixty of these children can be definitely considered permanent pupils of this school. The balance or part of them will be returning to their own villages after the New Year, although some of these would remain here no doubt if accommodation were available as there is no school at their own village.\n\nDuring our discussion you requested me to try and find some means of relieving the situation, and it was suggested that a portion of the school building, now used as a Dispensary, be altered to provide for an extra classroom. I have gone into this suggestion very carefully, and find it would take too long for the alterations to be made, too costly, and would only be when completed a temporary solution and not satisfactory for a permanent classroom.\n\nThere is no doubt the Department is faced with the necessity of providing a two-roomed Day School here, as our census shows the situation will be even more acute next year. The immediate situation is intolerable, and I am sure the teacher no matter how hard he tries, cannot do justice to himself or the school.\n\nIn order to find quick relief, I investigated other means of solving our problem and interviewed Moses Alfred, a member of the Nimpkish Band who owns a hall immediately across the road from the Indian Day School, which has been occupied by the Apostolic Faith Mission. He has offered to rent this building to the Department for Eight Dollars per month as long as we need it and might even make it less if the Department thought this rent too high. Personally I feel it is very reasonable and would recommend to the Department that they accept his offer and arrange to purchase the necessary supplies and equipment to establish this extra room at the beginning of the next quarter.\n\nThe building is ideally located, and would make just as good a classroom as our present school. I rather think Captain Barry knows the hall and could give you first hand information.\n\nIndian Affairs.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have read a letter dated November 19, 1938 from Indian Agent Todd with reference to the present overcrowded condition of the Alert Bay Indian Day School, in the Kwawkewlth Agency.\n\nIn my report on the above school dated April 9th last I mentioned on page 3 that we should later have to consider the provision of a second classroom at Alert Bay.\n\nIn October and November of each year there are in Alert Bay itself a number of children who are registered at other schools, either Kingcome Inlet or Mamalilikulla; but it would appear from the figures in the Indian Agent's letter that there are now sufficient Alert Bay pupils to warrant the establishment of a second or Primary Division there.\n\nDuring my next inspection in the Kwawkewlth Agency in March 1939 I shall go into the matter on the ground and report in detail with regard to the necessity for a second permanent classroom and the alterations which would be needed to the present Indian Day School.\n\nAs it may be some years before such a room, if required, could be erected, I would recommend that the hall owned by Moses Alfred be rented and the necessary single school desks and blackboards purchased and set up so that this new PRIMARY DIVISION could be opened on January 4th 1939.\n\nIf instructed I should be able to obtain from the Right Rev. H. Sexton D.D., Bishop of British Columbia the nomination of a suitable lady as teacher for the new class.\n\nIf there are any available funds I certainly consider that Mr. Todd's plan should be followed. I know the hall he mentions quite well.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nWhile at Alert Bay last month, I visited the Indian Day School there, and found insufficient desk accommodation for the number of pupils in attendance. The children are much too crowded under the present arrangements to make good progress in their studies. The teacher, Mr. Stewart, tries his best, but is greatly handicapped under existing conditions. Mr. Todd has written to me in connection with this matter and I am forwarding herewith a copy of his letter, together with a letter from Inspector Barry dealing with the same subject. Inspector Barry's recommendation is concurred in.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nDecember 8, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo with reference to the increased attendance at the Alert Bay Indian day school.\n\nNo funds were specially provided in the current year's appropriation for a second teacher at this school and under these circumstances favourable consideration cannot be given to your recommendation that a second room be opened on January 1, 1939.\n\nYou might, however, arrange for the re-opening of a second room at this school from April 1, 1939, and during the period April 1 to June 30 we can carefully note the attendance and ascertain definitely if there will be sufficient children attending this school to justify the employment of two teachers for the academic year 1939-40.\n\nI note that you can secure a building at a cost of $6.00 a month. I am writing to Bishop Rix with a view to obtaining the nomination of a qualified teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. H. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have read Departmental letter 156-29-5 of the 8th instant with regard to the opening of a second classroom at the Alert Bay Indian Day School, Kwawkewlth Agency.\n\nWith regard to the above matter may I suggest:\n\n(a) As it has been found impossible to open this room in January owing to lack of funds, I believe it would be better to leave the establishment of a second room till the opening of the 1939-40 academic year in September.\n\n(b) A second permanent classroom would be much better than a rented room and there will be more than sufficient pupils for at least eight months of the year at Alert Bay.\n\n(c) During the period mentioned by Mr. Hosy, April 1st to June 30th 1939 there are not likely to be as large a number of pupils available in the village, and the attendance then would be no indication whatever of the numbers seeking instruction in the October to April period of any year.\n\n(d) I would draw your attention to the second last paragraph of my letter of November 28th 1938. The Right Reverend H. Sexton and not Bishop Rix of Prince Rupert would expect to be consulted with regard to the nomination of a suitable teacher. Alert Bay is in the diocese of British Columbia and not in Bishop Rix's diocese of Caledonia.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Your File 156-29-5.\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Hoey's letter of December 8th regarding the provision of a second room to take care of the increased attendance at the Alert Bay Indian Day School. This matter was further discussed with Inspector Barry, who has made certain suggestions which are set out in his letter to me of December 23rd, a copy of which is attached, and with which suggestions I am inclined to agree.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nYou have requested my remarks on a letter dated July 3rd from Mr. Indian Agent Todd with reference to the use of Moses Alfred's hall as a second schoolroom at Alert Bay.\n\nThe provision of a permanent second classroom at the Alert Bay Indian Day School where there will be around 80 children in attendance by October of this year has been suggested as Project 4 in a report dated June 6th 1939 dealing with a future building programme. Such a permanent building added to the present building was recommended in detail in my report on Alert Bay Day School dated June 17th and in the covering letter. The need for it is obvious but I am well aware that there may not be sufficient funds to cover the cost of construction.\n\nThe rental of Moses Alfred's hall provided we can have the whole building including a small shop or room at the end of the hall would provide sufficient accommodation for the next academic year. A rent of say not more than $10.00 a month on a twelve months' basis would be reasonable.\n\nI do not consider that including the reshingling of the building which is necessary the repairs should be allowed to exceed the sum of $100.00. I would not recommend the erection of the brick chimney suggested by the Indian Agent. The circulatory heater might perhaps also be done without if the permanent addition to the present school includes a small basement with a furnace.\n\nThe small room at the end of the above mentioned hall might be used by the teacher as a residence. He would have to furnish it himself of course but as he finds it so difficult to obtain a suitable boarding place he might be willing to do this. Your attention is drawn to a letter from the teacher and my reply 15/6/102 & 104 dated July 4th last.\n\nIf the Department decides to rent rather than build to provide the very necessary additional accommodation at Alert Bay, I would ask that the second classroom be erected at Alert Bay in the 1940-41 Fiscal Year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H. Barry.\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6384, File 800-5, part 3)\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJuly 3rd, 1939.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter No. 15-6-9977 dated June 24th last, in which you request particulars in respect to the suggestion that Moses Alfred's hall be used as a second classroom in connection with the Alert Bay Indian Day School, I beg to give you the following information. The approximate cost to put the building in suitable repair for use would be as follows:\n\n**Repairs**\n- Reshingling - material and labour, approx. $80.00\n- Incidental repairs - replacement of window panes, repairs to steps, foundation, painting, etc... $75.00\n\n**Heating**\n- Circulator heater, stove pipes and new chimney, approximately $100.00\n\nThis would be the outside figure, and it is possible the work could be done for less by employing local labour by the day rather than contract. I believe Mr. Fred Sharpe who built the Preventorium and who has done other work for the Department, could be employed, and I would strongly recommend that his services be obtained in this particular.\n\nI would like to add in my opinion the Department is faced with building a second classroom at the Alert Bay Indian Day School, and it does seem a waste of money to spend too much on someone else's property when it can only be considered at the best a temporary arrangement.\n\nThis building sits on the foreshore of the Indian Reserve opposite the present Day School and is a very dangerous place for children coming out of, as they must step immediately on to the public highway. It is, of course, a means of relieving our present situation, but I feel the Department would be well advised in building a second classroom immediately even though funds would have to be transferred from elsewhere where possibly the need is not so great.\n\nWhile I have not obtained an estimate from a contractor of the exact cost of enlarging the existing school, nevertheless I feel it would cost in the neighborhood of $2500.00, including labour and materials.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\nIn addition to this, we are faced with providing a playground for the children. At the present time this large number of children attending this school have no playground and are continually out on the street even though the teacher does his best to prevent it. The ground is very hilly, and on the side of a hill, and I feel in order to make a playground for the children a retaining wall about four feet high should be built along the face of the playground and the grounds levelled off. This would give them a small playground and would keep them off the street and away from danger. I consider the total cost of this would be approximately $200.00.\n\nIn addition to this it will be necessary to move the building now used as a Drug Dispensary to a different location and that would cost approximately $150.00.\n\nIt seems to me all these problems should be faced and worked out at the same time, as we cannot do one thing without dealing with the others. If the Department would undertake immediately to build an extra classroom and move the Dispensary, I feel the same could be done and ready for occupancy by October 1st. Moses Alfred's hall could be utilized temporarily for a month without spending any money on it, as the weather would not be too cold before the new school would be ready for opening.\n\nI am prepared to lend every assistance and take charge of the construction and purchasing of materials if the Department so desires, and would recommend in this case that the work be done by day labour and that Mr. Sharpe be employed as foreman.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M. S. Toda)\nIndian Agent\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith report of Capt. G.H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C., together with his covering letter of the 17th instant, with respect to his inspection on June 13th of the Alert Bay Indian Day School.\n\nWith reference to the recommendation made in the attached report for an extension to the present school building to provide a second classroom, it will be recalled that this office was advised by Departmental letter of January 4, 1939, file 156-29-5, that as no provision was made in the appropriation for the current fiscal year for the erection of a second classroom, it was unlikely that funds could be obtained for the purpose. Should funds for new construction not be available at present, the Department might favorably consider renting the accommodation available from Moses Alfred which, with some minor repairs, could be made suitable for a temporary school room.\n\nInspector Barry's recommendation covering the supply of blackboards and 57 desks is concurred in.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Todt has been asked to furnish an estimate of the cost of putting the hall owned by Moses Alfred in suitable condition for use as a school room, and to also supply information with respect to the wood-burning heater referred to in the Inspector's report. On receipt of this information, I shall forward same to the Department.\n\nThe nomination of a second teacher will no doubt be dealt with by the Department when a final decision is made with respect to the provision of a second class room.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nJune 17th 1939.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am forwarding herewith my report on the Alert Bay Indian Day School, Kwawkewlth Agency and administered under Anglican auspices, which I inspected on June 15th.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Todd was with me for part of the inspection period and gave me considerable assistance. He and the teacher are certainly to be congratulated on the fine work that has been done in this school under very adverse conditions of overcrowding.\n\nThere are some sixty pupils on the school register at the present time and we may expect slightly in excess of eighty children to be in attendance during the academic year starting in September 1939. The present overcrowding is of course particularly bad for the children in the way of health and makes effective teaching a most difficult matter. I simply am at a loss to understand how Mr. Stewart managed to carry on the school in the fine way he did during the past year. The addition of the twenty-five schoolchildren in September makes the provision of a second Division, room and teacher, a most urgent matter, even if this was only possible by the closing of some less wanted school in another part of B.C.\n\nI wish to draw your attention to the fact that there are only some twenty-five single crown desks in this school. To seat the remainder of the children at present in attendance Mr. F.E. Anfus, Principal of St. Michael's Residential School, was good enough some time ago to lend to the Indian Agent some dozen single desks. These desks are only here on temporary loan and will be needed at St. Michael's School later.\n\nTo seat the children expected next September we shall need in addition to the present ten No. 3 and fifteen No. 5 single crown school desks the property of the school the following:\n\n| Crown Single School Desks Required |\n|-----------------------------------|\n| 2 only Teacher's Desks             |\n| 9 only Single Desk Sections No. 5  |\n| 16 only Single Desk Sections No. 4 |\n| 14 only Single Desk Sections No. 3 |\n| 16 only Single Desk Sections No. 2 |\n\nI would strongly recommend the supply of the above desks by September 1st 1939. With the twenty-five desks now the property of the Indian Day School seating would then be provided for the expected eighty pupils, provided they be placed in the usual rows of eight desks and mounted on strips of wood at the regulation distance apart. Forty desks or five rows of eight should be placed in each classroom.\nTo provide the second classroom necessary at Alert Bay I would suggest that following work be carried out during the summer months:\n\n(1) Removal from its present unsuitable position at the end of the school building of the small dispensary to a site some two hundred yards away on Departmental land.\n\nThe site near the Indian Agent's residence shown to me by Mr Todd appears to be highly suitable for the Dispensary. There is a roadway and possibly the St. Michael's School tractor could be used in moving the small frame structure.\n\n(2) Extension of the present school building at each end for about twenty feet.\n\n(3) Moving of windows and supply of six new large windows for new room.\n\n(4) Provision of entrance hall in middle of reconstructed building, this hall to be at least fifteen feet wide Entrance to each classroom to be from this hall.\n\n(5) On the end of the extended building next the village street where the ground falls away and excavation would be a minimum the provision of a Manual Training basement room\n\n(6) The provision of a woodburning hot air furnace with pipes in partly excavated furnace room under building and next brick chimney lately erected.\n\nIn addition to the teacher's desk and school desks mentioned in an earlier part of this letter six eight foot lengths of four foot wide Asbestoslate Blackboard would be required for the second or new room.\n\nShould the Department find it impossible to carry out the recommendations of the Indian Agent which will be along the same lines as I have suggested above, there is only one other possible plan, and a much inferior plan at that.\n\n(a) The renting at not more than $10.00 a month of the hall located almost opposite the present school and owned by Moses Alfred (Indian)\n\n(b) The provision of a wood burning circulatory heater of fair size for the rented room. This heater would remain the property of the school, if the rented room was later given back to Moses Alfred.\n\n(c) The reshingling of the roof of Moses Alfred's hall.\n\nIn addition to the school desks and teacher's desk mentioned above only two lengths of Asbestoslate Board each 4 feet by 8 feet would be needed, should it be decided to rent this building in place of building additions to the ends of the present school.\n\nWhichever plan is adopted, and I should most strongly recommend the first (the addition to the present building) a second teacher, an Anglican lady with special qualifications in Primary Work and experience in an Indian School, would be needed from the opening of school in September next.\n\nThe nomination of a teacher for the proposed second Division at Alert Bay Indian Day School would no doubt be in the hands of the Right Reverend H. Sexton, D.D., Bishop of Columbia Victoria, B.C. and I suggest that the Anglican Bishop's nomination be forwarded through the Indian Commissioner's office to insure that the Department may have a professional report on her qualifications before any appointment is made.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nAGENT'S REPORT ON KWA'KWAK'WEULTH AGENCY FOR AUGUST 1939.\n\nThe entire month of August has been spent at the Agency headquarters. Owing to a second classroom being established in connection with the Alert Bay Indian Day School, and the necessity of transferring children from the Residential school to the Day school and other places, it was necessary for me to remain here to supervise the repairs and changes which are taking place.\n\nThe second classroom which we are providing here will open on time, but we have had difficulty in completing same owing to the Department not approving of the full amount of money I estimated it would cost to put this building in repair. In this connection I should like to inform the Department Mr. Stewart, the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Day School, returned earlier at my request in order that he could help us rearrange the equipment and supplies before school opened. Mr. Sharp, who assisted with the carpenter work, has offered to donate some of his services to the department if necessary in order to complete the work, but in my opinion this should not be necessary and it is my intention to put in his full time even though it does exceed the total amount of $205.00 approved by the department, and I hope any small expenditure beyond the approved amount will be paid.\n\nThe Residential school opened on August 28th with a full attendance.\n\nM.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of Mr. Indian Agent Todd's Monthly Report for the Kwawkewlth Agency for August, in which he states:\n\n\"The second classroom which we are providing here will open on time, but we have had difficulty in completing same owing to the Department not approving of the full amount of money I estimated it would cost to put this building in repair. In this connection, I should like to inform the Department Mr. Stewart, the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Day School, returned earlier at my request in order that he could help us rearrange the equipment and supplies before school opened.

(RG 10, Volume 6384, File 800-5, part 3)\nIn my letter of July 14th, 1939, to the Department, I expressed the opinion, after conferring with Mr. Inspector Barry who had made a complete survey of the building, that $100.00 would be sufficient to repair the hall for our purpose and that $50.00 should cover the heating requirements. However, the Department on July 21st approved of the original amount of $155.00 requested by Mr. Todd for repairs and confirmed my recommendation of $50.00 for heating. It now appears that he is endeavoring to convince the Department that he has been required to carry out repairs at $50.00 less than requested whereas he has been granted the amount for this purpose although he has been reduced $50.00 on the amount for heating. According to a letter received from him recently, this has also necessitated his remaining at Alert Bay assisting the carpenter in order to bring the cost of the repairs within the amount asked for and authorized, with the result that the field work has been entirely neglected.\n\nIf Mr. Todd has failed to budget the repairs within the authorized amount or is called upon for compensation by Mr. Stewart, the school teacher whom, according to his report, he recalled from leave to assist him, I would recommend that he be required to meet such unauthorized additional costs at his own expense.\n\nParagraph four of this report might also leave the Department with the impression that his family have been seriously inconvenienced by failure of the Department or this office to act promptly on his request for repairs to the Agency building, whereas the delay was entirely his own, and his expectation that our purchasing regulations could be set aside to offset such delay.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nSept. 6, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe second paragraph of your Agency Report for August is considered to have been drafted with a view to misleading the Department in regard to the insufficiency of their provision for repairs to the Moses Alfred Hall at Alert Bay. It is not the desire or the policy of the Department that Mr. Stewart or Mr. Sharpe should be called upon to contribute free labour in the performance of any of its work, it being your duty to confine expenditures entirely within the amount authorized by the Department.\n\nIt is also considered that paragraph four of your report should have included the reasons for arrangements for repairs to your house not being completed in order to carry out the work in time to avoid convenience to your family.\n\nRegarding paragraph one of your report and your letter of August 28th, I would advise that your duties as Indian Agent do not include assisting carpenters, etc., to the neglect of essential administration of your agency as a whole, a service that in my opinion can only be rendered by full time devotion to your work in all its divisions and I would suggest that you leave carpentry and other work to persons employed for that purpose.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.

Very careful consideration has been given to the contents of these letters but due to the fact that no funds were provided in the current year's appropriation for the specific purpose of enlarging the Alert Bay day school it is not possible to authorize the expenditure that would be required in this regard.\n\nYou may, however, arrange for the rental of the hall mentioned in Mr. Barry's report at a cost of $10.00 a month for the academic year 1939-40. You may also authorize the Agent to incur an expenditure of $155.00 in repairing this building. Indian labour should be employed as far as possible.\n\nYou may purchase the desks that are absolutely necessary but it is hoped that you will not consider it advisable to secure as many as mentioned in Inspector Barry's report.\n\nYou may also purchase a heater and stove pipes of the type that you consider most useful for the building.\n\nI am applying for an encumbrance to cover the cost of the desks and heater and the number of this will be forwarded to you as soon as obtained. It is possible that in the past this Division has not supplied you with the encumbrance number and in this way hampered\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.

I discussed this matter recently with Mr. Bailey who visited my office following his return from British Columbia. It is understood, of course, that all purchases will be made from firms on the approved list.\n\nProvision will be made in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41 for the cost of enlarging the Alert Bay school.\n\nI am communicating with the Rt. Rev. H. E.

As it is the Department's intention to erect a second classroom, it is necessary to have the situation clarified before any addition can be made to the building.\n\nWith this in mind, I wrote to the Church Committee of Christ Church, Alert Bay, and suggested to them if they wished to take this portion of the building and remove it from its present location, it be Church property. I would recommend to our Department that they relinquish their equity, with the understanding that the Church pay all expenses of moving this part of the School building to Church property. On the other hand, if the Church did not wish to do this, I suggested they waive their equity to the Department so that an unconditional title to the building could be obtained by either.\n\nOn October 4th, I received the enclosed copy of letter from Mr. F.E. Anfield, secretary-treasurer of Christ Church, in which you will please note the Church are now claiming to own the lot on which our Alert Bay Indian Day School is located.\n\nThis is rather a serious question the Church has raised, and if it is correct then the Department have build a school, representing an investment of approximately Three Thousand Dollars, on property which they do not own. I am of the opinion the Church are confused and believe the Department may have given the C.M.S. of London, England, only a letter of permission to build, and not a title to the lot.\n\nWould the Department please have their files searched and advise me at their earliest convenience, as I am anxious to have this clarified at an early date. It is noted on the survey of Nimpkish Reserve No.1; no record is shown of any lot ever having been surveyed and transferred to anyone.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M. S.

Personally, I agree with him as the Department cannot expect him to lose money through the decision of keeping the school closed during the month of September; in fact, we have no other alternative than to pay it, or be ordered out of the building by Alfred. I would therefore recommend that the attached voucher be paid as submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M. S.

As far as the Department is aware the building was not rented at the time it was originally taken over for school purposes. You will also remember that we have spent a considerable sum of money in repairing the building and no doubt this improved it considerably. I, therefore, cannot agree with you that Alfred would be losing any money by renting us this building for a nine-month term during the current academic year. Payment of the account will be withheld until we hear further from you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. M.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nLARGE BAY B.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of January 25th last, file 156-29-5 in connection with the Department's use of the Alfred Hall for the Alert Bay Indian Day School, I beg to advise upon receipt of your letter I interviewed Alfred and explained the Department's views and was informed he was not prepared to accept rental for the building for only nine months in the year.\n\nFor the Department's information, Alfred had this hall rented to the Pacific Coast Missionary Society previous to the Department taking it over, and received his regular rent from them with the exception of three months in the year which he donated to this church as a contribution to the work.\n\nI must point out the Department we have no lease on this building, and unless we are prepared to pay what Alfred asks, and what was agreed upon, he has the right to ask us to vacate the building although as he is a very sensible and reasonable Indian I do not think he would ask us to do so. However I believe the Department should carry out the original arrangement and pay for ten month's rental.\n\nI should like to say I have tried ever since I have been here to economise wherever possible and more particularly since the War, but in this case I feel we are obligated to him and should pay ten month's rent for the use of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.

(RG 10, Volume 6384, File 800-5, part 3)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Todd's letter of July 12th, with reference to proposed repairs to the junior room of the Alert Bay Indian Day School.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Todd has been able to secure the services of a contractor to decorate the interior of the room at a cost of $65.00, including material and labor and, although the detail provided by Mr. Todd is not considered sufficient, I would recommend that an accountable cheque for this amount be forwarded to him. In the meantime, I am writing to Mr. Todd requesting further details regarding what the Department will receive for the amount expended.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C., Department of Mines and Resources, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIn our estimates for 1944-1945 an amount of Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00) was provided for repairs to Indian Day Schools in the Kwawkewlth Agency. Since then I have been advised that this money is available, but Twenty-Five Dollars ($25.00) of same has been spent in cleaning the interior of the Campbell River Indian Day School, which leaves us a balance of Two Hundred Seventy-Five Dollars ($275.00).\n\nI have been wanting to have needed repairs done at both classrooms of the Alert Bay Indian Day School, but until today I have not been able to find anyone, due to the scarcity of labour, who will undertake the work; and, therefore, no action could be taken before now.\n\nWe have in Alert Bay at the present time a Mr. J.W. Sanderson, who is doing some decorating for the B.C. Packers Ltd., and I interviewed him to see if he would be good enough to decorate the junior room, as a spare job to fit in with his present contract. Mr. Sanderson went with me to the classroom, looked it over, and stated he would undertake the work, providing he could do it evenings, and offered to supply material and labour, completing the job in full, for the sum of Sixty-Three Dollars ($63.00).\n\nAs the department is aware, this classroom is 26' x 46' with 12' walls. It being larger than the usual classroom, it will naturally cost more money to decorate.\n\nI consider this offer to be reasonable, as he has agreed to repair the blackboards, decorate cupboards, etc., for the full price of Sixty-Three Dollars ($63.00). I consider we are very fortunate in being able to find someone to do this work and\n\nP.t.o.\nwould recommend that the department accept his offer. I would appreciate if you would kindly forward me an Encumbrance Requisition to cover same at your earliest convenience, so that Mr. Sanderson may take advantage of any convenient opportunity to proceed with the work.\n\nExtra c.c. enclosed.\n\n(M.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant, arrangements are being made to forward Indian Agent Todd a cheque for $63 in connection with proposed repairs to the junior room of the Alert Bay Day School.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C., Department of Mines and Resources, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nThe senior room of the Alert Bay Indian Day School, which is the property of Moses Alfred, Indian of the Nimpkish Band, Alert Bay, has been rented from him at an annual rental of One Hundred Twenty Dollars ($120.00). This building is being used temporarily until such time as the department can build a second classroom.\n\nWhen this building was taken over by the department for this purpose it was necessary for them to spend some money on it before it could be used, and at that time we felt the new classroom would be built in the matter of a few years. However, the war has intervened with the department's plans. It has been my views that we should not spend any more money on this building when it did not belong to us than was necessary, and for that reason I have refrained from asking the department to make any further repairs.\n\nHowever, it has been known to me that the building is very cold in the winter time. In fact, so cold that the teacher and children have to wear their overcoats in school. The building itself is merely a shell built of two-inch lumber - drop-siding on the outside and V-joint on the inside. The lumber was evidently badly put on and has shrunk leaving cracks. This building is sitting on piles over the salt-water, and the damp cold wind makes it impossible to keep the rooms warm. There have been days when the teacher was forced to close school on account of not being able to heat the building.\n\nIf the department intends to continue using this building for some length of time it would be in our interests to re-line the building and put in another floor. At the present time we have available Two Hundred Twelve Dollars ($212.00), which could be used for this purpose, but I do not think it will quite complete the work, and there is no use starting it unless we can finish the job. I think that the necessary work could be done for Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00), and I believe I could get someone to do the work during the month of August, providing we are able to obtain the material.\n\nThe building should be re-lined with 3-ply veneer. This veneer could be of second-grade quality with one good surface, and then stained. The floor should be of 1\"x4\", #3 edge-grained flooring. It will require one thousand (1,000) square feet of 3-ply and one thousand (1,000) f.m. of flooring.\n\nIf the department could purchase the 3-ply this year and do this much and leave the floor for later on, it would help a great deal towards keeping the building sufficiently warm to get by with.\n\np.t.o.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6384, File 800-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nI am giving the department all this information because I want you to know the facts before deciding what is the proper thing to do under the circumstances. Possibly you would be good enough to check up and find out if this material could be obtained and let me know the cost of same, after you have decided what you think should be done, and report fully in respect to same at an early date. The question of obtaining labour is a very serious problem and we must take advantage of every opportunity if we hope to have anything done in the matter.\n\nExtra c.c. enclosed.\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent.\nAlert Bay, B. C.,\nJuly 15th, 1944.\n\nIndian Commissioner for B. C., Department of Mines and Resources, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nFurther to my letter of July 12th last in respect to repairs to the senior classroom of the Alert Bay Indian Day School, owned by Moses Alfred and rented by the department from him; I beg to advise you I have discussed this matter with Moses and he has agreed to help the department to the extent of One Hundred Twenty Dollars ($120.00), towards re-lining and re-flooring the building.\n\nThis has put the matter in a new light and I would appreciate if you would do your best to obtain the material to carry out this work, as we will now have sufficient funds with which to complete the building properly.\n\nMr. Alfred suggests that we re-line the walls with Gyproc Wallboard, and in this I concur. I think this material could be purchased as there is no priority rating required. It will be necessary that we act immediately in order that I can take advantage of an opportunity to obtain the labour when it is available.\n\nIt will require, as stated in my last letter, one thousand (1,000) square feet of Gyproc Wallboard and one thousand (1,000) Tbm. #3 edge-grained flooring. If you could purchase the above and have it shipped, and leave other incidentals in my hands to look after, I will be glad to do so.\n\nExtra c.o. enclosed.\n\n(M. G.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Todd's letters of July 12 and July 15 with reference to repairs required to the senior classroom of the Alert Bay Indian Day School.\n\nIt will be noted that the building in question is owned by Moses Alfred, Indian of the Nimipkish Band, who has agreed to contribute $120.00 towards the cost of the repairs, and as it would appear that there is little possibility of conditions permitting the construction of a new school at this point for some time, I would recommend that the Department authorize an expenditure of $130.00 of the total estimated cost of $250.00.\n\nIt is anticipated that there will be some difficulty in procuring the necessary materials for the work, but I would like to be assured that funds are available before making definite enquiries in this connection. The cost of materials has been estimated at $150.00 and the balance will provide the labour.\n\nD.M.

The lanyard was gone and I have been unable to get anyone to reeve a new one, with the result that the school has not been able to use their flag.\n\nRecently Mr. Aldrich, professional flag pole painter and repairer, was passing through Alert Bay and arranged to paint and repair other flag poles in this village. When I learned of his presence I inquired as to the cost of repairing and painting the two flag poles, one located at the Indian Day School and the other at the Agency Office, and was informed he would do the two complete for Twenty Dollars ($20.00).\n\nAs I have been trying for sometime to find someone who would do the work, but without success, and when this gentleman was only going to be here a short time which would not permit me to refer the matter to Ottawa, I authorized the work, and I enclose you, here, vouchers Nos. 192 and 193, covering labour and material, which was paid for by myself.\n\nIt would be appreciated if the department could reimburse me for this amount.\n\nM.S.

On October 23 we wrote to him asking what could be done to improve the lighting conditions in the school, but I regret that we did not request him to forward his reply through your office.\n\nWe are now in receipt of the attached reply. I may say that we do not favour fluorescent lighting. As a general rule in this type of lighting replacements are frequently necessary and are costly. If you feel it necessary to install electricity in these two buildings, I feel that a more reasonable type of fixture would fill the requirements.\n\nLater you might return the attached correspondence for our file.\n\nR.A.

C.,\nNov. 4th, 1944.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Canada.\n\nIn reply to your letter of October 23rd last, file #156-29-5, I beg to enclose, as requested, tenders for the complete wiring of both Indian Day Schools at Alert Bay.\n\nI am informed that the Provincial Government are now using the new fluorescent fixtures rather than the old system for two reasons. The lighting system is much easier on the children's eyes and the consumption of electricity is about one-third, which would reduce our annual cost considerably, even though the original cost of installation is somewhat higher.\n\nUnder these circumstances I feel that in the long run it would pay the department to install this type of light. Ordinarily we would have to have two meters as these classrooms are in separate buildings with a public highway running between, but I have arranged with the Power Company to operate both schools under one meter which will mean quite a saving to the department each year.\n\nThis tender is being submitted by the Manager of the Pacific Power and Water Co. Ltd., Alert Bay, who supply the energy and the installation will be done by their own help. The tender calls for first-class installation and complying with Provincial Regulations.\n\nIt would be appreciated if the department could advise me at an early date, as I visited the schools only yesterday and found the dark rooms very difficult for all concerned.\n\n(M. S. Tod)\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncs.\nAlert Bay B.C.\nNov.25,1944\n\nMr.B.S.Todd,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay,B.C.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI herewith submit my tender to wire in conduit as set forth in the regulations by the inspector of Electrical Energy for the Province of British Columbia, the two Indian Day Schools in Alert Bay,B.C.\n\nSchool on beach side of road.\n\nFour light outlets with keyless receptacles controlled from two switches at entrance door.The whole circuit to be controlled by 15 Amp.service switch grounded in approved style and getting energy from main school across the road.\n\nMain School\n\nFour light outlets with keyless receptacles controlled from two switches at entrance door.One duplex plug mounted in convenient place for appliances and Xmas tree lights.\n\nThe two schools to be wired for one meter,the wires to be strung across the roadway.The meter and service to be at the main school.\n\n$110.00 including light bulbs and fuses,ready to connect to power lines.\n\nYours truly,\n\nK.L.Francis\nIndian Commissioner for B.C., Department of Mines and Resources, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nReplying to your letter of November 21st last, file #215-6-7300, with reference to supplying adequate light for the Alert Bay Indian Day Classrooms, I wish to advise you as follows:\n\n1. The school hours have already been adjusted to take advantage of daylight hours. This policy has been followed for years now on account of the poor visibility in the classrooms.\n\n2. When the school building was altered several years ago I re-arranged the windows to obtain the maximum light, but this does not give sufficient.\n\nIt is, therefore, important that in the interests of the children's eyesight and their work, that artificial lighting be installed at an early date.\n\nAs requested, I have obtained new tenders for both rooms, without reflectors, which amounts to One Hundred Ten Dollars ($110.00). It is regretted that the original lighting system submitted could not be installed even though the initial cost was higher than the one now being submitted; as the cost of our consumption of power will be nearly four (4) times greater, and this spread over a period of years will run into a considerable sum of money.\n\nHowever, I still feel we should have reflectors of some description to get maximum light properly distributed throughout the rooms, and as these will cost approximately Twenty Dollars\n\np.t.o.\n($20.00) for the eight (8) lights required, I would recommend that the department authorize me to purchase these which would be in addition to the One Hundred Ten Dollars ($110.00) tender enclosed herewith.\n\nPossibly the department would advise me on this and also let me have their decision in respect to the tenders enclosed, as I am very much worried about these dark rooms and want to see it rectified as quickly as possible.\n\nEncs.\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\n\nYour File 156-29-5\n\nWith reference to Mr. Hoey's letter of November 13th, regarding proposed installation of artificial lighting in both classrooms of the Alert Bay Indian Day School, I enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Todd's letter of November 28th and tender covering the installation at a cost of $110.00, plus the cost of reflectors for the eight drop lights at an estimate cost of $20.00.\n\nIf funds are available, I would recommend that an expenditure of $130.00 be authorized for this purpose.\n\nThe correspondence received under cover of your letter above referred to is returned herewith.\n\nD.M.

Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nWe have received from Indian Agent Todd his report\nfor the year ended March 31, 1946. In this communication he\nmentions the new schools which he considers are needed in his\nagency. He refers particularly to Alert Bay Day School and points\nout that although we have two rooms at this school we have only\nthe services of one teacher. He also states that three rooms\nare really necessary to accommodate the number of pupils.\n\nFor your information I enclose copy of a letter\nwhich I am writing to Mr. Todd, and you will note that if there\nwere another building available in Alert Bay we would be prepared\nto rent it until such time as adequate provision could be made\nfor the children of that village by the erection of a new school.\n\nMr. Todd's reference to the Airport at Port Hardy\nis as follows:-\n\n\"For the Department's information, I am told\nunofficially that the large Airport at Port Hardy, now under the\njurisdiction of the Department of Transport, is going to be\ndismantled. There are endless buildings on this Airport that\nwould be suitable for classrooms, and if the Department would\nemploy men, to be paid out of this $12,000,000.00 we have been\ntold about, and make arrangements to take some of these buildings\nover, we could proceed at once with the building or the necessary\nschool and other buildings in this Agency. It seems this is the\nbest and most suitable procedure to get our building program\nunder way, and unless we act reasonably soon, these buildings will be torn down and the lumber shipped to Vancouver or some other large centre and used for various undertakings.\"\n\nAre you aware who is handling the disposal of the building mentioned and do you think there is any opportunity of our obtaining it?\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, April 30, 1946.\n\nMr. H. S. Todd, Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, British Columbia.\n\nI have carefully read that portion of your 1945 report which refers to Indian education in your agency. We have noted the schools that you believe are needed and will give your recommendations every possible consideration.\n\nHowever, I regret that no action can be taken this year in erecting any of the schools which you mention. Owing to the policy of encouraging the erection of private homes, our public building program has been somewhat curtailed and no provision was made in the current year's appropriation for buildings on the reserves to which you refer.\n\nI am communicating with Indian Commissioner MacKay regarding your statement in connection with the Airport at Port Hardy. If there were any building available in Alert Bay, we would be prepared to rent it, but I note from your report that no building is available.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nEXTRACT FROM ANNUAL GENERAL REPORT OF M. S. TODD,\nIndian Agent, Kwawkewlth Agency, for year ending March 31, 1946.\n\nIn the Indian Village of Alert Bay we have two classrooms - one being held in the Department Day School, and the other in a building rented from a local Indian. On the Quarterly Return ended March 31st, of the junior room, the Department will note there were sixty-one pupils, and in the senior room where grades 3-8 are taught, we have forty-six children. This is an intolerable situation. The senior room is now closed due to the teacher's health being broken down, and we have requested that a new teacher be appointed, but to date the school is still closed. Mrs. Massey, teacher in the junior room, cannot possibly carry this load much longer. It is not only unfair but unjust to allow this situation to continue. I have tried to find some building that we could use as a third classroom but there is nothing in Alert Bay available. We are faced with building a three-room modern Indian Day School to take care of the educational needs of this village. The place is growing year by year, and it seems a tragedy in the lives of these young children that provision is not made so that they can receive a proper education. Consideration should be given to the immediate erection of a three-room Indian Day School in Alert Bay, to be part of the Rehabilitation Scheme. As we are told funds are available, and with men out of work, I can see no reason why this project should not be undertaken at once.\n\nFor the Department's information, I am told unofficially that the large Airport at Port Hardy, now under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transport, is going to be dismantled. There are endless buildings on this Airport that would be suitable for classrooms, and if the Department would employ men, to be paid out of this $12,000,000.00 we have been told about, and make arrangements to take some of these buildings over, we could proceed at once with the building of the necessary school and other buildings in this Agency. It seems this is the best and most suitable procedure to get our building program under way, and unless we act reasonably soon, these buildings will be torn down and the lumber shipped to Vancouver or some other large centre and used for various undertakings.\nEXTRACT FROM ANNUAL REPORT OF M. S. TODD, Indian Agent, Kwawkewlth Agency, for year ending March 31, 1946.\n\nI will give you what I think is necessary to accomplish the desired results:\n\nA new three-room Day School at Alert Bay, with teacherage, is necessary to properly educate the many children in this locality.\n\nNew classrooms for St. Michael's Residential School, Alert Bay, are required.\n\nA new School with Teacherage should be built at Turnour Island to provide education for the children in this village.\n\nA new School at Cape Mudge to replace the present one is necessary, but could be left until other schools are built where there are no schools at the present time.\n\nA teacherage should be built in connection with the Campbell River Indian Day School.\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1946 April 22 | To electricity used in the Alert Bay Indian Day School, as per invoice attached: | $3.25  |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

(RG 10, Volume 6384, File 800-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nIndian Commissioner for B.C., Department of Mines and Resources, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nThis short report is being made in respect to conditions at our Alert Bay Indian Day School.\n\nThis school consists of two rooms; one building is owned by the Department and the other is an old building owned by an Indian which we have made some repairs on in recent years in order to make it usable, and for which we pay $10.00 a month rent. Two teachers are now employed.\n\nYesterday I had a visit from the teachers and was informed they could not carry on under the present conditions and stated that unless some new arrangement or assistance could be given them, they would have to resign. They pointed out that there were forty-seven children in the senior classroom, made up of grades 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8; and forty-six in the junior room of grades 1a, b, c and grade 2. Some of the children are sitting two at a desk while others are sandwiched in and using boxes, old fashioned long seats and benches where seven or eight children are sitting together. The teachers also pointed out every bit of available space was being used and there was no room for the individual grades to stand as a group at the blackboard and take instruction. They also pointed out this unhealthy condition and stated they could not do justice to their work. They also stated there were other children walking the streets who should be in school (which I am also aware of), but due to this condition they could not admit any more.\n\nThis condition has existed for several years and has been kept before the Department.\n\nAs it was necessary to take immediate action to relieve this intolerable situation, I instructed the senior teacher to arrange for grades 3, 4, 7 and 8 to attend in the morning, and grades 5, 6, 7 and 8 to attend in the afternoon. This new arrangement became effective today and will continue for the time being. The junior room will continue to be used as at present as it was felt due to fewer grades in the classroom some relief might be effected by re-grouping them. I hope the Department will approve of the action I have taken as there was not sufficient time to refer the matter to Ottawa for your approval.\n\nIn the Department's letter of April 30th last, file M56-29-5, they informed me that if I could obtain accommodation for another classroom somewhere they would agree to the third teacher. So far I have been unable to find any available room in Alert Bay where we could establish a third room.\n\nRecently the department have taken over the Army Camp at Port Hardy and I understand some of these buildings are to be used for schools. These buildings will make ideal classrooms and now that we have the buildings available, it is a question of having them delivered, transferred and\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6384, File 800-5, part 3)\nI feel no time should be lost in undertaking this program.\n\nIf the Department will give me the authority to go ahead, and provide the necessary funds, I will undertake to have these buildings dismantled, transported to Alert Bay and erected, and have them ready for occupancy at the earliest possible date. There are at the present time good Indian carpenters whom I can employ to help erect these prefabricated buildings on their present site, but it will have to be done and completed during this winter before the fishing season starts next Spring. There are also one or two good white carpenters whom I believe I could employ to assist. It would be necessary to have this whole undertaking based on the basis of day labour as it would be impossible to get anyone to take a contract. I am satisfied it would cost less by day labour rather than by contract - in any case there is no one available who will take a contract.\n\nA few days ago I recommended that funds be provided to clear the site for the new school as well as burning refuse and gravelling the road. I hope the Department will approve of this so that we can take advantage of the bulldozer which is still here on the island before it leaves for Klickseewy Reserve to start lagging operations in a few days' time.\n\nIn a previous report I presented plans for the new school and estimated the same could be completed for approximately $6,000.00. I still feel this can be done, barring unforeseen circumstances.\n\nAs the matter of school accommodation is so serious it seems to me we should now take advantage of this wonderful opportunity and provide the necessary classrooms, and when doing so consider our own needs so that the question of sufficient accommodation will be settled for years to come. There are going to be many Indian families locate in Alert Bay on the Industrial School site as soon as the status of this Reserve is settled. These are young people with growing-up families who wish to get away from the settlement, and they consider it is the only chance they have in which they can do so. It is this custom which is holding back my young married Indians and I consider the Department should leave nothing unturned to make it possible for them to shake themselves loose from it so that they can prosper and become progressive, law-abiding citizens. The Indians realize most of their earning power comes from fishing and, therefore, it would be far better for them to live in Alert Bay where their children could enjoy good school facilities and receive proper medical care from our local hospital and medical officers. This they are deprived of living in isolated Indian villages elsewhere. We have a wonderful opportunity now to really help them.\n\nAt the present time we are paying tuition fees and board, etc., for Indian boys and girls to attend high school in Victoria and Vancouver, which is costing the Department considerable sums. If we had a proper day school here it would pay us to establish a boarding school with dormitories so that the children could combine work with education right up to grade 12 and still live at home. This year I have seven children attending high school and if it were possible for them to attend high school and remain at home I know there would be a great many more who would avail themselves of this opportunity. We would then be giving the Indians the very\nthing they are pleading for. A high school in connection with this day school would serve my whole Agency, and now that we have the buildings that could be utilized at very little cost, provision should be made to that end.\n\nI might mention that our present Indian Day School in Alert Bay is a very old building, but could be used for many good purposes, other than for school purposes, either by the Department or the Indians, after the new school had been built. It is felt that all classrooms should be in one unit whereby the principal would have immediate supervision and control at all times.\n\nI, therefore, recommend that when we erect this new school, all these suggestions referred to be given due consideration. Possibly the Department would give my recommendations early consideration, as I am anxious to take steps to improve conditions here at the earliest possible date.\n\n(Ms. S.

We have also received your letter, 6-11-3, of Nov. 18th with comments upon Mr. Todd's letter.\n\nThe Department approves the operation of the Alert Bay Indian Day School on a half-day system as at present in operation. It is understood that this is necessitated by the overcrowding at this school.\n\nWe have recently discussed this matter with Col. Medland who was in charge of the construction of the Port Hardy Military Camp. He informed us that buildings from this camp had been moved by the Army as far as Nanaimo with no serious consequences.\n\nWe are quite prepared to have such buildings as you consider necessary moved to Alert Bay to provide the additional classroom accommodation which you consider necessary. It is understood that Inspector Davey will be making recommendations in this regard. We have included an amount to cover such moving expenses in our 1947-48 estimates.\n\nMr. Armstrong has already written you on Nov. 25th concerning the funds required to move buildings which will be used for housing purposes.\nTo summarize, we will await a definite recommendation from you as to the number or these buildings which you wish to use for classrooms both at Alert Bay and in other Agencies. Insofar as the use of the Industrial School Reserve site is concerned, we are advised that it will be in order to erect classrooms upon this land, but that care must be taken not to authorize the erection of additional housing upon this site.\n\nBernard F.

(RG 10, Volume 6384, File 800-5, part 3)\nJune 4th, 1947.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nReferring to your memoranda of May 5th and May 29th and to our telephone conversation this morning, if the buildings referred to are those at Camp \"A\" near Port Hardy airport, a description of them and suggestions as to their dismantling are contained in my report of October 10th, last, to Mr. Jackson, a copy of which was supplied to you.\n\nIt would not be feasible to transport the buildings by water without tearing them down, but the thirty-one Loxstave prefabricated buildings, referred to in my report, are very amenable to dismantling and loading on barges.\n\nYour Indian Commissioner, in co-operation with our Engineer, would have to make arrangements for the securing of the necessary barges and the settling of transportation rates with the tug or other boat that would be used for tow purposes.\n\nWhen I was at Port Hardy, Mr. Keith J. Robinson, Airport Manager, was very co-operative and said that if he could get permission from the Department of Transport he would have time to exercise supervision over the dismantling and loading of the Loxstave buildings. He said the Department of Transport had a two-ton Dodge truck with stake body and a D-8 tractor with power winch that might be loaned. All arrangements in this connection could, it is believed, be made with the Department of Transport office at Vancouver, providing this equipment is still at the airport.\nThe watchman looking after these buildings, as well as the R.C.A.F. Hospital at Port Hardy, was Mr. F. Carrington of the Corps of Commissionaires, and he was quite anxious to co-operate in the dismantling and unloading of the buildings providing he could be paid suitable wages while on this work.\n\nThis is a project that will have to be organized and looked after by Mr. Webb's office in conjunction with Major MacKay.\n\nThere are two ways of financing this project but perhaps the better one would be for your Indian Commissioner to meet the expenditures involved on the certificate of our Engineer, or the foreman, rather than for funds to be transferred to our Engineering and Construction Service. There are so many operations that will be handled largely by your officers that it would be simpler if your Vancouver office handled all the finances.\n\nDirector.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, June 10th, 1947.\n\nMajor D.

Mills, Esq., Chief Engineer, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Removal of Buildings from Port Hardy Military Camp,\nVancouver Island, B.C.\n\nYour letter of June 25 advising that the above work is to be carried out under financial responsibilities of Mr. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for British Columbia is acknowledged. We are, therefore, forwarding him copies of this letter and have contacted him regarding funds.\n\nPursuant to your letter of June 6 and subsequent teletypes and telegrams, Mr. K.J. McClure was employed as Construction Foreman to supervise this work of removing the buildings and of re-erecting them as required. Mr. Whyte accompanied by Mr. McClure left Vancouver by steamer on June 19th and visited Alert Bay and Port Hardy, returning on June 24th.\n\nPrior to their going north, which could not be arranged by plane, a conference was held in this office with Indian Commissioner MacKay on June 18th as to what his branch has in mind and done with the use of the buildings. Subsequent to this Mr. Whyte held a further conference with the Indian Commissioner and the Indian Affairs school inspector and submitted tentative plans for schools and teachers' dwellings so as to obtain an idea as to where buildings of various sizes should be shipped.\n\nThe first priority seems to be for a four room school at Alert Bay with two teachers' dwellings - one 48 x 24 to house a married teacher, and one 60 x 24 to house three or four single teachers; also a stores building adjacent to the Agency office.\n\nThe second priority is for a single teachers' residence at Campbell River.\n\nThird priority is for a combined one room school and teacher's residence at Tournour Island.\n\nFourth priority is for a similar structure at Gilford Island.\n\nFifth priority is for a one or two roomed school at Cape Mudge.\n\nSixth priority is for a combined single room and teacher's quarters at Village Island.\n\nIt is possible the sizes or some of these schools and other buildings may later be changed.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6384, File 800-5, part 3)\nOn Mr. Whyte's visit north he found it was not possible to secure labour due to the fishing season which is just starting. It will, therefore, be necessary to hire men in Vancouver and transport them north. No doubt Vancouver wage scale will be necessary. Arrangements have been made to have a new sod at Port Hardy airport at an advanced charge and they can find quarters in the camp although we may find it necessary to supply bedding. The Indian Commissioner is trying to arrange for their accommodation at the Indian Residential School at Alert Bay as the school will be almost empty during July and August. By making these arrangements, a cook will not be necessary until later in the programme.\n\nArrangements were made through the Department of Transport for use of their vehicles on a rental basis at Port Hardy and trucks and a bulldozer can be hired at Alert Bay. At Campbell River and possibly Cape Mudge it should be possible to hire a truck but at other points all material will have to be transported by hand. At some points this may be expensive.\n\nThe Canada Kelp Company at Deer Island, near Port Hardy, has a 52 ft. x 20 ft. landing craft with its own power and this has been arranged for at a cost of approximately $30.00 per day. The company is submitting the definite rate in writing as soon as the manager, Mr. R. Barker, can contact the captain of our craft. This tentative rate which includes fuel costs is considered reasonable as Mr. A. Borden, District Engineer, Dominion Public Works Department at New Westminster, stated that a scow might cost up to $100.00 per day and to this we would have to add towing charges and the time taken to move the scow to and from Vancouver. No scows could be located in the Port Hardy-Alert Bay area. The only other conveyance is a small unpowered landing craft at Alert Bay. The landing craft of the Canada Kelp Company has a capacity of 15 tons and should be able to carry 120 lin. ft. of 24 ft. Loxtave Prefab building per trip. It can be beached on any smooth shore for loading or unloading.\n\nAt Port Hardy there is an excellent loading dock with adjacent storeroom approximately two miles from the Army camp. This is on the Indian Reserve and was built by the camp contractors. At Alert Bay the landing craft can be beached at the foot of Park Street on which Lot 24 fronts where the school and teachers' dwellings are to be erected.\n\nWhile complete estimates as to costs are not yet available, it is estimated that a building approximately 60 ft. x 24 ft. can be removed and re-erected at Alert Bay complete with new Duroid or similar shingle roof for approximately $1200.00. For a four room school using an \"H\" hut which is 38 ft. long with 40 ft. connection and 40 ft. wide which would mean a cost of approximately $5000.00. As the floors will have to be sawn, it is likely a covering of some kind will be necessary and this would add a cost of $500.00 to the above. The installation of plumbing and wiring and also repainting would be extra as well as cost of a central heating system if such is required. Cost of\nblackboards, school seats and other fittings would also be extra. The two teachers' dwellings would cost approximately $2400.00. Painting, plumbing and wiring extra, also floor covering.\n\nThere are sufficient stoves available and equipment to fit all buildings with plumbing and wiring. Hot water tanks are also in supply and just need fitting which could be used in other than vacant dwellings. There are no suitable cooking ranges for dwellings at Port Hardy Bay. The cooking ranges there are all large camp type only suitable for institutional purposes.\n\nThe dismantling of the buildings does not appear to be a difficult problem other than the floors. It is suggested we secure still poles and cut them into sections. Such saw can be used at Port Hardy and at Alert Bay and would soon save its cost in labour time. In addition to the floors there will also be considerable cutting to fit in extra windows as all are desired on one side of school rooms.\n\nAt Alert Bay the area selected for the school has been cleared but about one-half days work of a bulldozer is needed to level ground which now has quite a slope to cut down or supporting posts required.\n\nThe stores building at Alert Bay could be approximately 30 ft. long and could be roofed with 3 ply rubberoid unless it is considered that shingles such as Duroid should be used due to its proximity to the Agency buildings. It would not require many partitions or the floor to be covered so cost of its removal and re-erection should not exceed $1200.00.\n\nThe above gives a figure of $7900.00 for removal and erection of buildings for 4 room school and 2 teachers' dwellings at Alert Bay. Installation of plumbing and electric wiring as well as painting could be left until later, also floor in residence is found necessary. An estimate covering these items will be submitted in due course.\n\nA rough estimate of costs of other buildings re-erected less plumbing, electric wiring and painting would be as follows:\n\nCampbell River - teachers' residence $1500.00\nTurnour Island - 1 room school and residence $1800.00\nGilford Island - 1 room school and residence $1800.00\nCape Mudge - 1 room school $1500.00\nVillage Island - 1 room school and residence $1800.00\n\nAs it is evident from correspondence that it is desired we proceed at once with these projects, we have submitted an estimate for July of $5482.00 and Mr. McClure is securing labour and proposes to return north on Saturday, June 28th. If the above programme is concurred in, it is\nessential we take full advantage of good weather and get as much done as possible by September 1st when it is assumed school buildings will be required.\n\nDetailed plans and estimates for the several proposed buildings are being prepared and will be submitted as available.\n\nAt present and for the next month or so accommodation on boat or plane is very difficult so we have been forced to make plans in anticipation of approval being forthcoming.\n\nC.H. Webb\nDistrict Chief Engineer\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6384, File 800-5, part 3)\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThe following message by Army Signals was dispatched to you early this afternoon:\n\n'Reference removal buildings Port Hardy Camp for school and Agency purposes Alert Bay approximate cost of removal and re-erection sufficient buildings for four classroom block and two teachers' residences eight thousand dollars central heating if required installation of plumbing electric wiring and repainting extra Stop Consider we would be fully justified in proceeding with this work and have advised local office Surveys and Engineering accordingly Stop Request covering Departmental authority by wire immediately Stop Also advance five thousand dollars to cover labour Stop Report of local Surveys and Engineering Branch giving detailed information being forwarded by airmail.'\n\nThe report referred to is enclosed.\n\nYou will note the arrangement made covering the use of the buildings required at the places mentioned and the order in which the work is to be carried out. The estimate of costs given to move these buildings and erect them ready for use less plumbing, central heating if required, wiring and repainting appears to me to justify our proceeding with the work without delay. A four classroom block at Alert Bay with sufficient living quarters for teachers could not be built at prevailing prices for less than $40,000 to $45,000 and if we can meet the school needs at Alert Bay which, I may say, are of a very urgent character, for the next ten years by using the buildings at Port Hardy even if the cost of doing so exceeds $10,000 we should, in my opinion, proceed. The estimate of the cost of providing our requirements...\nat Campbell River and elsewhere in the Kwawkewlth Agency is set out in Mr. Webb's report and I would recommend that the necessary funds be provided to carry out as much as possible of this program while we are in a position to secure the men and equipment required. I should appreciate being advised how far we may go in carrying out this program.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa, June 30, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. HESY\n\nFort Hardy Military Camp\n\nI have recently had an opportunity of inspecting the army buildings which Colonel Randle has had moved to the Six Nations Reserve. They are progressing very rapidly in having these set up as school buildings and they should prove satisfactory for a period of 5 years or more.\n\nThe attached letter and report concerns the removal of buildings from the Fort Hardy Military Camp to be re-erected similarly as schools in the Commonwealth Agency at Alert Bay.\n\nI had an opportunity of discussing this situation with Major MacKay during his recent visit here. This project will do a great deal to alleviate the present shortage of educational facilities for the Indians in this area. In all it will provide the following buildings:\n\n(a) A four-room school at Alert Bay with two teachers' dwellings,\n\n(b) A teacher's residence at Campbell River,\n\n(c) A one-room school and teacher's residence at Toernour Island,\n\n(d) A one-room school and residence at Gilford Island,\n\n(e) A one-room school and residence at Cape Mudge,\n\n(f) A one-room school and residence at Village Island.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6384, File 800-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nWhen Major MacKay's telegram arrived on Saturday, I did not hesitate to draft the telegram of approval for your signature. The reason for the immediate decision being necessary was the fact that men had to leave Vancouver on June 28 in order to begin this operation at once.\n\nThe immediate funds necessary are available under the item entitled \"Cape Mudge - one-room school and residence - $8,000,\" included in our Main Estimates. In order that we may fully avail ourselves of this excellent opportunity of securing temporary classroom accommodation, I would also recommend that we consider the transfer of $5,000.00 from the $10,000.00 which is available in our Vote for the assembling of materials for the residential school at Teslin, N. T. Major Clark estimates that $5,000.00 will be sufficient to carry out most of this work at Teslin this summer.\n\nI would appreciate an opportunity of discussing this project with you and Miss Walton. You will note that one of the buildings will be used as a stores building for agency purposes.\n\nBernard F.

Colonel Rundle has finished the army buildings at Brentford with both asbestos shingle and insul-brick. Of the two, he has found the insul-brick to be more satisfactory. However, in view of the lumber situation in British Columbia, you may prefer the use of cedar shingles or cedar siding.\n\nTo date we have not received from our Surveys and Engineering Branch an official letter concerning this project. However, we are proceeding on the assumption that Mr. Webb's letter to his Chief Engineer will be dealt with by them in the near future.\n\nBernard F.

(RG 10, Volume 6384, File 800-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nWe are very pleased indeed that the Educational Branch is providing a suitable four-room Day School for Alert Bay. This will mean employing four teachers when the next term commences as I understand the school will be ready when the fall term opens. I am also very pleased that furnished teacherages are going to be provided for the teachers and would recommend that authority be granted to purchase the necessary furnishings for these teacherages.\n\nAs the Surveys and Engineering Branch have obtained equipment to dismantle, transport and rebuild the Army Camp buildings for schools, it would seem advisable, while this equipment is available, to complete our whole school program, particularly when we have the buildings available and arrangements made for use of equipment. In this connection our program consists of schools and teacherages at Gilford Island and Turnour Island, a new school at Cape Mudge and a teacherage at Campbell River Indian Day School, as well as furnishings for the teacherages. If sufficient help were employed all this work could be done before the bad weather sets in.\n\nM. S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\n\nCopied:\nCS\nJuly 22, 1947.\n\nRe: Port Hardy Military Camp Buildings\n\nIn a letter dated the 17th instant from Vancouver our Mr. Webb, under whose control buildings for the Indian Affairs Branch are being moved from Port Hardy, states that Commissioner MacKay hopes to have an outer finish of:\n\n(a) Asbestos Shingles,\n(b) Insul-brick Asphalt Siding,\n(c) Cedar Shingles,\n\napplied to the buildings when re-erected in their new locations.\n\nCommissioner MacKay has cited the action taken by Superintendent Randall at the Six Nations Superintendency in covering salvaged buildings, in which operation he appears to have developed a preference for insul-brick finish.\n\nIf the salvaged buildings for the Six Nations area were of National Defence construction they were probably faced originally with asbestos shingles, and since the latter are not easily salvagable, were probably covered with insul-brick asphalt siding when placed in their new positions. However, since the Port Hardy buildings appear to be Loxstave type as handled by Prefabricated Buildings Limited of Vancouver, it is our opinion that the patented feature of their construction, whereby the locking system of wall members at the corners, causes a projection somewhat similar to log wall construction, satisfactory application of any covering material would not be possible.\n\nMr. Webb has requested us to obtain construction particulars of the buildings handled by Superintendent Randall, in order that he may form an opinion regarding their exterior finish to pass on to Commissioner MacKay.\n\nYour reply as soon as possible will be appreciated.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Building, 165 Sparks St.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 25th, 1947.\n\nLt.-Col. E.P. Randle,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Randle:\n\nI dislike bothering you with a matter with which you have no particular concern, but I enclose for your information a copy of a memorandum just received from the Surveys and Engineering Branch. This memorandum explains itself and I would appreciate it very much if you would let me have an immediate reply giving the information that Mr. Webb requires.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\nP. Phelan, Esq., Chief Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nIn reply to your 156-29-5 WT.1 of the 25th ultimo enclosing copy of memorandum from the Surveys and Engineering Branch you are advised as follows.\n\nThe outside walls of the buildings on the former military training centre were originally faced with rolls of ordinary black 2-ply roofing, - a low grade type, much used by Indians and farmers as a cheap way of roofing small houses and buildings.\n\nOn siding the first school reconstructed from an army building, we used asbestos shingles, but as only second grade were obtainable, the job when done did not look first class, as the shingles disclosed cracks after being on a few days, and some corners broke off.\n\nThen with children playing around, more get cracked and damaged, and it is doubtful if even first grade would really stand up.\n\nOn the other hand, the insul-brick siding placed on the remaining schools, is neater looking in every respect, much more difficult for the children to damage, and in this damp cold climate will be a much warmer siding.\n\nAlso, in spite of what is commonly said, - it looks as if after all in a year or two we shall have to paint the asbestos shingles, and they appear already to be darkening up, and also show dirt marks easily.\n\nLt.-Col. E.P. Randle,\nEPR/MH\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n| No. of Pkgs | ARTICLES AND MARKS | WEIGHT | RATE | FREIGHT | ADVANCES | PREPAID | COLLECT |\n|------------|--------------------|--------|------|---------|----------|---------|---------|\n|            | BOX BOOKS          | 4 CU FT | 100  | 600     | 60       | 10      | 05      |\n|            |                    |        |      | HDG     |          |         |         |\n|            |                    |        |      | CR      |          |         |         |\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6384, File 800-5, part 4)\nPainting, electrical work and necessary plumbing will be a factor but the estimated cost of this is not excessive under present costs. It is proposed to install water in all buildings and cess pits as a temporary measure to handle drainage water. All buildings are to be painted inside and out.\n\nBulldozer costs have been much in excess of original estimate. Some of this was due to work instructed to be done when Mr. McClure was at Port Hardy.\n\nThe buildings at Alert Bay school will be finished to a greater extent than covered by the original estimate in that they will be completely repainted, floor covering will be supplied on school floors, electrical outlets will be installed as well as water and temporary drainage. The roofing is of double construction consisting of a sheathing overlaid with asphalt shingle. The walls will have a heavy saturated paper inside outer cedar covering and a dry paper sheathing outside inside walls. New paper will be laid between the two floors. Concrete footing for the treated cedar posts have been installed. The result will be a first class building which will have a life of many years.\n\nWhile the present estimated cost of the Alert Bay school and residences will be very much above original estimate, they will still be actually much below ordinary present day costs. The school and teachers' residences have a floor area of approximately 844.8 square feet so that on the present estimate of $15,000 the cost will be $1.77 per square foot. Considering height as 10 feet (floor to ceiling) the cost per cubic foot is only 17.7 cents.\n\nIn addition to the four room school and two teachers' residences under construction at Alert Bay other work as follows has been carried out:\n\nGeneral costs chargeable to all work has amounted to $553.61 divided into supervision and expenses, $214.49; Camp equipment, $37.04; Tools, $276.28, and Miscellaneous, $25.80. This amount will be divided between the several jobs on completion.\n\nOn the Alert Bay Agency storeroom, etc., the sum of $586.84 has been spent broken down as follows: Supervision and expenses, $86.61; Labour, $332.48; Trucking, $75.00; Roofing, $31.39, Sheathing, $13.41, and miscellaneous, $47.95. At present the stores for this building are at Alert Bay and other charges will be for barge, labour, wiring and painting. The total cost of this project should be under $2000.00.\n\nThe Campbell River teachers' residence site has been looked over and some work in connection with preparation for this and other buildings made. Costs to date have been $132.81 make up of Supervision and expenses, $68.00; Sheathing, $6.72, and Miscellaneous supplies, $58.09.\n\nC.E. Webb\nDistrict Chief Engineer\n\nc.c.

MacKay, Esq., Indian Commissioner, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Buildings - Port Hardy Military Camp\n\nCosts to end of August indicate that our estimate of June 27, 1947, as to expenses of moving buildings to other points on the B.C. coast and erecting them as schools, teachers' residences, etc., was seriously in error.\n\nProportion of costs of labour, material and supervision shows that the Alert Bay four-room school and two town-hall residences has been approximately $5745.00 to date and to complete the two residences now erected and to erect and complete the school will cost approximately a further amount of approximately $9655.00, or a total of $15,000.00. See attached appendix I.\n\nIn analysing the costs shown in Appendix I it will be seen supervision will be about 15% of total cost.\n\nLabour costs have been much in excess of the original estimate due to bad weather, difficulty in securing and keeping efficient carpenters and other labour, and also due to the fact that buildings were nailed in excess of expectations. Owing to the numerous nails in the floors it was finally necessary to give up the plan to cut them in sections and to pull them up. Original estimates for labour costs were based on information secured in Vancouver to effect that a crew of five men could assemble a 60-foot hut in one day. Actually it has been found that it takes a perfect crew of six men at least a week to do this. Erection time was also in error as instead of ten man days per 60-foot hut it takes several times that number of man days.\n\nTrucking charges have been above estimate due in part to fact that labour crew was not large enough to load and unload without some loss in time.\n\nBarge costs to date have exceeded estimate but with experience gained future charges should be lower per trip.\n\nRoofing costs will be above original estimate due in part to non-delivery of materials when promised and the construction of a better roof than originally contemplated.\n\nDue to condition of much of floor, it was necessary to secure a floor covering which will cost slightly above original estimate.\n\nNails and all other materials have cost much more than estimated due in part to necessity of paying excess costs to secure delivery.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Port Hardy Military Camp\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of July 10th and memorandum from the Surveys and Engineering Branch with respect to the cost of utilizing certain buildings at the above Camp for school purposes, I am enclosing Mr. C. E. Webb's letter of September 11th and analysis of costs to date.\n\nYou will note that the four-room school at Alert Bay with two teachers' residences is now estimated to cost approximately $15,000. Factors contributing toward the increase in costs are outlined in Mr. Webb's letter. The estimate of costs is still within the funds available and the utilization of these buildings, even at the higher costs, will economically provide our school building requirements in the Kwawkewlth Agency.\n\nD.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 28th instant, file 6-11-3 with reference to the erection of buildings at the Alert Bay Bay School as a result of securing camp buildings from Port Hardy Military Camp.\n\nWe note that the cost at Alert Bay will amount to approximately $25,000, and arrangements will be made to forward you an additional accountable cheque for $5,000.00.\n\nAs mentioned in our letter, the cost of the buildings at Alert Bay will be considerably more than the original estimate. However, the main fact to keep in mind is our letter of October 4th, 1947 in which you were advised of the total amount allotted for new buildings in British Columbia this year. The total mentioned in that letter cannot be exceeded but outside of that feature, we are quite prepared to be guided by any recommendations that you make.\n\nI might add that we have submitted the contents of your letter of October 14th regarding Altatla to the Deputy Minister. We have not yet received his reply but when this reaches us we will communicate with you immediately.\n\nBernard L. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter dated Oct. 22nd from the local office of the Surveys and Engineering Branch reporting on the progress made in the conversion of Port Hardy Military camp buildings for school purposes. You will note that the cost of the work to date is $14,289.50 for which we have one 48' teacher's residence practically completed; one 60' teacher's residence partly completed; and one wing of the classroom building almost completed.\n\nWhile it is regretted that this project has not progressed to the stage anticipated and the cost to date has been so much in excess of the original estimate, these are due to circumstances beyond our control and we have no alternative but to proceed with the project. I have discussed the matter at some length with the Surveys and Engineering Branch and have agreed that it would seem preferable to immediately complete the 48' teacher's residence and two school rooms with the present labour crew, following which their services would be dispensed with and the project carried on to completion with local labour.\n\nThe approximate cost of the Alert Bay School project alone now is $25,000, part of which amount, however, would be chargeable to the funds appropriated for the construction of an Agency storeroom. Of the accountable advances received to cover labour costs we now have a balance of $700 which will be insufficient to meet all labour costs during the period October 16th to 31st, in view of which I would ask that a further advance of $5000 be forwarded to this office at the earliest possible date.\n\nFor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nD. M. MacKay, Esq., Indian Commissioner, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Four Room School and Teachers' Residences - Alert Bay\n\nFurther to my letter of September 11, Mr. Whyte visited the above project on October 18th and advises that he is not all satisfied with the work accomplished in the past five weeks. In discussing the matter with Mr. McClure he was advised that weather conditions (confirmed from other sources) had been adverse and that the labour is not very satisfactory despite the high wages which we have had to pay.\n\nA summation of expenditures for which accounts have been submitted, including payrolls, to October 19th shows cost of work to that date as $14,239.50. Other commitments will bring the total expended to at least $15,000.00 for which we have one 48 ft. teachers' residence practically completed less plumbing and second outside coat of paint and trim and some minor work, one 60 ft. teachers' residence erected but top floor not laid and partitions not erected, and one wing of school erected but final roof not laid, partitions and interior not completed.\n\nUnder present conditions I have no lead how long it will take to complete the work at present under way but with favourable weather, it might be possible to have 48 foot residence and two school rooms ready by end of this month at a possible additional cost of $5,000.00.\n\nIt must be pointed out that practically all supplies for the whole job are on the ground and the end of the work at Alert Bay is in sight, although probably costs may run to a further $5,000.00. This would include the store-room at the Agency Office.\nThere seems to be three alternatives:\n\n1st - To carry on work to completion with present crew.\n\n2nd - To complete 48 ft. residence and 2 school rooms with present crew and then close down for balance of this fiscal year.\n\n3rd - To complete 48 ft. residence and 2 school rooms with present crew and then organize crew of local labour and carry on to completion.\n\nWhich of these alternatives is decided on will, of course, depend on funds made available. If there are funds still available, I would suggest that alternative 3 be followed. The cost of completion should be less as after the fishing season is over (October 31) it is stated there is a good supply of first-class local labour available at local pay rates or less than we are paying now. With better skilled labour and lower labour costs, it is reasonable to suppose we could complete the work for much less than the total of $25,000.00 now apparently required to complete all work at Alert Bay. It must, however, be pointed out that the necessary labour might not be found to carry out proposal 3 expeditiously but it is believed that it would be worth while taking that chance. As a further alternative we could well contract certain portions of the job to local men, white or Indian, advantageously.\n\nIn conclusion, I may say that Mr. Whyte considers that Mr. McClure has done as well as possible under the circumstances but has been up against a most difficult problem from the first with the labour which it has been possible to secure. Actually we had to take any which offered and with high wages in the lumber camps and fishing industry in Alert Bay area, the class of labour we obtained was naturally much below standard, and the same applies to the labour we were able to recruit in Vancouver for work up there.\n\nC.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have for acknowledgment your letter of September 16th enclosing memorandum from the Surveys and Engineering Branch with reference to utilizing certain buildings at the Fort Hardy Military Camp.\n\nWe also received your letter of September 4th recommending an expenditure of $4,050 in order to purchase a loxstave building and move same to the Kitkatla Reserve for school purposes.\n\nIn our letter of July 10th you were advised that an amount of $26,000 had been allotted for utilization of the buildings at the Fort Hardy Camp and at that time we forwarded to you a copy of our memorandum of June 30th with reference to the schools that we were informed could be erected from the materials salvaged from Fort Hardy. Attached is a statement indicating the situation as we see it now.\n\nYou will note that we have actually allotted an amount of $47,500, and in view of the increased cost at Alert Bay over the amount estimated, we are inclined to feel that the estimated expenditure at the other proposed schools will be over the original estimate.\n\nWith the above in mind we have hesitated authorizing the purchase and moving of the loxstave building.\n\nIt is possible that you do not propose to build all the buildings mentioned in the attached statement. If so, and if there is an amount of $4,050 available from the total mentioned on our statement, we have no objection to you proceeding with the Kitkatla project.\nThe point to be kept in mind is that the total expenditure that we can allow for the erection of new day schools in British Columbia during the current fiscal year is $47,500.\n\nBernard P. Neary\nDept. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\n\nEncl.\nK. P. McClure, Esq., c/o Nimkish Hotel, Alert Bay, B. C.\n\nRE: Alert Bay Day School and Teachers' Residences.\n\nOn Mr. Whyte's return he discussed the above project with Mr. Coleman, Inspector of Indian Agencies, in the absence of the Indian Commissioner. It was decided that we will proceed with the work in hand as follows:\n\n(1) Complete 48 ft. residence ready for occupancy. This includes painting floors and any other necessary interior trim, and placing kitchen sink with drain to temporary sump pit outdoors. No further outside painting will be done and plumbing will not be installed other than sink mentioned above. Complete skirting about building. Construct temporary outhouse at edge of terrace and about midway between the 48 and 60 ft. buildings so it could be used for either.\n\n(2) Complete floor, walls, ceiling and partitions in school wing (2 rooms) now erected. Put on Durold roofing and paint interior. Construct a second temporary outhouse at opposite end of lot from one installed at present.\n\nIt is desired this work should be cleaned up at once so two teacher residence (48 ft.) and two school rooms can be put in use at earliest possible date.\n\nMen now employed are to be laid off as soon as they can be spared from work.\n\nIt is possible further funds may be provided at a later date to do certain additional work and if so it is considered we may be able to engage local men, white or Indians, to carry on at local labour rates without paying board. You might consider this factor and advise in connection therewith.\n\nWork on the teachers' residence and Campbell River is likely to be proceeded with using local labour as far as possible. You will be advised regarding this at an early date.\n\n\"C. E. Webb\"\nDistrict Chief Engineer\nPer \"G. W. Whyte\"\nAlert Bay, B. C.,\nOctober 28th, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThe attached copy of letter forwarded me from the Commissioner's Office by Inspector Coleman in the absence of Commissioner MacKay, will create such a serious situation if the orders are carried out that I felt I should immediately place this whole matter before you for your personal attention, and as there are some pertinent things responsible for this situation, which you should be fully aware of, I am taking the liberty of writing you a strictly confidential letter.\n\nIt is my understanding the reason given for not completing the construction of Alert Bay Indian Day School and Teachergages, which the Surveys and Engineering Branch have been working on for the past four months, is due to the fact that the estimated appropriation is expended. First let me say I feel very sorry for Col. G. W. Whyte, Assistant Director, Chief Engineer, Surveys and Engineering Branch, who is in charge of this project, as I consider the Superintendent of Construction under him has let his men down badly - indeed, so much so that it must be extremely embarrassing to Col. Whyte. Mr. McClure, the Superintendent in charge, is an old Army acquaintance of Col Whyte's and served under him Overseas in the last war. I know for a fact that Col. Whyte is terribly disappointed in the results of four months' efforts in dismantling Army Camp buildings at Fort Rupert and rebuilding them into a four-room school and teachergages at Alert Bay.\n\nThe first month that McClure was on the job he seemed to make good progress. Then suddenly a French lady arrived here by plane from Paris, France. Her arrival appeared totally unexpected by Mr. McClure. A month later he introduced me to her as his wife. Since then she has lived in a hotel room with him and followed him around no matter where he went. I believe her presence has been a great handicap to him in his work as he seems to spend all his time with her in the hotel room and thus is very seldom on the job supervising his men or the work at hand.\n\nThe principal of our new Alert Bay four-room Indian Day School has just arrived with her furniture and wishes to take up residence in one of the teachergages. I went to look for Mr. McClure this morning at the school buildings under construction and was told by the men he was not there. I then went to the hotel about a mile and a quarter from the job and found him still in bed at 10:45 in the morning. He promised to come and see me at the office this afternoon but failed to do so.\n\nI have watched his carryings-on for three months but felt it was not my business to interfere with another Department when they had been charged with the responsibilities of building this school. I do, however, feel, in view of the contents of the attached letter, that it is now my duty as well as other officials of the Indian Affairs Branch to give some direction and see that this school and teachergages are completed as originally planned. It appears to me that it is only a question of money that has caused Col. Whyte to recommend the work stopped, leaving this school and teachergages in a half-finished condition.\n\np.t.o.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 634, File 800-5, part 4)\nIn order that you will get a complete picture I think it is best that I should give you a complete report as to the actual conditions and what we are up against. At the present time one 48' teachersage is practically completed and the principal could move in tomorrow if the plumbing was installed. All the plumbing fixtures are laying in the building ready to be installed. The other teachersage is about two-thirds completed. Two rooms of the four-room school are pretty well completed. The foundations are in for the rest of the classrooms, lavatories, assembly room, furnace room and teachers' office. All the building material to complete the entire school is here on the grounds, eleven having been transferred from the Alert Bay Camp or purchased from wholesalers. It is stacked around the school yard, some of it covered up by tarps while the rest is laying unprotected in the rain. Two or three weeks more work would complete the shell of the school and all that would remain then is the inside finishings, plumbing and sewerage. If it is left as it is, half of this lumber and supplies will be stolen or ruined by weather.\n\nOur teachers are refusing to move into a teachersage where there is no plumbing or water. Arrangements were made whereby we could run a line from the Residential School water supply to the Day School, which is only a matter of a few hundred feet; or they could hook onto the Church supply which is about five or six hundred feet away.\n\nI can understand that these buildings have cost more than the original estimate, the way it has been carried on. Anytime you dismantle a building whereby you take the boards down, piece by piece, remove the nails, bundle the lumber for shipment, as has been done in this case, it is bound to run into a lot of money. Nevertheless, the work that has been done so far is good and when this school and teachersages are completed we will have a well-built structure that will last for twenty-five or thirty years, if given ordinary care. There is nothing wrong with the construction work so far - it is just that it has cost more money than it should.\n\nAt the present time the organization is complete, the material on the ground and labour employed which could complete this school and teachersages in a very short time if allowed to continue. In my opinion, irrespective of cost, the work on these buildings should be continued and no let-up until the whole project is completed in every detail. To stop work now means setting up a new organization which takes time and costs money. Our materials laying around the school grounds, particularly 3-way, will deteriorate when exposed to weather, and there is no place to store them. Our Department are going to sustain a serious loss if we allow this work to be discontinued now. There should be no let-up but rather instructions go out insisting that the work be speeded up here, and that not only the Alert Bay Schools and Teachersages be completed but the Campbell River Teachersage, Cape Mudge School and Turnour Island School and Teachersage should also be got under way at the earliest possible date. While it is true we have had some real bad weather of late; nevertheless, the men can work inside on bad days and on the exterior of the buildings in the good weather.\n\nThe Surveys and Engineering Branch promised they would have the principal's teachersage completed by September 1st so that we would have a place for our teachers to live. One teacher was able to get a room in an attic of a private home and has been living there and eating at restaurants. We could find no place for another teacher and so we have only been able to open one classroom, and this classroom accommodating grades 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, has\nbeen on a half-day system, part of the grades coming in the morning and the other half in the afternoon.\n\nOver fifty children in the junior room have not been attending school as we had no accommodation for them which they could not open the classroom. The Indian parents and the Native Brotherhood in particular are getting very much upset at these children walking the streets of Alert Bay waiting for this new school to be completed. To me it is a tragedy and it is up to the Indian Affairs Branch to insist that the Surveys and Engineering Branch complete the Alert Bay Indian Day School and Teachergate at as early a date as possible, and that we provide whatever money is necessary to do so. As stated before there is a great deal of work stacked on the Alert Bay side to complete the construction of the school and teachergate including plumbing, electric wiring and sewers etc. Sufficient labour is available and it seems the height of folly to stop in the middle of the building program for the want of a few more dollars to complete the job.\n\nI am sending this letter Airmail and would kindly ask you to give it your personal attention. Our Branch will lay ourselves open to the utmost criticism if we do not complete this school and get these children in the classroom and off the streets; and our teachers will not move into a building where there are no ordinary conveniences. We must complete this one teachergate by immediate installation of all plumbing, as the principal is here with her furniture and ready to move in but cannot do so without water in the building.\n\nMajor Davey, School Inspector, and myself have been laying plans to open the new school on January 5th, 1948. We had hoped that the whole project would be completed and ready for occupancy. It was my plan to move the present two classrooms and our present equipment into the new school during the Christmas holidays. Major Davey has the teachers employed to start the four classrooms at the beginning of the new year. All these plans will go by the boards if the Surveys and Engineering Branch are permitted to stop the work now, and the children will lose the better part of a school year.\n\nI have written you at some length so that you will have the whole picture before you. As far as I am aware it is just a question of funds. It is my understanding the estimated appropriation has been expended and that is the reason why the engineers are closing down construction work.\n\nImmediate action is necessary as I understand it is the engineers' intention to close down the whole project in the course of the next few days, and if this is permitted to take place it means our schools will all be closed down in Alert Bay, as our teachers are going to resign. They are insisting that the Department give them reasonable accommodation, and do not intend to live in a building where there is no water or ordinary conveniences. If there is anything I can do to assist I shall be very glad to do so. I only wish my health was such so that I could take a more active part.\n\nIt must not be overlooked that the expenses contracted to date are not all chargeable to the Alert Bay Indian Day School. The teachergate for the Campbell River Indian Day School is all dismantled, bundled and on the dock at Fort Rupert ready to be shipped to Campbell River. Material for the Agency warehouse is on the site here ready for construction. I do not know how the Superintendent of Construction is handling matters insofar as\n\np.t.o.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6384, File 800-5, part 4)\ncharging costs against various votes but I am satisfied this picture is not as black as it might appear. I also believe the engineers are looking for an excuse to shut down construction work during the winter months. Out here on the coast the weather is mild and construction never ceases from one end of the year to the other, and in our case there is sufficient work to permit the men to work inside on bad days and to work outside on good days; so there is no hold-up or any extra cost incurred.\n\nWord has got out that the engineers are closing down work on this school and the Indians are extremely upset and others very much disgusted. It is up to us to see this entire project completed properly at the earliest possible date.\n\nEnc. 1,\n\nMr. R. A.

(RG 10, Volume 6384, File 800-5, part 4)\nEditorial.\n\nWe are very pleased that the first edition of our paper gained so many favourable comments, and further that our effort should have been mentioned at a meeting of the Alert Bay & District Board of Trade. There is no news-sheet in Alert Bay, and an advertisement was sent to the Board of Trade for display, together with the sum of $1.00. This has been given to us and will help pay for the cost of stencils for our paper. This advertisement is set out in the notices. Perhaps one of these days as we improve we may be able to ask for paid advertising.\n\nAnother landmark has left Alert Bay. The totem pole which stood for so many years outside the Drabble house has been sold to the University of British Columbia.\n\nJUNIOR ROOM. We welcome Mrs. Scanlon as our teacher in the Junior Room which opens on 3 November. She is not a stranger to us nor to our parents as she was teaching for several years at the Regional School. Everyone is glad that this room has been opened for the children will go to school all day. We are glad that they are off the streets. If only the new buildings were finished more children would be off the streets. The housing shortage in this village is awful and we think Mrs. Scanlon a sport to come here and put up with the discomforts she is doing. We thank her for this. She thinks of the children before herself.\n\nNEW SCHOOL. For many months now we have all been waiting patiently for the new school to be opened. We now hear that the men who are working on the building will not be able to continue with the work. It is a shame to hear this. We sometimes wonder how our teachers can teach without proper equipment, or how they can manage all of us alone when we are so crowded. Amazing things these teachers can do. We know it is hard on them. It will be a disgrace if they stop the work now when they have gone so far, and we hope it will be possible for them to keep on working until it is finished.\n\nTHANKSGIVING DAY. On the Friday before Thanksgiving Day we all drew pictures to represent our thanksgiving. Some pupils drew pictures of people at table giving thanks to God for the good things to eat. Many of the drawings were very good. We liked it very much. Some of us went to Church. Some of the people decorated their houses and invited others in to eat with them.\n\nGEORGE LUTHER. We appreciate the work George Luther has done. As all of you older people in this village know he was one of the first teachers in Alert Bay. We are very sorry to hear that he is quite sick in the Hospital and that he has been suffering for a long time. We thought it would make him happy if we put a few lines about him in our little paper. He is a good man for all that he has done in this village among his Indian people. Let your some of our boys sang in his choir. This year he should go to sing to him.\n\nHALLOWEEN. Before Hallowe'en we made decorations, cats, masks, paper chains, witches and baskets. These baskets were filled by the senior girls with good things to eat. On the afternoon of Hallowe'en we had a party and played many games. Mrs. Scanlon was invited to our place so that she could meet us all. After the games the children were given the decorations which had apples, candy, peanuts and other things in them. We thanked Miss Lucas for giving us the party and everyone said they had a wonderful time. We are sure they enjoyed the party too. After supper we went out to hunt for ghosts, go to houses or rowboats, and nobody got hurt.\nBUS STOP. What a strange sign to see in Alert Bay! Yet there are twenty of them between the Residential School and Skinner's Corner. Yes! we have a regular bus service. Fare 10\u00a2. The bus runs every day except Monday. Some of the pupils come to school by bus, and it is very nice of Mr. Dalgarno to stop at the school door on wet days. This is a novelty to the children and on the first day some were late at school because they were joy-riding and did not get off the bus when they should have done. All the children have been warned about riding on the back of the bus. Two young boys were doing this between 11:30 and 11:45 p.m. on Saturday night. This is a very DANGEROUS thing to do. We would ask the parents to remind their children about this, otherwise we may have a serious and perhaps FATAL accident. These young boys should not have been on the street at that hour without their parents.\n\nWEDDING NEWS. Lena Mary Alfred, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Kasas Alfred was married to Thomas Leon Brown, son of Mr. Harry Brown, on 24th October at Christ Church, Alert Bay, by Rev. Canon Hatfield. The bride wore a lovely white dress and looked beautiful. She was attended by three bridesmaids, Kitty Beams, Elsie Abraham and Jessie Alfred who wore dresses in pastel shades. Shirley Alfred was flower girl. A reception was held at 9 p.m. in the Parish Hall which was attended by many friends. On 21 October, Mrs. Dora Alfred gave a shower for the bride at which she received many useful gifts for her new home.\n\nITS AN ILL WIND THAT BLOWS NOBODY ANY GOOD. For months we had an old stove at our school. It smoked and smoked and smoked, and sometimes it was so bad we had tears rolling down our cheeks and we used to go home until it had stopped smoking. This year when we started school our stove was even worse than last year. Nothing was done about it as we were supposed to be going to go into the new school. But one Monday when we came to school we found that a storm had blown our chimney down. How we hoped we were now going to get a new stove! Well, up went something new. Yes! new pipes! But we got another old stove, little better than what we once had. It was missing one leg and when it was put in the school three brick were put under this leg to hold up the stove. However, the smoke is not quite so bad; it only smokes occasionally! On Wednesday another leg fell off the stove, so we have had to prop this side up now. In the Junior Room the same day, the front fell off the stove!\n\n(Teachers Note - Who wouldn't teach in an Indian School? Don't we have fun!)\n\nNOTICES.

MacKay, Esq., Indian Commissioner, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Day School - Alert Bay\n\nI am today in receipt of advice that the two classrooms in the west wing of the above school are now ready for occupancy.\n\nAt the present time it will be necessary to have the pupils hang their coats in the classrooms and if immediate occupancy is desired clothes racks can be knocked up pending the completion of the connecting hall between the west and east wing. It is hoped to have this portion of the building while not completed in shape to hang clothing in it during school hours by the end of the month.\n\nNo doubt some shelving and possibly cupboards may be needed in the classrooms. There are about three sets of suitable shelves for schools at Port Hardy which can be moved to Alert Bay but few if any of the cupboards salvaged at the Port Hardy camp are suitable for re-erection and new ones will have to be built as desired.\n\nShould it be desired to have a carpenter install desks, etc. in the classrooms please advise and I will instruct Mr. McClure to detail a man to do this.\n\nG.E. Webb\nDistrict Chief Engineer\n\nc.c. Mr. McClure (Letter in duplicate)\n744 W. Hastings St.,\nVancouver, B.C.,\n2nd December, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Alert Bay Indian Day School\n\nThis will acknowledge your letter of December 1 re\nthe above project. The accompanying memorandum in\nduplicate by Mr. G.H. Whyte dated November 27, 1947, which\nhas just been completed would appear to give the information\nrequested as to condition of the work at time of his\ninspection of November 16 to 19.\n\nWe have been today advised that the west school room\nwing (2 class rooms each 42 x 24 ft.) has been completed\nand is now ready to move in furniture. It is probable some\nshelving or cupboard space may be needed and if so this\nwill be installed as requested.\n\nIn addition to completion of the west wing we have\nbeen advised that the east wing has been erected and the\nroof shingled. The interior walls are being installed at\npresent. In addition progress is being made on the\nconnecting wings of the school and these should be erected\nin the next two weeks and the connecting hall ready for use\nby the end of the month.\n\nOwing to the slow progress that has been made to date\non this project and the fact that there does not appear to\nbe much hope of making much better progress in future and\nat the same time keeping costs down, we are unable to state\nwhen this project will be completed but hope it will be\nfinished before March 31st.\n\nMemo. in duplicate\n\n(Letter in duplicate)\n\nC. E. Webb,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\nDecember 12, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Director,\nLands and Development Services Branch.\n\nRe: Buildings at Fort Hardy being demolished and transferred to Alert Bay for construction of buildings at Alert Bay.\n\nI do not believe that we have received any report from your Branch as to how this matter stands although a great deal of work has been accomplished under the direction of Mr. Whyte of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau. Would it be possible for you to furnish a report at a fairly early date.\n\nMost of the material I believe is being used in the construction of school buildings but we did encumber $1200.00 and send to you a copy of the Encumbrance Requisition under the Agency Vote. This was for the construction of a warehouse and possibly an office. I should be pleased to be brought up to date on this matter. If Col. Whyte has not reported perhaps it would be possible to secure a report from him and forward it to me.\n\nWe are also particularly anxious to know whether any of the Fort Hardy buildings are being set aside for the building of an office. From a report from Indian Agent Todd, addressed to Dr. P.B. Tennant, of the Indian Health Services, it would appear that there is some difference of opinion between Mr. Whyte and the Indian Agent as to where the office should be located. The Indian Agent apparently thinks that the office could be erected between the present office and a vacant lot. Mr. Whyte apparently believes that the office should be built on the vacant lot. If this decision is arrived at, the Indian Agent states that there will not be room for any medical buildings.\n\nThe Encumbrance Requisition for $1200.00 to which I refer is dated July 30th, and the number of it is 935. It sets aside $1200.00 for\nthe purpose of providing a storage building by using materials from the Fort Hardy Military Camp. I am wondering just what progress has been made, particularly in this connection.\n\nDirector\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6384, File 800-5, part 4)\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, December 8, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 3rd instant, file 6-11-3, reporting on the progress made in connection with the Alert Bay Indian day school construction. We note that recently progress has been slow but we hope that the work will progress more quickly and that the buildings at Alert Bay will be completed before the end of March.\n\nWe presume that no progress has been made on the other buildings which it was understood would be erected this year. In this connection I refer you to the list forwarded with my communication of October 4th. As just intimated, we were under the impression that the other buildings would be completed this year and consequently have not made any provision for them in the appropriation for the year 1948-49. If we are correct in this assumption it will mean proceeding with the unfinished buildings next year and this would involve using funds which we hope could be used for new projects.\n\nWe would also like to know why it was apparently considered necessary to provide one building as living accommodation for two teachers and a second building to provide similar accommodation for four teachers.\n\nColonel Whyte's report which you forwarded is enclosed.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nFollowing receipt of Mr. Neary's letter of November 25th the Surveys and Engineering Branch was requested to report on the progress made in connection with the Alert Bay Indian Day School construction and the work necessary to prepare the school for occupancy.\n\nCopies of Mr. C.E. Webb's letters of December 2nd in this connection are enclosed, together with a memorandum dated November 27th from Mr. G.H. Whyte.\n\nWhile it is regretted that the cost of this project has been greatly in excess of the estimate and while considerable less progress has been made to date than was anticipated for the reasons set out in Mr. Whyte's report you will note from his summary that from now on with a reasonable labour force and favourable weather more satisfactory progress should be seen than has been apparent to date, but at the same time the Engineering Branch has made no definite commitment with respect to completion of the project prior to March 31st. In the absence of any further information to the contrary it is presumed that the Engineering Branch's recent estimate of the cost, $25,000 still stands. It is thought that the Department can secure a copy of Col. Whyte's report from the Surveys and Engineering Branch, Ottawa, in which case I should appreciate the return of the report enclosed.\n\nD.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: School Construction - Commonwealth Agency\n\nThis will acknowledge your letter of 18 December 1947 re the above question.\n\nAt present we have under construction the teacher's residence at Campbell River. This we hope to complete by the latter part of January. The cost of this building less plumbing and furnishings will be approximately $2500.\n\nWe are arranging to proceed with a combined one classroom school and one teachers' quarters at Turnour Island about the latter part of January. It is expected we will have it completed by the end of February using Indian labour which Mr. L.J. Todd advised us would be available as soon as we had a contract to supervise. While we haven't yet seen the site or made final arrangements to transport material it is contemplated cost will be approximately $4500.\n\nAt the same time we will arrange to start work at Cone Mudge on the two classroom school using the men now employed at Campbell River. This school should be finished in March at an estimated cost of $7500.\n\nArrangements will also be put under way to construct a combined one classroom and one teacher residence at Village Island, and while we hope to complete by the end of March this will depend on what arrangements can be made to secure local labour or to board imported labour, also the availability of such labour. If the whole job cannot be completed we should be able to have materials delivered to site before the end of March so that if necessary work could proceed when it is possible to put labour under canvas. The estimated cost of this building would be approximately $3500.\n\nIt is assumed work at Gilford Island is dependent on decision as to site. We will, however, arrange to have material ready to transport there before the end of March. This combined one class room and one teacher residence can be dismantled and made ready to ship for an estimated cost of $3000. If desired all new material could be delivered to Alert Bay by March 31 for a further $1500. This would only leave cost of transportation to Gilford Island and erection to be paid next fiscal year, and this should not exceed a further $6500.\n\nIn connection with all the schools it will be desirable to paint exteriors in the next dry season and with this in view it would be well to secure the necessary paint before March 31st. Unless otherwise instructed this will be done.\n\n\"C.E. Webb\"\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\nJanuary 16, 1948\n\nC. E. Webb, Esq., Dominion Water & Power Bureau, Pacific Building, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: School Construction - Kwakwaka'wakw Agency\n\nI have your letter of January 9th outlining the work which you anticipate can be completed prior to March 31st. As you are aware, the total appropriation for school construction in B.C. during this fiscal year is $47,500, against which amount we have made the following commitments:\n\n1. Kitkatla School-Skeena River Agency - approximately $4500\n2. Nanaimo Indian Bay School-Cowichan Agency - additional classroom - approximately $1000\n\nTotal ........ $5500\n\nPresuming that your previous estimate of the cost of school construction at Alert Bay still stands at $25,000, the position with respect to possible expenditures by March 31st would appear to be:\n\nCommitments by this office ........................................... $5500\nAlert Bay School ......................................................... $25,000\nCampbell River Teacherage .............................................. $2500\nCape Mudge two classroom school .................................... $7960\nTurnour Island School and teacherage ................................ $5430\nVillage Island - one classroom and one teacher's residence .......... $5500\n\nTotal ......... $52,190\nYou will note that apart from any expenditures made in connection with the proposed school at Gilford Island if the work outlined above is completed the expenditure will be in excess of our appropriation. It would be appreciated therefore if you would keep in close touch with construction costs to ensure that the total expenditure prior to March 31st does not exceed $47,500.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDominion Water and Power Bureau\nMines, Forests and Scientific Services.\n\nDepartment of Mines\nand Resources\n\n744 W. Hastings St.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nJanuary 28, 1946.\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq., Indian Commissioner,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: School Construction\nKwakwaka'wakw Agency\n\nThis will acknowledge your letter of January 15 re\nthe above matter.\n\nWe have checked over expenditures for which we have\naccounts to date and find them to be approximately as follows:\n\nSchool & Residence Alert Bay - $65,035.99\nCobweb River Residence - $1,199.56\nOther Schools - $299.25\n\nTotal schools - $66,498.81\n\nAgency building Alert Bay - $1,199.56\n\nGeneral costs - chiefly tools\nand equipment - $544.95\n\nTotal expenditures Alert Bay\nProject to this date - $68,193.32\n\nThe above figures are not in exact agreement with our\nAccountant's records but are those which Mr. White has kept and\ninclude certain items paid by your office. Possibly certain other items\nhave also been paid by you which are not included but these are not\nlikely to be extensive if they only include blackboards, etc., but\nnot furniture.\n\nIt is expected that construction expenditures in connection\nwith Alert Bay school have exceeded figure shown above by at least\n$1,000. In January and cost of furnishings such as cupboards and\nlinoleum which have been authorized will further add to costs of this\nproject.\n\nWe can easily spend a great deal more in the Alert Bay\nschool to advantage, but it is considered that this might well be\nlimited for present and additional work be carried out by contract\nas funds become available.\n\nAs soon as labour costs to date are received we will submit\na further summary of expenditures in connection with this project and\nestimates to complete.\n\n\"J.W. Webb\"\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of December 8th regarding the school construction program in the Kwekwelth Agency, I am enclosing for your information a copy of Mr. C.F. Webb's letter of January 9th, a copy of my reply thereto and copy of subsequent letter from the Mines, Forests and Scientific Services Branch dated January 22nd. Further construction has been proceeded with since these letters were written but in any event the total expenditure will not be permitted to exceed $47,500, including commitments made by this office at Kitkatla and Nenaimo prior to March 31st and a further report on progress will be submitted at a later date.\n\nWith regard to your inquiry as to why it was necessary to provide one building as living accommodation for two teachers and a second building to provide accommodation for four teachers, I would advise that we have in mind the eventual employment of a manual training instructor to this school in addition to the four classroom teachers and in view of the size of the school will likely have to employ a caretaker. Also it is probable that one or more of the teaching staff will be married which will necessitate the provision of accommodation for one or more married couples.\n\nI may say that the two buildings are not the same size, one being 40' in length and the other 60'.\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.S.

The cost of the Nlakatla Indian Day School and the second classroom at the Nanaimo Indian Day School will also be met from the $47,500 appropriation although work at these latter schools was not carried out under the supervision of Mr. Webb's office.\n\nMy object in writing now is to find out on what date the Department will require an accounting of the funds advanced to meet labour costs in connection with this construction program as information received from Mr. Webb's office indicates that in order to complete the construction at Turnour Island it may be necessary to continue the work during the first week in April. Apart from this there is an unavoidable delay between the time paysheets are prepared on the job and the time they are received at this office, with the result that it might be towards the end of the first week in April before we receive the necessary information in this office on which to issue cheques covering labour costs during the period March 16th to 31st.\n\nIt would be appreciated, therefore, if you would advise:\n\n(1). The latest date on which an accounting of advances received for school construction labour costs must be made.\n(c) Whether it will be permissible for the work to continue during the first week or ten days in April, if necessary, in order to complete the Turnour Island school.\n\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, March 12, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S.

Scanlon to do certain repair work at the Alert Bay Day School.\n\nAs far as I can see, the only way we can handle the matter is to send an advance to the Indian Agent so that he can pay Mr. Scanlon as a day laborer. If we set his salary at $150.00 a month, present regulations consider this at the rate of $1,800.00 a year and consequently we would be obliged to have a position established by the Civil Service Commission.\n\nHowever, if he is employed on a daily basis at approximately the same rate as suggested by you, we can handle the matter.\n\nIn view of your recommendation we are arranging to forward an accountable cheque to Indian Agent Todd for $750.00. We are inclined to feel that the work should be completed in less time than mentioned in your letter. As you are aware, the expenditure in erecting the Alert Bay buildings has been rather high and no funds for new buildings at Alert Bay have been provided in the current year's appropriation and any money we expend will have to be taken from our allotment for Repairs and Improvements. We, therefore, hope that it will not be necessary to expend the full $750.00.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\nExtract from requisition dated April 30th, 1948, from the Teacher of the Alert Bay Day School.\n\nThe teacher requests:\n\n- 4 Classroom thermometers,\n- 6 Paint brushes 1\"\n- 2 Hammers\n- 8 doz.

C., Department of Mines and Resources,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nRE: ALERT BAY INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nFurther to my letter of June 19th last in respect to the heating of this school, I wish to give you more particulars as to the manner in which the engineers left that portion of the building where no provision was made for heating. There is no chimney built in the Assembly Room; therefore, we cannot set up a stove. In addition no chimneys were built in the portion of the building where the plumbing is installed, which includes teachers' office, wash room, store room, etc., and there is no room in this portion of the building to set up a stove.\n\nI am afraid if we wait for the Surveys and Engineering Branch, this installation will not be done in time for opening of the school this September. I am recommending that the Department make a decision as to the method of heating this building. My recommendation is that an oil-burning hot water central heating system should be installed. If the Department decide on this, I will immediately have a reliable firm submit a tender for the installation, which would cover materials and labour. This is the only method I can see of getting heat in the school and have it ready for September 1st.\n\nAt the present time we have drilled and provided an excellent well for the Alert Bay Village, which well will supply the Alert Bay Day School. We have the pipes laying here on the ground ready for installation, the tank purchased, and all we need is someone to make the installation. Why can't this be proceeded with now? We could at least have the tank erected and pipeline built from the pump to the tank and from the tank to the school which would have this much of the installation completed and thus provide water and sewerage for the school and teacherages.\n\nThis pipe has been laying here since last March. When the pipe arrived I suggested to Mr. McClure that for the time being until the installation was made they could store the pipe on the lawn at the Agency.\n\np.t.o.\nunder shade trees where it would be protected from the sun and also from being stolen. This was done at the time but later he hauled a lot of it away and piled it on the school grounds and along the road where it is exposed to the sun and the tar is running out of the pipes and not doing them any good. Certain ditches were dug and as far as I know this pipe line which has been laid is now complete but the ditches have never been filled in with the result that the pipes are still exposed to the sun. This work should be finished.\n\nI understand our Department have transferred $10,000.00 to the Surveys ad Engineering Branch to have this work completed.\n\nI also understand Mr. Unsworth of the Surveys and Engineering Branch claims he does not get co-operation from the Indians. With all due respect to Mr. Unsworth I must say he does not seem to know how to handle Indians or get work out of them. He was here three weeks and accomplished very little - in fact, when he was called to Vancouver he dropped his tools where he was working and left them laying all over the place. He also left connections and materials, which we had to wait months in order to purchase, laying around for anybody to pick up. As soon as I learned this I had Mr. Scanlon go down the next morning, gather up all the tools and parts and put them in the warehouse under lock and key so that we would have them when required.\n\nThe method of doing things by representatives of the Surveys and Engineering Branch is not satisfactory and the Indian Affairs Branch is being criticised generally for delays and the conduct of the work. The Department have enough difficulty in obtaining necessary funds to do the work, and now that we have the funds we want this work completed.\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Original on file 156-12-5.\n\nAlert Bay Day School.\n\nIt is understood that the work necessary to complete these buildings consists of exterior painting, installation of plumbing and insulation of ceilings. It is understood that Mr. Scanlon can attend to the matter of insulation and that the only cost involved will be for material. Will you please let me have an estimate of the cost of material. With respect to the painting, etc., will you please submit a tender covering completion of this work under contract.\n| DATE | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| June 30 | To 4-1/5 Gals.

Todd has secured a tender covering material and labour required for painting the Alert Bay Indian Day school buildings and the two teacherages and this tender, together with Mr. Todd's letter of June 16th and enclosures referred to therein is attached hereto. While Mr. D.T. Utley has submitted the lowest tender, in the amount of $1450, his submission does not clearly indicate that it covers both the provision of material and labour. This was pointed out to Mr. Todd but a subsequent tender does not clarify the matter to any extent although you will note from Mr. Todd's letter that he states definitely that the tender covers both labour and material.\n\nIn my letter above referred to I recommended the transfer of funds for completion of schools in the Kwawkewlth Agency and would now recommend that Mr. Utley's tender for painting the day school building and teacherages at Alert Bay be accepted. If the tender in its present form is unacceptable will you please advise by Army Signals when a new form will be prepared in this office and forwarded to Mr. Utley for his signature.\n\nW. S.

T. Utley's tender of $1450.00 is the lower and as he is a painter by trade and has a good name here in Alert Bay for work he has done, I would recommend that his tender be accepted. Mr. Utley informed me he had plenty of other work to do but if the Department accepted his tender he would work long hours and take advantage of the present good weather and get the job completed as quickly as possible.\n\nI would therefore ask that this matter be dealt with by Airmail and the Department's approval received at the earliest possible date. An accountable cheque for this tender could be forwarded this office later, but the important thing is to obtain a decision so that we can get started without any delay.\n\n(M. S.

Mr. Todd states that a good second-hand piano may be purchased for $250.00 from a local resident who will be moving away from Alert Bay in about two months time.\n\nAs the Department is aware, the present Day School has an enrolment between 120 and 130 pupils and operates four class-rooms. It is also anticipated that this enrolment will be greatly increased when the pupils from the Residential school attend the Day School, which it is expected they will do at the beginning of the new academic year. Even if this plan does not go into operation the present enrolment at the school would justify the provision of a piano.\n\nI would strongly recommend that the Department authorize the purchase of this instrument.\n\nW.S.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No.: dated: \n\nVoucher No.: 353  \nDate: March 31/49\nDuring 1948 the Department forwarded an accountable advance, same to be used for various improvements in connection with the Alert Bay Indian Day School. Every effort was made to employ local labour on a daily rate to complete this work but it was realized near the end of our fiscal year that the work was not going to be completed by this method. I, therefore, went to Mr. T. Westerlund, local contractor, and asked if he would consider a contract to complete the work and at the same time finish it by the end of our fiscal year.\n\nMr. Westerlund agreed to supply the necessary materials and labour to complete the work by March 31st. I, therefore, had him submit a tender covering all the work required to be done and he agreed to do it for $417.14. The signed tender is attached to Voucher No. 353.\n\nWe had a balance on hand of $183.51 from the accountable advance forwarded by the Department. When the work was completed on March 31st, 1949, we paid Mr. Westerlund $183.51 by cheque against his tender, which left a balance of $233.63. We are submitting herewith voucher #353 in favor of Mr. Westerlund in the amount of $233.63, which will pay the tender in full.\n\nThe work which we have completed was most essential in providing a playground with equipment for the children in this school. Prior to this they had no playground equipment or place to play. I am requesting the School Inspector to make a report to the Department on this work when he inspects the school.\n\n(M. S.

(RG 10, Volume 6384, File 800-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nMay 13, 1949.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Alert Bay Indian Day School\n\nOn the occasion of my recent inspection of the above mentioned school I was informed by the staff that there had been considerable difficulty in maintaining normal temperatures in the class-rooms during the winter months. Temperature readings were kept by the teachers in 3 of the 4 rooms and I secured a copy of these from the principal, which I am attaching herewith. It is obvious that something will have to be done concerning these conditions in the summer months of this year in order to ensure that they will not re-occur in the next year.\n\nAlthough the school has been kept very clean, due to the efforts of the staff, it is the normal practice to provide the services of a janitor in schools of this size and I strongly recommend that such an employee be engaged for the next academic year.\n\nYou will recall that the water piping has already been installed in this school but this has not been connected to the water main. Some of the plumbing for waste has also been installed but is not connected to a sewage system. It\nis most desirable that this work be completed in the current fiscal year, particularly in the case of the teacherage. It is unfortunate that our teachers have not at least as good facilities in this respect as many of the Indian homes in Alert Bay.\n\nNo fire protection is provided for this frame building and I feel that the Department should protect its considerable investment by providing at least a hose for the existing fire hydrant located on the school grounds. I feel that there should also be at least two hand extinguishers located in the school itself.\n\nDuring my inspection I noted that a number of the desks provided were not suited in size to the pupils who were occupying them. The following adjustments should be made:\n\nIn the senior room- 4 desks size No. 3 should be removed and 6 desks size No. 1 should be installed.\n\nIn the Intermediate room- 7 desks size No. 5 and 4 desks size No. 4 should be removed and replaced with 11 size No. 1.\n\nIn the Junior room- 6 desks size No. 5 should be replaced with 2 primary tables and 10 chairs.\n\nIn the Primary room- 7 No. 5 desks should be replaced with 3 primary tables and 10 chairs. The replacement of the 28 desks as indicated above will release them for the school at Village Island which we hope to open in September.\nSeveral of the doors in the school will not latch, apparently due to the shrinkage in the lumber. This applies in particular to the main entrance door on the front of the building and the doors opening from the class-rooms to the large entrance hall.\n\nThere also appears to be something wrong with the electric light circuits in the senior and intermediate rooms as the teachers concerned have been unable to get certain of the globes in these rooms to light.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nDistrict School Inspector.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Alert Bay Indian Day School\n\nContents of the attached memorandum from District School Inspector Davey with regard to the Alert Bay Indian Day School were brought to the attention of Supt. Todd and as a result we have received from him the attached communication dated May 25th and requisitions for school desks, tables, fire hose, etc. I would recommend:\n\n(1) That the Department approve purchase of the desks, primary tables, and primary chairs at a cost of $500.00.\n\n(2) That purchase of three lengths of fire hose with the necessary couplings, etc., be authorized at an approximate cost of $125.00.\n\n(3) An expenditure of $50 for the erection of a box to protect the fire hose from the weather be approved.\n\n(4) An expenditure of $25.00 be approved for necessary changes to the school wiring.\n\nOther matters referred to by Mr. Davey in his memorandum will be the subject of separate communications.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Commissioner for B. C., Department of Mines and Resources, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 17th last, file #3-11-4, re Alert Bay Indian Day School.\n\nAttached please find requisitions for desks and also for three-fifty-foot lengths of fire hose together with nozzle, to be stationed and used at the new Alert Bay Indian Day School.\n\nOne fifty-foot length is not sufficient to reach the school; therefore, we are ordering three lengths. In regard to the type of coupling and size of thread, please phone Surveys and Engineering Branch for this information as they made the installation and will be able to give you the correct type and size.\n\nIt would be appreciated if this could be rushed as we have no hose available for this purpose at the present time.\n\nIt will also be necessary to build a small box adjacent to the hydrant to protect the house from weather and at the same time make it available immediately for use. This together with repairing the doors in the Indian Day School would amount to approximately $50.00.\n\nI do not believe there are any major changes necessary in the wiring of the school. It is not possible for me to obtain the services of an electrician to make this investigation at this time but I feel if $25.00 were provided, the work could be done for this amount.\n\n(M. S.

C., and will be\nself-explanatory.\n\nIn connection with the plumbing the Surveys and Engineering\nBranch hung five wash basins in the school as well as installing\nmain water lines running to these basins within the building. The\nwork yet to be done consists of the following:\n\n(1) Installing ten toilets and one latrine.\n\n(2) Digging a trench from the hydrant to the building\nand installing water line from hydrant to school.\n\n(3) Connecting up all basins, latrines and hot water tank.\n\nThere is considerable material to be supplied in connection\nwith this installation. We have the toilets and hot water tank on\nhand.\n\nWhen the school was built a furnace room was provided. In\norder to get a solid foundation for the furnace, it is necessary\nto cut a hole in the floor and build a cement foundation from the\nground up to the floor. One ply of tar paper will be laid on the\nrest of the floor and then a cement floor laid on top of it. The\nwalls and ceiling will have to be insulated with asbestos. The\nwiring will have to be changed somewhat. One door and window will\nalso have to be moved to new locations and a hole in the wall made\nfor the chimney. This will give us an excellent furnace room and\nperfectly safe when proper ventilation is installed. A standard\nsize chimney to comply with heating requirements will be built of\nred clay brick lined with tile.\n\np.t.o.\nAs this work is part of the total improvements and necessary, I would recommend that it be accepted and that an accountable cheque in the amount of $1,033.00 be forwarded this office so that cash advances may be made as work progresses.\n\n(M.

Westerlund\nand Westerlund covering all labour and materials necessary to insulate\nall ceilings in both teacherages and Indian Day School, Alert Bay.\nIt requires approximately 8,500 sq.ft. of Donnacorns and 20 rolls of\nblow-in paper to complete this work. Messrs. Westerlund and Westerlund\nwill supply all this together with sufficient nails and pay for all\ncharges of wharfage, trucking, freight and total wages, for the full\nsum of $1,152.50.\n\nWhen the insulation of the ceilings of the school and teacherages\nwas first recommended we thought rock wool would be the answer. However,\nwhen we thoroughly examined the structure of the rafters and ceiling\njoists we found they were constructed in such a manner that it would\nbe impossible to make a tight job by laying rock wool on top of the\nceiling panels. I have since obtained expert advice from several\npeople including Mr. A.H. Hargreaves, Heating Engineer, Ottawa, who\nwas here a few days ago. He crawled up into the attic with me, examined\nthe structure and then informed me that in his opinion Donnacorns with\npaper between it and the ceiling panels would be the answer to our heat\nlosses. It is for this reason that we have changed from rock wool to\nDonnacorns and consider we will have a tight job and remove heat\nescapement by using this material.\n\nThere is going to be considerable work in addition to actually\nputting the Donnacorns on. All our electric lights will have to be\ndisconnected and boxes lowered and reassembled. In addition to this\nall strips on the present ceilings will have to be removed as well as\nmoving school equipment in the school while doing the work.\n\nWe are fortunate in getting Messrs. Westerlund and Westerlund\nto undertake this work as they have a contract at present with the\nDepartment of Transport in Alert Bay but have promised me they will\nundertake the work and have it completed before school opens if the\nDepartment would give them a reply reasonably soon.\n\np.t.o.\nIt would be appreciated if you would give this your early consideration so that I can inform Messrs. Westerlund and Westerlund of the Department's decision. If Messrs.

Todd)\nIndian Superintendent.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C., Department of Mines and Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nAttached please find tender received from Messrs. Westerlund and Westerlund covering the installation of an automatic hot water heating system in the Alert Bay Indian Day School as per blueprint and specifications attached. The total cost sum is Forty-One Hundred Eighty-Four Dollars ($41,844.00), which Messrs. Westerlund and Westerlund have agreed to complete subject to the Department's approval and within sixty (60) days following the Department's notification to them that their tender has been accepted.\n\nThe Department is aware that a proper heating system is necessary in this school. At the present time we have only four classrooms heated with old Army Camp coal-burning stoves, which must be replaced at once. There is no heat in the Assembly Room nor in the wing which was used for 'girls' and boys' washrooms, teachers' offices, 'boys' and 'girls' wash room and store rooms. The fact that this building has been up for a year with no heat in this portion of the building has permitted dampness to deteriorate the structure, and this will become serious unless heating is installed within the next few months.\n\nWhen this building was built by the Surveys and Engineering Branch it was planned for a central heating system and cannot be heated otherwise. In addition to this we have been unable to install any plumbing to date for lack of heat as the pipes would only freeze during the cold weather and destroy the installation.\n\nRecently Mr. Hargreaves was here from Ottawa inspecting the Residential School heating system and I asked him if he would inspect the Day School and also examine the plans and specifications which I had had prepared for the heating plant, pointing out to Mr. Hargreaves that I was not personally qualified to make a recommendation without technical advice. Mr. Hargreaves informed me that he had not been sent here to deal with the Indian Day School but now that he was here he would look over the plant and also the specifications and then if the Department wished any advice upon his return to Ottawa, he would be very glad to assist them in any way he could. I would therefore request the Department to call Mr. Hargreaves on the phone and ask him to come over and give you expert advice on the recommendations which I am submitting in respect to the heating of this school. I am sure he will be glad to help you.\n\nI called for local tenders for this work but there is nobody in Alert Bay or district other than Messrs. Westerlund and Westerlund who is capable or able to undertake this work, and if it is necessary to bring someone in from say Vancouver, the cost of this installation will be a great deal more than Messrs. Westerlund and Westerlund's tender. Messrs. Westerlund and Westerlund built our Health Centre last year and installed a similar heating plant there, the only difference it being a smaller unit, and Mr. Hargreaves informed me the installation was exceptionally good.\n\np.t.o.\nMessrs. Westerlund and Westerlund are repairing and modernizing the Federal Department of Public Works' building here in Alert Bay at present and will be through in about two weeks' time, and will then be available to undertake our work, providing their tender is accepted. This work must be done during the summer holidays when school is closed and, therefore, there is some urgency in getting the work under way.\n\nMessrs. Westerlund and Westerlund are submitting tenders for other work that has to be done at our Day School during the holidays and they inform me the amount of each tender is based on the Department accepting all their tenders. They pointed out that they have a complete crew of men such as plumbers, electricians and heating experts, and if their tenders are accepted, wish to move their crew and fill their equipment to the Day School to be used on the various projects simultaneously. This is the only way they can complete the work before the opening of school and at the amounts offered in their tenders.\n\nWe are fortunate in having local men able to undertake this work and guarantee to finish it quickly, and I would recommend that all their tenders be accepted. They are very capable men and have had extensive experience working on Government projects.\n\nI regret the time seems short but we have had to overcome many difficulties and delays before I have been able to prepare and submit plans, specifications and necessary data in connection with all the work that I have been asked to have done. I would, therefore, request the Department to give immediate consideration to the various tenders being submitted and wire this office immediately their decision is reached in respect to all tenders, so that Messrs. Westerlund and Westerlund may order their materials and get the work under way as quickly as possible. This is the only way we will have it completed prior to the opening of school at the beginning of September.\n\nIf the Department accepts Messrs. Westerlund and Westerlund's tender, I would request that an accountable cheque in the amount of $4,984.00 be forwarded this office so that advances can be made as the work progresses.\n\nEncs.\n\n(M.

If approved, kindly forward me an accountable advance in the amount of $449.60, so that I may advance Messrs.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.,\n\nRe: Alert Bay Indian Day School\n\nYour file 6-11-3 (156)\n\nWe received your letter of June 30th with reference to additional improvements which are considered necessary at the above school.\n\nWe have carefully considered its contents but it must be kept in mind that the amount of $6,500. is the total amount that we have available during the current fiscal year unless we transfer additional funds from some other project which would be difficult.\n\nWe approve the acceptance of the tender of Messrs. Westerlund and Westerlund in an amount of $449.60 for laying a new floor throughout the school. It is further noted that this firm agrees to commence work immediately and to complete same on or before August 31st. The Departmental Purchasing Agent has been requested to secure the flooring.\n\nWe are communicating with the Lands and Development Services Branch in regard to the installation of an automatic hot water heating system. However, in view of the amount of the tender that you have received it is doubtful if we will be able to handle this work during the current fiscal year even if the Lands and Development Services approve the proposal.\nNo action will be taken regarding the following items as I intend to write further:\n\n(1) Installation of major sewage system for the school building and two teacherages\n\n(2) Installation of water supply and plumbing facilities\n\n(3) Insulation of teacherage and classrooms\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nPP/HM\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Alert Bay Indian Day School\n\nDistrict School Inspector Davey recently brought to our attention certain improvements which were required at the above-mentioned School and additional work necessary for completion of the buildings. Through communication with Superintendent Todd, we endeavoured to arrive at the cost of this work and to secure from him proposals covering the best method of having the work carried out. All the information necessary was not immediately forthcoming, but having in mind that the work was necessary and in an attempt to clarify our construction program and the necessary allotment of available funds, in my letter of June 17th, I estimated that $6,500.00 would be sufficient to meet the cost of the work.\n\nI now have Mr. Phelan's letter of June 27th, advising that certain transfers of funds, including the amount estimated for the Alert Bay Day School, were being proceeded with, but in the interval, additional information secured from Mr. Todd indicates that the amount requested will be insufficient to meet the entire cost. It is not intended to go into any great detail at this time, my purpose in writing being to secure, if possible, approval of certain specific expenditures, details of which are as follows:\n\n1. New floors.- When these buildings were erected, the old flooring from the Army Camp which necessarily had to be cut up, was in poor shape, was covered with a material known as Tuflex, which has since been found to be quite unsuitable. It is proposed to recover the entire floor with edge grain fir\nflooring, a requisition for which is attached, together with a quotation from the Inkster Lumber Company, Courtenay, B.C. The price quoted by the Company works out at $192.00 per 1000 delivered, which is in line with Vancouver prices, plus freight and cartage and as the Inkster Lumber Company is the only source of supply in the Alert Bay district, I would recommend that the Purchasing Agent be requested to place the order with them for immediate delivery. With regard to labour, you will note from Mr. Todd's letter of June 20th and enclosure attached, that Messrs. Westerlund and Westerlund have tendered in the amount of $440.60, to provide all labour, trucking charges from the wharf, nails, etc., and guarantee to complete the work to the satisfaction of the Department. I have discussed this matter at some length with Mr. Todd and although we feel that it might be desirable to secure competitive tenders, he assures me there is no one in Alert Bay or vicinity other than Mr. Westerlund who would tender on the work. Under the circumstances, I would recommend acceptance of their tender.\n\n2. Installation of an automatic hot water heating system.- You will note from Mr. Todd's letter of June 20th and enclosures attached, that Messrs. Westerlund and Westerlund will undertake the complete installation of an automatic hot water heating system, for the sum of $4,384.00. I am unable to comment with regard to the suitability of the system proposed or the amount of the tender, but as Mr. Hargreaves apparently went into the matter in some detail while at Alert Bay, I would suggest that the proposal be referred to him and if acceptable to him both with regard to design and price, an attempt be made to have the tender accepted.\n\n3. The installation of a master sewage system for the school building and two teacherages.- Mr. Todd has submitted a design for a sewage disposal system and a tender from Messrs. Westerlund and Westerlund in the amount of $5,269.00, for material and labour. As the Local Office of the Lands and Development Services Branch gave consideration to a sewage disposal system at the time they erected the buildings, this proposal is being referred to them for their comments and if they are of the opinion that the design is suitable and the price is reasonable, I intend to recommend acceptance of Mr. Westerlund's tender. I might say that although I know it is difficult to secure acceptance of large tenders such as this without advertising, having in mind that Alert Bay is a small centre with possibly only one firm competent to do such work, it is impossible to secure competitive tenders unless, of course, detailed plans and specifications are made available and tenders called for in Vancouver, and in this case, such plans and\nspecifications are not available.\n\n4. Insulation of teacherages and classrooms.\u2014 Temperature charts maintained by the teachers last year indicated terrific heat losses in these buildings and for several weeks at a stretch it is impossible to raise the inside temperature to 65\u00b0. In order to conserve fuel and for the comfort of the teachers and pupils, it is considered essential that these buildings be insulated. Mr. Todd has secured a tender from Messrs. Westerlund and Westerlund in the amount of $1,152.00, a copy of which is attached, covering the supply of Donnacanna and other materials and labour, but I have suggested to Mr. Todd that it might be more acceptable if Mr. Westerlund submitted a tender on labour only, the Department to supply the materials required, and he has agreed to approach Mr. Westerlund for such a tender. This matter will be the subject of a further communication at a later date.\n\n5. Water supply and installation of plumbing facilities.\u2014 As with the proposal for insulating the buildings, we have here a tender from Messrs. Westerlund and Westerlund for the supply of material and labour necessary for completion of the work as outlined in Mr. Todd's letter of June 20th and tender attached, at a cost of $1,033.00 and in this case, I have also suggested to Mr. Todd that it might be preferable for Mr. Westerlund to tender on labour only, the Department to supply materials. This matter will also be the subject of a further communication when we hear again from Mr. Todd.\n\nNo summary of the proposed expenditures is made here for the reason that we anticipate the sewage disposal design and possibly the heating design also may not be acceptable to the engineering division.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.S.

Mr. Westerlund, whose tenders I forwarded, has just completed a building for the Dominion Department of Public Works here in Alert Bay, and he told me yesterday that unless he can get word reasonably soon he would have to take on other work, otherwise lay off his crew, in which case we would not be able to have our work done as there is no one else available here who can do it.\n\nI do not know what has happened to the tenders since they left our office but am presuming you are dealing with them at the present time. It is very difficult to purchase Fir flooring but I have made arrangements for a firm to hold sufficient material until I can get a Purchasing Order issued by Ottawa.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would do everything possible to speed this up as time is running out and I want to have it completed before the opening of school, as it would naturally interfere with the classrooms trying to make repairs during school hours.\n\nIf you would be kind enough to send me a wire immediately you have decided and obtained approval, particularly in respect to the insulating and new floor tenders, then I could get the material ordered and also retain the services of Mr. Westerlund. Anything you can do to help me will be greatly appreciated.\n\n(M. S.

It might be well to stress the importance of using circulating pumps equal to those made by Bell and Gossett, S.A., Armstrong Company, or Minneapolis Honeywell Company.\n\nPumps made by any one of the above mentioned firms are specifically designed to positively operate against the required head which is an important consideration in forced hot water heating.\n\nIt should be pointed out that the ceiling of the Day School is anything but tight. During his visit to this building, our officer climbed through an access door into the ceiling space and found that the ceiling was very porous, full of cracks and admitted a great deal of light, which is a true indication that the heat loss through this ceiling would be abnormal at best. At times Rock wool either in loose or batt form should be laid between the ceiling joists over the ceiling or its equivalent in fibre board applied directly to the ceiling.\n\nSince Mr. Todd had no specific data at the time of our officers visit with regard to the sewage disposal system, we are unable to offer worthwhile comment. It is felt however, that if the scheme verbally outlined by Mr. Todd to our officer and referred to in Major Mackay's memorandum is followed, this part of the work would be satisfactory.\n\nComment on matters dealing with the Residential School, will be furnished separately.\n\nR.A.

I would recommend acceptance of Mr. Westerlund's tender in the amount of $495.00 and would ask that I be authorized to secure the materials.\n\n(4) Insulation of teacherages and classrooms: We have secured the attached tender from Mr. Westerlund in the amount of $487.00 covering the provision of labour only for insulation of all ceilings in the classrooms and teacherages. The work involved is outlined in the tender and the amount would appear to be reasonable. Materials are estimated to cost approximately $625.00. I would recommend acceptance of Mr. Westerlund's tender and would ask that I be authorized to secure the required insulating materials in Vancouver.

Todd)\nIndian Superintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nAugust 10th, 1949.\n\nIndian Commissioner for B.C., Department of Mines & Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRE: ALERT BAY INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of August 2nd last, file #6-11-3, in which you informed me as follows: \"With regard to the automatic hot water heating system proposed, owing to the cost the Department is unable to favorably consider the tenders submitted, and consequently it will be necessary to heat the buildings with oil stoves for another year as was done previously.\"\n\nIt is regretted that a special effort was not made to provide a proper heating system for this school. With regard to heating the buildings with oil stoves for another year as you suggest, I must point out this school has never been heated with oil stoves but rather with four old, rusty, worn-out Army Camp coal heaters, which no longer can be used and must be replaced as the grates in the stoves are no longer safe. All the heat we have had in this school to date is the four stoves, one in each classroom. The assembly room, wash rooms, teachers' office and storeroom have no heat installed and there are no chimneys in the building whereby individual stoves can be set up without building a chimney.\n\nWe are now proceeding with the installation of the plumbing and this end the sewerage system cannot be used unless heat is provided in this building, as the plumbing would freeze up. There is another bad feature. Unless heat is installed in the rest of the school, that part of our building is going to deteriorate so badly that we will have a major repair job on our hands. The V-joint is already bulging. All I can do is report these matters as they are.\n\nIt seems to me that for the sake of economy and to protect this new building from deterioration, where we have a very large investment, we should go all out and provide adequate heating and complete the construction of this school, even though we had to transfer funds from some other source. When Mr. Hargreaves was here from Ottawa, I asked\n\np.t.o.\nhim to give me a rough, approximate estimate of what he thought it would cost to put a proper heating system in this school, and he informed me it would be in the neighbourhood of $7,000.00. When we obtained a figure from Mr. Westerlund of $4,984.00, I felt we were getting an installation at a reasonable price.\n\nUnless a central heating unit to heat this school is installed before the cold weather sets in we are going to be faced with replacing the four present stoves with oil burners at an approximate cost of $400.00, which will only provide heat for four classrooms and not for any other part of the school.\n\nI am again recommending that the Department reconsider the installation of a central heating unit as recommended, but failing this I am requesting authority to purchase four new oil burning heaters for the four classrooms, and also authority to build chimneys on the rest of the school to take care of three more oil burners, and authority to purchase the oil burners for this part of the school. This will mean that we will have seven oil burners operating in the school, and the cost is going to be definitely very high, and even with this number of stoves there is no way that I can assure that the plumbing will not freeze due to being unable to distribute the heat owing to the plan of the building.\n\nWe have submitted through School Inspector Davey a daily report of the temperatures in the various classrooms where we had these old Army Camp heaters during last term; and this report alone should indicate to the Department that the building is not adequately heated, nor is it safe in the interests of the children's health to have them sitting in classrooms under these conditions.\n\nI have now reported the matter as it is and cannot take any further responsibility should we be faced with a lot of illness in this school during the next term through lack of adequate heating.\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nTo Mr. F. Phelan\n\nConfirming our discussion today relative to our school building program in British Columbia: In connection with the one-room school at Cape Mudge tenders for which close on September 9th, in the event of a suitable tender not being received on that date would you kindly advise by wire whether you will endeavour to look after the erection of a prefab building on the basis that we can obtain a contract for the foundation and erection.\n\nWe feel it is essential that the calling for tenders on the two-room schools at Hartley Bay, Greenville and Kincolith be looked after immediately due to the advancement of the season. Again in the event of suitable tenders not being received we feel that we could erect suitable schools by the purchase of either prefabricated structures or by the possible erection of quonset buildings. It is imperative that the advertising for tenders for the three above-mentioned schools be done within thirty days.\n\nWe are unable to understand why Mr. Buck is having plans prepared by Mr. Van Norman for the two-room school at Belle Belle. Mr. Van Norman has already submitted plans and it would appear that we can proceed at this time.\n\nRe the Alert Bay Indian Day School it is understood that we shall receive information concerning the heating of this school as soon as you return.\n\n(sgd) W.S.

C.\n\nRE: ALERT BAY INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nAs the Department have approved of the following contracts in favor of Mr. T. Westerlund, and as Mr. Westerlund's tenders were subject to advances being made as work progressed, it would be appreciated if you would kindly arrange to have accountable advances forwarded here at an early date.\n\nContract No. 1 - Dated June 20th, 1949, covering labour, trucking and nails for laying new floors in the Alert Bay Indian Day School: $449.60\n\nContract No. 2 - Dated June 20th, 1949, covering labour insulating ceilings of two teacherages and Day School with Donnacona: $487.00\n\nContract No. 3 - Dated June 27th, 1949, covering labour water supply, plumbing facilities and boiler room, Alert Bay Indian Day School: $495.00\n\n$1,431.60\n\nAs Mr. Westerlund has a crew of men working at the Alert Bay Indian Day School trying to have this work completed before school opens, it would be appreciated if these accountable advances could be forwarded here by Airmail so that I can make advances to him as the work progresses.\n\nYour kind and early attention to this will be greatly appreciated.\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Superintendent.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nAugust 20th, 1949.\n\nIndian Commissioner for B.C., Department of Mines & Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRE: Progress Report - Alert Bay Day School\n\nThis is to advise you Mr. Westerlund, to whom the Department gave contracts to insulate with Donnaconna Wallboard the ceilings in the two Teacherages and the Alert Bay Indian Day School, as well as laying new edge-grained Fir floors in the Day School, has completed the work and has made a very excellent job.\n\nIn order to put insulation on the ceilings it was necessary to lower all the light receptacles the thickness of the Donnaconna. This in itself was quite a lot of extra work. The insulation and new floors have improved the school considerably and I am very pleased with the results of our decision to have this work done.\n\nIn order to preserve the floors it is necessary that they be well oiled before being used due to the sand and dirt being tracked into the school.\n\nAll doors within the building had to be removed and the thickness of the flooring cut off the bottom of the doors. There was quite a lot of extra work in moving supplies and equipment but Mr. Westerlund absorbed this extra expense and charged no extra on the contract for doing so.\n\nIt would be appreciated if the cheques covering these contracts could be forwarded at an early date as Mr. Westerlund has had to pay his men and certain materials for the job. It was requested under date of June 20th last that accountable advances be forwarded this office following the acceptance of Mr. Westerlund's tenders.\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Alert Bay Indian Day School.\n\nWith reference to the final paragraph of Mr. Neary's letter of July 26, with regard to the proposed automatic hot water heating system for the above-mentioned school, Superintendent Todd, in his letter of August 10 attached, requests that the Department's decision to postpone the installation be reconsidered. I concur with Mr. Todd's comments with regard to the inadequacy of the present heating arrangement, but if the Department is not able to provide the funds required, there would appear to be no alternative to carry on with the present method of heating until next year.\n\nIf, however, Mr. Hargraves considers that Mr. Westerlund's proposed heating system is adequate and the cost reasonable, I feel we should endeavour to secure, if there is any possibility of being successful, the additional funds required from the supplementary estimates.\n\nW.S. Arneil\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nAugust 10th, 1949.\n\nIndian Commissioner for B.C., Department of Mines & Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRE: ALERT BAY INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of August 2nd last, file #6-11-3, in which you informed me as follows: \"With regard to the automatic hot water heating system proposed, owing to the cost the Department is unable to favorably consider the tenders submitted, and consequently it will be necessary to heat the buildings with oil stoves for another year as was done previously.\"\n\nIt is regretted that a special effort was not made to provide a proper heating system for this school. With regard to heating the buildings with oil stoves for another year as you suggest, I must point out this school has never been heated with oil stoves but rather with four old, rusty, worn-out Army Camp coal heaters, which no longer can be used and must be replaced as the grates in the stoves are no longer safe. All the heat we have had in this school to date is the four stoves, one in each classroom. The assembly room, wash rooms, teachers' office and storeroom have no heat installed and there are no chimneys in the building whereby individual stoves can be set up without building a chimney.\n\nWe are now proceeding with the installation of the plumbing and this and the sewerage system cannot be used unless heat is provided in this building; as the plumbing would freeze up. There is another bad feature. Unless heat is installed in the rest of the school, that part of our building is going to deteriorate so badly that we will have a major repair job on our hands. The V-joint is already bulging. All I can do is report these matters as they are.\n\nIt seems to me that for the sake of economy and to protect this new building from deterioration, where we have a very large investment, we should go all out and provide adequate heating and complete the construction of this school, even though we had to transfer funds from some other source. When Mr. Hargreaves was here from Ottawa, I asked\n\np.t.o.\nhim to give me a rough, approximate estimate of what he thought it would cost to put a proper heating system in this school, and he informed me it would be in the neighbourhood of $7,000.00. When we obtained a figure from Mr. Westerlund of $4,984.00, I felt we were getting an installation at a reasonable price.\n\nUnless a central heating unit to heat this school is installed before the cold weather sets in we are going to be faced with replacing the four present stoves with oil burners at an approximate cost of $400.00, which will only provide heat for four classrooms and not for any other part of the school.\n\nI am again recommending that the Department reconsider the installation of a central heating unit as recommended, but failing this I am requesting authority to purchase four new oil burning heaters for the four classrooms, and also authority to build chimneys on the rest of the school to take care of three more oil burners, and authority to purchase the oil burners for this part of the school. This will mean that we will have seven oil burners operating in the school, and the cost is going to be definitely very high, and even with this number of stoves there is no way that I can assure that the plumbing will not freeze due to being unable to distribute the heat owing to the plan of the building.\n\nWe have submitted through School Inspector Davey a daily report of the temperatures in the various classrooms where we had these old Army Camp heaters during last term; and this report alone should indicate to the Department that the building is not adequately heated, nor is it safe in the interests of the children's health to have them sitting in classrooms under these conditions.\n\nI have now reported the matter as it is and cannot take any further responsibility should we be faced with a lot of illness in this school during the next term through lack of adequate heating.\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nAugust 26th, 1949\n\nIndian Commissioner for B.C., Department of Mines & Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Progress Report - Alert Bay Day School\n\nThis is to advise you Mr. Westerlund, to show the Department gave contracts to insulate with Domacomes Wallboard the ceilings in the two Teachersages and the Alert Bay Indian Day School, as well as laying new edge-grained Fir floors in the Day School, has completed the work and has made a very excellent job.\n\nIn order to put insulation on the ceilings it was necessary to lower all the light receptacles the thickness of the Domacomes.

Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am enclosing copy of a letter dated August 20th from Supt. Todd with regard to the progress made with regard to various improvements authorized to the Alert Bay Day School buildings.\n\nWill you please advise by Army Signals if it is intended to issue accountable advances to Mr. Todd covering the amounts of Mr. Westerlund's contracts or if it will be necessary for Mr. Todd to submit vouchers.\n\nW.S.

I also pointed out that the rest of the building had no heat in it.\n\nThe present stoves are worn out and must be replaced. The rainy, cold weather is now with us and some decision will have to be made in respect to heating this school. A great deal of time was spent to ascertain the best method of heating this school. Plans were drawn, estimate of the cost obtained, and the equipment to make the installation is available and could be installed within four weeks, after approval was received from Ottawa.\n\nPossibly I have not given the Department as much information as is necessary to assist them in arriving at a decision, and as something must be done to heat this school, I am writing you more fully. If the Department cannot see their way clear to install a central heating plant as recommended, it will be necessary to provide the following as a temporary measure. Purchase seven large circulating oil-burning heaters and erect three temporary chimneys at an estimated cost of $1100.00. This could only be considered a temporary measure as the seven stoves will not adequately heat the school due to the plan of the building.\n\nThere has been no adequate heat in parts of this building for two years with the result that the V-joint is beginning to bulge in places and I am afraid unless a proper heating system is installed, this fine new building will be damaged through lack of heat. Here on the Coast the climate is very damp and any building requires heat to keep it from deteriorating.\n\np.t.o.\nOn the other hand, if the Department proceeds with the installation of a central heating plant it will be a permanent installation and the money spent as a temporary measure for oil-burning heaters would go a considerable way towards reducing the cost of the permanent installation. We have also purchased most of the materials for the furnace room which is extra expense and will be of no value to us unless the central heating plant is installed in the furnace room we are providing.\n\nIn addition to this it is going to be very costly to operate seven oil-burning stoves whereas if we had a central heating unit one furnace would heat the whole building and thus reduce our cost of operating at least half.\n\nI mentioned in my report of August 10th that Mr. Hargreaves had seen the plan as well as the building, and although he informed me he had no instructions from his office to make any recommendation in respect to the heating of the Day School and, therefore, could not officially do so without being requested but, however, felt as he was here he should give us any assistance he could under the circumstances, and stated he would be very glad to advise our Department if they wished to refer the matter to him upon his return to Ottawa. Knowing that Mr. Hargreaves was an expert on heating, I asked him what his opinion was as to cost of this heating plant. After he had examined the plan and visited the school he informed me privately in all probability it would cost the Department roughly $7,000.00 for a complete installation. Later when I was able to obtain a tender from Mr. Westerlund for an amount considerably less than this, I felt we were getting an exceptionally good offer.\n\nFour classrooms are now in full session with an attendance of some 125 children. There is no heat in the school. Some children are walking approximately a mile to the school, and on cold rainy days it is not in the best interests of their health to have to sit in school with wet clothes and no heat. I cannot purchase fuel pending the Department's decision as to what type of heating is to be used.\n\nIt would be appreciated if the Department could give us a definite answer, preferably by wire. If you decide to install the central heating system as recommended and accept Mr. Westerlund's offer and would wire me accordingly, we could have the installation completed in approximately four weeks' time. It would be more economical to make the permanent installation and at the same time preserve the structure and provide adequate heating for this large enrolment of students.\n\nWould the Department please consider this matter urgent and advise me their decision at the earliest convenience.\n\n(M.

(RG 10, Volume 6384, File 800-5, part 4)\nPART IV SPECIFICATIONS\n\n(1) Scope of Work\n\nThe work to be done includes; the excavating of 1310 lineal feet of trench, the laying of 580 lineal feet of six inch diameter vitrified tile pipe and 730 lineal feet of cast iron pipe and backfilling of these trenches, the construction of four man holes and one septic tank.\n\n(2) Excavating\n\nThe Contractor shall excavate to the dimensions and depths indicated or required. The trenches for pipe line shall be open cuts excavated along straight lines; these shall have a minimum of six inches between the outside of the pipe body and the side of the trench or bracing, with a minimum width of trench of two feet. Additional excavation shall be made under bell ends to allow for caulking and to give the pipe a uniform bearing.\n\nExcavations below depths indicated without specific directions shall be refilled to the proper grade with thoroughly compacted suitable fill. All additional work of this nature shall be at the contractor's expense.\n\n(3) Backfilling in Trenches\n\nThe backfilling of trenches shall progress as rapidly as the construction and testing of the work shall permit. Approved fill, free from vegetable matter, shall first be compacted firmly and evenly on both sides of the pipe in six inch layers to a depth of one foot over top of the pipe. In tamping around pipes, care shall be taken to avoid unequal lateral pressure. The earth to the height specified above shall be carefully thrown in with shovels and not dumped. The remainder of the trenches shall be backfilled in dry well-rammed one foot layers. Trenches shall be crowned to allow for settlement.\n(4) **Filling Against New Concrete**\n\nFilling against the septic tank and man holes or other new concrete shall not commence until 14 clear days have elapsed from time of pouring. Backfill shall be free from vegetable matter or large boulders and shall be thoroughly consolidated by ramming in one foot layers.\n1. Concrete Work\n\na. Cement - The type of cement used shall be normal Portland cement and shall be in good condition.\n\nb. Water - The water for mixing shall be clean and fresh and free from oil, acid, salt, alkali, and organic matter.\n\nc. Aggregate - (i) Fine aggregate shall consist of natural sand having hard strong durable uncoated particles.\n\n(ii) Coarse aggregate shall consist of broken stone or natural gravel having hard strong, durable pieces free from adherent coatings and vegetable matter. The maximum size of coarse aggregate shall be one inch.\n\nd. Proportions and Mixing of Concrete - All concrete shall be proportioned by volumetric measurement to the proportions of one sack (Canadian) Portland cement to two cubic feet of fine aggregate and four cubic feet of coarse aggregate. In order to obtain proper workability and a smooth, dense, homogeneous, plastic mixture free from segregation, the exact division of the total aggregate between fine and coarse may be varied from the approximate ratios above specified. In any event, however, the sum of the volumes of the fine and coarse aggregate, measured separately, used for each sack of cement shall not be greater than the volume of the total aggregate specified. The amount of water used per sack of cement shall not exceed seven imperial gallons.\n\ne. Mixing - All concrete shall be machine mixed. The contractor shall provide at the site of the work an improved type of batch mixer and measuring device for the accurate measurement of water and the aggregate\ningredients. The minimum time of mixing, after all materials including water are in the mixer, shall be one and one-half minutes.\n\n2. Reinforcing\n\nAll reinforcing shall, when placed, be free from scale, grease, clay, and other coatings, and foreign substances that would reduce or destroy the bond.\n\na. Reinforcing bars shall be corrugated round of intermediate grade structural steel.\n\n3. Forms\n\nForms shall be built true to line and grade; they shall be of wood and shall be mortar tight and sufficiently rigid to prevent displacement or sagging between supports. Responsibility for their adequacy shall rest with the contractor. Knot holes and broken pieces on wood forms shall be covered with metal patches. All form work shall be provided with adequate clean-out openings to permit easy cleaning after all reinforcement has been placed. All forms shall be constructed so that they can be removed without hammering or prying against the concrete.\n\n4. Placing Reinforcement\n\nAll reinforcing bars shall be placed as indicated in the plan together with all necessary wire ties and other devices required to install and secure the reinforcing properly.\n\na. Reinforcement shall be formed to the dimensions indicated. Cold bends shall be made around a pin having a diameter not less than four times the least diameter of the bar. Heating of reinforcement for bending shall not be allowed. All reinforcement shall be accurately placed and secured and shall be supported by concrete or metal chairs or by spacers or by metal hangers.\n\nb. Splicing - All splices shall overlap by at least one foot. Adjacent bars shall not be spliced at the same point. The lapped ends of the bars shall be separated to develop the entire bond strength of each bar.\n5. Conveyance and Placing\n\na. Conveying - Concrete shall be conveyed from the mixer to the forms as rapidly as practicable by methods which will prevent segregation and loss of ingredients. It shall be deposited as nearly as practical to its final position to avoid rehandlings. The concrete shall not be discharged directly from chutes into forms. All concrete shall be deposited as soon as practical after forms have been set up and reinforcing placed. It shall be placed before initial set, and in any event, not later than 20 minutes after mixing. In no case shall concrete which has partially set or concrete which has been remixed with the addition of cement or water be used in the work. Concrete which has been segregated in conveying shall be wasted.\n\nb. Placing - All concrete shall be placed in the dry. It shall be deposited in approximately horizontal layers. The method of depositing concrete shall be such as to avoid displacing the reinforcing. The concrete shall be compacted by tamping or puddling either manually or by machine in an approved manner. Concrete shall not be poured through the reinforcing steel as in walls of septic tank and/or manholes in such cases, hoppers or other approved means shall be used to prevent segregation.\n\n6. Protection and Curing\n\na. General Requirements - Concrete shall be adequately protected from injurious action by the sun, heavy rains, flowing water, frost and mechanical injury and shall not be allowed to dry out from the time it is placed until the expiration of the minimum curing period specified in these specifications.\n\nb. Curing - Wood forms shall be left in place for a period of seven days and they shall be kept sufficiently damp at all times to prevent opening at the joints and drying out of the concrete. The temperature of the air in\ncontact with the concrete shall not be less than 50\u00b0 F. for a period of not less than seven days after placing. Heating of the concrete in place shall be affected by salamanders or steam coils under canvas covers or by other approved means. The temperature shall not exceed 100\u00b0 F., and adequate moisture shall be applied to the concrete surface during the heating period to prevent its drying out.\n\nc. Removal of forms - All form work should be left intact for a period of 14 days after placing of concrete.\n\n7.

Day School and Teacherage\n\nAttached are four copies of specifications and plans of a septic tank for the above mentioned installations.\n\nWhile Mr. D.W. Gordon of this office was supervising repairs to the Residential School he contacted the firm of Westerlund and Westerlund, and these people initimated to him that they would be interested in tendering for such work.\n\nThe specifications enclosed will indicate to the contractor the class of work required.\n\nThe cost of material and freight is estimated to be $2357.00, and labour at $1100.00, making a total of about $3,457.00 for these items. The contractor will require, of course, a profit in addition, and I would consider a price of $4,000.00 reasonable.\n\nThis type of system meets with the approval of the National Health authorities.\n\nIf further information or assistance is required, we will be most pleased to assist.\n\nEnc.\n\nSpecifications and plans\n\nC.

These stoves are rusty and worn out army camp coal heaters which we can no longer use with safety. There is one in each classroom and no heat is provided in the assembly hall, the wash-rooms, teachers' office and store-rooms, nor are there chimneys in the building whereby individual stoves could be set up in these rooms.\n\nTherefore, in order to properly heat this school, we have two alternatives:\n\n(a) The installation of a central heating unit;\n\n(b) The installation of four oil heaters for the four classrooms; the building of three chimneys and the installation of three additional oil burners.\n\nWe were fortunate in having our heating engineer at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School at the time the heating of this school was under discussion. You will find his report attached hereto. I also attach the tender received from Messrs. Westerlund and Westerlund for the installation of this automatic hot water heating plant. You will note that this is in the amount of $4,984.00 which we feel to be a reasonable price.\n\nWe have thoroughly investigated the heating of this\nschool and while the oil burners may seem cheaper, it will mean seven stoves to maintain and the amount of fuel oil consumed will be very high.\n\nTherefore we would recommend, for the acceptance of the Minister, the tender of Messrs.

It might be well to stress the importance of using circulating pumps equal to those made by Bell and Gossett, S.A. Armstrong Company, or Minneapolis Honeywell Company.\n\nPumps made by any one of the above mentioned firms are specifically designed to positively operate against the required head which is an important consideration in forced hot water heating.\n\nIt should be pointed out that the ceiling of the Day School is anything but tight. During his visit to this building, our officer climbed through an access door into the ceiling space and found that the ceiling was very porous, full of cracks and admitted a great deal of light, which is a true indication that the heat loss through this ceiling would be abnormal in the wintertime. Rock wool either in loose or batt form should be laid between the ceiling joists over the ceiling or its equivalent in fibre board applied directly to the ceiling.\n\nSince Mr. Todd had no specific data at the time of our officer's visit with regard to the sewage disposal system, we are unable to offer worthwhile comment. It is felt however, that if the scheme verbally outlined by Mr. Todd to our officer and referred to in Major Mackay's memorandum is followed, this part of the work would be satisfactory.\n\nComment on matters dealing with the Residential School, will be furnished separately.\n\nChas.

Manning's report on the Alert Bay Indian Day School visited on January 21, 1944.\n\nDivision 1\n\nTeacher .....Miss Grace Madeline McGill\n\nThe class has a Junior Red Cross Club and some good work has been done in knitting. It is highly desirable that the older girls and boys receive instruction in sewing and shop-work at the residential school.\n\nVocational Training\n\nNo vocational courses are offered in this school although the teacher of the senior pupils has been giving some attention to sewing and knitting. I think it is very desirable that pupils of this school, when reaching a certain age, should be given the privilege of attending for at least a half day a week the vocational instruction offered in the St. Michael's Residential School. The pupils would receive necessary training and it would solve to some extent the complaint of parents that the day school pupils do not receive the same opportunities as those attending the residential school.\n\nExtract from Major MacKay's letter of February 15, 1944.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Todd has been asked to discuss with the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School the possibility of the day school children receiving some vocational instruction at the residential school.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR.

Scanlon for the position of manual training instructor at the above mentioned Day School. It will be noted that Mr. Scanlon has two years experience as instructor in this work. In addition to this he was employed for a month at the St. Michael's Residential School at Alert Bay when the Reverend S.J. Wickens was principal of that school. In this period he made considerable improvement in the general set-up of the manual training work at that school, but due to the unsettled conditions prevailing at the time he resigned from this position. Subsequent to this he was employed by the Surveys and Engineering Branch on work on the construction of the new Day School.\n\nHe is undoubtedly a qualified craftsman and it is recommended that he be classified on the Day School Teacher's Salary Schedule as a Grade 2 teacher with two year's experience.\n\nIt is our intention to use as a temporary measure one of the old classroom buildings which were vacated when the new classroom block came into operation and to install in this room only equipment which can be utilized when proper manual training facilities are provided at the new Day School.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nNovember 30, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Manual Training Instructor\nAlert Bay Indian Residential School\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter dated November 6th, file 6-11-2.\n\nThe Department is prepared to appoint Mr. Harold A. Scanlon as manual training instructor at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. Manual training teachers at Indian Residential Schools do not come under the provisions of the Day School Teacher's Salary Schedule.\n\nUpon considering his application form, it has been decided to classify him as a Grade II Manual Training Instructor at a salary of $100.00 a month for the academic year.\n\nAttached please find the schedule of salaries for manual training instructors.\n\nVouchers covering Mr. Scanlon's salary should be submitted to this office monthly or quarterly and payment will be made.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nRe: Mr. H.A. Scanlon, Manual Training Instructor\nYour File 800-11 (E.1)\n\nI refer to Mr. Neary's letter dated November 30th, concerning the employment of the above-mentioned teacher. This man's application was for the position of Instructor, at the Alert Bay Day School and not the Residential School at the same point. In this connection, I would refer you to my letter of November 6th.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDecember 15, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.,\n\nRe: Manual Training Instructor\nAlert Bay Indian Day School.\n\nYou will realize that it is impossible for us to appoint Mr. Scanlon as a Grade 2 teacher as requested in your letter of November 6th. Our schedule definitely requires that a person must have a teacher training before he can be appointed under this classification.\n\nMay we presume that Mr. Scanlon also takes charge of the Residential school pupils. Under this heading we would be able to appoint him as a Grade 2 Manual Training Instructor as indicated in our letter of November 30.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nDecember 22, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nYour file 800-11 (E2)\nRe: Manual Training Instructor\nAlert Bay Indian Day School\n\nI refer to Mr. Neary's letter of December 14th concerning the appointment of Mr. Scanlon to the above-mentioned position.\n\nIt was not our intention at the moment to use Mr. Scanlon for both the Day and Residential School pupils but we hope that at a later date a combination of the classes will be put into effect.\n\nIn the meantime, the instructor will be fully employed in either class-room instruction or in the preparation of equipment such as benches, cupboards for the manual training shop. Since it is not possible to classify Mr. Scanlon as a Grade 2 teacher I would recommend that he be placed on the Day School Teacher's Salary Schedule with a Grade 1 classification.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAIR MAIL,\n\nJanuary 14, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd ultimo, the Department approves the appointment of Mr. Harold Scanlon as Manual Training Instructor at the Alert Bay Day and Residential School at a salary of $100. a month for the academic year.\n\nWhen forwarding the voucher for his salary at the end of each month he should also complete and forward one of the enclosed forms.\n\nIn forwarding the voucher it should be issued as shown on the attached sample.\n\nCareful consideration has been given to the recommendation contained in the last paragraph of your letter but we do not see any particular advantage in appointing Mr. Scanlon as a Grade I teacher. In any case, the only allowance we make towards any employee at a residential school is either as Manual Training Instructor or in some cases night watchmen.

The Indians have for the last two years been anxious to send their children to the Public School here. This is contrary to the School Acts of B.C. and would not be tolerated by the white residents.\n\nTaku Jack (Chief) has written several letters to the Department asking them to look into the matter of educating the Indian children. When at the coast a short time ago I several times interviewed the Revd. A.E. Green, Inspector of Indian Schools and he is of the opinion that the Indians should be educated and advised me to lay the matter before Mr. Sloan M.P.\n\nI have ample time to teach the Indians, either in the afternoons or evenings as I am free.\nafter 3 o'clock in the winter & 3:30 p.m. in the summer.\n\nI should be very glad of the appointment as my present salary as teacher is only $5.00 a month whereas in the neighbouring schools of the Yukon Territory no male teacher receives less than $20.00 per month or female $17.50.\n\nAs you personally are aware the living here is exceptionally high, even higher than the Yukon Territory.\n\nIt may say should a school be opened the Indians have promised to leave their children here all the year round and to make Athi their headquarters.\n\nThis would be of great benefit to the town as previously our Indians would sell their furs & trade in White Horse & Juneau, and very little benefit was consequently derived by the Athi store-keepers.\n\nThey also state as soon as word was sent to the Teslin Indians that a school was to be opened many of them would also come and make Athi their headquarters.\n\nThe Indians at present residing here are of the Wolf & Bear tribes of Canadian Indians.\nand number about 130 souls including about 40 children.\n\nApparently although Canadian Indians up to the present time have not been under any Dominion jurisdiction.\n\nThe Indians of the adjoining Yukon Territory I believe are looked after by the Mounted Police.\n\nUnfortunately I missed seeing William Sloan Esq M.P. both in Athabasca and I should be very much obliged indeed if you would personally lay the matter before him.\n\nThanking you in anticipation and regretting troubling you. I am,\n\nYours very truly,\nMalcolm R. J. Reid\n\nP.S. It would not be necessary for the Govt. to build a school, as I have no doubt our schoolhouse could be used after regular hours, on payment of a nominal sum for rent & fuel.\nPublic School\nAtlin, B.C.\nSept. 25th\n\nWilliam Sloan, Esq., M.P.\nChamplain, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Sloan:\n\nI have your favor of recent date enclosing letter from the Dept. of Indian Affairs. I am also in receipt of a communication from the Rev'd A.B. Green, Dept. of Indian Schools in which he advises me to lay the matter before you and stating that in his opinion a school should be established here for Indian children. I may say a school would be of benefit to the town as the Indians would then trade their furs here instead of going to White Horse and Juneau.\n\nI regret I again missed seeing you as I arrived in Atlin just after your departure, but His Honour Judge Young is in possession of the necessary facts and he has kindly volunteered to personally lay the matter before you as he expects to leave for Champlain in a few days.

Reid, the Public School teacher here has spoken to me about the education of the Indian children whose parents make Atlin their headquarters and say that some of said parents have frequently spoken to him about having their children taught English and as White children are. He is willing to undertake either after hours or as may be arranged, provided he is remunerated therefor. These Indians claim to belong to the \"Bear\" and \"Wolf\" Tribes and to be Canadian Indians. I have always been led to regard them as American Indians and therefore as having no claim to recognition but I have never had occasion to investigate the matter and they may be Canadian Indians after all. In any event they are quite respectfully behaved people, for Indians, and ambitious to emulate white people in the better and higher sense, in fact more so than any Indians I have ever met and it is a pity not to assist and encourage them, even from the humanitarian standpoint.\n\nI therefore respectfully request you to see what you can do to arrange for their education. The public school building here could be used after hours and a small rental therefor would assist the School Board materially.\n\nRelying on you to use your good offices and influence in this behalf,\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGovernment Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I just saw a man from Atlin, and he says that it is too late to visit there this fall, as the ice is in the river, and we would have to take great chances over thin ice.\n\nI think it is best to postpone the purposed visit till early summer.\n\nI will arrange to meet any date that will be convenient to you. The Chiefs at Skidegate and Chief Dudoward of Port Simpson wished me to convey their regards to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"A.E. Green.\"\nExtract of notes made from interview with Reverend O'Meara re Indians in the Yukon.\n\nHe thinks a Day School should be established at Teslin Lake, whose Indians are Canadians and live say 100 miles from the international boundary. This school should be at Teslin not at Atlin. While at Atlin there are American Indians from Juneau and at times Teslin Lake Indians there are no others, the domicile of the former being Juneau, of the latter Teslin Lake.\n\n(November 1937.)\nAccompanied by the Indian Chief, Taku Jack, we visited the School House, which was opened early last summer in the Indian Village, by the Rev. Father Ollard. We found the Rev. Father superintending the education of eight boy pupils in the primitive but well-appointed school room; everything was in order, maps and instructive pictures and black board hanging on the walls, and desks and benches occupied by the pupils studying English. The boys looked clean, cheerful and intelligent; they average between six and sixteen years of age. To our surprise 'six years old' with class book in hand, stood forth, and distinctly spelt and recited a sentence to the effect that 'the cow did eat the grass' and then the big boy of sixteen gave a good example of his more advanced learning in the English tongue. All of which is highly creditable to the industrious young teacher. During part of the summer there were 30 children under tuition, but owing to funds being very limited, most of them had to go out in the woods for the winter.\n\nWe would observe that Father Ollard for the present is entirely dependent upon local support for the maintenance of the school and board of the pupils. The Atlin Indians belong to the Hlinsit tribe, which is a branch of the Taku tribe. Hlinsit, in the native language, is synonymous with Gentlemen in English, and from all we can see and learn the Indian inhabitants of Atlin do not belie their appropriate nomenclature. Chief Taku Jack's knowledge of ancient history extends to the memory that his Grandfather was the proud possessor of a flint-lock-gun, this might account for a period of three generations, as the gun takes to make a Hlinsit (gentleman) amongst ourselves. We hope that Father Ollards Home and School for Indian children will ere long obtain support from the Dominion Government. These Indian children, the representatives of a race which inhabited the country long before the \"pale-face\" set foot upon its shores call forth the sympathy of their rulers, and under the Dominion Government protects an Indian population of 108,000; and has established 279 schools for their benefit in different parts of Canada, of this number 104 are conducted by the R. C. Church; 86 by Anglicans; 49 by Methodists; 16 by Presbyterians; and the rest are undenominational. Canada recognizes that the Indians have a claim to land, she protects their lands and promotes their welfare, and the reward for her humanity will be amply found in the honest upbringing and civilization of her Indian subjects.\n\nWe wish Father Ollard all the success he deserves in his meritorious efforts to guide and educate the promising young Hlinsits of Atlin.\nSir W.

From the newspaper clipping inclosed it would appear that some of the children are being maintained there and, although Father Allard does not state clearly what assistance he requires, it may safely be taken for granted that a boarding school grant is what he is looking for.\n\nIn July 1906 Mr. School Inspector Green reported to Supt.

The Superintendent was informed that, before the Department could deal with the question, definite information regarding the need for a school at this point, the number and character of the Indians, etc., would be required.\n\nIn October of that year Mr. J.A.

Mr. Fraser says that he was always under the impression that they were American Indians, although they claim to belong to the Bear and Wolf tribes of Canadian Indians. He thinks it would be a pity not to assist and encourage them even from a humanitarian standpoint. This letter was also forwarded through Mr. Sloan.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6384, File 801-1, part 1)\nOn the strength of these communications Mr. Vowell was requested to forward the information asked for as soon as possible.

The Superintendent was told that the Department approves of his suggestion to make a joint visit with the Inspector and that it would await his report before taking any definite action; and we are in receipt of a letter from him dated the 13th instant in which he states that upon inquiry he learns that sometime about the first week in June is the earliest date upon which it would be practicable for himself and Mr. Inspector Green to start.\n\nOnly last month a letter was received from the Secretary of the Atlin District Board of Trade, stating that in accordance with a resolution adopted by that body he submitted to the favourable consideration of the Department the following urgent appeal:\n\n\"That the Atlin Indian school, under the superintendence of the Rev. F. J. Allard, be granted assistance by the Dominion Government from the appropriation fund allowed for Indian schools.\"\n\nThe Board give the following reasons for making this application:\n\n(1) That the school was opened in the Indian village, adjacent to Atlin, on the 2nd of July, 1907, by the Rev.

Then the question of the class of school to be established there arises, whether a boarding or day. If the former, a higher per capita grant than is usually made would be necessary to meet the increased cost of supplies and if a day school a higher salary than is usually paid would be needed to secure the services of a teacher.

The room everything was in order, maps and instructive pictures and black board hanging on the walls, and desks and benches occupied by the pupils studying English. The boys looked clean, cheerful, and intelligent; they average between six and sixteen years of age. To our surprise 'six years old' with class book in hand, stood forth, and distinctly spelt and recited a sentence to the effect that 'the cow did eat the grass' and then the big boy of sixteen gave a good example of his more advanced learning in the English tongue. All of which is highly creditable to the young teacher. During part of the summer there were 20 children under tuition, but owing to funds being very limited, most of them had to go out in the woods for the winter.\n\nWe would observe that Father Ollard for the present is entirely dependent upon local support for the maintenance of the school and board of the pupils.

(RG 10, Volume 6384, File 801-1, part 1)\nAccompanied by the Indian Chief, Taku Jack, we visited the School House, which was opened early in the spring at the Indian Village, by the Rev. Father Oillard. We found the Rev. Father superintending the education of eight boy pupils in the miniature but well appointed school room; everything was in order, maps and instructional pictures and books being hanging on the walls, and desks and benches occupied by the pupils studying English. The boys looked clean, cheerful, and intelligent; they average between six and sixteen years of age. To our surprise \"sixteen old\" with one book in hand, stood forth and distinctly spelt and recited a sentence to the effect that \"the cow did eat the grass\" and then the big boy of sixteen gave a good example of his more advanced learning in the English tongue. All this was highly creditable to their painstaking teacher. During part of the summer there were 20 children under tuition, but owing to funds being very limited, most of them had to go out in the woods for the winter.\n\nWe understand that Father Oillard for the present is entirely dependent upon local support for the maintenance of the school and board of the pupils. The Atlin Indians belong to the Hlengit tribe, which is a branch of the Taku tribe. Hlengit in the native language, is synonymous with Seminole in English, and from all we can see, and learn the Indian inhabitants of Atlin do not bear their appropriate nomenclature. Chief Taku Jack's knowledge of ancient history extends to the fact that his Grandfather was the proud possessor of a flint-lock-gun, this might account for a period of three generations, just the time it takes to make a Hlengit (gentleman) amongst ourselves. We hope that Father Oillard's Home and School for Indian children will ere long obtain support from the Dominion Government. These Indian children, the representatives of a race which inhabited the country long before the \"pale-face\" set foot upon its shores call forth the sympathy of their rulers, and indeed in view of the Dominion Government providing an Indian population of 189,000; and has established 273 schools for their benefit in different parts of Canada, of this number 104 are conducted by the R. C. Church; 86 by Anglicans; 49 by Methodists; 16 by Presbyterians; and the remainder are non-denominational. Canada recognises that the Indians have a claim on her; she protects their lands and...\nIndians or Canadian, the Department wrote the Superintendent approving of his suggestion that he and the Inspector should visit Atlin and report on their request for the establishment of a school there. In October, last, the Superintendent wrote stating that he had not lost sight of this matter but that he and Mr. Green could not conveniently proceed to Atlin before next spring, and there the matter rests.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. O'Hea, who was here in December, last, thinks that a school should be established at Toonin, where all the Indians are Canadians, and not at Atlin, where there are American Indians from Juneau.\n\nI do not see that the Department can deal with Father Allard's application until a report from either the Superintendent or the Inspector of Indian schools is received, and I would suggest that one or both of these officers be directed to proceed there as soon as possible.\n\n(Signed) M.

Father Allard had taken charge of some sixteen pupils. (The Indians of that place being particularly desirous for the education of their children.) The school was carried on in a small cabin, under many difficulties, during the summer months. The children proved to be amenable to discipline, and by their industry and close attention to their studies, making very satisfactory progress.\n\nDuring the winter the Rev. Father at his own cost maintained nine of these pupils. Not only attending to their instruction personally, but also attending to the cooking, etc., with very good results.\n\nOwing to the nomadic habits of these Indians a Day School would be of little use, and we would strongly recommend that the Rev.

Father J. Allard O.M.I., Atlin B.C.\n\nIn looking over the joint report of Rev. Mr. Green and myself, dated 14th instant, written at, and forwarded from Vancouver, I find that we omitted mentioning that we met Father Allard on our return from Atlin and had a long talk with him being impressed with his earnestness and the practical manner in which he viewed the work proposed for the advancement of the Indians amongst whom he has been working as missionary, etc.\n\nIt will be seen that he gives the number of Indians at Atlin as 54, while the number given by Chief Taku Jack to Mr. Green and myself was made up as follows; adults, men 20, women 20; children, boys 32, girls 14 = 56. I consider Father Allard's request most reasonable and recommend the favourable consideration of the same. I may state that at Atlin rough lumber can be purchased for $32.00 per M, and dressed at $40.00 per M.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSupt. of Indian Affairs, B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Affairs,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Atlin Indians whom you visited on the 17th of July last numbered 84 persons. There are 43 adults and 41 children of whom 24 are of school age. The Testlin Indians inhabiting 80 miles from here are of the same tribe and are blood relations to the Atlin Indians. The Testlin Indians number 64. There are 40 adults and 24 children of whom 13 are of school age. You are aware, Sir, of the Atlin Indians' desire to have a Roman Catholic School. Now I have just returned from a trip to Testlin, and I am glad to say that it is a rather easy matter to get the few Testlin children to attend the Atlin school. Already the Great Chief of the tribe and the Testlin Chief's only sons both residing in Testlin have been intrusted to my care for the next school year. Now, this is the situation which calls for immediate government help. There are in this district 37 children of school age. Last year in July I opened a school for them, a maximum of 24 pupils and an average of 14 attended school for the first three months. When the first three months were over in September, the Indians went to the woods for trapping furs. Most of them remained in the woods the whole winter, many even did not come back till June. Under such conditions, school is impossible unless the pupils are taught, fed and cared for in the school itself. This is what I have done in September last year. I took nine pupils with me. I taught and fed them, and cared for them during the whole year. To maintain such an institution, I begged for alms in and out of Atlin. The same school system is the only practical\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6384, File 801-1, part 1)\npractical one for the coming year, and this time it is not only nine pupils but at least 20 pupils that must be taught, fed and cared for. Such work must be carried on in a convenient building. Such work cannot be carried on without the cooperation of two teachers and a cook. I therefore entreat you, Sir, to provide the Atlin and Teslin Indians with a school and some support. The erection of a school in which over 30 children can be taught and cared for, would cost in this country at least three thousand dollars, provided yet the Indians helped in doing the work. The season is too far advanced to put up such a building in time for school opening this year. Therefore, I beg your department to allow at least two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.) for school rent this year. With regard to school support, I wish to inform you that at least 20 pupils will this year be taught, fed and cared for in the Atlin school. Now since sixty dollars per capita is considered a reasonable support where provisions can be had cheaper, I hope a special and greater allowance shall be made for Atlin where victuals cost nearly twice as much as in south western British Columbia. Remark, there was in Atlin last winter a teacher who many a time begged the white people to lend him their dogs in order to send one of his pupils after some wild meat. The same teacher also many a time stretched out a beggar's hand entreating white people to help him buying flour, beans, etc., for himself and his pupils. At last the white people universally signed a petition urging the government to support the Atlin Indian school & its teacher. I hope, Sir, you will attend to this matter & provide us in time with a rented school and a reasonable support for 20 pupils this year. Meanwhile, Sir, I want the subject to be laid before your department for the grant of an Indian Reserve in this district, and the erection of a convenient school if not this fall, at least early next summer.\n\nYours, J.

P.\nD. S. G. I. A.\nOttawa, October 12, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nMr. Supt. Vowell has forwarded a letter from the Rev. J. Allard, of Atlin, B.C., asking for the recognition of the Indian school he has established there as a boarding school, with a suitable per capita grant for at least 30 pupils, in addition to which he requests that a convenient school building to accommodate this number of children as boarders be erected.\n\nHe also asks to be allowed at least $250 for rent of the building they are at present occupying.\n\nMr. Superintendent Vowell states that in looking over the joint report of himself and Mr. Green, which he considers Father Allard's request most reasonable and recommends it to the favourable consideration of the Department.\n\nNo stated amount is given for either the building or the per capita grant, but Father Allard says, that as everything costs twice as much there as in the other portions of the province, a much larger grant would be necessary. Mr. Vowell gives the cost of rough lumber at $32 per M and dressed lumber at $40 per M at Atlin.\n\nMr. Vowell and Mr. Green state in their report that\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6384, File 801-1, part 1)\nthat owing to the nomadic habits of these Indians a day school would be of little use and they strongly recommend that the Rev. Father Allard's praiseworthy efforts be supported by the Department and that a grant be made for the erection of a boarding school at that place.\n\nI find, on referring to previous correspondences on File 296776 that a similar application was made through Mr. Sloan, then member for this district, upon which you made a memorandum to the Minister, setting out that the first point to be decided was whether they are American or Canadian Indians and also as to their religious belief, whether Protestant or Catholic. These two points are not referred to in the joint report, although it may be taken for granted that had they been American or Protestant Indians, they would have mentioned the fact. If the Department allows Father Allard to continue receiving and maintaining Indian children, he will expect to be paid for their support, but before going to any expense in the erection of buildings it would be well for the Department to decide whether these Indians are ripe for boarding school education. Mr. Vowell remarks that he knows of many Indians in British Columbia who are doing fairly well in their uneducated state. The confinement and change of life might have a serious effect upon their health and it would be well to consider this fully before the Department commits itself.\n\nI think two files on this subject are likely to cause confusion.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We can, however, when corresponding with the Victoria Office about the proposed grant emphasize this point. I would propose, if this grant is approved of, to write a letter that will preclude any claims for a Boarding School Grant; which I am convinced should not be paid for this School.

This grant could be made for the current year without pledging the Department as to what course will be taken next year. I think at the same time you should give Father Allard to understand very clearly that we do not favor the establishment of Boarding Schools in these outlying districts, and cannot consent to give anything toward the erection of buildings for a Boarding School nor any assistance in the way of a regular per capita grant.

At that time there were 25 pupils enrolled with an average attendance of 60 and the last return shows an enrolment of only 14 with an average of 8.

They take their children along with them. These are left in the school practically only those whom I can afford to board, for if the trappers ever come to town during these months they remain here but a short time thereby allowing only a few days of school to their children. In summer days the Indians stay here most of the time. But if they are out of fish or meat, they go to the woods with their children for a week or two. In the latter case is the cause for irregular attendance. In the former case is the cause of reduced attendance in winter.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6384, File 801-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nFollowing are the reports as forwarded to the Department about enrolment and attendance at the Attin Indian Day School.\n\nReport ending March 1909:\n- Enrolment: 15\n- Average attendance: 8\n\nJune 1909:\n- Enrolment: 25\n- Average attendance: 10\n\nSeptember 1909:\n- Enrolment: 24\n- Average attendance: 12\n\nDecember 1909:\n- Enrolment: 23\n- Average attendance: 14\n\nMarch 1910:\n- Enrolment: 14\n- Average attendance: 7\n\nIn addition to the 25 pupils herein enrolled were 12 other pupils or more, the parents of whom had made no understanding would likely send their children to our school had it been a boarding school, for they came to far from Attin to send them to the Day School.

J. Allard, O.M.I.,\nAtlin, B.C.\nReport of the Attin Indian Day School\n\nAttin B.C.\n\nFrom June 1909 to June 1910, 26 pupils have attended school.\n\nThey are divided into four general classes:\n\n1) The A.B.C. class\n2) The Spelling class\n3) The Spelling & Reading No. 1\n4) The Spelling & Reading No. 2\n\nIt has 4 pupils. 2 of them, Jackson John and Ward Julia know their letters, write them fairly well on the slate. The other two, Jackson Louis and Jack Jackson Daisy know their letters but imperfectly. Like the preceding ones they have a greater facility for learning what is taught in the class standing, namely the names of the different parts of the body, the objects in the school, etc.\n\n2) The Spelling class\n\nIt has 18 pupils of whom 6 succeeded and 2 are fair and 2 poor. The pupils who succeed are Bean Arthur and Ward Julia who have seen all their Primer during the year. The other 4: Jackson Andrew, Jack Eaton, John Williams, Frank and Jackson George have learned their Primer as far as page 15. The former as well as these can not only spell the words but read without much hesitation and come up with a relatively natural tone the whole sentence contained in their books. They can also copy well the ones from their Primer into their scribbled pages of the book, counting and figuring as far as a hundred is also part of their knowledge, etc. The two fair ones are Paddy Anna and Paddy Mary. They have spelled their Primer as far as page 19. They begin to write words and orally they know very near as much.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6384, File 801-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nmuch as the preceding ones. These two suffer especially from the indifferent way the antipathy of their parents toward white people's education and instruction. The beautiful results obtained with the other children will I hope soon banish this unreasonable view. The two new pupils of this class are Luka Martha and Jack Zacharia Maggie. The former seemed a little too old to learn although only 16. But her greatest obstacle as well as for little boys frequent absence. She claimed she had to work for others to help her widowed mother. And Maggie has an inferior faculty and is too fond of her parents to stay away from them more than a month at time. It was during one he stay at the school that she has managed to learn as far as page 12 in the Primer, wrote the letters of the alphabet, and so did Martha.\n\n3) The Spelling & Reading list\n\nIt has 7 pupils. This class as whole is a success, because of regular attendance, mostly are boasters and they have worked hard like the boys succeeded in the preceding class. Their names are:\n\n- John Andrew\n- Sidney Thomas\n- Johnson Albert\n- Luka John\n- Bean Anna\n- Jackson Mary\n- Luka Anna\n\nAll these pupils have learned to spell from memory and to read relatively well every words and sentences in two different books. The First Primer and the Infant Reader. They also give the synonym or definition of every word by the same with often times their meaning in the Indian language. The writing of the girls is better than that of the boys. But the boys are superior in making numbers and small addition. All the members of this class have also learned everything of the 33 lessons contained in the Xian Doctrine taught by the Catholic Church.\nSpelling and Reading No. 2\n\nThis last and highest class has 5 men in it. They are Jackson Richard, Stanley Joseph, Jack, Jake Henry, Johnson David, and Shorty Thomas.\n\nOnly 2 of these have been regular attendants; the others have been greatly employed by parents for hunting. Only two therefore have well through the First Reader (not Sage's edition). The other three have spelled at different times a chapter here and there. They all can read English and write it fairly well, writing even business letters to trade houses like Eaton etc. I have often received compliments from white people for their very relatively correct conversations. Their knowledge in arithmetic is not beyond addition and simple subtraction. They have mastered several times the whole X'tian Doctrine. They gave the meaning of every word in all their lessons, spelled the same words from memory, have learned the seasons, some messages, weights and some classification of animals.\n\nAs the strict discipline observed in the school may be the cause of some absence, of cases of truancy. But the same discipline has enabled the pupils who attend school to learn something. Your agent from Telegraph creek was an eyewitness last summer of the good work carried on in the Athabaskan Day School.\n\nI ask but one favor from your Department:\n\nDear Sir, It is to be permitted to carry on the same good work which you have kindly enabled me to do. Your kind allowance of $100 & a few gas monthly for the feeding of my pupils who are sitting at my own table.\n\nI have not yet received my salary for quarter ending in March. I hope you will forward me the same along with that June. Last. Yours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Allard of Telegraph Creek have urged the Department to reopen the Atlin Indian Day School. This school was conducted for a few years some time ago and the Department gave financial assistance during the fiscal year 1909-10. His Lordship suggests that the Atlin School be conducted for six months of the year\u2014from April 15 to October 15. I shall be grateful if you would let me have a report of recommendation at your convenience.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. Scott Simpson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nMoreover having accepted that charge, I must convey to the Department the incessant request of the Atlin Indians for a day school. They want to learn how to read and write. Their constant dealings with white people make them realize this need. They claim they feel ashamed to appear so ignorant. In fact they have more reasons for that feeling now than they had in the past. Atlin has become a Summer resort of considerable importance. The numerous tourists who come there inevitably visit the Indian Village, inquire about their school, deprecate the want of it &c. Hence, I hope, that a school that will cost so little and satisfy so many will readily be granted by the Department. It would be sufficient to run it 6 months in the year, viz: from the 15th of April to the 15th of October, the period of time when most of those Indians stay in their village at Atlin.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nE. M. Bunoz, O.M.I.\nMr. Duncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nI beg to inform you that I have found here a smart young student who accepts to take charge of the indian school at Atlin for the Summer from the 15th of April prox. His name is Kenneth V. Meagher who, I think, will make a success of the undertaking.\n\nMr. Meagher however having never studied in a normal school has no teacher's certificate; yet I consider it my duty to entreat you to grant him a salary of $100.00 per month. Considering the high cost of living at Atlin and also the fact that he will have to pay the expenses of his journey in and out, any one who knows the conditions of that section of our country would tell you that the above amount is hardly enough. Of course no teacher could be found at Atlin.\n\nThe old school and desks are there yet, and with some repairs can be made satisfactory for the purpose. I'll accept for the rent the amount usually paid for such. It will be necessary to supply a heater. Books and other school materials for about 16 beginners will be sent, I suppose, direct to Atlin by the Department.\n\nHoping that the school will be a blessing for the Indians and a source of gratification to the Department\n\nI beg to remain\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is the first information I am asked in the matter. I hope you will make it as high as in the Yukon, as living expenses are also high in Atlin.\n\nIt will be easy to find a classroom.

The Indians of Atlin proper are all members of the Roman Catholic Church, and would therefore prefer to have the School conducted by a Priest of their own faith, and I presume that The Reverend Father Allard, who has been in touch with these Indians will himself conduct the teaching in the school. As the open season for trapping Furs closes on the 30th of April, most of the families are resident in Atlin during the six months, that the school would be opened, and the attendance should be good during that period.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nDecember 24th, 1925.\n\nDear Bishop Bunoz:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 17th instant, requesting the re-opening of the Atlin Indian Day School. Some weeks ago I asked Mr. W. Scott Simpson, the Indian Agent at Telegraph Creek, to let me have a report and recommendation in this connection, but his answering communication has not yet been received. I hesitate to give authority to commence this school again until we are convinced of its usefulness.\n\nAs soon as the Department hears from Mr. Simpson, Your Lordship will receive another letter.\n\nWishing you the Compliments of the Season,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

I also heard that the School Master in charge of the summer school was delinquent in his duties, so after closing accounts for July, I left Telegraph Creek on the fifth and arrived in Atlin on the evening of the tenth, inspected school on the eleventh and found that the attendance had dwindled from twelve to three, and after careful investigation I concluded that the fault lay entirely with the School Master who did not keep regular hours and closed the school whenever he desired an outing, but in his report he claimed to have had the school open every day during the past month. I visited the different families with children and induced them to send their children back assuring them that the matter would be submitted to headquarters and a proper teacher substituted as I did not wish to close the school owing to the fact that it would take such a long time to get a new master in and the term would close on October fifteenth. The result was that when I left there were eight children in attendance and I hope that matters may improve until a better man can be found.\n\nW. Scott Simpson.\nOTTAWA, September 9, 1926.\n\nW.

The report which you enclosed, showing that school has been open 60 days during the three months' period ended July 15th, has been noted.

C.\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nSir,\n\nOn my arrival in Atlin on August 11th, I visited the Indian Day School established April 15th, on recommendation of the local Catholic Bishop. The number in attendance had dwindled to three, and the school master, Kenneth Mungier stated that the Indians had gradually withdrawn their children from school and that most of them had moved away to Takla Arm with their families. But on visiting the Indians I found that there were nine children then living within one hundred yards of the school and on questioning the parents I was informed that frequently the master left the school unopened and at times they would not see him before 3 P.M., and then he would leave his house and go to town and would not return until 8 A.M. I said nothing to him for the moment but requested him to submit a report on instructions from the opening day April 15th to end of first quarter, July 15th. This statement I am enclosing herewith for your perusal. After doing this there were 64 days in the quarter - School opened for 6 days and four days holiday. After receiving this statement I confronted him with the information given by the Indians, and he then admitted that he was ill at the time and kept the school closed for a week, but would not admit that he did not keep proper hours. I told him that I would bring the Indians before him if he wished to hear them repeat the accusations, but he said it was not necessary. I told him that I would have to report the matter to the Department but he made no plea in defense, and when I talked to the Indians and assured them that a more suitable master would be sent in the coming year if attendance justified the keeping up of the school, they agreed to let school continue just as they are now and that they would attend education, and for the past week all of the Indians in the vicinity, the number of nine are in regular attendance.\n\nI am leaving tomorrow for Telegraph Creek as the School opens on the 1st of September under the management of a new teacher Miss Turvey and I am anxious to have as many as possible enrolled. Kenneth Mungier in my opinion is unfit for the duty of teaching the Indian children; he is inclined to slack and will not keep regular hours but unfortunately the season is so far advanced that we will have to let him complete the second quarter which ends October 15th, as there is no time in which to secure a proper teacher to relieve him. He is owing a number of merchants for supplies and states that he has not received a salary cheque to date from the Department as they have practically closed down on his activities further credit and they have refused to make inquiry as to the true state of this situation as they say that he has already received his cheque and has cashed it in some other quarter. Possibly after my reconnoissance he will make an endeavour to follow out the rules as he has been told that the Indians are instructed to keep account of the attendance and report if he fails in his duty during my absence.\n\nI am surprised that a mere boy should have been sent to fill the position where functionality should be the outstanding feature.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Scott Simpson\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I quite understand the Indians in the extreme north of B.C. are hesitant about sending their children as far south as our Fraser Lake School. Our educational programme for this area is, as yet, undetermined, but I am free to state that it is not the practice to allow grants for the education of Indian children who are enrolled at institutions outside of Canada.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

It was admitted that the work of the Anglican Church is increasing there while that of the Roman Catholic Church under Rev. Father Allard, O.M.I., is not extensive. Rev. Father Allard, O.M.I., stated that his Church would be willing to give up any religious activities that might be prejudicial to the Anglican interests there, especially if the Department would be willing to make provision for a residential school for say 50 or 92 Catholic children of school age at a place called Six-Mile point which is on the right bank of Stikine River about 6 miles below Telegraph Creek.\nATLIN, B.C.\nSeptember 3rd 1929.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept.

He stated that he would like to put in a priest to teach the children during the summer months or that we should increase the salary sufficient to warrant the employment of a suitable teacher, the salary to be the same as is paid in the Yukon, whatever that may be.\n\nI am of the opinion that this point is well taken as it will be noted in a communication from the Indian Agent, dated 29th August, forwarded to this office, he speaks of this school at Atlin being run by a young gentleman who had no control over the children and the school was looked upon as rather a joke by the whites and also the Indians who are most intelligent.\n\nAs the living expenses in the Stikine Agency are almost as high as they are in the Yukon, I feel it would be advisable to provide a salary sufficiently large to warrant the employment of a competent teacher.\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE.\n\nVancouver, B.C., 27th Aug. 1927.\n\nLiard Patrol 1926-1927.\n\nThere are a large number of children growing up in this district, seven of them being half-breeds.

Perry, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nSir:\n\nAs I told you yesterday, the Atlin Indian Day School can be re-\nopened next summer. Three years ago, in the spring of 1929, the Department\nof Indian Affairs at Ottawa informed me in their letter to the Right Rev.\nBishop Dunne, of Prince Rupert, that they would grant $90.00 a month for\nteacher's salary during the few months of the year that the school could\nbe attended to in Atlin.\n\nBut I found conditions in Atlin in 1929 did not permit me to open\nthe school that year. The reason is that the Indians having been deprived\nof their school for nineteen years - since I had left them in 1910 - they\nhad become so discouraged in their waiting that many of them had departed\nfrom Atlin.\n\nI have spent the four last summers in Atlin, with the result that\nthe natives are now hoping to see me again doing the good work which I did\nfrom the year 1907 to 1910, have come back to Atlin and are expecting me to\nteach their children during at least four months of the year.\n\nTrusting this request will meet your approbation and that of my\nold friends in the Department at Ottawa - I hope to remain for many years\nto come a friendly collaborator of our Canadian Indian Department,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJoseph Allard\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6384, File 801-1, part 1)\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to advise the Department that I received a call at this office on the 27th instant from Reverend Joseph Allard, O.M.I., who wished me to request from the Department the desirability of having the Atlin Indian Day School, Stikine Agency, re-opened during next summer for which a grant of $90.00 per month was requested covering the period of a few months of the time when the school would be attended at Atlin by Indian children. I requested Father Allard to kindly put into writing his request in order that the same may be presented to the Department for consideration. This he has done and duplicate of his letter, dated December 28th, instant, addressed to me, is forwarded to the Department. I have not received at this office any special report from Mr. Indian Agent Harper Reed bearing upon the need for the opening of the Atlin School, but it is quite possible that the Department may have received from the Agent from time to time, reports bearing upon matters affecting this school. Perhaps the Department will be good enough to give Father Allard's letter due consideration and advise me of its decision in order that I may communicate with Father Allard as well as the Indian Agent in regard to the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas. G. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure:-\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 7, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 15/12/27565 of the 30th ultimo, enclosing a communication from Rev. Joseph Allard requesting that the Atlin Indian Day School be reopened during next summer and that a grant be provided to pay the salary of a teacher.\n\nIn reply I regret that it will not be possible to provide a grant towards the cost of reestablishing any Indian day school. Our funds will be extremely limited and provision can only be made to carry on existing schools. I regret that Father Allard's request cannot be favourably considered, and I shall be pleased if you will inform him accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. C.

(RG 10, Volume 6384, File 801-1, part 2)\nAtlin, B.C.\nJuly 20th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Rev. Jos. Allard, O.M.I., who is a brother of the Rev. Father E. Allard of the Cassiar R.C. Mission, is in charge of the Atlin R.C. Mission located in Indian Town Atlin.\n\nPractically all the Indians here belong to his Church, and as usual, a call is always paid the Rev. Father when this end of the Agency is visited.\n\nYesterday it was discovered he has started a small Mission Day School of his own, and has a Miss Conroy, whose parents live in the Town, in charge of same, and the children are receiving some benefit from the schooling.\n\nEnclosed is submitted a letter received from the Rev. Father requesting aid for the school, and that he might be granted permission to take two of the children, i.e., Helen age 16 and Louis age 13 of the David Johnson Indian Family, to Skagway this winter for further schooling there, under the Sisters care.\n\nThe question of taking Canadian Indian Children to Skagway, S.F. Alaska, for schooling purposes, came up for attention last Fall, and the Rev. Father was instructed to obtain the Department's permission, ere such steps were taken, and this he seems to be now doing in the attached letter.\n\nTherefore the matter is submitted for your consideration, as there will be no expense attached to these children going to Skagway perhaps it might be considered possible for them to be schooled at that point. The parents were interviewed, and they of course, were only too glad for their children to attend a school no further away than Skagway, and it is expected that if these children are allowed that privilege, other families will claim the same favour.\n\nThe new idea of using a local School mistress is very good, and his request of $100.00 for the year (summer) is reasonable.\n\nMay the Rev. Father be written to direct, as my visit to this end of the Agency is now drawing to a close, and there will not be time enough to receive your reply ere leaving.\n\nI am,\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"Harper Reed\"\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nThe Asst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nVictoria, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to refer to Departmental letter dated January 7, 1933, No. 158-4-1, in regard to the inability of the Department to comply with the request of Rev. Jos. Allard, O.M.I., Atlin, B.C., for a grant toward the salary of a teacher to conduct a day school for the benefit of the Indians at Atlin. In this connection I now beg to transmit herewith copy of a letter received from Mr. Harper Reed, Indian Agent at Telegraph Creek, Stikine Agency, dated July 20th, ultimo, the same being accompanied with original of a letter addressed to the Secretary, Indian Affairs, Canada, by Rev. Father Allard, this letter being sent herewith, and both communications will be self explanatory. Perhaps the Department would be kind enough to consider the representations made in these letters and advise me of its decision so that I may be in a position to reply to Mr. Agent Reed's communication. I may say that if it can be made possible I would like to support the effort which Father Allard is endeavoring to make in connection with his work in the Atlin district. The Department will be aware that there is very great demand for some progressive civilizing work in the northern part of British Columbia in the vicinity of the Yukon, particularly in the Stikine Agency, and I feel if at all possible we should do everything possible to encourage the promotion of organized life amongst the nomadic Indians of that northern territory, where conditions are anything but satisfactory. It is greatly to the credit of the Roman Catholic Church authorities that they are endeavoring to take hold of a very difficult situation in that area and I feel I should lend every reasonable support where the prospective work shows promise of success.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP/AC\n\nEncl.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6384, File 801-1, part 2)\nOttawa, August 15, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 15/12/30560 of the 4th instant, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from Mr. Harper Reed, Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, accompanied by the original of a letter from Rev. Jos. Allard, O. M. I., requesting that a grant be provided towards the salary of a teacher for the summer months at the school which is being conducted at Atlin for the benefit of the Indian children at that point.\n\nThe Department has had a similar request from Father Allard. He was informed that, as our Appropriation this year had been so greatly reduced, it would not be possible to provide the grant asked for to give any assistance this present summer. The Department has found it necessary to close a number of Indian summer schools this year. In addition, a number of regular Indian day schools will be discontinued for the coming school year. I regret that it will not be possible to provide the funds required to assist in the conducting of a day school at Atlin this year.\n\nWith reference to the request made by Father Allard for a grant towards the tuition of Indian children at a school conducted by the Rev. Sisters at Skagway, I have to say that it is not the practice to allow grants for education of Indian children who are enrolled at institutions outside of Canada. The Department is aware of the services and interest being taken by Father Allard in the Indians at Atlin, but it is regretted that, owing to present financial conditions, it is not possible to provide any financial assistance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nDear Father Allard,\n\nA reply has just been received from Ottawa regarding some assistance towards the upkeep of your local school teacher, in Indian Town.\n\nIt is with much regret that I have to inform you that the Department cannot entertain the matter this year, but later on - perhaps. They state that matters have come to such a pass that some schools are being closed, so matters must be rather sad.\n\nIn the letter also is mentioned that some help was asked for some Indian Children that were to attend the R.C. School at Skagway, a matter that I have not yet been acquainted with. It is sincerely hoped that these children are not from the Stikine Agency, as a ruling on that matter was given to you some time ago, which up to the present, as far as this Office is concerned, is still in force.\n\nYour Brother with the Rev Father Boise have just left this point after a very good summer's work on the \"inside\". Father Boise has met with general approval and I have been glad of his company.\n\nWith my very kindest regards,\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Rev Jos. Allard O.M.L.\nATLIN, B.C.\nTo A. V. McKenzie Esq.,\nSecretary Indian Affairs Ottawa Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nAs I notified you on July 21st last, I have directed a school in Athabasca for the benefit of the Indians.\n\nI had to have the help of a teacher whom I paid out of my own pockets.\n\nTwo girls are over sixteen years of age and they must without further delay receive more instruction than what they have received in less than two months. Also a boy over nineteen.\n\nNow as the parents objects to sending their pupils to Fraser Lake, I have, as I already told you, made arrangements to have those three pupils attend the Indian Boarding School in Skagway.\n\nMy love for the moral welfare of these natives has in the past made me a teacher and a cook for them during three years. If necessary I will lay aside labor in order to form moral women among these Indians.\n\nWhat do you think of the zeal of your little agent? Read his letter! Yours truly,\n\nAllard\n\nIndian Affairs.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Jos. Allard, O.M.I.,\nAtlin, B.C.\nI thank you for your 158-4-1 of October 13th.\n\nIt was not my intention at anytime to ask for help in sending Athin Indian children to the Rev. Sisters' School in Skagway, Alaska, if opened this year.\n\nI meant simply to tell you what stand had the Stikine Agency Official taken in this matter.\n\nHis ruling: \"No Athin Indian child will be allowed to go out of the Agency to be educated.\"\n\nI have sent you his letter to see where he speaks of his \"ruling.\" Of course \"his ruling\" does not apply when the Catholic Indian children Anderson of the Stikine Agency, his own agency, were sent to the Protestant Indian School of Carcross, Yukon Agency for three years in 1929, 30, and 31.\n\nAgent Reid's rulings, colored by his prejudices, apply only against Catholic children going into a Catholic School. Since the Department in Ottawa cannot do anything to educate the Athin Indians, deny the right to the Stikine Agent to interfere in my behalf to educate where I can, provided I pay the bill.\n\nYour sincerely,\n\nJoseph Allard (signature)\n\nIndian Affairs.

J. Allard, O.M.I., of Atlin, B.C., which was brought up by Father Allard during my visit to Atlin in company with Mr. Reed. Both Mr. Reed and myself, in talking it over with Father Allard decided that it was a matter for the Department to consider for payment, and as it was originally authorized by the Indian Agent, it was considered that they were matters that would have been authorized by the Indian Agent, had it not been for the fact that Atlin is so far away from Telegraph Creek, and the matters were urgent, and there was no opportunity for the Rev. Father to refer them to the Agent first.\n\nThis expenditure was made and was necessary, and the two children mentioned are now in Lejac School, this being the nearest Catholic School to Atlin. The charge for expenses paid by Father Allard to the local school mistress is also quite in order, and the same was good and necessary work, as otherwise these children had no possible chance of any schooling, there being no room available at Lejac School for such numbers, and in addition the cost of sending them there would have been very high, there being so many.\n\nThe fare mentioned of the Atlin Girl, Nancy Johnson, from Juneau, was also a necessary expenditure as this girl's mother had deserted her husband and was in bad company at Juneau, and would probably have prostituted the girl. I therefore recommend that Father Allard be reimbursed in all three cases.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Geo. S.

I am returning the voucher which you submitted, in order that you may have a new one prepared, and also the receipts in connection with the payments made for the school at Atlin.

Servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B. C.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nVancouver, B.C., Dec. 12, 1901.\n\nThe Hon. the Super't General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have the honor to submit a brief statement of the educational needs of the Indians of Bella Bella, B.C., and to request the aid of the Government in meeting the same.\n\nBella Bella is an important point on the North West Coast of British Columbia, centrally located; population 319, with 52 children on the roll of the Day School \u2014 26 boys and 26 girls. At certain seasons the attendance is good, but the work of the teacher is seriously handicapped by the frequent and prolonged absence of the children, who accompany their parents to the salmon fishing and other employments. In fact the Day School may be said to be in effective operation only about three months in the year.\n\nUnder these circumstances it is felt that the only way of dealing with the problem is by means of a Boarding School, where the children will be under continuous instruction for at least nine months in the year. I beg, therefore, to make respectful application for a grant of $3000 (three thousand dollars) toward the erection of a suitable building, and a further grant of $60 (sixty dollars) per capita for thirty pupils. As the case is an urgent one it is important that these amounts should be in the supplementary estimates to come before the ensuing Parliament.\nI have been given to understand that Mr. Todd, the Indian Agent, will endorse a grant of $30. per capita from the Government and $30. per capita in provisions, etc., from the Indians; but I respectfully submit that this is an impossible proposition at Bella Bella, sandwiched in as it is between Metlakatla and Alert Bay, each with its $120 per capita, although the distance to either place is very considerable. I have elsewhere expressed the opinion that the Indians could be induced to contribute something in food and clothing toward the support of their children; but to lay so heavy a burden upon them at the start would defeat the very end we have in view.\n\nThis application will be forwarded by the Rev. Dr. Sutherland, General Secretary of Missions, with such endorsement as he may be disposed to give, and I trust it will receive the favorable consideration of the Superintendent General.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(signed) Robert Whittington.\nThe Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nThe enclosed statement and request from the Rev. R. Whittington, D.D., Superintendent of Indian Missions in British Columbia, is respectfully commended to the favorable consideration of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nHaving had personal knowledge of condition of affairs at Bella Bella, and other points on the Coast, I can unhesitatingly endorse Dr. Whittington's statement as regards the inadequacy of Day School work, and the necessity which exists for a Boarding School to meet the needs of children of school age.\n\nIt will be seen that the amount asked for buildings is very moderate, and it may be supposed the building would be very inferior. I shall take the liberty, therefore, of submitting to the Department, in the course of a week or ten days, a suggested plan of a building to accommodate from 30 to 50 pupils, and hope it may meet with approval.\n\nWith the earnest hope that provision can be made in the present years' estimates for this urgently needed Boarding School.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 9th January, 1902\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nRev. Dr Sutherland encloses a request from Rev. R. Whittington, Supt. of Missions in British Columbia for the establishment of a boarding school at Bella-Bella and asks for a grant of $3000 towards the erection of a suitable building and that provision be made for the maintenance of thirty pupils at $60 per capita.\n\nAs this matter has come up in another form I do not consider that any action is necessary until the Minister has given his decision in regard to increasing the number of boarding schools in British Columbia.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I trust, however, that the Superintendent General will keep the matter in mind and include the necessary amount in the Estimates a year from now.\n\nAs I had been hoping that the amount asked for might be voted this year, I had a plan prepared for the necessary building, and am sending a \"Blue Print\" copy under separate cover. This will show that our ideas were not extravagant.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Honorable the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOTTAWA, 5th February, 1902\n\nRev.

C.\nJanuary 6th, 1903.\n\nTo the Honorable\nA. R. Macquill, M.P.,\nNew Westminster.\n\nHon. Sir:\n\nI have applied to the Honorable the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, for a Boarding School Building Grant of $3,000.00 for Bella Bella, and for a further annual Grant of $80.00 per capita for 30 pupils.\n\nBella Bella is an important point, as you know; its population 310, with 53 children on the Day School roll. The Day School is efficient for not more than three months in the year, the children being compelled to accompany their parents in their hunting, fishing and berrying work the other nine months. The only solution of this problem is the establishment of a Boarding School to care for the children in the absence of the parents.\n\nThe Indian Agent (Mr. Todd) endorses this application to the extent of two-thirds of the building grant and 30 pupils at $80.00 or $2400.00.\n\nThere is no school of any kind at Bella Bella, as the Indians have moved from the old to the new village. The Day School Building Grant might be merged into the Boarding School Grant.\n\nI respectfully request your valuable assistance in securing this grant and have it put into the supplementary estimates coming before the coming session of Parliament.\n\nI am,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nR. Whittington\n\nIndian Affairs.

So far as that illness was concerned I think the parents of the children did well to keep the pupils at home until all danger had passed.\n\nRelative to the remark made by the inspector as to the parents being compelled to send their children to school when the parents are at home I may state that I agree with Mr. Green's suggestion and may add that from time to time the several Indian Agents throughout the superintendency have been\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nbeen granted discretionary power to put the regulations relating to the education of Indian children in force to compel a better attendance at such schools when there is no good and sufficient reason for the parents to offer for the absence of their children.\n\nThe stationery referred to may be sent to \"Miss Mary A. Beatty, % Indian Agent, Metlakatla, B. C.\"\n(Bella Bella)\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B.

Miss Tranter will be required to send in monthly reports on her field matron work and you will be good enough to so inform her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIver Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to your request for a report on the letter sent in by Mr. Agent Fougner enclosing one addressed to him by Rev. Dr. Spencer asking for an increase in the salary of Miss Tranter, teacher of the Indian school at Bella Bella I beg to say that the application for the increase is based on the fact that she is doing field matron work and nursing on the reserve.\n\nMiss Tranter was granted an increase in October, last, and is now in receipt of a salary of $600.00 per annum. When Mr. Fougner made the previous application for an increase he asked that her salary be placed at $720.00 a year. As she had only been receiving $500.00, an increase of $100.00 was given her.\n\nMiss Tranter has been nearly twenty years in the service of the Department and her work during that time has been most satisfactory. A salary of $600.00 as teacher would not be excessive and I think the Department would be quite justified in making her an extra allowance for her field matron work.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Spencer, also Fouger, in connection with Miss Tranter, for an additional allowance of $120.00 per annum for field nurse work.

Spencer of Fort Simpson.\n\nMiss Tranter is now teaching the Indian school at Bella Bella, and receives a yearly salary of $600.00 from the Department. She is most deserving, and I can endorse all that Mr. Spencer says.\n\nI might suggest that she, in addition to her salary as teacher, be allowed $120.00 per annum for the work she does as field-nurse, outside of school. It is not much, but to me, it is better to ask for little and get it, than to ask for much, and not get it. I know that if you can do anything for Miss Tranter, it will be most pleasing to the Methodist Missionary Society, as well as to myself.\n\nMost respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nPort Simpson, Nov. 21st\n\nMr. D.

She has always been reported as an excellent teacher and doing good work among the Indians, visiting their homes and looking after their general welfare, both in sickness and health. In the list of salaries submitted by the Rev. Mr. Farrier he places the remuneration for this school at $500.00 a year. I think in view of Miss Tranter's long and faithful service that she is entitled to consideration.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6384, File 802-1, part 1)\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to report that I have often been impressed with the thought that of all those who work for the betterment of the Indians, no one is doing a greater or more self-sacrificing work than the conscientious teacher of Indian schools.\n\nWhile no one is likely to contradict a statement of this nature, it is nevertheless true that the compensation paid to teachers by church or state is less than what is paid to others.\n\nThe Bella Coola Agency is fortunate in its only school teachers; and of these I desire to bring to the attention of the Department Miss Kate Treiter of Bella Bella. For more than twenty years she has now labored in the schoolroom, and, I understand, that she besides is doing work as a field-nurse. If the Department could increase her salary to $60.00 per month or $720 per annum, I know that the recipient would be most deserving.\n\nIt may be in place, as a basis of comparison, to mention that here in Bella Coola are three public schools, whose average attendance is below 15 pupils; the Province pays each teacher at the rate of $80.00 per month or $960.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I feel certain, however, that they would be prepared to meet the Department half way in any expenditure on improvements which may be decided upon following Inspector Barry's reports of the last two years.\n\nRe Bella Bella: I may say that I was in the village just three or four days before Inspector Barry's visit. I would like to have the privilege of discussing this case with Mr. Sutherland and yourself when I next visit Ottawa. I have been looking over my engagements and expect that I shall be in Ottawa sometime about the middle of November. I do not hesitate to say, however, that the report is extremely biased and that if Miss Green's work is as satisfactory and shows as much improvement in this academic year as it did in the last one, we certainly will not dismiss her in June, 1934.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth Beaton\n\nEJB.MLT\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. G. H. BARRY, INSPECTOR OF INDIAN SCHOOLS, ON HIS VISIT TO THE BELLA BELLA DAY SCHOOL, ON MAY 13th, LAST.\n\nNAME: Miss Marjorie Green\n\nHEALTH: Stated to be excellent. Seems to me to be suffering from strain now, and was in tears several times during my inspection.\n\nSUCCESS: A complete failure in my opinion. The teacher has too many children to reach in the first place, and with only an Interim Second Class Certificate and no Summer School work, is in a very poor position to deal with what is admitted to be a very difficult situation.\n\nI suggested to the teacher that she should attend the Indian and Rural Course as well as the Primary Course at this year's Provincial Summer School. This she did not do, and I now am given to understand that the local Missionary does not approve of my suggestion that this young teacher should attend a Summer Course. My advice, which is the same as that given by all School Inspectors in such cases, was given in the interest of the girl herself in order that she might have some chance of remaining in the teaching profession. As it is, I am not prepared to recommend her for her Permanent Certificate in this Province.\n\nI must recommend a change of teacher here, the present teacher, Miss M. Green to be given plenty of notice that she will not be required after June, 1934. This girl belongs to the Young People's organizations, plays games, and teaches Sunday School, Etc. here, and is reported to me by the Missionary to be the best teacher they ever had. Unfortunately, she does not know how to teach Indians and has, from a professional point of view, been a complete failure here. The Missionary, Mr. Gibson, is now elderly and does not quite understand that we require in our schools. I would ask that the United Church Mission Officials, the Rev. Mr. Benton or other responsible person, be asked to nominate a teacher with the required qualifications to open school here in September, 1934.\nOttawa, September 12, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the authorities of the United Church of Canada have engaged the services of Miss Marjory E. Green for the position as teacher of the Bella Bella Indian Day School for the current school year. Miss Green is a qualified teacher and is highly recommended. The Department approves of her appointment, with salary at the rate of $95 per teaching month.\n\nI have to request that you will give Miss Green any assistance you can in her work at this school, where it is hoped she will meet with every success.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Green of Abbotsford, B.C. for that position. I expect ere this the school is in running order. She is a qualified teacher with a very good report from the Inspector and she is highly recommended by her pastor. We have secured her services at the rate of $95 per teaching month.\n\nOwing to the lack of time we had to take immediate action in this case, and I trust the Department will ratify what we have done. Kindly notify Indian Agent Fougner of your action in this matter.\n\nAs far as I know this completes the list of appointments for which we are responsible in regard to nomination.

We are passing this information on to Mr. Barnet, who is at present in Manitoba, and will advise Miss Gingrich that the Department has approved of her transfer.\n\nMr. Barnet will doubtless forward a nomination for the Port Simpson school within a short time.\n\nYours most faithfully,\n\nMLT.\nOttawa, June 13, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the authorities of the United Church of Canada have arranged for the transfer of Miss M. Gingrich, at present senior teacher at the Port Simpson Indian Day School, to take up duties as teacher at the Bella Bella Indian Day School for the coming academic year. The Department is approving of this proposed transfer and will allow Miss Gingrich salary at the rate of $105 per teaching month - the same rate as she is at present receiving at Port Simpson. I have to request that, when Miss Gingrich takes up duties at Bella Bella, you will give her every assistance you can in her work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B. C.\nOttawa, June 13, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Rev. Arthur Barner, dated the 9th instant, in further reference to the transfer of Miss M. Gingrich, at present senior teacher at Port Simpson, as teacher of the Bella Bella Indian Day School for the coming school year and also regarding the salary that will be allowed.\n\nThe Department will be pleased to approve of the transfer of Miss Gingrich as teacher at Bella Bella and will allow her salary at the same rate as she has been receiving at Port Simpson, viz.: $105 per teaching month.\n\nMr. Barner states that he is in correspondence with a young woman with splendid qualifications, who, he thinks, will accept the position at Port Simpson at $95 per teaching month, and that there will therefore be no increase in the aggregate amount allowed for salaries owing to the transfer of Miss Gingrich.\n\nPlease inform Miss Gingrich of the approval granted for her transfer to Bella Bella and the salary that will be paid her. We are advising the local Indian Agent of the arrangements made for teaching services at Bella Bella for the next school year and the salary allowed and requesting him to give Miss Gingrich every assistance he can in her work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

H. J. Beaton, concerning the transfer of Miss M. Gingrich to the Bella Bella School in British Columbia, has been forwarded to me for reply.\n\nIn a letter which I received last year in regard to the matter of increase of salary for Miss Gingrich I understood it to be the policy of the Department to make the increase to the teacher and not to the School. It was with this understanding that I nominated Miss Gingrich for Bella Bella expecting that her salary would continue at that point at the rate of $105.00 per teaching month and that whoever is appointed to succeed her at Port Simpson would commence on the minimum salary, just as she did.\n\nI am in correspondence with a very fine young woman with splendid qualifications who I think will accept the position at Port Simpson for $95.00 per teaching month.\n\nI trust the Department will see its way clear to appoint Miss Gingrich to the school at Bella Bella as we are making a sincere endeavor to bring these schools up to the very best possible standard.\n\nI quite appreciate the financial position in which the Department finds itself and we will co-operate in every way possible.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, suggesting the transfer to the Bella Bella School of Miss M. Gingrich, at present senior teacher at Port Simpson.\n\nBefore making a final decision on this transfer, permit me to point out that Miss Gingrich is being allowed a salary of $105 a month at Port Simpson, while a salary of $95 a month only is provided for the teacher at Bella Bella.\n\nOur appropriation this year is so limited it is extremely difficult to increase the salary rate at any school. I would, therefore, appreciate your again considering the matter, with a view to determining whether or not a suitable teacher could be secured for Bella Bella at the same salary as previously allowed.\n\nIt is presumed that, in the event of a transfer being made, Miss Gingrich's successor at Port Simpson would expect a salary of $105 a month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This I think will be a very fine appointment, and I have great pleasure in nominating Miss Gingrich for the post at her present salary.\n\nWhen we engaged Miss Gingrich and sent her out from Ontario it was for a two year term. I have been in correspondence with her for some months trying to secure a continuation of her services, and this is the result. I will keep in close touch with Mr. Collison in regard to a successor at Port Simpson.\n\nWith kindest wishes,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I vaccinated 24 of them. The other two were successfully vaccinated last year. The general health was good. One child had discharging ears and three had hypertrophied tonsils. One child of school age is sick at home with pulmonary tuberculosis, following a severe attack of pneumonia. During the winter, she had a very severe attack of influenza. The children seem to appreciate their new teacher and are attending better than they have for a long time.\n\nOn February 29th, I visited the school at China Hat and examined 17 children present. The general health and condition of the children was good. One child had some eye trouble and is quite deaf. Several would be better for having their tonsils removed. One was suffering from tonsillitis at the time. Fred Brown, who was in the hospital so long is in fine shape. Every sinus has closed and his skin is quite whole. Benjamin Brown who went to Vancouver to have his foot straightened is in very good condition now. Polly Brown is in good condition. All the openings have healed but one gland has enlarged and will require treatment. Alice the oldest girl was married last winter and was away with her husband when I was there. I understand though that she is quite well. I am very much gratified to see such good results in these very difficult cases.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I gave you the best advice I could at the time, and suggested that you should obtain permission through your Indian Agent to teach the whole of the Grade 1 children as one class in the morning, and have the children in the other Grades come in the afternoon. I also reported to the Department along the above lines. I should certainly advise you to take the matter up with Mr. Indian Agent Pounger at once.\n\nIt is noted that you did not take my advice with regard to attendance at the Provincial Summer School held in Victoria this year. This advice was given to you in your own interests. Should there not be a very marked change for the better in the standing of your school when I next inspect it, I shall not be able to recommend the continuation of your Interim Teaching Certificate.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to the Department of Indian Affairs, through the Assistant Indian Commissioner for B.C., and a copy is being sent to the Department of Education, Victoria, who are interested in the matter in so far as your B.C.

A copy of my answer is also attached.\n\nMay I be permitted to draw your attention to my reports on Bella Bella Day School, Bella Coola Agency, made after inspections on May 14th 1932, and May 13th 1933.\n\nThough I consider Miss Green very unlikely to ever make a satisfactory teacher, and strongly recommend that she be replaced after the end of the present school year in June 1934, the permission she asks for to have the children attend on the half day system might well be granted as a temporary measure. This, as you will see from my report, was recommended after my last inspection.\n\nThe question as to whether this girl should be recommended for a B.C. Permanent Certificate will be taken up with the Education Department in Victoria at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H.

(RG 10, Volume 6384, File 802-1, part 1)\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith the original of a duplicate letter received from Captain Gerald H. Barry, District Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C., covering copies of correspondence had between himself and Miss Marjorie E. Green, teacher of the Indian Day School at Bella Bella in the Bella Coola Agency.\n\nI shall be pleased to be advised if there is any question occurring to the Department in connection with this correspondence.\n\nI may say it is my own view that where teachers located at remote schools in the province are required to attend Summer School, some provision should be made whereby at least a portion of their expenses should be covered by Departmental appropriation. I may say I am fully aware of the advantage to any teacher in attending the provincial Summer School at which a special course is given by our Inspector with the approval of the Department. There is no doubt that these courses have decided beneficial effect both on the teachers themselves as well as the pupils, but the cost of steamer transportation, room and board and other incidental expenses should not, in my opinion, be a burden of any teacher especially when he or she has giving up a portion of their vacation period which should be devoted to relaxation from teaching and other mental strain for which such vacation is undoubtedly designed.\n\nMoreover the expenses of teachers from their homes to remote villages are not paid by the Department but from the salaries of the teachers which are not too high in any event. I am emphatically opposed to any measure of coercion in the matter of attendance of our Indian school teachers at Summer School unless financial provision is made to that end. Were such provision made, however, the Department would be in a better position to require its teachers to attend the Summer School.\n\nI feel that Captain Barry is actuated by the sincerest motives to advance efficiency of our schools and teachers. However, I think that something should be done, if possible, to encourage attendance of teachers at Summer School under more favorable conditions than they are called upon to attend at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnclosures:\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6384, File 802-1, part 1)\nOttawa, November 29, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter directed to Mr. Barry by Miss Green, teacher of the Bella Bella Indian Day School. It appears from this letter that there is an attendance ranging between 40 and 54 and, as a result, the classroom is overcrowded. The teacher suggests that half this number of children attend school in the morning and the balance in the afternoon.\n\nThe Department approves of this arrangement, and you should co-operate with the teacher with a view to determining those who should attend in the morning and those who should attend in the afternoon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nI. Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nOttawa, November 29, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your 15/31967 of the 20th instant, with reference to the Bella Bella Indian Day School.\n\nIn view of the number of children at this school, the Department considers that it would be advisable for the teacher to have half the number of children attend in the morning and the balance in the afternoon. Mr. Agent Fougner is being so advised.\n\nNo doubt, it is beneficial for teachers of Indian day schools to attend summer school, but, at the same time, the Department is not prepared to insist upon this action in the case of any teacher who is unable to incur the necessary expense. It has not been the practice of the Department to pay such expenses.\n\nIt has been strongly represented to the Department that Inspector Barry has not been absolutely fair to Miss Green. In the first place, the school was inspected on a Saturday - May 13, 1933 - which was not a regular school day, and it is probable that, for this reason, the classes were more or less disorganized. We have been further advised that, as a result of a conversation with Mr. Barry previous to the inspection, the teacher entered the classroom in a very nervous condition. As a result, it is quite likely her work in Mr. Barry's presence was not as satisfactory as reports received from other sources indicate it is.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

She has not been particularly happy in Port Simpson.

C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nRe: Bella Bella Indian Day School\n\nI anticipated the type of answer that you have given in regard to the erection of a new day school at Bella Bella and we must bow to the inevitable. There seems to be no question of the need. Miss Perry, the present teacher, is carrying on her work by having different groups morning and afternoon. Her morning enrolment was during the last term - 29, and the afternoon - 40. It is expected that some of the older pupils will enter Residential Schools this fall, but there is a considerable group of younger children of school age who must be provided for.\n\nWould the Department consider the appointment of a second teacher who could, in the meantime, carry on a second class-room in the Council Hall? Beyond a small sum which would be required for seats and blackboards - which will be needed when the new school is built anyway - there would be only seven months' salary to be found out of the budget for this fiscal year. Besides, a teacher could be appointed on a temporary basis and the experiment would prove whether or not there is really a necessity for two teachers in the village, as Captain Barry insists.\n\nHoping that this may have your favorable consideration,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MLP\nOttawa, June 25, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, regarding the providing of a salary for a second teacher at the Bella Bella Indian Day School.\n\nAs you are aware, our Appropriation has been considerably reduced. The Department has given this request every consideration, but it will be impossible to provide the funds required to pay the salary of a second teacher and to supply classroom equipment. The need for providing funds for the erection of a new two-roomed school at this point will not be overlooked when our Estimates are being prepared for the next fiscal year. The question of providing salary for a second teacher will be considered at that time. In the meantime, the teaching services will have to be carried on under present arrangements.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B.A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto, Ont.\nBella Coola, B.C.,\nJuly 8th 1936.\n\nBELLA COOLA AGENCY REPORT FOR MONTH OF JUNE, 1936.\n\nThe Agent visited Bella Coola, Bella Bella, Klemtu and Kitimat Indian schools. The Bella Bella and Kitimat schools are overcrowded. Suggestions in this regard will be presented to the Department at a later date. I have not been able to make my usual monthly report on each school, as I did in the Queen Charlotte Agency, as there were no forms for that purpose in this office, and none have so far been received, although I requisitioned for a supply. Perhaps the Department does not require them in this Agency, as I understand that Mr. Founger did not send any in. The children in all the schools responded very well, and a great improvement was noted in the Bella Bella school, where on the Agent's first visit the children were evidently too bashful to answer questions. The attendance at all the schools dropped during June as the people began to leave for the various canneries.\n\nJ. Gillett\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is already aware of the overcrowding in the Bella Bella Day School, and it is unfortunate that a new school cannot be built this year because of the lack of funds.\n\nCould the Department give consideration to the plan of supplying a second teacher for the months of November, December, January, February, March, April and May, at a salary of $90.00 per month. A suitable building belonging to the Band can be obtained, and the people are willing to build a woodshed and toilet. The building is already equipped with a stove, and Mr. Anfield is willing to loan thirty desks, free of charge. The extra expenses, apart from the teacher's salary, would be:\n\nFreight on desks (approximately) $5.00\nFirewood $30.00\nRent of building, 7 months @ $5.00 $35.00\nBlackboard, etc., chair & table etc. $20.00\n\nSome of these things could of course be used in a new school when it is built.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

At Kitimat Miss Nelson, the teacher, is doing a good work but I consider it is not fair to the teacher or scholars to be in an overcrowded school. There were fifty-five present on the day of my visit. At Bella Bella Miss Perry is working hard and is doing all that can be expected. On account of the lack of accommodation the children are divided into two sections. The seniors attend school in the morning and the juniors in the afternoon. The total number attending this school is fifty-nine.\n\nJ.

Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI received a wire from Miss Florence Perry yesterday saying that on account of the illness of her mother she wished a substitute at Bella Bella School for the month of January, and in accordance with that request I have sent forward to Toronto the name of Miss Lela Swartz, whom you already know as she informed me that she attended your Summer School in Victoria. She holds an interim first class certificate, with special training and preference for primary work. She is a young woman well recommended by those who knew her and appears to possess an earnest missionary spirit which ought to help her make a little contribution in the service for the short time which is afforded her.\n\nMiss Swartz is going with the distinct understanding that she is supplying for Miss Perry only and until the latter is able to resume her work. In my wire East I suggested that she receive the usual remuneration and her travelling expenses to and from Bella Bella.\n\nHoping that these arrangements may prove satisfactory to you and to all concerned, and wishing you the compliments of Season,\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\"S.S.Osterhout\"\n\nSSO/AM\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\n(COPY)\n\nVICTORIA, B.C.,\n31st December, 1936.\n\nS.

Osterhout, D.D.,\nSuperintendent,\nThe United Church of Canada,\n411 Dominion Bank Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Dr. Osterhout:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 30th instant, with regard to the nomination of Miss Lola Swartz as temporary substitute for Miss Florence L. Perry, teacher of the Bella Bella Indian Day School. I assume that the United Church authorities in Toronto will communicate with the Indian Branch of the Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, with regard to this nomination.\n\nI am in receipt of a telegram from the Secretary of the Branch stating that leave-of-absence, without pay, has been granted to Miss Florence L. Perry and that approval would be given for the appointment of a qualified substitute selected by the United Church Missionary authorities.\n\nI am forwarding to the Indian Branch full particulars regarding Miss Lola Swartz, whom I remember very well. I may say that I am very glad to know that Miss Swartz has at last obtained a position in one of our Indian Day Schools working under United Church auspices. Should her work prove successful at Bella Bella, which is, as you know, a very difficult school owing to the large number of pupils, you might feel inclined to nominate her for regular appointment in the event of a vacancy occurring elsewhere in British Columbia. She certainly did very well at Summer School, and from what I have seen of her, I thoroughly agree with your estimation of her character. I have wired to you today as it is very necessary that Miss Lola Swartz proceed to Bella Bella by the next boat.\n\nWith all Good Wishes for the New Year,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 638L, File 802-1, part 1)\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE\nP.O. BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C., 31st December, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am forwarding a file of correspondence with regard to the nomination of Miss Lela Swartz as substitute teacher of the Bella Bella Indian Day School, Bella Coola Agency, in place of Miss Florence L. Perry, who was granted leave-of-absence without pay on the authority of your night letter of December 30th, 1936.\n\nMiss Lela Swartz is about 25 years of age, and holds a First-Class Interim Certificate in British Columbia. She was trained at the Vancouver Normal School and later attended the Provincial Summer School in Victoria, where she received Certificates for the Primary Course, and the Course in Indian and Rural School Problems. Miss Swartz has substituted from time to time in Vancouver schools; and has also had some special training in Designing and Commercial Art.\n\nMiss Swartz was one of my students at Summer School and I found her industrious and likely to train into an exceptionally good teacher. I would, therefore, recommend the Department to approve of her appointment as substitute teacher until Miss Florence L. Perry is able to resume her work at Bella Bella.\n\nI should like also to suggest that Mr. Indian Agent Gillett be informed of the Department's decision in this case. As far as I know, he has not been informed of Miss Perry's request for leave-of-absence, or of the United Church's nomination to fill this position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6384, File 802-1, part 1)\nOttawa, January 7th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOwing to the serious illness of her mother, the Department has granted leave of absence, without pay, to Miss Florence L. Perry, teacher of the Bella Bella Indian Day School.\n\nOn the recommendation of Inspector Barry, we have approved the temporary engagement of Miss Lela Swartz. She holds a first class interim B. C. certificate and was trained at the Vancouver Normal School and, later, attended the Provincial Summer School where she received certificates for the primary course and the course in Indian and rural school problems. Miss Swartz will be allowed the same salary as was paid to Miss Perry, viz., $95 a teaching month, and Inspector Barry has already made the necessary arrangements to have her re-open the school after the Christmas holidays.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nJas. Gillett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nOttawa, February 10, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn your telegram of December 29th you stated that Miss Florence L. Perry was unable to remain at her duties as teacher of the Bella Bella Indian Day School owing to the serious illness of her mother, and suggested the appointment of a qualified substitute. This action was approved in our telegram of December 30th.\n\nWe do not appear to have definite information on file stating whether Miss Perry wishes to return to Bella Bella before the end of the current academic year, on June 30th, next. Please let me have definite information on this point in order that we may pay the substitute teacher regularly. As you are aware, Miss Perry is allowed leave of absence without pay.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJas. Gillett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nOttawa, March 10th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn the last paragraph of official letter of the 10th ultimo, you were requested to advise the Department definitely whether or not Miss Perry intended to return to the Bella Bella Indian Day School before the end of the current academic year. No reply was received to that letter and, as a result, a cheque for $95.00 was issued at the end of February and sent to Miss L. M. Swartz. About the middle of February, we received a voucher from you for Miss Swartz's salary for the month of January. This cheque had already been sent but there was a short notation on your voucher that Miss Perry had resumed duties on February 1st.\n\nPlease communicate with Miss Swartz at once and arrange to have her forward the cheque which she has received for the month of February to Miss Perry. No payment is being made to Miss Perry for either February or March until you reply to official letter of the 10th ultimo, stating definitely the date on which Miss Perry resumed duties. At that time, you should also state if you have been successful in obtaining from Miss Swartz the cheque for February which was forwarded to her.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. Gillett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B. C.\nDear Sir,\n\nYour file 162-3-1 Feb. 10th\nand 162-3-1 Mar. 10th\n\nI regret that the first of the above mentioned was not replied to before. I had already made a note on the Voucher for Miss Swartz' salary before I received the letter, and I thought that would be sufficient.\n\nI may say that Miss Perry resumed her school teaching duties at Bella Bella on February 1st. Miss Swartz endorsed the cheque she received for February and turned it over to Miss Perry; therefore it will not be necessary to issue a cheque to Miss Perry for February. Miss Perry intends to continue teaching at Bella Bella.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nBella Coola B.C., April 7th, 1937.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR MARCH 1937.\n\nAll the schools were visited and an almost perfect attendance was found in all of them. I found also that progress is being made, although at Bella Bella school the children do not answer very readily. The average attendance at that school was 54-9. At Bella Coola the average was 28.12, with twelve of the pupils showing perfect attendance for the last three months. I have not as yet received the averages for Klemtu and Kitimaat Schools.\n\nJ.

Judging from the information which was given me when I was at this village, it certainly is not before time as this community is growing and the School is altogether too small. I should like to say how much we appreciate the interest of the Department in making provision for the development of the educational work in such a promising community.\n\nIt will, therefore, be necessary to have a second teacher, and we beg to nominate Miss Elizabeth Allen for this position. Miss Jessop will naturally take the higher grades. I believe that this is satisfactory to Captain Barry who has been in consultation with Dr. Osterhout. I am asking Dr. Osterhout to have Miss Allen submit her qualifications.\n\nWith kindest regards, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD:BJ\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJuly 11, 1938.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, nominating Miss Elizabeth Allen as a teacher of the second room at the Bella Bella Indian Day School. Her appointment is approved, and funds have been provided for the current year's appropriation for a salary at the rate of $950 a year.\n\nWhile the plans for the Bella Bella School have been completed, construction has not yet started, although the last information I had from the Surveys and Engineering Branch indicated that they hope to get started before the end of the current month. As a result, it will probably be the first of October or even the first of November before the school will be ready for occupation.\n\nUnder these circumstances, Miss Allen's services will not be required until the new school is completed. Her appointment, therefore, is being approved on the understanding that her salary will start from the date of which the school is opened.

Gillett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola Indian Agency,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to Mrs. Brenda Campbell's letter of May 30th, 1939, requesting Residential School accommodation for various children of Bella Bella and expressing dissatisfaction with Miss Jessop, I enclose herewith a report on the subject by Mr. Inspector Barry, and would advise that some time ago the Department laid down a very definite principle that, where a Day School was in operation on an Indian Reserve, no Indian child within reasonable reach of same was to be admitted to a Residential School without first referring the applications to the Department and my understanding was that same would only be entertained under very unusual circumstances, in which it would have to be shown quite clearly that the child was likely to suffer morally or physically in its existing surroundings.\n\nA little reflection will show that there are many Indian children remote from any educational centre and those most decidedly under-privileged, and it is the desire of the Department to preserve existing Residential School accommodation for them. Also it is my opinion that only a portion of a child's training can be carried out in a school and that, not the least important part of their upbringing, is that part played by the parents in training them at home out of school hours in the actual art of earning a livelihood according to the opportunities offered by the locality, and the loss of such training is extremely difficult to compensate in the best of Residential Schools.\n\nI trust this will make my attitude clear in respect to this particular question.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. Gillett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBELLA COOLA AGENCY,\nPRINCE RUPERT, B.C.\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nBella Bella B.C.\nMay 30th, 1939\n\nTo Mr. Gillett (Indian Agent)\n\nFrom:- Mothers of Children of Village.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nWe would like you to tell us the reason why our children are not to be taken into the Residential Schools.\n\nIf the children of village are not permitted in the Residential Schools we want a better teacher.\n\n(Fault of Miss Jessup) When asked of a word not understood by class. (Answer) mind your own business & so forth.\n\nWe send our children to school daily, but they are afraid of their teacher.\n\nWe feel that they are taught English in school, but when they go home, the next hour they are talking their own language. So that makes it much harder for their quick learning. As if when at being in the Residential Schools they are strictly forbidden to speak their languages & only speak English, which makes their learning activities faster than in these day schools. There are a lot of more children ready to go to school here next term, then the day school will be packed again.\n\nWe are sorry that our children are not accepted anymore in the Residential Schools, because they won't speak good English like those in the schools now. Last fall there were a lot of children ready to go to school but were not accepted.\n\nWe want a Home School in the Village for the children over 10 years of age, if these children are not accepted at the Residential Schools.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have read a letter from the parents of certain children at Bella Bella forwarded to you by Mr. Indian Agent Gillett under his 3758 of the 19th instant.\n\nI may say that I believe that Inspector Coleman who spoke to me on this matter has taken some action.\n\nIn general I am aware that Mr. Indian Agent Gillett is in favour of sending children to Indian Residential Schools even when home conditions are good and there is a day school on the Indian Reserve. I have explained the policy of the Department to him a number of times, but he appears very loath to accept my own suggestions.\n\nI understand that St. Michael's Indian Residential School has a long waiting list. The homes at Bella Bella are in the main quite good. There may be some orphans who should go to residential schools, but those with good homes should certainly attend the new Indian Day School at Bella Bella.\n\nThe people at Bella Bella are members of the United Church of Canada. The parents however do not care for Coqualeetza School and would much prefer to send their children to St. Michael's Alert Bay, an Anglican school.\n\nThe question of the ability of the present teacher of the Bella Bella Indian Day School has been reported on previously, in April 1938 and again in September of the same year. Miss Jessop has a rather weak personality, but is an experienced teacher. She holds good qualifications, and should certainly not be deprived of her school because some parents wish to have the Department look after the children for them. My suggestion is that the Department should establish a Home School or small Residential School in the village for pupils over 10 years of age is ridiculous.\n\nThe new school at Bella Bella will be inspected in due course in late September of this year. I understand that the junior teacher Miss E. Allen has resigned to be married. If there is a vacancy, may I suggest that Miss Jessop take the Primary Division and the new teacher to be selected take charge of the Senior Division. Only an experienced and well qualified teacher should be sent to Bella Bella.\n\nAs Mr. Indian Agent Gillett is now in charge of the Skeena River Agency I feel that it is essential that he should be informed in clear language of the Department's decision to educate the Indian children in Indian Day Schools except where there is a clear reason for them to be sent to a Residential School. In the case of orphans, those with unsuitable home conditions, either through overcrowding, immoral surroundings, those who have done too well at day school, they should have a chance to take Junior High School and a few other special cases, the residential school is an greatly increased cost to the Department is no doubt justified, but in the majority of cases the sending of children to residential schools when the parents can easily support them is a great mistake.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6384, File 802-1, part 2)\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith report of Mr. Inspector Barry, with respect to a letter dated May 30th, 1939, allegedly written by the parents of school children at Bella Bella, in the Bella Coola Agency, copy of which is enclosed.\n\nI quote agree with the principle laid down by Inspector Barry in that Indian children residing within a reasonable distance of a Day School should not be permitted to attend a Residential School except under unusual circumstances, and that this type of accommodation should be reserved for those children not so fortunately situated. I enclose herewith my letter to Mr. Indian Agent Gillett, which I believe represents the Department's intentions in this respect.\n\nIn my opinion, the Inspector should be authorized to make such changes in the allotment of grades as he may deem necessary in the best interests of the school should the changes of personnel occur, as set out in the penultimate paragraph of his report.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFor D.M.

The parents were present and the judge reprimanded the boys, and bound them over for six months and the parents were assessed the cost of articles stolen and damages to school property. It is intended to form a troupe of \"Sea Scouts\" here, providing a suitable person can be found to take charge. The missionary states the boys are afraid of him, which is rather an unfortunate state of affairs, and I have found that the school children in Bella Coola show a lack of enthusiasm which is not evident at the Bella Coola and Kitimat schools, where the relations between the school children and teachers seem very happy.\n\nWm.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nWith reference to Mr. Indian Agent Christie's letter 64/7170 of October 24th regarding the overcrowding at the Bella Bella Indian Day School, I may say that I can see no prospect whatever of securing a third teacher, even should the Department sanction the establishment of a third division at this school.\n\nThe Bella Bella Indian Day School is carried on under the auspices of the United Church of Canada who, so far, have been unable to secure a second teacher for the Kispiox Indian Day School.\n\nThe figures given by Miss How, Principal of the Bella Bella Indian Day School, and by Mr. Christie, are somewhat difficult to understand and I may say that from my experience of the Bella Bella Day School the average attendance is considerably below the number enrolled.\n\nFor some time when there was only one class room at Bella Bella, the children were educated on the half day system. The Indian parents somewhat resented this and on the erection of the new Day School, the children were, of course, placed on full time.\n\nI am unable to support the suggestion of Miss How that the congestion in the senior room should be alleviated by placing Grade 2 and 3 pupils on the half day system and I would recommend to the Department the following solution of the difficulty:\n\nThe Grade 2 pupils, some twenty odd in number, should be removed from the senior room and enrolled in the junior division. The junior room would therefore become, for some months in the year, overcrowded, the attendance falling away, no doubt, fairly rapidly in the late spring.\n\nShould the average attendance of Grade 1 and 2 pupils in the junior room exceed thirty-five, I would suggest that the\nchildren in this junior division be placed on the half day system as a purely temporary measure until the average attendance again decreased to around thirty-five.\n\nIn conclusion I would recommend that the approval of the Department be sought for the putting into effect of the above plan.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools.\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Indian Agent Christie has recently forwarded to this office a copy of a letter received from Miss L.K., How, B.A., Principal of the Bella Bella Indian Bay School, regarding overcrowding at that school. In his letter to me on the subject, dated November 1st, a copy of which is attached, Inspector Barry has pointed out that the difficulties experienced might well be overcome by having the Grade 2 pupils, some twenty odd in number, removed from the Senior room and enrolled in the Junior Division.\n\nSuch a course would result in overcrowding the Junior room during at least a few months in the year. In this regard, Inspector Barry points out that the attendance declines rapidly in the late spring.\n\nThe average attendance of Grade 1 and 2 pupils in the Junior room under the above arrangement would no doubt exceed thirty-five during certain months of the year. To make it possible for the teacher to deal with this large number of Primary pupils Inspector Barry suggested that when necessary the Junior Division of the Bella Bella Indian Bay School be placed on the half day system as a purely temporary measure and until such time as the average attendance again decreases to around thirty-five.\n\nI would recommend that Inspector Barry's solution of the difficulties caused by large attendance of pupils at the Bella Bella Indian Bay School be accepted and that I be given authority by air mail if possible to put the above noted plan into effect.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

At Kitimat there were 64 on the roll in the beginning of October with a possible attendance of 75 which is far too many pupils for one teacher. This situation may be alleviated when certain families go down to Butedale. At Bella Coola there were 35 pupils on the roll and 46 in attendance at the time of my visit on October 24. A second room with an additional teacher is required at this point. The Bella Bella School was visited and appeared to be away to a very good start this year but one of the basement rooms will have to be utilised as a classroom in the near future employing a third teacher.\n\nWm.

Coleman,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa,\nMay 5, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have had brought to my attention today an excerpt from Inspector Coleman's report regarding his visit to Bella Bella last October, in which he stated that the Agent was unable to find whether the old school house on the Bella Bella Reserve is the property of the Department or the Church.\n\nI have reviewed several files and find that we have no record of having conveyed to the former Methodist Church a site for a school on the Bella Bella Reserve. However, a letter dated April 29, 1936, from the former Agent, Mr. I. Fougner, read, in part, as follows:\n\n\"The present Bella Coola School, built, before my time in office, some 30 or 40 years ago by the Church authorities, is too small to accommodate all the pupils.\"\n\nIt is quite possible that the information given in Mr. Fougner's communication was correct, but at the same time you will note that our files do not show any record of a site having been formally conveyed to the Church.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M.

Levelton,\nActing Indian Agent\nREPORT ON BELLA COOLA AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY, 1943.\n\nLeft for Bella Bella next morning, and visited the two class rooms in the school, and found a good attendance, with the children looking healthy and clean, also the school rooms were in very good order. Visited the hospital, and conferred with the medical Supt. Dr. Darby, on various matters pertaining to the Indian patients in the hospital.\n\nFound the school without water, and made arrangements to have the pipe line checked for leaks, and left at 12.15 for Klemtu, arriving there in a heavy S.E. Gale. Visited School teacher, and the School, and I certainly was amazed at how he had been able to carry on with the stove in the condition it was. The whole top of the fire box was burnt and rusted away, and there were holes through it at all points, so it was a wonder that the school had not been burnt down.\n\nThe new stove, and coal had not arrived there at this time, but on my return from the north, I found a New stove and pipes installed, but still no coal, so the teacher had ordered some wood cut and delivered, but this was green and full of salt water, so it had to be cut into kindling wood before it would burn.\n\nT.A.

T.A. Levelton.\nA/Indian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI would refer to my letter of the 19th ultimo, regarding the inspection of the Bella Bella Indian Day School by Mr. B. Thorsteinsson, and to enclose herewith copy of Mr. Acting Indian Agent Levelton's reply of the 6th instant to my request for his comments on the report.\n\nIn view of the complaint of Mr. Andrew Paull, of the Native Brotherhood, regarding the lack of provision for advanced training for Indians it is noted the poor attendance at this school. This Reserve is one of the strongest supporters of the Brotherhood.\n\nFor: D. M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nREPORT ON BELLA COOLA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER, 1943.\n\nVisited the Indian School, but found only eight children attending. As far as I could ascertain there were no other children in the village at the time, and not much likelihood of any more until the end of the month, when the parents would return from the various canneries.\n\nT.A. Levellton,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON BELLA COOLA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OCTOBER, 1943.\n\nSchools;\n\nBella Bella Day School is operating with two rooms, and two teachers, and it is hoped that attendance in October will justify operation of the two rooms.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nExtract from Indian Agent Anfield's report for the month of November, 1943, on the Bella Bella Indian Day School.\n\nThe absence of school age boys in this room is indicative of the whole tone of the village of Bella Bella, which appears to have reached an all time low in morale. Only one boy over twelve was present on this date. Room was far too warm for proper teaching, and the teacher was advised to watch ventilation more carefully.\nSchools; Day.\n\nAll schools in operation were visited and inspected. It is a shame that no teachers are available for Kitammat and Bella Coola. Attendance at Bella Bella is fairly good, but I am afraid that after the new year, it will take a slump as many of these people are due to go to Nama Cannery for work. The school at Bella Coola is overcrowded. Repairs have been done at Klemtu and the building at least looks clean inside. It will last until better days come and a proper unit can be put up, with teachers quarters attached. It is suggested that at Kitammat a local Indian with Grade XI standing be appointed interim teacher, to get one room going at least. He seems a fine kind of young man, and he could not be any worse than some white interim or temporary appointments at present in action.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON BELLA COOLA AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER, 1943.\n\nSchools;\n\nDay schools at Bella Coola, Klemtu, Bella Bella (2 division and the empty schoolhouse at Kitamaat were all carefully inspected. Attendance is not satisfactory at all; Klemtu and Bella Coola have most unsuitable persons as teachers; and the closing of the latter school has been recommended. I am afraid that the School at Bella Bella will suffer a serious attendance lapse. War services take men and women in a wholesale manner from the villages winter as well as summer, and if the war goes on much longer, the entire social economy of these Indians will require serious review. In the old days there were at least six months in which the parents would be home; today in some villages, they are home for two weeks at Xmas or for a wedding or funeral; and children by the score are not attending school at all. It is very moot point in my opinion, as to whether home life in Indian villages will ever return to its former status, and I foresee the possibility of \"ghost Villages\" not long hence. Just where Councils will fit in to the picture of the future is a baffling problem, and future objectives along these lines will need careful study.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON BELLA COOLA AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JANUARY, 1944.\n\nSchools;\n\nThe Indian Day Schools at Bella Bella and Klemtu were inspected during the month, and grade placement tests used on the pupils. Conditions in the senior room at Bella Bella are not satisfactory, and I am inclined to think that the teacher should be changed at the end of the present term, reducing this school to a one room status. The people make no effort to have the older pupils attend school regularly, if at all, and in view of the shortage of teachers, I cannot justify the retention of this unit as a two room school. Bella Coola, Ulkatcho, and two divisions in Kitamaat are closed for lack of teachers. Good work is being done in Klemtu.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON BELLA COOLA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH APRIL, 1944.\n\nSchools;\n\nNo schools were inspected during the month as arrival times at Klemtu and Bella Bella were inconvenient or on Saturdays; there is a possibility that Bella Coola Day School may re-open shortly, as the United Church have nominated a teacher for the remaining two months of the academic year; Mrs. Anfield has consented to provide board and room for this girl who is expected May 4th. A report has been sent to the Indian Commissioner for B.C. recommending that Kitamaat, if re-opened, be confined to a one room school, and the dispensary be moved to the Day School basement, and the nurse quartered in the teacherage. Inspector Thorstenstein expects to visit the Bella Bella and Klemtu schools, also Bella Coola if opened, in the latter part of May.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON BELLA COOLA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF MAY, 1944.\n\nSchools:\n\nThe Bella Coola Indian Day School was re-opened during the month with an untrained but willing teacher. It was not possible to inspect any other Agency Schools. Inspector Thorstenstein inspected the Bella Coola Day School but informed the Agent that it was not likely he would be able to inspect the Klemtu or Bella Bella Schools this term, due partly to the \"Brendan\" being tied up and partly to pressure of work.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nYour file 2-11-5, June 21st, Bella Bella Indian Day School.\n\nInspector B. Thorsteinsson's reports on the two divisions of the a/m Day School have been read with interest. It is nice to note that Miss Phillips' pupils have done so well, and their progress reflects great credit on the teacher of this division, who has from my own observation, worked very hard to make this room a success. I shall make a point of writing to Miss Phillips and will convey the Department's appreciation of her efforts.\n\nShould Miss How return to this School after the vacation, I will take the first opportunity of interviewing her with regard to the poor standing of this class. When last in Bella Coola, I asked Inspector Thorsteinsson to make a special effort to try and inspect this Bella Bella School, in the hope that he would with his greater professional knowledge see more to praise than I had been able to visualise on my several monthly inspections of this particular division. I regret to see from his report that there is apparently little to praise in Miss How's work during the past year.\n\nWere it not for the extreme shortage of teachers, I would have no hesitation in recommending that Miss How be asked to make a change, a move which I gathered she had been contemplating in any case. She has the ability to be a good teacher - am certain, but it would appear that the erratic attendance plus the poor support given to the School by the parents of the pupils has discouraged her to the place where her present effort is largely negative, making the situation as far as the pupils are concerned just that much worse. I shall write to her and suggest the recuperative values of a summer school course.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6384, File 802-1, part 2)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI would refer to my letter of the 21st ultimo regarding Inspector Thorsteinsson's report on Bella Bella Indian Day School and enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letter of the 30th ultimo in reference to the quality of Miss How's teaching.\n\nI agree with Mr. Anfield that this teacher's services could be dispensed with if and when it is found possible to secure a replacement, but, in the meantime, it will be necessary for us to continue her employment as an alternative to closing the school.\n\nKT\n\nD.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nBella Coola, B.C.\nAugust 1st, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nRe resignation, Miss Kathleen How, B.A. as Teacher, Bella Bella.\n\nAttached please find resignation of the a/n teacher from service in the senior room of the Bella Bella Indian Day School.\n\nAs the school is closed for the holidays, it may be presumed that the resignation is now effective, and that a vacancy exists at the Bella Bella school.\n\nIt is my understanding that nomination to these posts lies with the United Church of Canada in the case of the Bella Bella school, and it will be appreciated if you will inform them of your wishes with regard to the appointment of another teacher to this school.\n\nShould no teacher be available to replace Miss How, I would recommend that the Junior Room alone be operated with Miss Phillips as teacher, taking in grades 1 and 2 only.\n\nI would like to make the suggestion to the Department that if a qualified teacher could be secured for Bella Coola, Miss Grace Farr, who taught at Bella Coola for two months this May and June could perhaps be appointed to Bella Bella senior room, where I believe she would be of more use than at Bella Coola which will have nearly 70 pupils of all grades. This girl is untrained, and has a health problem, and could not in my opinion handle the Bella Coola school with satisfaction. If appointed to Bella Bella, she would only have a few grades and never more than thirty pupils. She would also come under the influence and help of Miss Phillips, one of our most successful teachers.\n\nIf this suggestion appears reasonable, would you be good enough to discuss it with the nominating body, who secretary is Rev. W.P. Bunt.\n\nF. Earl Anfield\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6384, File 802-1, part 2)\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAttention Mr. R.

In all three schools, satisfactory teaching is being carried on, but the problem is still one of securing better attendance.\n\nIf the herring run materializes, the attendance at Bella Bella will drop sharply. In Bella Coola we are fortunate in securing an exceptionally good teacher in Miss Fleming and the response of the pupils is excellent.

Your children can be well educated in their own villages if the parents are as keen as most of you have been this year. I have been very happy this past year to see the rapid progress being made in Bella Bella. You are the largest village in the Agency. It is up to you to see that you are at the top in the number of well educated children.\n\nI have recommended to the Dept. that special Certificates be awarded for perfect attendance to all children who have had 100% attendance since last fall.

Attendance at all schools has improved with the exception of Kitamaat, where the industrial requirements of the adult population resulted in a very unsatisfactory attendance record.

M. Phillips as teacher of the Bella Bella Indian Day School, be increased at least $5.00 a teaching month. Miss Phillips during her six years as teacher at the Bella Bella school has given outstanding service and I would strongly endorse the Agent's recommendation. I would suggest that a $5.00 per month increase for the balance of the current academic year should be paid and that her salary be increased to $105.00 per month as from September 1st, 1946. This will bring it more in line with the salary paid at the Bella Coola Indian Day School.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nBella Coola, B.C.\nDecember 27, 1945.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nApplication is made for consideration of an increase in salary for Miss Eunice M. Phillips, and for her promotion to the Principalship of the Bella Bella Indian Day School, Campbell Island, B.C.\n\nMiss Phillips has now completed eight years in her present position at Bella Bella. She holds a permanent 1st class certificate and she is my considered opinion one of the really outstanding teachers of primary grades in British Columbia. She is paid $95.00 a month and house in her present post; she has not to my knowledge been given any increase in salary for good service since her arrival at Bella Bella.\n\nI have knowledge that she has been approached by Provincial Educational people and School Boards to take work in provincial schools at very considerably enhanced salary scales. She has chosen to stay at Bella Bella all these years where she is doing a very fine piece of educational work, the merit of which should be recognized by an increase of salary of at least $5.00 per teaching month, and promotion to the Principalship of this two room school, both effective as from January 1st, 1946.\n\nIt would seem to me that unless the Department is prepared to recognize merit in a tangible way, we are going to have an increasingly difficult time keeping good teachers.\n\nF.

The enrollment in this village calls for a third classroom next fall and a fourth if children of six years were admitted to school as it is considered they must if Indian children are ever to overcome the age differential of four years noticeable between them and the non-Indian school pupils of the Province.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nDept. Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to yours of March 22nd, file 80-162, please be advised that the Bella Bella Indian Day School is situated on Campbell Island, which is the post office for this village.\n\nFrom the time of Inspector G. H. Barry, pupils of this Day School have been discharged at the close of term nearest their fifteenth birthday. Miss Phillips, Principal of the school informs me that the Inspector ordered this action to prevent overcrowding, and as the school is still overcrowded the policy has been continued.\n\nFor many years this village (second largest in B.C.) has operated with a village council and it is presumed that the Indian Act, Section 185 f. was applied to school attendance. Actually, the village was still under Part I though tacit recognition was given to the Council by the Department.\n\nIn the Bella Bella band located on Campbell Island, B.C., there are one hundred forty children of school age (Ind. Act 10.1) as at March 31st, 1946. Of this number, thirty-six are pupils in Residential Schools at Alert Bay and Alberni, leaving an actual school population of one hundred four to be handled by two teachers in a two room school. To ease the situation, children of fifteen years and up have been discharged from school and my letter of March 13th was directed to the Department to clarify the situation and get a definite ruling as to whether or not these children are to be cut off or kept on Family Allowance payments. I do not see why they should be cut off if the teacher, on orders of the Department's Inspector, discharged them from school, but as it is a matter effecting both the Indian Act and the Family Allowance Act, it is considered a ruling should be given.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 7, 1946.\n\nMr. F. Earl Anfield, Indian Agent,\nBella Coola, British Columbia.\n\nI desire to refer you to your letter of April 8, with regard to the Bella Bella School.\n\nThe remarks I have made in another letter of today's date regarding the Klemtu School apply also in the case of Bella Bella. If it is possible to rent another building to accommodate the extra pupils, the Department would be prepared to pay a reasonable rent and make an endeavour to secure a third teacher for the academic year 1946-47. I wish also to refer you to my letter regarding Klemtu in connection with the age of the pupils attending school. My remarks in regard to Klemtu apply also to Bella Bella.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSince taking over the Bella Coola Agency a careful study of the educational needs and facilities therefore in our Day Schools has been made, with particular attention directed to ascertaining the causes underlying the retardation noticeable in practically all the Day Schools. Irregular attendance is admittedly one of the chief causes of retardation, but this does not answer the problem by any means.\n\nWe find generally that Indian children take from two to four years to get through Grade I and into Grade II, by which time they are retarded an average of four years. The age norm for Grade II in Indian schools is eleven years, in non-Indian schools seven years; a differential of four years, increasing rather than decreasing as the average Indian child goes on through the grades.\n\nIn my opinion, speaking from a fairly long experience in Indian education, an essential step in any effort to reduce this age differential is to lower the compulsory school admission age for Indian children to six years from the present seven; vide Indian Act 10.1. It is true that under Section 185.f Indian children of families operating under Part II of the Act may start school at six years, but few if any bands in Bella Coola operate under this Section.\n\nIt may also be said that Section 10.1 does not bar Indian children of six years from attending school, in practice however it does. Most of our Indian schools are overcrowded and few of our teachers permit Indian children to register before attaining their seventh birthday. A child of six years is more adaptable to primary education than a child of seven. The courses of study are based on the minimum age for non-Indian children, and it is my conviction that six year old Indian children would do better in Grade I than would seven year old youngsters with wider life experience but less training in the use and purpose of such experiences.\n\nI would like to see an experiment made in this matter and would select Bella Bella for such an experiment. There we have a two room school. The basements could be floored and adapted to the higher grades and a classroom made available for six year olds, of whom there would be enough to form a class.\n\nIn Bella Bella we have an outstanding teacher for such an experiment in the person of Miss E. M. Phillips with whom I have discussed this matter at length. I believe she would take such a class and I also believe the parents would support this venture if it were put up to them properly. The results might be of very real value to the Department, and the children would certainly gain by such an experiment.\n\nWould you put this matter before the Department for consideration and if they are interested, I would be pleased to go into a great deal more detail.\nAt Bella Bella the experiment would require (a) another teacher and salary at $1,000.00; the lining and equipping of another classroom, say $350.00 and school supplies for same. Present day trends among non-Indian children indicate a growth of kindergarten schooling in five year olds in even kindergarten age. An earlier start in regular school life among Indians is urgently needed and would, I believe, remove many of the difficulties faced in trying to keep the interest of the older children in the higher grades.\n\nI am convinced that the chief reason that Indian children do not enjoy school or studies is that they are out of their element. By no stretch of imagination could a white boy of twelve retain interest in the course material of Grade III, and neither can Indians.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nWith reference to your letters of the 6th and 10th instant requesting authorization for extension of the enrollment of pupils at the Bella Bella Indian Day School to include a pre-school class of six-year-old children and some primary repeaters, at an estimated cost of adopting one of the existing semi-basement classrooms of about $350.00 and the salary of an additional teacher, I would advise that such applications should include a school survey of the Band showing those of school age and pre-school age.\n\nMiss Phillips, the teacher, called here just as I was writing the Department in the matter and informed me that the proposed class would not be a pre-school project but would deal entirely with those of school age in the primary group and if such is the case we should certainly have a definite survey showing why this group cannot be provided for by the primary teacher as at present we have no actual figures before us, your letters being in quite general terms.\n\nIn discussing the question of pre-school education you touched on a subject giving us considerable concern and one that we hoped would be fully explored by an Indian School Inspector. There are, no doubt, a number of factors contributing to the general retardation of Indian children and their consequent failure to keep pace with the white schools, including indifferent attendance, which again might result from lack of interest due to the length of time spent on primary work. I am satisfied that the Indian intelligence quotient is comparable with that of white children, particularly if the environmental and language factors are considered, but as the standard tests such as the Stanford-Binet are not applicable owing to the language problem, and those that are such as the Rutter-Intonson Performance Scale are not familiar to our teachers we appear to still lack the essential data on which to base an opinion.\n\nIf you wish to pursue the question of the pre-school\nclass further I would request your report giving fairly close detail as to the expected attendance. You should also deal with the problem of the accommodation of any additional teachers required.\n\nFor D. W. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMarch 31st, 1946.\n\nChildren of Bella Bella Indian Village from 7 years in 1945 to 15 years\n\n| Census page | children - I.R.S. - Alberni 4 | Alert Bay 32 | Poor Mental Ability - 5 |\n|-------------|-------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------|\n| 1           | 18                            | 36           | Matthew Starr           |\n| 2           | 18                            |              | Cecil Windsor           |\n| 3           | 13                            |              | Bobby Wallace           |\n| 4           | 13                            |              | Richard Hunt            |\n| 5           | 15                            |              | Daisy Starr             |\n| 6           | 11                            |              |                         |\n| 7           | 13                            |              |                         |\n| 8           | 12                            |              |                         |\n| 9           | 6                             |              |                         |\n| 10          | 6                             |              |                         |\n| 11          | 12                            |              |                         |\n| 12          | 10                            |              |                         |\n| Total       | 139                           |              |                         |\n\nIndian School Grading in General\n\nIf the standing of Indian children is to be equalized with that of white children from Grade II and up, (taking into account that the Indian children begin school at seven years and are in Grade I for two years) then, of necessity, somewhere from Gr.II-VI (or up) an Indian child will have to cover 4 years work in 2 years.\n\nIn a small percentage of cases where the child's attendance and ability are very good, and in cases in which the teacher knows the child (his ability and willingness to go ahead) from having already taught him and observed him. It is possible for the teacher to work that child up to a white school grading.\n\nBut, in class rooms in which teachers are new each year and especially those in which the teachers are new to Indian school teaching it is not to be expected that the children can accomplish more than one grade per year (this is not expected of white children) especially when a classroom is overcrowded (or in the other extreme when a child is \"out\" of school, getting native foods, or sick, or for other reasons).\n\nThe language difficulty has to be continually taken in to account.\nIf each grade, from II/VI requires one year's attendance and work, then the two years must be cut down before Grade II is reached.\n\nIf a preparatory class were introduced for six year olds and five year olds, to be a one year course or two, then a child would be prepared to enter the formal teaching of the primary room (i.e., to deal with the printed English word) at the age of 6 (or even 7) and to cover Grade I (B and A) in one year because the socialized atmosphere of the \"kindergarten\" class would build up a knowledge of English required as a basis for IB work, which a very small percentage of Bella Bella children possess upon entering school at present in ID.

Seven children within 7-16 discharged from Residential Schools live at home and are not included, it being considered that their discharge from the residential Schools precludes their admission to Day School.\n\nUsing ninety as a potential enrollment as at the end of term 1946, we find as follows for the next seven years, assuming the Residential School population as constant:\n\n| Enrolment 1946 | New admissions of 7 year olds in September | Discharged of 16 year olds at close June | Day School Population |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| 90             | 15                                         | 16                                     | 89                   |\n| 89             | 9                                          | 11                                     | 87                   |\n| 87             | 15                                         | 16                                     | 86                   |\n| 86             | 22                                         | 16                                     | 92                   |\n| 82             | 16                                         | 14                                     | 94                   |\n| 94             | 23                                         | 16                                     | 101                  |\n| 101            | 24                                         | 14                                     | 111                  |\n\n(over)\nWith an average attendance of 75% the following desk requirements are indicated:\n\n| Year   | Desk Requirements |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| 1946-47| 67                |\n| 1947-48| 65                |\n| 1948-49| 66                |\n| 1949-50| 69                |\n| 1950-51| 71                |\n| 1951-52| 76                |\n| 1952-53| 83                |\n\nPresent desk capacity is thirty-five in the senior room and thirty-five in the Junior room, and average attendance of 75% will keep both rooms filled. Present attendance trends are upward and a third classroom is indicated for Alert Bay by 1947 at the latest. One of the basements will have to be tiled and floored and an oil heater put in as the furnace will not take adequate care of the heating of this room. New blackboards and primary tables and seats will be needed as well as cupboards, teacher's desk, etc.\n\nIt is possible that the teacher could be accommodated in the Nurses' Home and students are being directed to this end. If so, rental would be charged and an adjustment in salary required. She could board either with the other teachers or at the Hospital.\n\nIt is recommended that the additional room when sanctioned be used as a Primary Classroom limited to twenty-five pupils.\n\nAs soon as advice is received regarding accommodation for the third teacher a further report will go forward. In the meantime items will be inserted in the estimated for 1947-48 for the material required for this room, as follows:\n\n- Additional toilets (2) $70.00\n- Oil Heaters $16.00\n- Blackboards $42.50\n- Tables and chairs (to be built) $78.00\n- Lining walls and laying floor $266.00\n- Teacher's desk $52.50\n- Cupboards etc. $26.00\n\nItems will also be included for the use of the other basement room as a Pre-primary or Kindergarten room.\n\nAn alternative scheme to using the basement room would be the rental of the Band Hall from the Council for a period of two years or until materials are in good supply. To put a primary room in this Hall would only require blackboards, teacher's desk and chair, tables and seats for children (to be made like those in the primary room at Alert Bay Residential School) and fuel, in addition to teacher's and janitor's wages. I am uncertain as to rental etc. and will report later. If this room could be secured for this fall, I would recommend this be accepted and converted to a classroom at once.\n\nCopies of Miss Phillips' notes on this third room are attached for your information.\n\nIndian Affairs.

No woodshed is provided to keep wood outside dry as a result the wood piled in the south basement has marked the walls to some extent even though heavy corrugated cardboard was placed between the wood and walls.\n\nN.B.

The agent's comments with respect to this third classroom are somewhat ambiguous, but he apparently intends to make enquiries as to the possibility of securing, on a rental basis, the use of the Band Hall for a period of two years, or if funds and material can be secured, for the construction and equipping of the third classroom in the basement of the present school. Nothing further can be done in this matter until we hear from Mr. Anfield whether or not the Council will be prepared to rent the Band Hall, but in the meantime it would appreciated if the Department would advise if funds could be made available for payment of salary for a third teacher and for equipping and operating a third classroom.\n\nD.

In that event, we will also be prepared to provide the salary for a third teacher.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nChief Counsellor Paul Gladstone, Campbell Island, B.C.\n\nYour letter of May 14th received. It is noted that most of the men are out halibut fishing and that you will call them for a meeting on their return to discuss whether or not they would rent the Band Hall to the Department as a third classroom for the Bella Bella Day School.\n\nThe Department has written in this matter to state that if it is possible to rent a suitable building for this purpose, they will pay a reasonable rent and endeavour to secure an additional teacher for the academic year 1946-47.\n\nIn view of this, it will be appreciated if you will do all you can to get the men together and secure a favourable decision about this Hall, which decision should be sent to me at Bella Coola as soon as possible.\n\nKind regards,\n\nF.

She accused the Principal, Miss E. Phillips, of attempted assault on her person in the teacherage at night, and showed me several highly irrational letters written by her prior to lawyers in Vancouver. A careful check was made with Dr. Darby and the Matron of the Hospital as to condition between the two teachers. As Mrs. Macdonald was anxious to leave as soon as possible and having in mind a letter to her from the United Church Mission Supt., and shown to me by Mrs. Macdonald which letter informed her that she would not be returning to this School for further employment, I accepted a written resignation from Mrs. Macdonald, effective this date, and gave her permission to leave immediately. I called the pupils of the senior room and informed them the senior room was closed for the term as from this date.\n\nIt is recommended that the resignation be accepted and Mrs. Macdonald paid for only two-thirds of the month of June. The resignation is attached herewith.\n\nF.

It is obvious, however, that steady and consistent progress has been made in the classroom during the year and the pupils of both rooms were congratulated on the way they had maintained the attendance average through the year.\n\nMiss Phillips is an enthusiastic worker and her pupils give a genuine response.

Bunt is absent from the city at present and will not be returning until next week and it is not considered advisable to delay submission of this application pending his return.\n\nIt will be noted that Miss Kroeker holds an Interim First Class teaching certificate valid until 1948, and following enquiries with respect to her religious affiliations I am of the opinion that there should be no objection to her appointment to a school under the auspices of the United Church. The Department may wish to refer this matter to Dr. Dorey but I would recommend that Miss Kroeker's appointment be confirmed as soon as possible and would appreciate advice by airmail.\n\nD. M.

Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nFurther to my letter of October 26th, re the non-arrival of Miss K. Kroeker's September cheque, this is to advise that Miss Kroeker has now received her cheque.\n\nThe delay was caused by the fact that the cheque was addressed to Bella Coola. Please note that Miss Kroeker's address is Bella Bella, Campbell Island, B.C.\n\nJ.A. Findlay,\nActing Indian Agent.\nJanuary 4, 1947.\n\nMEMORANDUM TO: Major D. M. MacKay - Indian Commissioner\nFROM: R. F. Davey - Inspector of Indian Schools\n\nMiss E. M. Phillips, Junior Room teacher at the Bella Bella School called at this office on January 2nd and requested that an increase in her salary be considered.\n\nIn estimating Miss Phillips' present salary an allowance of $20.00 per month should be made for her share of the living accommodation, heat, and light which are provided for the two teachers at this school. This amount with her basic salary of $125.00 per month is the equivalent of $145.00 per month. Miss Phillips has nine years teaching experience in Indian schools and holds a Permanent First Class teaching certificate for British Columbia and has attended summer courses in Primary Work and Rural Schools. The Basic Salary Schedule for the Province places her maximum at $1650.\n\nThe reports on her work by Captain Barry, Mr. Anfield and Mr. B. Thorsteinsson have all rated her work as being very good. Mr. Thorsteinsson considered her \"outstanding\". He thought so highly of her work he recommended that she visit other Indian schools with the object of her assisting new or inexperienced teachers.\n\nIn view of these facts I recommend that consideration be given to increasing Miss Phillips' basic salary to $145.00 per month.\n\nR.F. Davey\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6384, File 802-1, part 2)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing a memorandum dated January 4th from School Inspector Davy in connection with a proposed salary increase for Miss E. M. Phillips, Principal, and teacher of the junior room, Bella Bella Indian Day School.\n\nIt will be noted that with Miss Phillips' qualifications and experience, the basic salary schedule for the province places her maximum at $1850 per annum. The Department has previously intimated that they are prepared to meet provincial salary rates for certificated teachers and as Miss Phillips' work as a teacher has been outstanding, and to obviate the possibility of losing her services to a provincial school, it is recommended that her salary be increased to $145.00 a teaching month.\n\nD. M. MacKay\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, 13 January 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant regarding salary of Miss E.M.

This has been the subject of a separate report and will be a matter for the attention of the Inspector of Indian Schools. The teachers in this school are doing an extremely efficient piece of work. Miss E. Phillips in charge of the Junior Division is extremely capable and is to be commended for her efforts. The Senior teacher, Miss Kroeker was new to the work in September, but has adapted herself well and all indications point to a successful year.\n\nJ.A. Findlay,\nActing Indian Agent.\nThis survey was completed on January 29, 1947, with the exception of the information on present annual salary.\n\nI withheld the survey until I had conferred with the Inspector who was to visit us in February.\n\nMy salary from Sept. - Dec. 1946 was $125 per month. This was increased to $147 per month as of Jan. 1/47 but as my Jan. and Feb. cheques are still $125 I expect $1250 is the amount I shall have to report.\n\nE. M.

As to item V., I might say, that I can give you references as to my character, etc., if required, but the school Inspector's Reports in Saskatchewan are not given to the teachers, as long as they live in the Province.

However, I am writing to the Dept. of Education in Regina, for a Copy of the Report from my last school and when I receive it, I will forward it to you. You might mention this to Inspector Davey and tell him that I have been interested in education all through the past, as my three children all took their High School, including Grade XII, in Saskatoon.\n\nI shall be looking forward to hearing from you again, in the near future, regarding this appointment.\n\nThanking you,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) Mrs. Jas.

This application has come through the offices of the United Church in Vancouver and I understand that the church is prepared to nominate Mrs. McCaig for the position.\n\nIt is noted that Mrs. McCaig has a second class teacher's certificate for the province of Nova Scotia. Reference has been made to her certification in an attached letter from the Registrar, Department of Education of the Province of Saskatchewan, in which her certificate is referred to as third class. Apparently that is the standing which the Department of Education in Saskatchewan gave to Mrs. McCaig's Nova Scotia certificate. However it is recommended that Mrs. McCaig be given credit in our Department as holding a second class certificate as it is on the basis of the original certificate that we have previously based our classification.\n\nI recommend that Mrs. McCaig be appointed to this position and that she be placed on the salary schedule as teacher, Indian School, Grade 2.\n\nR.

We have the various regulations from the nine provinces governing their granting of teachers certificates. However, these regulations have varied considerably in the last few years as increased qualifications were demanded of the teachers.\n\nIn view of the information contained in her application form and in your letter of April 22, it would seem that Mrs. McCaig is entitled to qualification as a grade two teacher. If she has attended a Refresher Course during her provincial teaching experience, this would entitle her to a salary of $1500.00 per annum in our service. If, however, she has not attended a Refresher Course it would entitle her to a salary of $1320.00 per teaching year in our service.\nWe have prepared a special application form for use by our teachers in requesting classification on our new scale. This will be sent out with the issue of The Bulletin which is now being printed and which should reach the teachers within the next week or ten days.\n\nBernard F.

The school age population of the Agency is 468. There is normal Day School capacity for 150 with an additional 30 accommodated in a rented building. It is anticipated that about 97 pupils in all can be placed in Residential schools next term, about ten under age 16 may attend Provincial schools. This will leave about 151 children in the Agency for whom no educational provision is being made. The need is greatest at Bella Bella where a two roomed school is now several years overdue. The need has grown to the point where a new four-room school unit will soon be needed. Two additional rooms are needed at Kitsamant and an additional room has long been needed at Bella Coola. This latter will still be needed in spite of the fact that a few children have been accepted at the Provincial school. I am advised by School Board that space is available only in the senior grades and there are about 70 native children who must be provided for at Bella Coola under grade six. Cooperation between Indian schools and White schools at Bella Coola has been good. The native children were invited to participate in the Boys and Girls Fair, both in Bella Coola and Ocean Falls. At both points a very satisfactory number of prizes were won by the native children. At the Ocean Falls Fair, a Bella Coola native boy aged 12 was tied with a white boy for the highest aggregate score for the Fair. He won prizes in drawing, two in handicrafts and two in athletics. The native children were notably successful in arts and handicrafts.\nExtract from the Quarterly Report of the Superintendent Bella Coola Agency for the period April, May and June 1949.\n\nEducation\n\nAttendance at Day Schools while dropping off somewhat is much improved over former years.

The teacher was on the ground by the first of the month and ready to open the School. I may further state that we have paid the teacher her salary for the full month as agreed and would, therefore, ask the Department in view of the circumstances to reimburse the Home Mission Board for her salary for the first half of the month of September.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJNS: BJ\n\nIndian Affairs.

Berger,\n1878 Carnavon Street,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Mrs. Berger:\n\nThis is in reply to your letter of February 25, 1970 which was forwarded to us from the Regional Personnel Adviser for B.C.\n\nThe Civil Service Superannuation Act became effective in 1924. Teachers were not eligible to contribute to it and consequently were not entitled to a pension on retirement. Since 1947 teachers who held a permanent teaching Certificate and who had at least two years successful teaching experience were allowed to apply for permanent status and be designated as permanent employees for purposes of the Civil Service Superannuation Act. With the coming into force of the Public Service Superannuation Act on January 1, 1954, all teachers employed on a full-time basis are eligible to contribute to the Public Service Superannuation Fund.\n\nI hope the above information will prove satisfactory to you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nD.G.

Indian Affairs\nVictoria B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYou are aware of the fact that the Bella Bella Indians are moving from their present village to a new site two miles further north. This move has been undertaken after much deliberation and was necessitated by the increasing population of the tribe, the limited space on the old site preventing proper sanitary arrangements and therefore harbouring disease and hence the land available to enlarge the old village site was held by a white man who put such an exorbitant price on the property that the Indians could not consider its purchase. The new village site is an excellent piece of ground and is quite adapted to the growing needs of the Indians.\n\nAbout twelve new homes have been erected and a substantial wharf built and if the fishing season turns out a financial success the greater number of the people should move this fall.\n\nThe Methodist Church will be forced to build a new house for the Medical Missionary at the new site and will also have to rebuild the church. This will entail considerable expense.\n\nIt is felt that, under the circumstances, the...\nthe Government should be applied to in reference to a grant for a new day school. The attendance at the school is increasing and as there are now nearly sixty children of school age on the reservation and every prospect that this number will be increased in the near future, a substantial building should be erected properly equipped to meet the growing needs of the place for some time to come.\n\nThe Missionary Society of the Methodist Church will have to improve the character of their buildings at the new town and the expense to them will be great as it is.\n\nThe Indians are not in a position to do the work unassisted as they are taxing their finances to the utmost limit in trying to improve the character of their new dwellings.\n\nThe new town when completed will be a credit to the Coast and we would make request that a grant of seven hundred and fifty dollars ($750.00) be made by the Government to erect a school which will be in keeping with the needs and conditions of the case.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSigned: R.H. Large M.T.\nMedical Missionary\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to forward herein in duplicate an application in behalf of the Bella Bella Indians from the Reverend Mr. George M.R. Missionary at the settlement. He much needed help toward the erection of a school house at their new village site. It now seems quite evident that these Indians are moving their village to the new location. To them this is an enormous undertaking and shows their determination to better the condition of themselves, and more especially their children and future generations.\n\nIt is an enterprise that will tax their best energies for several years to come. I think however that in the nature of things the whole population will not have left the old village for several years yet but that the majority of families will do so within two years time. I believe therefore a less extensive school building than that contemplated by Mr. George would suffice at first; that a five hundred dollar school building be erected at the new town as soon as may be under conditions which would admit of its enlargement afterwards so as to accommodate the children of the whole population.\n\nIn behalf of the Bella Bella Indian band I would respectfully suggest an appropriation of five hundred dollars for school purposes.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.W.

The application is made by Dr Large, medical missionary at that place, who states that the Indians are locating a new village about two miles from their former home, on a site better adapted to the growing needs of the Band, and that substantial homes are being put up. He also states that the Methodist Missionary Society will be forced to build a new church and a house for the missionary which will entail considerable expense. The Indians, he says, are not in a position to put up a new school house unassisted, as they are taxing their finances to their utmost limits in trying to improve the character of their new dwellings, and he asks for a grant of $750.00.\n\nMr Agent Todd that as it will be some time before the whole of the population leaves the old village, he thinks that a less expensive building than that contemplated by Dr Large would do at first, and that a building might be put up for $400.00.\nwhich would fill the present requirements, and which could afterwards be enlarged so as to accommodate the whole school population. He suggests an appropriation of $500 for school purposes, and the Indian Superintendent recommends the application as modified by Mr. Todd.\n\nThere is no appropriation for this purpose and it is submitted whether an item should be put in next year's estimates to provide for a new school.\n\nThe Department is now paying the salary of a teacher at the old reserve.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nPut the item in with explanation.

The reply received was that there were no funds or land at present for such a grant.\n\nI beg to again present the matter to the consideration of Your Department as You are already aware the Bella Bella Village is being moved two miles further North. This has necessitated the erection of new houses by all the Indians - about thirty of which are already built. The Missionary Society of the Methodist Church has built a new Mission house where the Medical Missionary is now residing and expects build a new church and a hospital in the near future. A new school house is greatly needed as we have been holding School in an Indian Room which is not suited to the purpose.\n\nWe have 130 children in the tribe of sixteen years old and under and about sixty of these are of School age. If the several hundred of the tribe remains food for the next few years our School population will be increased. We desire a well equipped School house.\n\nThe People & the Methodist Church are\nAlready seeing great expense in making the new Village a credit to the Coast we would respectfully ask of your Department that a grant of $750 be made toward meeting the expenses of the new School building.\n\nHoping that the funds of the Department may permit of such grant being made in the immediate future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRichard Wang & Co.,\nMissionary.\nNellakatta 36\nApril 25th 1901\n\nI have the honour to forward herein a letter in duplicate sent through my office from Doctor R.W. Lang of Bella Bella and addressed to you for the second time, urging a Government appropriation for the erection of a suitable school house for the Indian day school at New Bella Bella.\n\nAs before I must report that a new school house is greatly needed at Bella Bella, and also that the Indians of that band are at present overtaxed in their expenditure of money and labor in clearing the new townsite, moving their dwelling houses and erecting a new church and hospital building.\n\nBut without Government assistance I fear that the Indian day school at Bella Bella will necessarily be of small use for some years to come. I think however that a sufficiently large building to prevent overcrowding could be erected for $500.00 instead of $700 and an addition to the building be made some years hence when the present large number of young Indian children become of school age.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYours obediently,\n\nC.

W. Large of Bella Bella, the medical missionary at that point. The request is for a grant of $750.00 wherewith to erect a school building at the new village of the band which site is distant two miles to the northward of the old one. These Indians have expended all their means and in some cases have been forced to incur debt in the removal from the old to the new location which necessitated the erection of new dwellings and other necessary buildings. This band is doing its best to improve its condition both materially and spiritually and under the direction of Dr. Large with the assistance of Mr. Agent Todd have erected a new village which is a model for neatness, cleanliness and general thriftiness and I consider that if the Department could spare the funds necessary to the erection\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume6385, File 802-5, part 1)\nerection of the school building that it would be money well expended. Dr. Large's estimate is, I consider, rather in excess of the actual cost of a structure suited to the needs of the new village, as I believe that the sum named in Mr. Todd's letter, viz:- $500.00 should be sufficient for the purpose. In time, if an addition were required, it could be made at small cost.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Ob'dt. Servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, P.

I was informed by Mr. Agent Todd by letter which I received June 8th that a grant of \u00a3400.00 had been made by the Dominion Government towards the new School at Bella Bella & that all Vouchers for material, labor etc should be forwarded to him so that they might be in by June 30th. I am sorry that I have not been able to do this, much as I desired it. I left Bella Bella for Rivers Inlet about the end of May so that Mr. Todd's letter came to me after I had left Bella Bella.\n\nI could not go down to Victoria to purchase the materials as I was very busy with Hospital work besides the same boat on which the letter came brought the report of the outbreak of smallpox at Nass River & from that time to the present I have been kept so busy with caring for the sick, vaccinating the Indians and other duties that I have had to leave such necessary work undone. I thought it unwise to order materials to be shipped to Bella Bella to lie on a wharf, that has not as yet even a freight shed, for over two months.\n\nThe Indians were all leaving for the Canning centres and I could not get any one to work at the building nor...\nnor could I go to superintend the erection myself, so that\nthe materials would have remained on the wharf till my\nreturn about the latter end of August, exposed to the\nweather & to the pilfering of any chance wayfarer.\n\nMr. Todd kindly purchased some of the rough lumber\nbut I wrote to him that it would be impossible for me\nto make the other purchases within the prescribed time\nlimit.\n\nI very much regret the inconvenience to your\nDepartment that this course will occasion, but it was\nimpossible for me in the limited time given to do any\nthing different.\n\nI sincerely hope that the facts above stated will\npermit of the grant being at our disposal by the end\nof August when I will have returned to Bella Bella, &\nwill then be able to order materials and superintend\nthe erection of the building.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nR.W.

(RG 10, Volume 6385, File 802-5, part 1)\nwithin the time limit, consequently will have to be paid for, and I fear will be of no use for any other purpose there, and if left lying around unused will be wasted and a total loss, and as the value is $76.68 is a matter for serious consideration.\n\nI would also call your attention to the fact that the time given Dr. Large in which to perform this work was very short, your letter dated May 15th last, being the first intimation which he had that the grant of $400.00 for school house construction at Bella Bella could be used at the new townsite, and that instead of the $750.00 which was asked for in my letter enclosing requisition of May 7th, 1901, No. 711, S3, they must perform the work with the $400.00 grant; it will be seen that between these dates a very few days was left to get together all the material, and get the accounts in the hands of the Department before the 30th of June, hence taking everything into consideration, first that Dr. Large has done the best he could under unfavorable circumstances, second, that the Indians need the school, and are now looking forward to getting it; and again, that a large proportion of the lumber has been purchased, I would strongly urge, if it is in any way possible, that the money be forthcoming for carrying the work to completion.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour Obedient Servant.\n\nIndian Superintendent, B.C.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nFor the Secretary:\n\nIt is to be regretted that the grant for the Bella-Bella School for building purposes was allowed to lapse. From a perusal of Mr. Vowell's letter of the 7th instant one would form the impression which, of course, it may not be intended to convey, that it was through some fault of the Department that Dr. Large was not able to use the grant. I think it best, therefore, to point out that so far as Mr. Vowell and those interested in the Bella-Bella School are concerned the amount has been available since May 28th, 1900.\n\nThis item was included in the main Estimates for 1900-01, and was shown in the detail of the day school vote. Mr. Vowell acknowledged the receipt of the detailed Estimates on the 28th May, 1900, therefore, the whole summer of 1900 went by without any action being taken. Mr. Vowell states that our letter of the 15th May last was the first intimation that Dr. Large had that the amount of the grant should be used for the construction of the school at the new town site. This seems very strange because in the manuscript Estimates which Mr. Vowell forwarded on the 14th Nov. 1899 he pointed out in asking for this grant of $400.00, that the building was to be at the new village site. However, the question now to be decided is how the disappointment of these Indians may be overcome. I would suggest, under the circumstances\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume6385, File 802-5, part 1)\ncircumstances owing to the strong recommendation of Mr. Vowell that the expenditure be allowed to proceed and that we cover it by the Supplementary Estimates next year which will be tantamount to a re-vote.\n\nAccountant.\nOttawa, August 26th, 1901.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant I have to inform you that it has been decided to allow the expenditure on the Bella-Bella Indian School to continue during the current year.

The day school here is kept in an old building, rented by the church. The Indians have been here for years, and the roof is leaking. The size of the school room is about 12 x 15 ft., containing 30 sq. ft. rooms, with doors for the boys' and girls' rooms. The number of children attending school are in the vicinity that the Indians attend residential schools.\n\nIt will thus be seen that the school room is too small, there being not enough seats, and too many children for one teacher to educate properly. Two or three new pupils are expected next year, and the tax going out.\n\nTo remedy these conditions it is recommended that a new two-roomed school building be erected, with new windows and shutters, so that a teacher can teach on one side and a child on the other, from October to March (final) sufficient shelter of desks should also be provided.\n\nAs last year's expenses is placed the sum of $600.00 for a new day school with teacher's residence at [redacted]. The day school building has to be done, though ready enough for the purpose, but is not suitable. The teacher is doing another living in the mission house. If the church intends to keep this up there is no such great need for a teacher's residence.\n\nIn view of what is stated above, and the fact that it is now so difficult to keep a teacher, the relief work is greatly needed. The Indians are in need of the work; I am sure they would be glad to be employed. New day school building will be built on [redacted] along the road, and the combined cost may not exceed the sum of $600.00.\n\nCopy of this letter is being sent to Capt.

I do not consider that the Department should build another schoolroom on to the existing building. The latter is not in sufficiently good condition for this. As far as I can see there should be a modern two room school in this village; but as many of the children from Bella Bella go on to residential schools at present, the whole matter of policy with regard to the education in such fairly large villages would have to be first decided. It is no use building modern schools of more than one room, and then allowing the children to leave the village for residential schools, in which their education and keep costs the Department considerably more money. There are too many children here now for one teacher. About a dozen will go to residential schools in September, 1933, but there will be about another dozen beginners to take their places in this day school.\nDay Schools.\n\nVoucher No. 24/30\n\nVote No.\n\nGOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS, BRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nBella Coola AGENCY\n\nTo: British Columbia Packers Ltd., Bella Bella, B.C.\n\nDATE DETAIL AMOUNT\n\n1933\n\nApr. 30 To material for day school at Bella Bella 5 10\n\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that all expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nForm No. II\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is considered that the teacher or yourself should have foreseen the danger of the building collapsing from the weight of the snow and arranged to have same removed. At other schools, this work is considered part of the janitor's duties; but, as the teacher at this school is paid for janitor services, it is thought that she could have arranged to have the older boys or Indians remove the snow.\n\nAs it appears, from your telegram, that the rebuilding of the woodshed is necessary, you may include an expenditure not exceeding the sum of approximately $50 in the purchase of the material required and the labour in carrying out the work, at as early a date as weather conditions permit. Any materials required should be purchased from a firm on the list to receive consideration, and the labour, as far as possible, should be performed by Indians. After the work has been completed, please forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, in the usual manner, covering the expenditure incurred. The Department would request that the accounts be received before our books close at the end of the present fiscal year, viz.: March 31st, next.\n\nI would request, further, that you give attention to the removing of snow from the roofs of any of the school buildings where damage is likely to occur and arrange to have this work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

C.\n\nDear Mr. Fougner:\n\nI would be very grateful if you could arrange with the Department to have the Bella Coola Indian Day School provided with suitable lighting as I find that under the present half-day system the schoolwork extends into the late afternoon at which time the school becomes too dark to carry on the work.\n\nAs my reports show, I have seventy pupils enrolled who attend fairly regularly during the winter months. As I can only seat thirty-six at a time it is necessary to take half of the class in the morning and half in the afternoon. By three o'clock it is dark, giving the higher grades only two to three hours schooling each day.\n\nAn electric lighting system could be installed from the hospital engine for ten dollars ($10) and the cost per year for upkeep would be fifteen dollars ($15). It would mean a lot to the older children who are quite bright and who would then be able to have an extra hour each afternoon.\n\nAs an alternative, two gas lamps could be purchased at about fifteen dollars ($15) and there would be the extra cost of generator, gas, matches, etc. This would not be as safe an electric light, nor as convenient, and for the longer run would probably come to about the same expense. However, we would be glad to have either one if the Department will supervise it.\n\nThis suggestion has been approved by the Acting Commissioner, Mr. J. C. Terry, and by Captain O. H. Berry, Inspector of Indian Schools.\n\nHoping that this letter will receive your early consideration,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Miss) Florence Levy\n\nIndian Affairs.

This would mean that the R.P. Large Memorial hospital install the lighting apparatus, and furnish necessary current from the system lighting the hospital.

The accounts covering the cost should be rendered in triplicate and forwarded to Mr. Agent Fournier to be certified and sent to the Department for payment.\n\nThe Agent has requested that you be written direct, in order to save time in having the installation made and the light supplied for the use of the classroom in the school.

Fougner, Indian Agent,\nBella Coola.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nRegarding Day School at Bella Bella,\n\nAs I understand that the building of a two room school has been recommended to the Department, I would like to state that I am very much in favor of such a thing and I hope that it will be possible for the Department to go ahead with it in the near future.\n\nHaving been here for twenty one years, I feel that I know local conditions and that with the limited opportunities for employment away from the village, that the people will be just as much at home in the future as they have been for the last few years. Some time ago, the attendance was very poor during most of the school year because the people were away from home. Now, as has no doubt been self evident, the children have been attending very well, and are increasing in numbers so that only a portion of them can be accommodated in the present school and the teacher has had to have half day classes.\n\nThis of course cuts down the chance each child has to get ahead, and with the shortened term due to late return from the canneries etc., the child cannot advance as rapidly as he should. In addition, there is the extra strain on the teacher of having to handle approximately twice as many different children each day, as she would have with one lot only.\n\nThanking you for your consideration and for forwarding this to the proper authorities, I am\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6385, File 802-5, part 2)\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that in former years when Indians were often employed at work away from their reserves they generally took their families with them. The result was that the day schools were poorly attended, and there was ample room for the children in the villages where Indians stay in their villages for want of employment outside, with the result that the children attend the day schools, and there is not room for them all. This will likely also apply to the future.\n\nBella Bella has an Indian population of over 400; the pupils on the register of the day school were, last quarter, 35. The school building here is old, and so small that some of the children attended in the forenoon, and the others in the afternoon. A great number of the children of this village are also at the residential school at Alert Bay.\n\nA new two-room school building is required in this village. The old building could be used as a playroom during recesses in rainy weather. The cost of a suitable building, with a wood-shed, should be about $800.00. I inclose letter on this subject from Dr. C. J. Darby, Superintendent of the hospital at Bella Bella.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 3, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th ultimo, enclosing a communication from Dr. Darby, regarding the need of a new two-roomed school for the Indian children at Bella Bella, to replace the present old building, which is too small to provide classroom accommodation for the children on the reserve.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will have no funds during the present fiscal year to erect a new building. However, the need will be kept in mind, and, when our Estimates are being prepared for the next fiscal year, the matter of providing funds for the purpose will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nI. Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola,\nB. C.\nExtract from June Quarter Return, 1935, received from the teacher of the Bella Bella Indian Day School. Original on File 162-3-2.\n\nThis school is far too crowded. The seating capacity is 36 and many days in the winter over fifty attend. The average attendance for seven months this year has been well over forty each month. The present half-day system is not satisfactory. A two room school is most necessary. There will be 23 children ready to start school in September and unless something is done to relieve the present system, I will have to turn away some of them as to give the rest the best possible education.\n\n(Sgd.) F. L. Ferry.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inclose herewith Day School return from Bella Bella for quarter ended June 30, 1931.\n\nAs to the Secretary's remarks about the school being crowded, I beg to refer to your letter No. 162-3-5 of date instant.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In the Estimates for this fiscal year I placed the sum of $3500.00 for the erection of a two-roomed day school at this place.\n\nMiss Young of Bella Coola reports insufficiency of school desks.

The present building, built before my time in office, some 30 or forty years ago, by the Church authorities, is too small to accommodate all the pupils; and the number is too great for one teacher to handle. Last quarter the enrollment was 62, average attendance, 50. The number will increase in the future. A large number of children from this village are in residential schools.\n\nIn this year's Estimates I placed the sum of $3500.00 for the purpose of erecting a two-roomed school at Bella Bella. Indians could do the work under a white foreman, when they are not fishing at the canneries. The main fishing season takes in the months of July & August. Two outhouses, and a shed for wood and coal would also be required.\n\nIf the Department authorizes this building, perhaps plans and specifications could be made at Ottawa. The building should rest on concrete piers. The ground is such that no excavation can be made for a basement. It is somewhat swampy, and not far to bedrock.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nJune 18th,\n1936.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nI understand you to say when I was in Ottawa the last time that there is no money in the Estimates this year for the erection of new day school buildings at Bella Bella. Evidently, Captain Harry who has, as you know, been pressing for a new two-roomed day school, with teachers attached, for that place, has given quite a number of people in British Columbia to understand that a new day school is to be erected this summer and that an additional teacher will be required at the opening of the Fall term. As a consequence, we are in receipt of applications from teachers for a position which, so far as we know, will not materialize.\n\nI should be glad to hear from you by return mail as to whether or not there has been a change in the situation with regard to the new school at Bella Bella within the last few weeks.\n\nThanking you, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6385, File 802-5, part 2)\nOttawa, June 17, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Beaton:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, relative to the erection of a new day school building at Bella Bella.\n\nThe Department was unable to obtain the funds required in either the Appropriation for Indian Education or in the allotment from the Public Works Construction Act. It will therefore not be possible to erect a new building, to contain two classrooms, during the present fiscal year.\n\nThe need of a new building at this point will be kept in mind and consideration will be given when the Estimates for the coming fiscal year are being prepared.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B. A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto, Ont.\nBella Bella Day School.\n\nI did not strike this school during session. I however, met Miss Perry, the teacher. The trouble at this school is want of accommodation. The room is far too small for an attendance of 60, which will be increased to 80 at the commencement of the school year. Another teacher and more desks are necessary at once as temporary accommodation for a class room can be arranged for. A two-roomed day school will have to be built ultimately, the old class room being used for wet day accommodation, the wet days being very frequent and the children having nowhere to go to play.\n\nSchools General\n\nOne thing has struck me in connection with the day schools in this agency and that is the large increase in attendance, really beyond the accommodation we have and the number of teachers.\n\nHowever, this agency is not alone in this as I have found the same large increase in nearly all the day schools I have visited this year. Day school accommodation is now one of the most pressing and urgent necessities before the Department.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nBella Bella Cannery, B.

(RG 10, Volume 6385, File 802-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, July 14th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nVery careful consideration has been given to the report of Inspector Barry regarding his inspection of the Bella Bella Indian Day School on May 31st, last.\n\nWhile a second classroom is, no doubt, necessary, at the same time I must point out that no funds were provided in our current year's appropriation for the salary of the extra teacher, the new equipment that would be required and for the rent of the building proposed to be used for the second classroom. Our funds are so limited that it is impossible to consider an expenditure for which no provision has been made. Under these circumstances, I regret that the Department is not prepared to approve the opening of a second classroom at the Bella Bella School for the academic year 1937-38.\n\nAn endeavour will be made to provide funds in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1938-39 for the erection of a new school at Bella Bella. If this is allowed, we will also provide the amount required for the salary of a second teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nD. H. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of June 28th, I beg to report as follows.\n\nThere are approximately seventy-five children of school age at Bella Bella. There were sixty-three on the roll last year. It is possible that six or seven of these will be transferred to St. Michael's School at Alert Bay, but there will be at least fifteen beginners.\n\nAs the school is on the half day system at present, progress is anything but satisfactory. I have visited this school each month and there has been very little progress shown. As the Department could not see its way to building a new two-room school this year, I recommend that a building belonging to the village Band be rented and used as an additional school room. The extra expense, apart from the teacher's salary and cost of desks, will be as follows:\n\n- Rental of building, 6 months @ $10.00...$60.00\n- Blackboard, axe, chair, table etc.............$5.00\n- Heating stove.................................$5.00\n- Firewood, 6 cords @ $10.00..................$60.00\n- Erection of woodshed and toilets.............$50.00\n\nI would suggest that the second teacher be engaged for nine months only, beginning in October, owing to the fact that a number of the children will not be in the village until that time.\n\nIn my letter of August 4th last, when I made recommendations similar to the above, the rental of the building was given as $5.00 per month, and the Indians were then willing to erect the building free of charge. This year, however, they could not get the same terms. The reason for the change may be that a new committee is looking after the building, and I insisted on some improvements on the building. I consider that ten dollars a month is a reasonable charge. It is understood that all furnishings, including blackboard etc., will be transferred to the new school when built.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nR.A.

By this means a reduction in the cubical area of the building can be effected which will allow a saving of about $1,500.00 and it is estimated that the building could be erected for the sum of about $9,000.00.\n\nThe sketch submitted with your memorandum of the 12th ultimo was examined by our Architects but as this would involve a building which would cost at least $17,000.00 it cannot be considered.\n\nI should be glad if you would look over the attached blueprints and return one set initialled if you approve.\n\nDirector.\nDear Sir,\n\nKindly advise if it is the intention of the Department to build a new school at Bella Bella this year. If it is, I would suggest that the site be cleared immediately as the work will help lessen relief. I have had a number of requests recently from Bella Bella Indians for relief, and I see no prospect of their earning anything by fishing until July first.\n\nI estimated in a previous letter, that $150 would be required to clear the site for the new school. If the above meets with the Department's approval, I would suggest that a cheque for $125 for labour be sent me.\n\nIf blasting powder has to be purchased through the Department's purchasing agent, I may say that the only firm in Vancouver from whom it can be obtained is the Canadian Industries Ltd. I believe however, it would be better, as only a small quantity is needed, and as it is not possible to have it brought in on the regular passenger steamer, that I be allowed to purchase the powder at Ocean Falls where they usually have some on hand. It could be taken from there to Bella Bella by gasoline boat. The material required is listed on a separate sheet.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This work cost $124.80. The muskeg was deeper than I had anticipated and under the muskeg were boulders instead of bedrock as I thought. As no machinery was available all the work of removing the stones had to be done by hand labour.

There was no other source of income in this village during the month. Fishermen were busy getting their boats ready for the coming season. The school was fairly well attended. There was no serious illness in the village, but there was the usual number of patients in the hospital.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nAgent.\nDear Sir,\n\nBy letter No. 162-3-5 of June 2nd, I notice the size of the proposed new school at Bella Bella will be 54 by 43 feet. I would gather from this that the teachers' residence cannot be on the ground floor.\n\nIf the residence is to be above the school, a pump and storage tank will be necessary, as there is not sufficient pressure in the main to raise the water above the ground floor. I would recommend a 100 gallon galvanized storage tank to be placed under cover within the building.\n\nI think it possible that a hydraulic ram type of pump could be used, and I am today writing Mr. Webb for his advice.\n\nIn previous correspondence I stated that a pump and tank would not be necessary, but at that time I was of the impression that the teachers' residence would be on the same level as the school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nOctober 3rd, 1938.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nMay I draw your attention again to the fact that under the circumstances existing in this village the children are not receiving a very good education. I think you know that the school is too small and that you have made provision in the estimates for the erection of a new building, which will no doubt be a very fine addition to the buildings which you have at the coast. In the meantime, however, the children are suffering. The teacher is trying to teach two schools at the same time - one in the forenoon and the other in the afternoon.\n\nWould it be possible, in the meantime, to set up school in the church hall, to take care of the second room until the new building is completed? I do not know what the church authorities would want, but I think that possibly $10.00 a month would cover the expenses of this, and the new desks, blackboards, etc., which would be necessary, could easily be transferred to the new schoolroom when it is ready, at whatever time in the future, near or remote, that may be. Would you be good enough to give the matter your best attention and see what can be done? Dr. Osterhout is very anxious to see these children get a good education, and, as you know, they are above the general average of the native population throughout the country.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6385, File 802-5, part 2)\nOttawa,\nOctober 7, 1938.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nOn receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant I immediately communicated with the Surveys & Engineering Branch and find that due to circumstances beyond their control it was not possible to proceed with the erection of the Bella Bella Indian Day School during the past few months. However, they expect to let the contract and have construction started by the first of November. This will mean another 4 or 5 months before the building will be ready for occupation.\n\nIn the meantime I am instructing Indian Commissioner MacKay to rent the building mentioned in your letter and purchase the desks and other equipment that would be needed. I consider that the equipment will be in the Church hall within the next month. I should, therefore, appreciate it if you would nominate the services of a teacher to commence duties about November 15.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Geo.

However, they have advertised for tenders which are returnable here on October 20 and it is hoped that the contract will be let and construction started early in November. This means, of course, that the building will not be ready for occupation for 4 or 5 months.\n\nIn the meantime I should appreciate it if you would make arrangements for renting the Church hall mentioned in Doctor Dorey's letter at a rental of $10.00 a month.\n\nYesterday I wired you for information regarding the desks that would be needed and as soon as I have your reply I will take up the matter with the Purchasing Agent and arrange with him to forward you the names of the firms from whom quotations are to be requested.\n\nAn order for new blackboards is being placed with the Government Stationery Office and any other minor equipment that you consider necessary for this building may be purchased from firms on the approved list.\n\nMajor D.

When this reading was taken, several outdoor taps in the village were open and a 2\" iron pipe at the north end of the village was leaking badly at two or three points.\n\nLevels to the school site show that the kitchen tap at the school will be 27.75 feet higher in elevation than the tap at Point \"A\". This leaves a static head of approximately 28 feet for outlets on the ground floor of the school. This should provide a flow of about 9 gallons per minute, assuming that leakage losses from the main pipe are no higher in the future than at time of examination. Elimination of some of these losses would no doubt provide sufficient head to\n\nG.E. Webb, Eng.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water and Power Bureau,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\ncarry water into the upper floors of the building if this should be required.\n\nThe proposed pipeline extension starts at the end of a 2-inch wood stave pipe now in place, paralleling the boardwalk leading from the main street to the church, continues in the same general direction for about 70 feet, then turns north and west as shown on the sketch about 243 feet further, entering the school wall at this point. The first 100 feet of the extension will be 2-inch wood stave pipe, the remainder will be 1\" galvanized wrought iron pipe. From the west side of the muskeg area shown on sketch to the school it would not be possible to place the pipe in trench without dynamite. It is intended that this section of the pipe should be laid on the rock outcrop and covered to a depth of two feet with material already excavated from the school site. This should be placed carefully and the finer material selected so as to give better insulation against frost. Pipe laid in trench should be buried to a depth of two feet.\n\nA half-inch iron pipe leads from the end of the 2-inch W.S. pipe now in place to the old school. This is leaking at the stop and waste. The necessary repairs should be made in order to supply water to the old school until the new school is ready for occupation, after which it should be cut off from the line.\n\nProvision is made for the installation of a Total Eclipse self-draining tap outside the new school. This tap should be placed in such position as not to interfere with a driveway lead-\ning to the fuel room at the rear of the school. A stop and waste valve is to be installed outside the school wall.\n\nThe installation is estimated to cost $216.90. Details of this estimate are appended hereto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.L.

C.,\nFebruary 20th, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am advised by Major MacKay, Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, that it is not the Department's policy to have toilets and running water in the Indian Day Schools. This was in reply to a telegram sent to the Department by Major MacKay subsequent to my interview with the Commissioner in Vancouver.\n\nWhat I had in mind chiefly was toilet and bath facilities for the teachers' residence at Bella Coola. While this may be a wise policy in so far as the school itself is concerned, I feel that it is a little short of a hardship that the teachers should not have these conveniences, particularly when some of the Indian homes nearby are equipped with such facilities.\n\nThe chemical toilet is anything but satisfactory, as it will require frequent cleaning. I note the plans calls for a pit placed under the sink for drainage. This will require attention daily. I think it should not be expected of the teachers living on an Indian Reserve with various unavoidable privations to do without such everyday necessities, as bath, proper toilet, and sink facilities where they can be readily installed with running water available, for an outlay which would cost as follows:\n\n- Septic Tank with necessary fittings, including Soil Pipe from bathroom to tank, etc. $150.00\n- Toilet, wash basin, bath, hot water boiler. (Approximately) $75.00\n- Installation of toilet, bath, etc. $10.00\n- Total. $235.00\n\nI trust that the Department will reconsider their decision, and allow installation of these facilities in the teachers' residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nThree schools were visited during the month, and the attendance was excellent. I found it necessary at Bella Bella to change Miss Jessop to the Junior room, and put Miss Allen in charge of the Seniors. Good progress is being made in constructing the new school at Bella Bella.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am advised by Major Mackay, Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, that it is not the Department's policy to have toilets and running water in the Indian Day Schools. This was in reply to a telegram sent to the Department by Major Mackay subsequent to my interview with the Commissioner in Vancouver.\n\nWhat I had in mind chiefly was toilet and bath facilities for the teachers' residence at Bella Coola. While it may be a wise policy in so far as the school itself is concerned, I feel that it is a little short of a hardship that the teachers should not have these conveniences, particularly when some of the Indian homes nearby are equipped with such facilities.\n\nThe chemical toilet is anything but satisfactory, as it will require frequent cleaning. I note the plan calls for a pail placed under the sink for drainage. This will require attention daily. I think it should not be expected of the teachers living on an Indian Reserve with various unavoidable privations to do without such everyday necessities, as bath, proper toilet, and sink facilities where they can be readily installed with running water available, for an outlay which would cost as follows:\n\n- Septic Tank with necessary fittings, including Soil Pipe from bathroom to tank, etc. $150.00\n- Toilet, wash basin, bath, hot water boiler. (Approximately) $7.00\n- Installation of toilet, bath, etc. $10.00\n- Total. $167.00\n\nI trust that the Department will reconsider their decision, and allow installation of these facilities in the teachers' residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nMarch 3, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter dated the 20th ultimo from Indian Agent Gillett again urging the installation of a septic tank, also toilet and bath facilities in the teachers' residence at the Bella Bella Indian day school.\n\nIt is difficult to understand why this matter has again been brought to our attention. As you have no doubt advised Indian Agent Gillett it is not our policy to make the installations requested in Indian day schools.\n\nFor our future information I should appreciate your advising if it is usual to make such installations in rural white schools in British Columbia. I know that such action is not taken in rural white schools in the other provinces.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa,\nMarch 3, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo with reference to the installation of a septic tank, also toilet and bath facilities in the teachers' residence at Bella Bella.\n\nAs you have been informed by Indian Commissioner MacKay it is not the Department's policy to make such installations. As far as I am aware in adopting this policy we are in line with the policy followed in rural white schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. Gillett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B. C.\nMarch 20, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Your File 162-3-5.\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Hoey's letter of March 3rd regarding the installation of inside toilets and septic tank at the Bella Bella Indian Day School, now in course of construction.\n\nMr. Gillett has explained his second reference of the matter to the Department by saying that he thought the information given to him was in connection with the school itself and did not necessarily apply to the teacher's quarters.\n\nThe Chief Engineer, Department of Public Works, has advised this office that no provision is made for plumbing and septic tanks in rural white schools, and this includes Provincial Schools where the teacher's residence forms part of the School or is attached thereto.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

In his letter, however, Mr. Webb recommended that, owing to the heavy and violent rainfall experienced in that area, gutters, rainwater leaders and a weeping tile drain should be provided and that the pitch waterproofing on the basement walls should be extended from grade to top of concrete.\n\nMr. Webb has secured a price from Mr. Currie, the contractor who built the school, covering all the items as follows:\n\n1) 5\" wood gutter and 5\" galvanized iron down pipes on main eaves.\n\n2) 4\" wood gutter and 2\" galvanized iron down pipes on eaves at entrances.\n\n3) 4\" tile drain connected to down pipes carrying roof water 10'0\" away from building at two lowest points.\n\n4) Two coats of hot coal tar pitch from present point to top of concrete walls of workshop, fuel room and sewing room.\n\n5) Gutters and down pipes to be given two coats of paint to match other work.\n\nThe above five items to be executed for the sum of Three Hundred and Eighty-six Dollars ($386.00).\n\nIn connection with the items included in the estimate, I may say that in view of (a) the recent decision of the Department to install drainage in Indian Schools and (b) the particularly heavy rainfall in the Bella Bella area, it is felt that the drain and gutters\n\nJ.M.

This School was recently visited by the Inspector of Indian Agencies and he informs me that the grounds surrounding the building are in an extremely bad condition, being full of large holes, mud, water, heaps of excavated rubbish and dangerous snags, and that sooner or later a child will receive serious injury unless the ground in use is cleared up.\n\nHe also points out that, for some unaccountable reason, no connecting door has been installed in the corridor outside of the classrooms and, at present, each room has only one exit to the outside and, if it is required to proceed from one room to the other, it is necessary to descend a flight of stairs, go outside and climb through mud holes, etc., to the other side of the building; and then ascend a similar flight of stairs to the classroom that adjoins the other. In the absence of outside fire escapes, these classrooms would be cut off if a fire broke out near one of the staircases, which lead down to the teachers' quarters, but that installation of the door would make the other entrances available to both rooms. If the door and frame were supplied at a cost of approximately $10.00, it could no doubt be satisfactorily installed by a local Indian carpenter at a labour cost of $15.00 or a total of $25.00, and I would recommend that this be done.\n\nThe Inspector reports that the paint work on this building is, in his opinion, far from satisfactory and it would appear that very poor quality paint has been used. That used for the roof has washed down and stained the walls. The outside wall paint is blistered. The paint on the basement floors will never dry sufficiently to permit the use of these two large rooms and should be removed and redecorated with the\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nproper material. Some caulking with pitch has been done on the outside of the building where the frame construction rests on the concrete foundation and, due to the fact that there was no overhang of the siding, water leaked into the basement, a condition that has not yet been entirely remedied. The application of this pitch has been done in a slipshod manner and smeared up the wall to an unnecessary extent. Common iron hinges have been used on the outside doors with the butts on the outside and are already rusting and untidy.\n\nI enclose a rough sketch showing where the door is required and photographs of the School, from which it will also be observed that portions of the scaffolding were not even removed to complete the painting and which also show the other items referred to.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

I should also appreciate it if you would let me know what steps can be taken to prevent such a recurrence in future.\n\nI shall await your reply before authorizing the Agent to incur the expenditure required for installing a door between the two class rooms.\n\nActing Director.\nThe basement window in the new school at Bella Bella was broken during the Christmas Holidays by some school boys and an rance was made several times afterwards, and various articles and school supplies were stolen. The parties responsible will be brought before a Juvenile Judge at an early date. There seems to be a general lack of parental discipline at this village which is making it difficult for the school teachers who are getting very little cooperation from the parents. The agent called a meeting in the Community Hall at which the majority of the parents and children were present, and the seriousness of this situation was discussed. The Indians were very emphatic in their request for a male principal at this school, capable of teaching manual training.\n\nThe two basement rooms of the Bella Bella school are still unfit for use since the paint has not dried, and there is no indication that it will ever do so. I would suggest that this paint should be scraped and the proper material applied so that these rooms can be used for manual training etc., and also for play rooms for the children during the rainy spells.\n\nOn my last visit to the school, Miss Jeffers was sick, and consequently the senior pupils were not present. With the connecting door in the partition on the landing, it would be possible for one teacher to supervise both rooms in an emergency.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nJanuary 18, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe - Bella Bella Indian Day School\n\nIn connection with your memorandum of the 3rd instant regarding the above with which you forwarded a letter and photographs from the Acting Director of the Indian Affairs Branch, I may say that we have also received a communication relative to the same project from Mr. Webb. The latter has forwarded with his letter copies of a letter to the Indian Affairs Branch from Indian Commissioner MacKay regarding the School, together with a report from Engineer Ramsden who supervised the erection of the building.\n\nFor your information, I am transmitting herewith a copy of the following documents:\n\n(1) Letter dated December 29th, from Mr. Webb to the undersigned.\n(2) Letter dated December 14th, from Indian Commissioner MacKay to Mr. Webb.\n(3) Memorandum dated December 29th, from Engineer Ramsden to Mr. Webb.\n(4) Memorandum dated December 27th, from Acting Director, Indian Affairs Branch to Mr. Wardle with photographs.\n\nYou will observe that Commissioner MacKay calls attention to the following:\n\n(1) There is no communicating door between boys' and girls' accommodation on the classroom floor.\n\n(2) Caulking and waterproofing carried out last summer, after the completion of the school, have not eliminated evidences of dampness in the basement.\n\n(3) Poor quality paint has been used on both the exterior of the building and the basement floors. Shingle stain has washed down from the roof and stained the paint on exterior walls.\n\n(4) Door hinges are rusting because of inferior quality.\n\n(5) Portions of scaffolding used by the Contractor in painting have not been removed.\n\n(6) The grounds generally surrounding the School are untidy and require grading.\n\nDealing with the items in the above order, I may say that:\n\n(1) When the plans were being prepared for this School Mr. Dudley informs me that Mr. Hoey and Mr. Phelan stated to him verbally that there was to be no communication between boys' and girls' classrooms. Communication was to be provided between these areas------\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nareas for the teacher through the teacher's quarters.\n\n(2) To eliminate dampness in the basement caulking and waterproofing was carried out during the past summer along with the installation of gutters and extra drainage as recommended by Mr. Webb on July 10th last. As the results obtained do not appear to be completely satisfactory Mr. Webb advised us on the 7th ultimo that he is carrying out an inspection of the building to determine the cause of dampness and will report to this office. This report has not yet been received.\n\n(3) It would appear that painting of floors was carried out in the basement while dampness was still present, thus preventing adhesion between paint and concrete. It will be necessary to eliminate dampness entirely before a permanent correction of this fault can be effected. This is contingent upon Mr. Webb's report. The remaining paint items, which appear very minor, will be dealt with in the same report.\n\n(4) You will observe that Mr. Ramsden's report states that brass coated hinges were installed as specified.\n\n(5) The portions of scaffolding as shown on attached photographs are insignificant.\n\n(6) The suggested improvements to the School grounds in general is a matter under the jurisdiction of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nIn connection with the subject matter of this memorandum we would point out that on November 14th last Mr. Webb advised us that he had received the Contractor's account for items authorized by letter of August 29th last but owing to reports which he had received indicating that the measures employed to ensure a dry basement were not completely satisfactory, he was not passing the account for payment until an inspection had been made.\n\nWhen the engineer's report is received from Mr. Webb we will advise you further.\n\nWould you kindly return the attached photographs to this Service when they have served your purpose.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nChief Engineer.\nFebruary 15, 1940\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nIn your memorandum of December 27th you quoted from a letter received from Indian Commissioner MacKay relative to the Bella Bella Indian Day School, which was built by contract during the past season.\n\nThe various points mentioned by Mr. MacKay have been investigated by our Chief Engineer, and I am forwarding herewith, for your information, copies of memoranda received from him, dated January 18th and February 5th last. I think these two memoranda cover all the points referred to by Mr. MacKay.\n\nCertain defects in the building are due to poor work by the contractor and the necessary action is being taken by our officers to have these remedied. There is an amount still due the contractor for work done on the building and he is being advised that final payment will be withheld until all work has been completed in accordance with the specifications.\n\nYou will note that some of the other items of work mentioned by Mr. MacKay as being necessary were not done because of decisions made by officers of your Branch. Direct communication between the boys' and girls' classrooms is one of these items. If this communication door is now considered necessary, there is no reason why it should not be put in.\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle,\n\nRe: Bella Bella Indian Day School.\n\nFurther to my memorandum of the 18th ultimo in connection with the above, we are now in receipt of a report by Engineer McDonald dated the 8th ultimo, forwarded with Mr. Webb's covering letter of January 22nd last.\n\nFor your information I am forwarding herewith duplicate copies of the following documents:\n\n(a) Mr. Webb's letter of the 22nd ultimo to this Service,\n(b) Mr. Webb's letter of the 12th ultimo to the Contractor,\n(c) Report by Engineer McDonald.\n\nYou will observe that the matter of dampness in the basement has been thoroughly investigated by Mr. McDonald who has determined definitely by tests that water does not enter the basement through concrete foundation walls or floors, and that if at any time water entered the building at the top of the foundation wall, the work carried out during the past summer has remedied the condition.\n\nIn view of the engineer's findings, it is difficult to understand the significance of the third and eighth paragraphs of Mr. Webb's letter of the 22nd ultimo to this Service, or of the statement in his letter to the Contractor under date of the 12th ultimo, which was forwarded of course before he had received Mr. McDonald's report.\n\nFrom a perusal of Mr. McDonald's report it is considered that the remaining faults are entirely due to faulty workmanship by the contractor.\n\nThese may be listed as follows:\n\n(1) Paint on Basement Floor has remained gummy and tacky. Due to application of paint before surfaces were dry, paint will require removal and concrete surfaces repainted.\n\n(2) Water still enters building during rainstorms. As established by Mr. McDonald, in his report, leakages occur through unstopped nail holes and poorly fitted junctions.\n\n(3) Stains on exterior wall paint. While not covered by Mr. McDonald's report, it would appear that shingle stain had been applied during, or shortly before\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nOttawa.\na rainstorm, and the shingle stain had been washed down over the lower painted surfaces, which were never touched by it. Under the specification, it is the contractor's responsibility to rectify such items.\n\nAs you will observe certain extra work on this building was authorized by the Department on August 25th last at a cost of $386.00. This extra work has been satisfactorily completed; but Mr. Webb has not forwarded the accounts pending the receipt of Mr. McDonald's report on the whole project.\n\nUnder the circumstances it is recommended that we be authorized to have Mr. Webb instruct the contractor, John Currie & Son of Prince Rupert, to make the necessary repairs at his own expense before making any settlement for work carried out during the past summer.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\nChief Engineer.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 19, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of December 14 with reference to the Bella Bella Indian Day School.\n\nThe Surveys & Engineering Branch claim they had verbal instructions not to provide a connecting door. While I have no recollection of giving any such instructions at the same time there is no value in discussing the matter further with the Surveys & Engineering Branch and consequently you may authorize the Agent to incur the expenditure of $25.00 for the installation of this door.\n\nI understand that Mr. Webb has taken up with the contractor the question of paint on the basement floor and other defects in the building. It is the intention to have the contractor make necessary repairs before paying him a balance that is still due.\n\nWith regard to the condition of the grounds around the school the Surveys & Engineering Branch consider that this work should be handled by us. Consequently you might have inquiries made with a view to determining what expenditure would be involved in placing the grounds in reasonably good condition. It is understood, of course, that no funds for the purpose will be available until our appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41 is approved, and at the present time I am unable to state what amount will be available. Consequently you should impress on the Agent the necessity of securing quotations on the work that is most necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.

(RG 10, Volume 6385, File 802-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nREPORT ON\nINSPECTION OF BELLA BELLA SCHOOL,\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nWith reference to the above, I wish to report\nthat on the 18th ultimo I visited Mr. Webb in Vancouver\nand reviewed the items reported in a letter from Commis-\nsioner MacKay dated December 14th, 1939. It was explained\nto Mr. Webb that the inspection was being carried out with\na view to determining the reason for such reports.\n\nMr. Webb was informed that, as stated in a letter\nfrom the Chief Engineer, Engineering and Construction Ser-\nvice, dated February 23rd, 1940, it was felt that several\nof the defects mentioned by Commissioner MacKay, in con-\nnection with the school, should have been detected through\ninspections carried out by his staff during construction and\nremedied before the building was accepted as complete.\n\nMr. Webb replied that short of having an engineer\nremain constantly at the school during construction, he felt\nhe had given as much attention to supervision as was possible\nwith the staff at his disposal, particularly since the site\nwas 40 hours' steamer's drive from Vancouver. He stated that\nsupervision had been constantly maintained while concrete\nwas being poured, (which statement is supported by his letter\nto the Chief Engineer dated June 27th, 1939), and that four\nsubsequent inspection trips were made during the remainder\nof the construction period.\n\nIt was pointed out to Mr. Webb that supervision,\nas demanded by the peculiar requirements of each job, was\nnecessary at all times, and that if it became apparent that\nsuch supervision could not be supplied from field offices,\nother arrangements would be sought for, or instructions from\nOttawa. Mr. Webb was also advised that authority vested in\nfield officers included the right to challenge the suita-\nbility of sites selected by Indian Agents for schools where\nconditions indicated that the use of such sites might cause\ntrouble in the future.\n\nI arrived at Bella Bella at 3.30 A.M. on Friday\nthe 22nd ultimo and carried out a thorough inspection of\nthe school on that day, paying particular attention to the\nfollowing points which had been reported to this Service.\n\n(1) Condition of paint work in basement\nwork rooms.\n\n(2) Condition of exterior paint work.\n\n(3) Presence of water in basement work\nrooms.\n\n(4) Untidy condition of site.\nDealing with the various items in the order given above, I may say that I found conditions to be as follows:\n\n(1) Basement Work Room Paint Work\n\nPaint work in the basement work rooms was exactly as described in complaints received from Dr. Darby, Hospital Superintendent at Bella Bella, and Indian Commissioner MacKay. I found that the paint used was lead and oil floor paint of the same type as specified. This had been applied to concrete not thoroughly dry and which was exposed to running water through wall leakages immediately after it had been applied. Paint from the walls had been washed down to the floor where it had emulsified, as had also the paint applied to the floor. Traffic over this emulsion had broken the pigment film and patches of free oil were visible over most of the floor area. It is possible that this free oil might have been mistaken for water in some of the complaints registered.\n\nIt was obvious that the condition would not improve until the paint had been removed, the affected areas thoroughly cleaned and new paint applied.\n\n(2) Exterior Paint Work\n\nThe exterior paint work was examined regarding reported blistering and staining. I was unable to discover any blistering but observed that where water had dripped from the sloping roof over both entrances, the adjacent wall paint had been discoloured. Upon investigation I was able to establish that this discolouration was not stain from the shingles but a dirty deposit carried down from roof surfaces above, before the installation of gutters and down pipes, and which was removable when washed.\n\n(3) Water Penetration\n\nWhen I visited the school there was no evidence of water in the basement, and while rain fell frequently during my stay, no infiltration was observed. I am convinced that at no time has water entered the building through concrete walls or floors, and while the interior of the basement concrete walls show water stain, it was not possible to determine definitely where such water could have entered. However, I am satisfied myself that since the application of additional pitch waterproofing, which was applied from grade to top of the concrete basement walls during last summer, no water has entered the building at the junction of concrete and frame walls.\n\nI may say that I observed the points at which Engineer McDonald, of Mr. Webb's staff, found that water could enter the frame walls, and believe that if water still enters the basement, it is being admitted at those points, and possibly at the junction of the sloping roof over the south entrance with the adjacent walls as well. This could only be proven during a heavy driving rain or by means of a hose test, such as was carried out by Mr. McDonald on December 31st last, and described in his report dated January 22nd, 1940, a copy of which was forwarded to our...\nDirector with the Chief Engineer's memorandum of February 5th last.\n\nAn examination of the siding disclosed that, while siding as specified had been used, the type called for in the specification should not be used again for work in British Columbia. The siding used and specified is a \"lap\" siding, especially laid to provide a rain seal at the lap, restricting the lap to 1/8\" instead of 1\" which is considered the minimum advisable. While I was unable to discover any point where I considered water might be entering the wall, due to the reduced lap, any shrinkage or warping in the siding would create openings through which a driving rain might penetrate. No warping is evident, however, and it is felt that if the various spots now marked, were caulked with an approved compound and sealed, and the same treatment applied to the junction of the sloping roof over both entrances, with adjacent wall surfaces, the penetration of water would be eliminated.\n\nIt is recognized that during construction, Mr. Webb reported that water was entering the building at the junction of concrete and frame walls and that some attention was given to correcting the defects. In view of subsequent developments, however, it is considered that the admission of water was not thoroughly investigated. Reports on the condition prevailing were accepted from the Hospital Superintendent, who could not be expected to arrive at correct technical conclusions. If the engineer supervising the work had made every effort to eliminate leakage while the contractor was still at Bella-Bella considerable inconvenience might have been eliminated.\n\n(4) Site Conditions\n\nUpon seeing the site I was forced to admit that in the immediate vicinity of the school, it is in a deplorable condition. Nevertheless the objectionable features pointed out by Indian Commissioner MacKay are no fault of the Contractor.\n\nThe actual portion of the site occupied by the school was cleared of brush and boulders by the Indian Agent previous to the commencement of construction operations. Stumps and boulders are in evidence adjacent to the building which is located on a rock ledge covered with from two to four feet of muskeg soil. The site in rear of the school building rises gradually and rock outcroppings at the front of the site have resulted in the building being set in a depression. The gradual erosion cut by the Contractor prior to completion of building operations has been saturated with water draining into this depression from the adjacent muskeg and is being retained by the bed rock below. The resultant mud holes have necessitated the laying of rough plank walks, which, while unsightly, are nevertheless quite necessary.\nAfter visiting Bella Bella and before leaving Vancouver, I advised Indian Commissioner MacKay that, in my opinion, the site was badly chosen. He informed me that it had been considered the best available at the time of selection. In connection with the Commissioner's report that the site was untidy, I explained to him that references in his report, regarding responsibility for these conditions, were not altogether accurate, in that I could discover no building rubbish or material, left by the contractor, and that existing and future conditions were the responsibility of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nIt is confirmed that existing faults in connection with basement painting and infiltration of water are the responsibility of the Contractor, and in a letter from Mr. Webb dated February 26th, 1940, the Contractor, John Currie and Son, of Prince Rupert, British Columbia, was so advised, and he has since intimated his intention of making good all defects at his own expense.\n\nWe have been advised by Mr. Webb, in a letter dated the 4th instant, that the emulsified paint in the basement has already been removed and he is being advised that the balance of the work must be carried out at once.\n\nIt is pointed out that during the summer of last year, extra items considered necessary to rectify the dampness in the basement, were carried out at a cost of $286.00 by the same Contractor who built the school. Payment for this work has been deferred until such time as the defects referred to in this report have been made good.\n\nIt is recommended that when advice is received that the Contractor has completed the work still necessary, and while he is still at Bella Bella, Mr. Webb be instructed to carry out a thorough inspection of the school, to establish that the building has finally been made weatherproof.\n\nIn addition to the work still necessary at the school, in connection with the building proper, the site requires further clearing and grading which may involve some blasting before it can be considered at all presentable.\n\nIt is recommended that an additional 15'-0\" strip be cleared at the rear and two sides and the sufficient of the rock outcroppings at the front of the building be removed to allow grading to a continuous slope away from the school in an easterly direction. It is estimated that this additional work would involve an expenditure of approximately Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00).\n\nArchitect,\nEngineering and Construction Service.\n\nOttawa, Ontario,\nApril 30th, 1940.\nMay 4, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe - Bella Bella Indian Day School,\nBritish Columbia.\n\nIt is thought you will be interested in the attached report of our Architect, Mr. C.H. Buck, who recently made an inspection of the Bella Bella School in British Columbia, and in regard to which certain defects have come to light since it was completed by the contractor.\n\nThe contractor has promised to remedy, at his own expense, those defects for which, in our opinion, he is responsible and it is understood has already taken some action in this regard.\n\nIn regard to the poor condition of the site, this is not the fault nor the responsibility of the contractor, and certain work will have to be undertaken on the grounds immediately adjacent to the School to improve the general appearance. The Architect estimates that an additional $300 would cover this work and this could no doubt be arranged for by your Indian Commissioner with your Indian Agent. Some of the troubles encountered on this project were apparently due to the site selected being rather a poor one.\n\nWe will make arrangements for a further inspection of the building when the contractor has completed the work for which he is responsible.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nMay 9, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nI desire to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your memorandum of May 4 enclosing report of your Architect, Mr. C. H. Buck, regarding his inspection of the Bella Bella Indian Day School. It is noted that arrangements have been completed to have the contractor remedy, at his own expense, certain defects in the building.\n\nReferring to the third paragraph of your letter I would suggest that arrangements be made for a conference between your Architect and the officials of the Training Division with a view to discussing future action in connection with the selection of sites and the grading of the grounds. I feel it would be advisable, for the future guidance of your Branch and ours, to have a definite understanding regarding the manner in which these two matters should be dealt with in future.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Mills\n\nAttached herewith is a copy of a memorandum received from the Director of the Indian Affairs Branch, in regard to action that might be taken in future to ensure selection of better building sites, and the proper grading of the grounds after buildings are completed.\n\nI am in full agreement with Dr. McGill's suggestions, and would ask that you have an officer of your Branch discuss with the officials of the Training Division of the Indian Affairs Branch, a satisfactory procedure for taking care of the points mentioned.\n\nPlease let me know what is decided upon.\n\nDirector.\n## Return of Labour on the Bella Bella Day School Reserve\n\n**For Week Ending May 11th, 1949**\n\n| Name       | Number of Employment | Number of Hours | Rate | Total | Amount of Wages | Received Payment |\n|------------|----------------------|-----------------|------|-------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Andrew Wallace | Carpenter            |                 |      |       |                 |                  |\n\n---\n\n**Indian Affairs.

The painting, however, has not been done and I believe Mr. Currie is under the impression that the paint job will not be satisfactory since it is believed that in a wet spell, moisture will penetrate through the floor, the foundation having been laid on rock without leaving any drainage.\n\nMr. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nVancouver, B.C.,\nAugust 30, 1940.\n\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb:\n\nRe: Indian Day School, Bella Bella, B.C.\n\nAs instructed I arrived at the school on Sunday afternoon, August 18, in company with the contractor, John Currie, Esq., and immediately inspected the building.\n\nThe following is a report of the condition of the basement floors and siding of the building as found, and the repairs carried out. This inspection was made over a period of seven days, August 18 to 24 inclusive.\n\nWater Conditions.\n\nThe following rainfall data were obtained from the Meteorological Service of Canada, records made by W. R. Welch, Esq., of Bella Bella and illustrate the severe conditions obtaining in this locality even in the height of the summer season. In July, 1940, 6.91 inches of rain had fallen and in the seventeen days of August preceding my visit the following is the daily record:\n\n| Date | Rainfall (inches) |\n|------|-------------------|\n| Aug 1 | 0.70 inches       |\n| Aug 2 | 0.25 inches       |\n| Aug 3 | --                |\n| Aug 4 | --                |\n| Aug 5 | --                |\n| Aug 6 | 0.19 inches       |\n| Aug 7 | 1.05 inches       |\n| Aug 8 | 2.14 inches       |\n| Aug 9 | 1.12 inches       |\n| Aug 10| --                |\n| Aug 11| 1.20 inches       |\n| Aug 12| 1.35 inches       |\n| Aug 13| 1.17 inches       |\n| Aug 14| --                |\n| Aug 15| --                |\n| Aug 16| --                |\n| Aug 17| --                |\n| Aug 18| --                |\n\nThat is a total of 9.17 inches in eighteen days.\n\nC. E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water and Power Bureau,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\nCondition of the Concrete Basement Floors on August 18, 1946\n\nThe weather on August 18 was fine and warm and had been so for the four preceding days. Due to the heavy rains falling prior to August 14 and in spite of the hot weather following, the ground generally was very damp. Surface water showed six feet to eight feet away from the school on the north and west sides. Small trickles of water were observed to be coming from the drain outfalls indicating a continued subsurface drainage from the higher ground surrounding the school.\n\nIn the north basement room there was no visible moisture on the floor but in the south basement room there was a small amount of water in the southwest corner extending along the west wall for five feet. The water on the floor was dark brown in colour with no distinguishable odour. I believe it was stained by some cedar boards, used by the school, which were lying in it.\n\nHowever, under a three-foot by six-foot piece of painted wall board which was placed in the middle of the south room floor in June, the concrete was noticeably damp and the same condition was observed under some small pieces of wood in the south room.\n\nThe walls all appeared dry and gave no indication that water had been running down them.\nTest carried out to determine whether the concrete was in a fit condition to paint.\n\nThe water in the south room was wiped up and the floor cleared of stored material and rubbish. In thirty-six hours all traces of dampness had disappeared. The General Paint Corporation of Vancouver, who supplied the concrete paint which was to be used on the floors and made up according to the specification contained in Mr. Mills' letter of May 22, 1940, informed me that unless the floor was absolutely dry and could be assumed to remain that way, it was unsafe to apply the paint. They further suggested the use of a test for moisture, calcium chloride covered by an inverted watch glass which was to be sealed to the floor with putty.\n\nTwo tests were conducted in each room and it was found that in all cases the calcium chloride drew considerable moisture from the concrete slab in places where it appeared absolutely dry.\n\nIn addition, a test drill hole was made in the concrete where the water had been on the floor in the south room and showed that although the surface was dry, there was still moisture in the interior of the slab.\n\nRepairs carried out by the Contractor.\n\nThe contractor carefully puttied all visible holes and cracks in the siding giving particular attention to areas around the window frames, and the junction of sloping roofs and walls. The material used was a caulking compound supplied by...\nthe General Paint Corporation of Vancouver. Two coats of paint was applied to the work and a complete coat of paint was given to the south side of the south room.\n\nFurther Tests on the Repairs Made.\n\nWhen the paint had hardened, I tested all the exterior wall surfaces of the basement rooms and the entrance doors and furnace room roofs with a hose. No water was found to enter the building, although this was rather an extreme test.\n\nRecommendations.\n\nIn view of the conditions found I instructed the contractor not to paint the concrete basement floors and following the instructions of Mr. Mills' letter of August 6, 1940, the materials, three-one-gallon G. P. cement floor primer and three-one-gallon G. P. cement floor paint, dark grey, were left in the north basement room for the school authorities.\n\nThe floor is entirely serviceable as it is at present and in view of the evidence that the concrete slab is moist through capillary action, I would suggest that the floor should not be painted at any time. The contractor and the General Paint Corporation both inform me that a slab which appears dry but has water underneath it, will, when painted, draw moisture from below and will never be as satisfactory as a floor without paint.\nSince I was unable to detect any leaks subsequent to the repairs, and as I observed that the concrete floors are now serviceable, I recommend that the sum of $366.00 be now authorized for payment to the contractor. This was the agreed price of the gutters, downspouts, drains, and concrete wall pitching authorized in Mr. Mills' letter of August 29, 1939 and carried out in October of that year. This work was reported as satisfactorily done by Mr. McDonald in his memorandum to you dated January 8, 1940, with the exception of some exposed drain tile which I found to have been satisfactorily covered by the contractor earlier this year. As requested by Mr. Buck, the basement window sash had been eased and were again eased. This will doubtless have to be done again by the school authorities as it is not safe to ease the woodwork very much at a time otherwise leaks will develop.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. T. Ramsden.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 20, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nI desire to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your memorandum of September 16 in which you advise that the Bells Bella Indian Day School is now in satisfactory condition and that the balance owing to the contractor has been paid.\n\nDirector.\nSeptember 16, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe - Bella Bella Indian Day School,\nBella Coola Agency, B.C.\n\nYou will recall that after the above building was completed by contract, moisture seeped through the walls and through the floor and as a result some $335.00 was held back from the payments due the contractor until the apparent defects were remedied.\n\nA careful examination, including tests over several days, was made in August last by Mr. Ramsden of our engineering staff at Vancouver and I am attaching herewith a copy of his report.\n\nFrom this you will note that the walls of the building are now watertight and satisfactory. In regard to the basement floor, you will note that dampness is still being induced by capillary action and that until this condition has entirely disappeared, it would be unwise to apply paint.\n\nOn the instructions of our Chief Engineer, the contractor left in the north basement room for the School authorities the following paint which can be used when the concrete floor is sufficiently dry:\n\n3 One-gallon tins G.P. cement floor primer,\n3 One-gallon tins G.P. cement floor paint, dark grey.\nIt is considered that the contractor has now fulfilled the specifications, and final payment is being made to him.\n\nDirector.\n| Quantity | Unit | Description                  | List Price | Net Price | Discount | Extension | AMOUNT |\n|----------|------|------------------------------|------------|-----------|----------|-----------|--------|\n| 1/12     | DOZ. | 2814 STA-RITE FLOOR BRUSH    | 26.67      | DZ.       |          |           | 2.22   |\n| 1/12     | \"     | 704 X 8\" GARNISTER BRUSH     | 9.85       | DZ.       |          |           | .32    |\n|          |      | BOXES                        |            |           |          |           | .10    |\n|          |      | DELIVERY                     |            |           |          |           | .25    |\n|          |      | PREPAID FREIGHT              |            |           |          | NET       |        |\n\nNET: .70\n\n2% 20TH FOL.

Consequently I would request authorization for this expenditure.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nVancouver.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to the condition of the grounds surrounding the Bella Bella School for which I requested $200.00 last year.\n\nIt will require a considerable amount of work to put these grounds in decent shape but it would at least be a big improvement if duckboard is laid around the building and leading to the toilets. This is absolutely necessary and for this purpose about 160 feet of duckboard is required. I would recommend 4 by 6 inches for sills with 2 inch planking 3 feet wide requiring about 1000 feet of 2 inch planking and 700 feet of 4 by 6 inches. The planking should be furnished in 12 foot lengths or in a multiple of 3 feet.\n\nA drainage ditch is also required 90 feet long running to a slough at the rear of the school.\n\nThe cost of material and labour will approximate as follows:\n\n| Item                        | Cost   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| 1000 feet of 2\" x 12\" x 12' | $20.00 |\n| 700 feet of 4\" x 6\"         | 14.00  |\n| 30 lbs. of 4\" nails @ 7\u00a2     | 2.10   |\n| 10 lbs. of 5\" nails @ 7\u00a2     | .50    |\n| Labour                      | 30.00  |\n| Labour digging ditch        | 30.00  |\n\n$ 95.60\n\nI have delayed asking for this appropriation in the hope that the local Indian sawmill could supply the planking, and also in the hope that some prospective relief cases might be employed. Meantime it would be appreciated if authority to spend $100.00 on this project can be obtained from the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm.

In addition to this there is now a teacherage to light.\n\nWe are willing to supply necessary current, for lights only, at this rate as long as we can spare it. We have not sufficient capacity to supply any appliances and this agreement is made with the understanding that the teachers will keep their consumption as low as possible. I would be quite willing to have the village obtain some revenue by lighting the school with their plant, but as it is running in the evenings only, it would not be satisfactory.\"\n\nI consider that this is a reasonable request as there is much more electricity used at the new school and the village lighting plant is only used in the evening between certain hours.\n\nA voucher in triplicate is enclosed for payment of this account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Have since heard from Dr. Darby, that this work has been completed and the teachers were able to get water outside of the building but only occasionally out of the tap inside, as there does not seem to be enough pressure to bring the water to this higher level, except in the mornings when a lot of the village taps are closed.\n\nT.A.

Visited the hospital, and conferred with the medical Supt., Dr. Darby, on various matters pertaining to the Indian patients in the Hospital.\n\nFound the school without water, and made arrangements to have the pipe line checked for leaks, and left at 12:15 for Klemtu, arriving there in a heavy S.E. Gale. Visited School teacher, and the School, and I certainly was amazed at how he had been able to carry on with the stove in the condition it was. The whole top of the fire box was burnt and rusted away, and there were holes through it at all points, so it was a wonder that the school had not been burnt down.\n\nThe new stove, and coal had not arrived there at this time, but on my return from the North, I found a new stove and pipes installed, but still no coal, so the teacher had ordered some wood cut and delivered, but this was green and full of salt water, so it had to be cut into kindling wood before it would burn.\n\nT.A.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith application of Mr. Acting\nIndian Agent Levelton for renovation of the floors at the\nBella Bella Indian Day School, which he states are beginning\nto get worn in places.\n\nIt is noted that he recommends that this renova-\ntion be carried out by means of an application of boiled\nlinseed oil but, in my opinion, this materials is not satis-\nfactory where floors etc., have to carry the traffic\nincidental to school use and I would recommend that the\nsurfaces be given a two-coat application of Penetrem, manu-\nfactured by the Tremco Mfg. Co. and found very satisfactory\nfor this purpose. As this floor finish would cost $24.30\nfor five gallons, f.o.b. Vancouver, this amount being con-\nsidered sufficient, the total cost of the job with labour\nat $15.00 would amount to $39.30 instead of the $27.00\nestimated by Mr. Levelton, and, if funds can be provided,\nI would recommend approval of the application on that basis.\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nThe floors and stairs in the Bella Coola Indian Day School is becoming quite worn, and are in need of filling.\n\nApproximately Six (6) gallons of boiled linseed oil will be needed to cover, as the bare worn spots should have two coats applied.\n\nThis job should be done during the summer months, so that the oil would have sufficient time to dry properly before the class rooms are in use again.\n\nNo prices are quoted in catalogues, but would estimate that it would not run over $4.00 per gallon.\n\nThe cost of labour would be approx. $15.00\n\nTotal $29.00\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.J.

Murray, Principal, Campbell Island, B.C.\n\nThe Department has written to you regarding the safety of the school building in case of fire. It is recommended that the outer doors be kept closed (not locked) at all times except when the classroom door is open. In the event of a fire, the children should be instructed to use the stairs on the side away from the fire without delay.\n\nI have been informed that the school board has taken steps to ensure the safety of the children in case of fire. It is also stated that the school board has arranged for training the children for both classes in order to ensure their safety.\n\nOn my next visit to Bella Coola I will go into this matter further.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Anfield,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Anfield:\n\nWith further reference to the telephone installation at the school, I have received a quotation from Northern Electric as follows:\n\n1 - 1417 AH Telephone Set...........$30.19 less 20%\n2 - #6 Telephone Batteries ......... $3.08 each\n1400' - 18/2 Style HC Telephone Drop Wire ............... $15.80 M ft. less 10%\n20 - Glass Insulators .............. $1.55 doz.\n20 - Oak Brackets .................. $10.20 doz.\n\nThis with freight and incidentals would come to $75.00 for materials plus $12.00 for labor. If the Department does not have to pay Sales Tax a deduction of $7.41% is allowable.\n\nIf the Department prefers to purchase the materials direct, the above are the supplies needed.\n\nAs it will take 6 to 8 weeks to get delivery on this material, we may not be able to install it in time to be of much use this term, but will have it ready if authorized for next Fall.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"George E. Darby, M.D.\nMedical Superintendent.\"\nOttawa, June 13, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, in connection with the proposed installation of a telephone in the teacher's residence at the Bella Bella Indian Day School.\n\nIt is not our general practice to supply a telephone at a teacher's residence, but, in view of the unusual conditions mentioned in Indian Agent Anfield's letter, it has been decided to approve the installation of a telephone at the Bella Bella teacherage, at a cost of $87.00.\n\nIt is understood that this will be the only charge in the matter and that neither service nor further material charges will be submitted to the Department.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letters of May 7th and 27th in connection with the proposed installation of a telephone at the Bella Bella Indian Day School teacherage.\n\nAlthough I am of the opinion that there are many teachers in the province in more isolated places than Bella Bella, with even less protection available, in view of the Agent's comments with respect to the increasing use of liquor by the Indians of Bella Bella and the unfortunate position the Department would be in if the teachers were involved in any incident as a result of this now that the proposal has been suggested, I would recommend that if funds are available an expenditure of $87.00 be authorized to cover the cost of installation.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMajor D. M. Mackay, Indian Commissioner for B. C.,\nVancouver.\n\nRe yours of May 14th, file 2-11-4, dealing with a recommendation that the Department pay the cost of material and labour for the installation of a telephone from the Bella Bella Hospital to the teacherage at the Indian Day School, it is my definite understanding that this will be the sole charge in this matter and that neither service nor further material charges will be submitted to the Department.\n\nThe phone would be hooked up for immediate response at night by the nurse on duty at the hospital who could connect the call to Dr. Darby's bedside. Should the alarm be one of fire, the nurse would at once ring the fire alarm to the village. Should the alarm be an attempted breaking and entry to the teacherage both Dr. Darby and the Hospital Janitor and Engineer would be available to proceed to the teacherage in a matter of minutes.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nBella Coola, B.C.\nMay 7th, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nLast fall Miss Phillips, teacher at the Bella Bella Day School occupied the teacherage alone and the necessity of this with one or even two women is a worry in a village where drinking is on the increase as it is in Bella Bella.\n\nI have discussed the matter on several occasions with Dr. Darby and it is agreed that the solution lies in the installation of a phone to hook up with the system at the Hospital. Dr. Darby is now overhauling and replacing much of his phone system connecting the hospital with the Mission House, Nurses Home, etc. and I asked him to give me a bid on the required equipment and labour to link our teacherage with this system.

Should the alarm be one or fire, the nurse would at once ring the fire alarm to the village. Should the alarm be an attempted breaking and entry to the techerage both Dr. Darby and the Hospital janitor and engineer would be available to proceed to the techerage in a matter of minutes.\n\n(Sgd.)

This is very tentative since I do not recommend the absence of this tractor from the logging operations at Bella Coola during the period this fall when labor for the project will possibly be available here. However although I have not found a suitable power unit elsewhere, I am assuming for the purpose of these calculations that some unit might be located in an area as accessible as Bella Coola.\n\nRegarding the tug, it is proposed to try to secure one of the Bella Bella seiners which would necessitate their foregoing a month of seining in southern waters. The figure quoted would be merely cost of operation and I would not have quoted so low a figure had not one of the seine owners intimated that a boat might be provided locally at about that figure to help the project. A small commercial tug would cost at least twice the amount quoted and we would probably not get as good cooperation from the crew in catching tides, etc., which would probably increase the time required. The tug time is calculated on the basis of going out to pick up the power unit, returning with it and standing by during the whole moving operation, then returning the power unit and float.\n\nThe plan of the move briefly is to cut the building into three sections, cross the channel with one at a time and take each section up to the school site before returning for the next. This will be necessary if only one sleigh is used.\n\nI may say that the moving time is calculated on the basis of reasonably successful operation. Should a serious delay occur and the part from the beach to the school site presents several hazards which might cause trouble, then with the tug, tractor and crew standing by the daily time loss would be about $155.00 without possible cost of breakages and repairs.\n\nI am presenting this plan in a tentative form because I do not believe it is practical to spend the amount indicated on a building which when finished can have only a make-shift usefulness. In view of the likelihood that it would be nearing Christmas before it could be done even at such a cost I believe the possibilities of new and permanent construction should be reviewed before the use of a temporary building is further considered.\n\nMay I stress again the urgent need for this accommodation and point out the very serious loss in academic knowledge that the Bella Bella children are suffering, which may result in many people having to face problems of readjustment owing to a sense of frustration from having been deprived of normal education. The loss in life efficiency to the Bella Bella Band of Indians and to the Dominion of Canada should also be remembered.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6385, File 802-5, part 3)\nI therefore recommend that immediate steps be taken to provide two new and permanent classrooms at Bella Bella with quarters for two teachers.\n\nW.P.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOur Vancouver Office has forwarded us a letter written by Mr. James Coleman, Inspector of Indian Agencies, inquiring relative the availability of Building No. 5 at the Ex R.C.A.F. Seaplane Base at Belle Bells, B.C.\n\nAccording to our records, Building No. 5 was constructed as N.C.O. Quarters and reported to have cost the Crown $5,275.00.\n\nThis station was constructed upon lands owned by the Province and leased to the Crown, and a condition of the lease being that the structures erected by the Crown be removed when no longer required.\n\nI presume you want to use this building in place and, if so, request that you obtain the Province's permission to do so.\n\nOur Corporation is prepared to sell you the building upon a priority basis, figured at 8% of its reported cost, or $422.00.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nWAR ASSETS CORPORATION\n\n\"F.P. Gutelius\"\n\nF.P. Gutelius,\nfor Director,\nLands & Buildings Dept.\n\nFPG/he.\nMajor D. M. MacKey, Indian Commissioner for B. C., Vancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Bella Bella Indian Day School\n\nWhile at Bella Bella on February 25th and 26th with School Inspector R. F. Davey, we made a complete survey of the buildings at the Shearwater Air Base in order to ascertain if there was suitable structure for use as an extra school building at the Bella Bella Reserve.\n\nAfter inspecting several, we decided that building No. 5, formerly N.C.O. Quarters and listed on the building plan as No. A-S-23-2 would be almost ideal for use as school building. This building is 22' long and 23' wide, height from floor to plate 8' and floor to ceiling 10'6\". The exterior is shingled over shiplap; inside is lined with fir 3/ply over shiplap on walls; ceiling-beaverboard and insulated with rock wool. Floors are veneer 3/ply over shiplap and covered with battleship linoleum. I understand Inspector Davey has submitted tracings with his report. These show the partition of the building at present and the proposed changes which we consider would be advisable to make.\n\nThe necessary changes are as follows:\n\n1. Partition building in three main sections. A classroom at each end with teacherage in center of building.\n\n2. Classrooms: Length 28', width 23'. Windows to be placed on west side of the rooms, providing proper lighting and excellent blackboard space.\n\n3. Halls: Length 13', width 4' providing cloakroom space - with both walls available for hooks.\n\n4. Entrances: Glass doors - providing light to cloakrooms. It is suggested that an entrance from the teacherage be provided into each cloakroom.\n\n5. Teacherage: A living room, kitchen, two bedrooms and bathroom to be provided. Approximate size of rooms:\n\n   Living room 16' x 13'\n   Kitchen 12' x 13'\n   Bed rooms 12' x 10'\n   Bath room 7' x 10'\n\nThis teacherage should be equipped with adequate plumbing and properly furnished.\n\n6. Heating: The building is heated by an oil unit which goes with the building. In addition there is an oil-burning hot water unit complete with 40 gallon tank. It is thought that these units could be placed in the same room which is 10' x 5' and considered large enough to house both. There are oil tanks outside the building and I surmise these would be included in the purchase price.\n\n7. Site for building: It would appear that the best site for the proposed new school would be on the west side of the playground and north of the present building. This would give ample light from the west for the classrooms and the front of the teacherage would overlook the village and the waterfront.\n\n(over)\n8. Moving: No difficulty should be encountered in moving the building from the Air base. A problem confronted us as to how it could be brought ashore at Bella Bella village and taken to the proposed site. However, after considerable survey of the situation we found that the best route would be immediately south of the hospital - across the roadway and from there no difficulty should occur. I did not approach the Bella Bella head men on the matter, nor will I until such time as the approval of the Department is obtained.\n\nIt would appear that the work should be done by contract since it would not be advisable to attempt it with local labor. A contractor could best ascertain how it should be divided for moving.\n\n9. Costs: I am not in a position to place an exact value on the building, but realizing that most likely it would eventually be sold for salvage purposes, and in the meantime deteriorating in value, it would appear that the War Assets Corporation should be willing to place a reasonable price on the building especially to a branch of the Federal Government. I would suggest that the amount not exceeding $2,000.00 be offered; such price to include all heating units, oil tanks, fixtures and plumbing as the building now stands.\n\n10. General: Should this building be purchased and moved to Bella Bella, for school purposes, it is to be pointed out that it would take care of present needed school accommodation only and that in the very near future, consideration be given to the construction of a suitable permanent building to provide for at least five if not six class rooms. In the event of this being done, the building which it is now proposed to move from the Air Base could be adapted for living quarters for a staff of five or six teachers.\n\nA. Findlay,\nActing Indian Agent.\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Commissioner of Indian Affairs for B. C.,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nI have enclosed a sketch and description of building No. 5 at the Bella Bella Air Base and another showing one method altering the building for a combined two classroom and teacherage addition to the school at Bella Bella. The building is in very good condition and is well supplied with fixtures as listed on the drawing.\n\nThe building can be easily moved in sections to Campbell Island. There is a good road from the present site to a concrete slipway. The problem of getting the building from the water up to the school site is more difficult.\n\nThis addition should be placed on the west side of the playground and about 100 feet to the north of the present school. The classroom windows should face the west.\n\nThis work would have to be done by contract as there will not be a supply of local labour for the next seven months. This summer the hospital building at the airport is to be moved to Rivers Inlet and it is possible that the school work might be done more economically if the contract was let while equipment was in the area.\n\nThis proposal will take care of only the present needs of this village. In three or four years another\nclassroom will be required and if the present birth-\nrate is maintained the village will require a total\nof six room ten years from now. When materials are\navailable a four room addition or separate unit should\nbe built and the two classrooms provided by building\nNo. 8 could then be adapted for living quarters for\nthe teachers.\n\nI recommend that the building be purchased from\nWar Assets providing it can be obtained for a price\nnot in excess of $2000 for the building complete with\nplumbing, wiring, heating and other fixtures. I also\nrecommend that if it is possible to obtain building\nfor the above sum the contracts for moving and remodelling\nbe let in time to permit the use of the two rooms in\nSeptember of this year.\n\nMr. Findlay, Acting Indian Agent, is also reporting\non this matter.\n\nR. F. Davey,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools.\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Bella Bella Indian Day School\n\nI have your letter 2-114 of November 22nd for acknowledgement. Having returned from a patrol to Klemtu and Bella Bella, I have prepared reports on school accommodation and repairs at the above mentioned reserves.\n\nIn view of facts ascertained while at Bella Bella, I believe that a review of the entire situation should be made and herewith submit details accordingly.\n\nA Bella Bella Census of children 1 year to 16 years in 1946\n\n| Year of Birth | Girls | Boys | Total | 7 yrs. of age in |\n|---------------|-------|------|-------|------------------|\n| 1930          | 8     | 8    | 16    | 1937             |\n| 1931          | 3     | 8    | 11    | 1938             |\n| 1932          | 8     | 8    | 16    | 1939             |\n| 1933          | 5     | 11   | 16    | 1940             |\n| 1934          | 8     | 6    | 14    | 1941             |\n| 1935          | 6     | 11   | 17    | 1942             |\n| 1936          | 9     | 6    | 14    | 1943             |\n| 1937          | 15    | 6    | 21    | 1944             |\n| 1938          | 4     | 12   | 16    | 1945             |\n| 1939          | 7     | 9    | 16    | 1946 Not yet admitted |\n| 1940          | 5     | 4    | 9     | 1947             |\n| 1941          | 7     | 7    | 14    | 1948             |\n| 1942          | 12    | 10   | 22    | 1949             |\n| 1943          | 16    |      | 16    | 1950             |\n| 1944          | 14    | 9    | 23    | 1951             |\n| 1945          | 11    | 13   | 24    | 1952             |\n| 1946          | 11    | 15   | 26    | 1953             |\n\nB Disregarding possible decrease due to death or removal, the following shows number of school age children during the next seven years. 1953 figures include children born in 1946 (to date).\n\n| Year       | Girls | Boys | Total |\n|------------|-------|------|-------|\n| 1946       | 72    | 85   | 157   |\n| 1947       | 69    | 81   | 150   |\n| 1948       | 73    | 80   | 153   |\n| 1949       | 77    | 82   | 159   |\n| 1950       | 88    | 71   | 159   |\n| 1951       | 94    | 74   | 168   |\n| 1952       | 99    | 76   | 175   |\n| 1953       | 102   | 85   | 187   |\n\nAt present thirty-five Bella Bella children attend residential schools, six school age children are in hospital leaving one hundred sixteen who should be attending Bella Bella Indian Day School in the current school year.\n\n(over)\nC. Available accommodation in present school\n\nJunior room 30 Grade 1 only\nSenior room 37 Grades 2 to 7.\nTotal seating capacity 67\n\nNote: No space in either room available for additional desks.\n\nD. Children seven years of age in 1946 have not been admitted due to lack of accommodation and a number of fourteen to sixteen year olds cannot attend for the same reason.\n\nThe number, thirty-five, of Bella Bella children attending residential schools seems to be out of all proportion. If adequate school facilities were available at Bella Bella, the majority of these children could and should remain in the village and attend the Day School, thus giving opportunity for more deserving cases to attend the residential schools.\n\nThere should be a four-room school at Bella Bella, with seating space for approximately thirty-five children in each room. This would mean accommodation for 140 which even then would be seventeen below the actual number of school-age children in 1946.\n\nIt is my considered opinion that the school situation at Bella Bella is sufficiently serious to warrant complete reconsideration of any proposed use of a basement room. Use of such basement rooms would not allow for more accommodation than is necessary for fifteen to twenty pupils. The proximity of this room to the furnace room would not, in my opinion, be in accordance with safety regulations more conducive to healthy school-room conditions.\n\nI am strongly averse to the use of the basement as a classroom and do not consider the expense involved in the proposed conditioning of the basement as a worthwhile step towards remedying the lack of school facilities at Bella Bella. The use of the basement rooms as class-rooms will eliminate any indoor recreation space which in this climate is essential in the Day schools.\n\nI did not have an opportunity of inspecting the Town Hall, but will do so at the earliest possible time. However, from what I saw and know of this hall, I do not believe that the light is satisfactory and being immediately adjacent to the Bella Bella Town Hall which is used during the day on numerous occasions, would be subject to external disturbances.\n\nAs a result of reviewing the situation as it now stands and considering the serious problem which exists, I herewith submit my suggestions.\n\nE. Plan 1\n\nThat the blue prints of the Bella Bella Day School be submitted to a qualified architect in order to ascertain how two additional classrooms could be provided by a wing being built on the present building. In this respect provision must be made to provide living accommodation for two more teachers.\nMy own ideas in this respect are as follows: (See tracings)\n\nThe duplication of the main part of the present building in place of the teachers residence as now laid out would provide the two extra classrooms so badly needed and would permit of living accommodation necessary for four teachers. The entrances would remain the same and common cloakrooms provided for each of the two sets of rooms.\n\nThe furnace would be sufficient to heat all four rooms and the residence. In this proposed plan all the teachers accommodation would be on the main floor, consisting of living-room, kitchen and four bedrooms. Approximate size of each room would be - Living room 16 x 21; Kitchen 9\u00bd x 21; providing space for Dining Room; each of four bedrooms 12 x 10. Complete plumbing facilities should be installed.\n\nPlan II Only if basement rooms must be used.\n\nSince the use of either or both of the basement rooms as they are now will not provide the actual necessary accommodation it would be necessary for these two rooms to be enlarged as follows.\n\nSouth basement room: (As per attached sketch)\n\nThe end (south) wall be removed and the room extended twelve feet. A partition be built at the opposite end making corridor to be used as a cloakroom. The present room is 21' x 20' and with the change suggested will make a school room 21' x 29'. There is a nine foot ceiling clearance and excavation necessary to enlarge the room would be to the depth of approximately two feet. An exit should be provided at the south end providing ample safety. This expansion will not affect the lighting of the upper cloakroom and windows on the west side of the Eaves windows now in the south basement wall could be used in the west wall providing sufficient day light. Double flooring should be laid on 2\" x 6\" timbers to raise it off the present concrete floor and the walls suitably lined.\n\nNorth Basement Room\n\nExtended in similar manner. This plan would not allow for any additional living accommodation for two more teachers. This problem must be considered when any change is made.\n\nHeating F.\n\nThe present furnace would not adequately heat the basement rooms unless this system was re-arranged. The only other alternative would be the installation of oil heaters in each room.\n\nG. I fully realize that either of the above plans would involve considerable expense but if proper school facilities are to be provided at Bella Bella, plans must be considered now for some permanent construction. Any temporary arrangement will by no means solve the problem. I most definitely favor Plan #2. In view of the evident increase in pupils in Bella Bella, I urgently recommend that the question of school accommodation be completely re-considered with the view to providing the necessary space at as early a date as possible.\n\nJ.

Due in part to difficulty in securing material and labour and also by reason of the transfer of Mr. Indian Agent Anfield to Prince Rupert, the proposal was not proceeded with prior to the end of the fiscal year. In February last School Inspector Davey visited Bella Bella and during the course of his visit inspected some of the buildings at the Bella Bella Air Base with a view to ascertaining whether there would be one suitable for school purposes at the Bella Bella village. Inspector Davey found that two of the buildings at the Air Base would be suitable as to size and construction for two additional classrooms and living quarters for two teachers, but we have since found it almost impossible to secure any information with respect to the cost of moving these buildings to Bella Bella and preparing them for school and teachers' use.

Major MacKay in concurring in this recommendation has requested that your Branch investigate and report on the possibility of moving this building.\n\nAs you are aware, your local Officials in Vancouver have been successful in making arrangements for the removal and re-construction of buildings at the Fort Hardy Military Camp at a reasonable cost. As these two sites are within one hundred miles of each other on the British Columbia coast it is felt that similar arrangements could easily be made to move this building.\n\nWe, therefore, request that your local Officials be advised to proceed as requested above.\n\nEnclosure:\nBFN/HH.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, August 2, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT,\n\nBella Bella Indian Day School.\n\nIt has been decided to purchase the building at the Denny Island R.C.A.F. Seaplane Base and move it across the canal to Bella Bella for use as additional classrooms and teacherages.\n\nPlease find attached a letter concerning the above from the War Assets Corporation in Vancouver. Would you please issue the necessary Purchase Order.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEncl:\n\nBFN/HM.\nOttawa, August 2, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. Mackay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, British Columbia.\n\nBella Bella Indian Day School.\n\nReference your 2-11-3 of July 2nd.\n\nUpon receipt of your letter we immediately contacted War Assets Corporation concerning the building required for additional classroom facilities at the above school.\n\nWe have now received the attached letter from the War Assets Corporation in Vancouver concerning this building. We have written our Departmental Purchasing Agent requesting that he issue the necessary Purchase Order at once.\n\nWe have also written to the Surveys and Engineering Branch requesting that they proceed with the moving of this building in the same way that they are moving the buildings at the Port Hardy Military Camp. Would you please advise your local Survey and Engineering representative of this request. It would be appreciated if you would advise us as to the amount of money which will be required for this purpose so that we may make plans accordingly.\n\nBernard F.

Subsequent visits were made on August 26 and 31.\n\nMr. Coleman's letter of August 9, 1947 gives the size of the building as 92' x 32' by 10'6\" ceiling; the building shown to me by Mr. Pruden is 90' x 24' by 11 ft. ceiling. It is shown as Building 5 on Ground Service Plan, Bella Bella - Dwg. W.6026-2, WAC Dwg. No. SS 26-3-36. Department of National Defence Air; Western Air Command; Construction Engineering.\n\nA description of the building is as follows:\n\n(See also Sketch 'A').\n\nFloor 90 ft. by 24 ft. wide.\n\nThe floor joists rest on three sills running full length of the building. The sills are on concrete posts. The joists are 2\" x 8\" No. 1 Common Fir in first-class sound condition. They are spaced at 16\" centres.\n\nOn the joists are laid 1\" x 8\" No. 1 Fir shiplap at right angles to the joists. The material is sound and first-class condition. It is assumed there is a layer of tar paper between this shiplap and the 3-ply Fir floor of unknown thickness. The 3-ply is covered with linoleum, some of which is 'Battleship type' and some of poorer quality. The poorer quality is of little value.\nWalls The outside walls are as follows, describing from the outside to the inside:\n\n1st 3X No. 1 shingles coloured dirty green.\n2nd A layer of tar paper.\n3rd 1\" x 8\" No. 1 Common shiplap Fir, layed horizontally.\n4th 2\" x 4\" Studs of No. 1 Common Fir.\n5th 3/8\" Gyproc nailed to studding.\n6th 1/4\" Fir 3-ply nailed over the gyproc.\n\nThe plywood for the most part is stained a light brown.\n\nRoof The roof is 2\" x 6\" No. 1 Fir rafters with tie brace of 2\" x 6\" and braced with 2\" x 4\" No. 1 Fir. The rafters are spaced at 24-inch centres.\n\nSee also section 'X-X' Sketch 'A'.\n\nOver the rafters is 1\" x 8\" shiplap No. 1 Fir layed tight, i.e.\n\nIt is assumed there is a layer of tar paper between shiplap and the 3X No. 1 Cedar shingle roof. The shiplap and rafters are in excellent sound condition.\n\nCeiling The ceiling is of a composition board 1/2\" or 5/8\" thick. It is apparently a laminated material and appears to be denser and stronger than Donnaconda or Ten Test. I do not know the trade name or type of this material. The ceiling is insulated with a layer of rock wool or similar non-vegetable material.\n\nFixtures Plumbing fixtures include:\n\n2 Wash basins of good make, one slightly chipped, on edge.\n2 'Standard' water closets.\n1 Urinal\n2 Sinks without back\nFixtures (Cont'd.)\n\n1 'Duo-Therm' Model 240, Type M-AW21, Max. flow\n13 gallons. Serial No. S19469 water heater\nwith a 75-gallon storage tank. The unit has\nan oil burner of the pot type.\n\nSome 4\" C.I. drainage (sewage) pipe (soil pipe)\n1/2\" and 3/4\" galvanized iron pipe.\n\nHeating Equipment\n\n1 Hot air furnace with circulating fan.\nAutomatic oil fired with Thermostat control.\nFurnace by Holmes Heating Service and is No.\n77 CJW. (The figure 7 may be a 3 or 7).\n\nLighting Fixtures Consist of 7 centre lights, 5 of\nwhich have bowl shades and lights in each room. There\nare at least 10 double outlet base-board plugs and\nseveral wall standard toggle switches and covered copper\nwire.\n\nThere is a fireplace and brick chimney at\none end of the building. A single-flue brick chimney\nfor the water heater, and a single-flue metal pipe of\nthe Yukon type for the furnace.\n\nMoving the Building\n\nIt is not recommended that the building be\nmoved whole or in large sections. The difficulties and\ncosts, plus the many possible contingencies are too great\nto warrant an attempt.\n\nThe building is now situated at an estimated\nelevation of about 140 feet and some 500 feet from the\nsea, or by paved road about 900 feet from a seaplane slip\ninto the sea. Thus the route to a scow on the slip would\nnot be too difficult if power, tackle and experienced movers\nwere available. It is necessary to tow on suitable scow\nthree miles to Bella Bella Indian Village.\nFrom the shore at the Indian Village the real difficulties are encountered. It would be necessary to drag up-hill some 60 feet elevation at a distance of 1100 to 1200 feet over steep ground, muskeg, and rock outcrops. It would also involve shifting two electric light poles, 30 feet of wooden roadway, and cutting much brush.\n\nIt would appear that the best method to follow in transferring this building would be to disassemble to individual pieces of raw material, truck all material to the wharf or to the seaplane slip at the air base, then load on suitable scow and transfer to Bella Bella Indian Village Wharf. It will be necessary then to truck material to school site about 1100 feet.\n\nThe amount of care exercised in dismantling the building would determine amount of raw material obtainable. When a building is dismantled to raw material it is suggested that in re-building to a new school a standard school plan should be considered, thereby obtaining a building to the best advantage for the purpose.\n\nAs the time before mail collection is limited, further information on this project will follow in the next mail.\n\nThere is one factor, however, in building a school at this village which would be encountered in using either new or used material, and that is a new plank road about 350 feet would be required to transport goods, as present roadway from main road to school grounds is rotted beyond repair and could only carry a gross load of about 600 pounds.\n\nA.
