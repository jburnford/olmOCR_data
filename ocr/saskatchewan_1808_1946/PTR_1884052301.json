Macdonald is beyond all question a very clever and astute politician, with the rare genius of statesman that makes any other man by the exception of Count von Bismarck, Chancellor of the German Empire. Fortunately for him however, he possesses certain definite constitutional rights not enjoyed by the Germans, who however evince a determination to have them at no distant date, prevent our being at the mercy of our own government without the aid of the Canadian Parliament. We may soon be deprived of the Dominion together on the present basis of the British North American Act, which has been so long in the making, and which, we believe, will be abandoned in its entirety and important changes have taken place, notably the growth of new and powerful provinces, with their own rights and privileges, and the time is not far off when the question of the future of the Dominion will be decided.\n\nOUR EMIGRANTS\n\nLand monopoly and a surplus population are two vexed questions in the old country, the former having been brought to a head in recent years by the discovery of gold in California. Mr. George, or as they call him \"the San Francisco Prophet,\" can be wondered that so much land is left unsold in the hands of speculators, who run away from the fact that there is a vast amount of land lying idle, and that the people who have been given the land that they have supplied armed men in time of war, which condition has been quickly satisfied on the suffering taxpayer, the remaining surplus going to the benefit of those who have fallen into the hands of capitalists, where it lies unbroken, until, to enable these few monopolists to secure profits, the land must be sold at a high price. In Scotland, there is a great deal of land lying idle, and the question is, how shall the interests of the North West Territories be looked after? With regard to our settlers, each province has a means of making itself heard through its Local Legislature and its representatives in the Dominion Parliament, but the rapid increase of the population, due to the influx of our own territory, entitles us to the management of our territorial interests and a strong voice in the affairs of the Dominion is a matter of vital importance. It must be remembered that the rapidly increasing number of electoral divisions will bring about shortly the natural death of the weak, and the North West Canada, whose partial powers are controlled by Government officials, and the birth of a Legislative Assembly, which would at least express the voice of the people, but it is more likely feared that the situation as it is, is doomed for long enough to disappoiment. It seems only too probable that just as the electoral districts over the whole of the Territory have been drawn up, so, too, will they fail to become a Legislative House, the territories will be subdivided into provinces, each of which will have to work its way up again.\n\nPUBLIC NOTICE\n\nAll persons are hereby required to take notice that the execution of the Indian lands without authority from the Minister of Agriculture, Agent of Dominion Lands or the District Agent in public or private sale, or any person acting under authority liable to be prosecuted by the Minister of the Interior.
