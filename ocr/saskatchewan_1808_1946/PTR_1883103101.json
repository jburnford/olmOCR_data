This last thought seems ever him as he looks down upon Ethlyn across the river's rock, and as it awakes mournfully around the products of his soul his heart swells with a strange, yet piteous love. He was a merry, light-hearted boy with a sore toe. But suddenly the touch of a damsel's cheek against his own brings back the memory of those bright, sparkling eyes\u2014eyes that will soon be picking out buttons at his expense\u2014are looking at him now. The thought that Ethlyn has seen a tinge of melancholy, a lambent gleam of sorrow\u2014no cares\u2014for-three-days that goes to his very heart.\n\n\"You are sad, my darling,\" he said, pressing her closely to the midship rib of his steed's saddle. \"Why do you look so wistful?\"\n\n\"Because,\" she replies, \"you have not answered my question. I asked you if you had seen Ethlyn.\"\n\n\"Yes, he says. \"I do. I am deeply enamored of pie in every shape.\"\n\nHardly had the words left his lips when Ethlyn's hand fell from his arm, and presently her little form was shaken by a storm of sobs. George is horror-stricken. He has never seen such a sight since the Pinball game in the school yard.\n\n\"Why do you weep, my precious one?\" he asks, bending tenderly over her.\n\n\"I am afraid,\" she replies, raising a shower of kisses on the upturned face, \"you are more prone to me than ever.\"\n\nPROSPECTUS OF THE Prince Albert Directory\n\nBUSINESS GUIDE\n\nIt is proposed to publish a Business Directory for the town of Prince Albert and District of Louis in a pamphlet form which will contain the advertisements of each business establishment in the town, with full descriptive matter and a descriptive notice of each.\n\nThe purpose will be to contain all the information necessary for the present condition and future prospects, together with a statement of what can be expected for the future.\n\nLouis, existing as an isolated number of habitable farms, acreage increasing year by year, crop population of farmers, and other important information, written by a well-known journalist.\n\nAbout 500 or more copies will be published, and the proceeds thereof will be received, which will be distributed throughout the Dominion and the Mother Country.\n\nIt is hoped that by these means, benefits will result, not only to each individual, but to the entire community, and the whole country will benefit by the same and appreciated both at home and abroad and a healthy encouragement encouraged to the same.\n\nPrice of advertisement, whole page, with notice on opposite page, $10; two pages given free.

Sometimes the judges are slow, sometimes the system is sluggish. However, in this case, the delays have been extreme. The law has always been slow to everything, and as time goes by, the pace seems to slow even further. In this particular case, the delays appear to be rather long, they may be left to take care of themselves.\n\nThe delays which have occurred in this case are due to the fact that the case was heard before the Hon. Mr. Justice of the Saskatchewan District Court. The case, which has become so complex and protracted, has been heard in court several times, but each time the proceedings have been delayed. The case involves some public matters, and the judge has been unable to make any progress. The case is now in the hands of the judge, who has been unable to make any progress.
