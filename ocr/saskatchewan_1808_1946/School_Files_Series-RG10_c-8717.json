Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEFN/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch Dept of Mines & Resources Ottawa.\n\nAttention Mr Neary,\n\nI have received a letter from The Regional Supervisor re the approximate amount of water received from each source at the Sacred Heart School, as per letter of Sept 11th 1948.\n\nI apparently did not receive this letter, however I have contacted the new Principal, and also from my own knowledge would state that previous to the Spring rains that 75% was hauled from the C,P,R water tank, and the balance from the Spring.\n\nAfter the heavy rainfall till the end of June, the approximate percentage was almost the same the other way with the late principal filling the Reservoir, from the Tank and the Spring keeping it up with the odd hauling.\n\nIt would seem that this hauling from the water tank will have to be started regularly as soon as the spring and well weaken, and the question that arises from this would be should I be vouchering monthly for the assistance for hauling water, when there is a very small amount hauled. I am holding the November bill until I hear from you.\n\nSuperintendent.\n\nCopy to Mr Gooderham.\nDecember 22, 1948.\n\nMr. Anthony McMillan,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nBrocket, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to payments for hauling water to the Sacred Heart School, if the only duty required of the member of the staff is hauling water, it is felt that the payment should be made monthly, even though the amount of water hauled some months is less than others. On the other hand, if the hauling of water is done in the spare time of some member of the staff who has other duties, it is felt that you could make arrangements with the principal that would be satisfactory to all parties concerned.\n\nPossibly during those months that it is only necessary to haul a small amount of water it would be advisable to forward the usual voucher every second month instead of every month.\n\nPlease discuss the matter with the principal and let us hear from you again.\n\nBernard F.

Mr. LaPrie wanted to be paid immediately, having the extinguishers with him.\n\nI told him that I should see the Agent first and then he probably could ship them from Regina, but he advised me that when they ship those extinguishers, there are always some broken on the way; so I took his advice and gave him a cheque.\n\nWould it be possible to be refunded; hope this explanation will be satisfactory;\nThe order form is # 95.\n\nI remain,\nYours truly,\nFather E.

Phelan.\nRe: Snowplow for Sacred Heart Residential School\nBrocket, Alta.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI am in receipt of a very pressing letter from the principal of the above school, Reverend Father Forestier, O.M.I., in which he requests the purchase of a Massey Harris snowplow no 44, to keep the road from the school to the village clear of snow during the Winter months.\n\nThis school as you know is five miles from the village and away from all stores and conveniences. It is also impossible during the Winter when the roads are clogged up with snow to take a sick child to an hospital or even to the Doctor's office. The isolation is almost as complete during the Winter period as it is in regions much farther north.\n\nIt is true that the school has been doing without this snowplow since it was built, but we did live years ago without telephone, telegraph, automobiles or trucks and still no one complains when money is now expended to procure such facilities and conveniences.\n\nTherefore could you not come to the rescue of this poor Principal and afford him the means to properly look after his school, particularly in time of sickness.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

School in Brocket, that while visiting the school last fall, you had promised to put \"brick siding\" on the school this spring.\n\nI have replaced Father M. Lafrance as principal at the school, he has been transferred principal to Cardston.\n\nI was told by Father Lafrance that you wanted an estimate on that; I have seen Mr. Murphy from Pincher Creek who kindly made the estimate I am sending you with this letter.\n\nI am sure that the Indians and myself will appreciate very much if this could be done, because the building is not very warm and that \"brick Siding\" would make an awful difference, and also it would repair very much the look of the building.\n\nI have the intentions to paint the other outside buildings this spring.\n\nHoping to hear from you soon,\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\n3rd February, 1949.\n\nRev.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n3rd February, 1949.\n\nMr. A. McMillan,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nBrocket, Alberta.\n\nReverend E.

Father Forestier has also enclosed the attached quotation which he received from Foothills Builders Supplies. It is our intention to arrange for the brick siding after 1st April, 1949, when funds will be available in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1949 - 50.\n\nAbout the end of March you should forward a requisition for all the materials that will be required, and we will have our Departmental Purchasing Agent order them.

Not only is this building a fire hazard but it is in one of the windiest places in Canada. On the day on which I inspected it, it was almost impossible to open the door leading to the fire escape, due to the wind then blowing.

In fifteen minutes I received a call that it was under control, and advised them to call me if it got worse, it started up again in the wall about 2 A.M. but was handled immediately, and instructed the principal to put extra guards on. I phoned Sunday and found everything o.K., so asked Father Perrestier to have the Jeep available Monday at 9 O'clock, I went out to the school, and looked over the situation, but was unable to find anything as to where it would start, I returned to the Agency and called you, and after received your instructions, phoned the Stockton & Day Electric at Macleod, and arranged for an inspection on Tuesday morning, he arrived and went out in the Jeep, and spent all morning there and checked all the wiring close to the fire and found everything all right.\n\nHe however found a nest which he thought might be a mouse and a large number of matches, and a piece of string, and a trinket, which he brought to the Office and left with me, I showed to one or two parties who I thought might know and I got the impression from these men that it might have been a pack rat. I am sending in another envelope enclosed with this letter the articles which were taken out of the place where the fire occurred.\n\nMr Stockton is giving me his report on Thursday when I will forward it to you with further comments, the children are out, returning on the 6th March, and I am leaving the opening cut during the fire open so that it may dry up before repairing it.\n\nI would like to receive authority from Ottawa to return the children to school on the 6th, if no further fire happens, and also would recommend that in the schools the Night Watchman who is on till April be authorized to stay till the end of the school term.\n\nI would also like to commend Charles Provost Sr for the way he handled his job in locating the fire and awakening the school.\n\nAnthony T.

Indian School at Crockett after having a fire in the immediate area of the fire damage, I found nothing in the wiring system that would suggest it had any thing to do with starting the fire. This of rigid conduit type of wiring with ample fusing located in a metal panel correct size of fuses in good order. This panel is fed from the basement main control board and also fused. Fuses were in good order. The conduit system is sound and the metal ceiling in the corridor is in contact with the water system and also the heating system. Pipes all returning to trunk no indication of heating could be seen at any point on the metal ceiling. I am of the opinion that the fire did not start from the electrical wiring system.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nH.G. Stockton\nB. F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Fire - Sacred Heart Residential School, Pelican Agency.\n\nFurther to our letter of February 24th, attached please find report received from Stockton and Day Electric, which indicates that the small fire at the above school was not caused by a short circuit in the wiring. We also received a small parcel containing a couple of dozen burnt sulphur matches, old style. It is possible that these matches were accumulated by mice some years ago and that they were eventually ignited starting a mouse nest on fire. These matches were found between the floor boards in the area where the smoke was noticed.\n\nG. H.

Gooderham, Esq., Regional Supervisor Indian Agencies, Calgary.\n\nRe: Fire - Sacred Heart School\n\nOn the evening of Saturday 19th February, I was contacted by Telephone to advise me that there was a fire in the corridor between the second and third floor. I immediately approached the head of the Armories re an Army truck, and also the Pincher Creek Fire Brigade, who promised to be ready immediately. I received any worse news. In fifteen minutes I received a call that it was under control, and advised them to call me if it got worse. It started again in the well about 2 a.m., but was handled immediately, and instructed the principal to put extra guards on. I phoned Sunday and found everything o.k., so asked Father Forrestier to have the Jeep available Monday at 9 o'clock. I went out to the school, and looked over the situation, but was unable to find anything as to where it would start. I returned to the Agency and called you, and after received your instructions, phoned the Stockton & Day Electric at Macleod, and arranged for an inspection on Tuesday morning. He arrived and went out in the Jeep, and spent all morning there and checked all the wiring close to the fire and found everything all right.\n\nHe however found a nest which he thought might be a mouse and a large number of matches, and a piece of string, and a trinket which he brought to the office and left with me. I showed to one or two parties who I thought might know and I got the impression from these men that it might have been a pack rat. I am sending in another envelope enclosed with this letter the articles which were taken out of the place where the fire occurred.\n\nMr. Stockton is giving me his report on Thursday when I will forward it to you with further comments. The children are out, returning on the 6th March, and I am leaving the opening cut during the fire open so that it may dry up before repairing it.\n\nI would like to receive authority from Ottawa to return the children to school on the 6th, if no further fire happens, and also would recommend that in the schools the Night Watchman who is on till April be authorized to stay till the end of the school term.\nI would also like to commend Charles Provost Sr. for the way he handled this job in locating the fire and awakening the school.\n\n(sgd) Anthony McMillan\nSuperintendent.\n4th March, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMAJOR D.M.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs Branch Dept of Mines & Resources Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report from Father Forrestier of the Sacred Heart School on the fire which occurred in the School on this Reserve.\n\nIn reading the report you will note his remarks re Fire Extinguishers, I have had the two empty ones refilled locally, but there are two with the inside bottles broken, and it would be necessary to have these repaired or replaced and refilled, they are the Foamite Type of Fire Extinguisher.\n\nI have a local contractor repairing the flooring cut out when getting at the source of the fire.\n\nThere is one point which may run into a little expense, and that is a point I have taken up with the school without success, that is the Fire Alarm. This Alarm when connected up rings when the wind blows heavily, and most of the time keeps ringing, I think it would be very advisable to have this checked over by the same Electrician as checked the fire and get the Alarm in working order. I would be glad of your authority to go ahead, and have this done.\n\nI have your authority re the Night Watchmen staying until the end of the term, although it must not be considered as a precedent.\n\nCopy to Regional Supervisor.\n\nSuperintendent.\nSacred Heart Ind. Res. School,\nBrocket, Alberta,\nMarch 1, 1949.\n\nMr. A. MacMillan, Ind. Agent,\nBrocket, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSaturday night, Feb. 19 at 11:00 A.M. a fire broke out at\nthe Sacred Heart School; lucky the night watchman was on the\nalert; he was going for his round at that time and he smelt\nsmoke on the first floor between the chapel and the Principal's\nroom; he continued making his round and came back and still\nsmelt smoke; he took his flash light and saw smoke coming\nthrough the ceiling, between the sewer pipe and the tin.\n\nCharlie Provost who was night watchman woke Brother Albert\nup and Tharcis Forestier, employed at the school, heard Charlie\nProvost talking, he got up and told Charlie to wake the\nchildren up, which he did immediately. The children woke up\nand came out without any panic.\n\nTharcis Forestier, Brother Albert and George Schultz the\nfarmer went to work with the axes and the fire extinguishers;\nthey worked for three hours steady and came to control the\nfire; they went downstairs for a lunch and at 3:00 A.M. the\nfire started once more, they went to work again for three\nhours steady and got the fire under control with the auto-\nmatic fire extinguishers which I have bought in November,\nand which saved the building; I had asked the Dept. to\nsupply these fire extinguishers and they turned me down.\n\nThe roads being impassable, nobody could come to our help\nand that night it was 10\u00b0 below zero weather, we had to send\nthe children in the barn while they were fighting the fire.\nMr. A. MacMillan came Monday morning to examine the situation, and decided to send the children home for ten days, which I think was wise, and he also wired Mr. Gooderham in Calgary to send an expert electrician to examine the situation. This expert as well as Mr. MacMillan told me that it was not caused by electricity, that everything was in perfect condition; all during the fire the lights stayed on, if there would have been a short circuit some lights would have been out.\n\nMr. Stooton, the electrician, examined over and over again and where the fire started he found a mice nest and also fifteen matches, so came to the conclusion that the fire might have been started in that way in the mice nest, he could not find any other cause how it could possibly start.\n\nWe have to give credit to our good night watchman Mr. Charlie Provost who located the fire first and also the other three men employed for the school, who worked like fifteen men to get the fire under control; I was surely glad to have bought those automatic fire extinguishers which saved the building.\n\nWould it be possible to have a night watchman year round because that fire goes to prove that the fire could also start in the summer time as well; the cause of fire is not always started by fire, but from unknown causes. I think it is very important to have a night watchman all the time especially in a building which is not fireproof. I would appreciate that very much, especially for saving lives of so many people.\n\nIf the night watchman would have come there ten minutes later, it would have been too late to stop the fire and probably the lives of 85 people; I think it is a very serious matter.\n\nWould it be possible for the Dept. to renew my automatic fire extinguishers without any delay; really I feel bad now that the Dept. have turned me down; and when I think that is the only thing that saved us, I would appreciate very much if my demand was granted as soon as possible, especially for the safeguard of the Indian Children and the Staff and for the parents of the children who are scared to send their children back to school unless we get a night watchman year round, and also the automatic fire extinguishers.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nAIR MAIL\n\n23rd March, 1949.\n\nMr. A. McMillan,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nBrocket, Alberta.\n\nWe have your letter of the 15th instant with further reference to the fire which occurred at the Sacred Heart Residential School.\n\nYou may arrange to have the fire alarm system checked and repaired. It is understood of course that the cost must be kept as low as possible.\n\nWe are prepared to order two more fire extinguishers provided you let us know the size of extinguisher required.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F.

Artlett, Chemist\nMarch 31, 1949.\n\nMemorandum re Water Supply, Sacred Heart Indian Residential School\nBrocket, Alberta\n\nExamined March 21, 1949\n\nThis residential school for Indian children mainly from the Pigeon Indian Reservation in Southern Alberta, is located five miles east of the railroad hamlet of Brocket, Alberta. At present there is a staff of fifteen and an enrollment of sixty-eight students. It is operated by the Roman Catholic Church, with assistance from the Dominion Government.\n\nWater is supplied from a spring 200 yards east of the barn and 250 yards from the school. A manhole covered the spring at the time of the examination but it is said to be a concrete reservoir 6 x 6 x 9 feet high with a 2-foot square manhole extending 5 feet upward and rising 9 inches above the ground. Two underground wings on either side of the reservoir deflect the water into the reservoir. The manhole has a tin cover which is always kept in place. The water is pumped from the reservoir by a 500 gallon-per-minute Red Jacket pump to two pressure tanks each of 1200 gallons.\n\nThe samples of water taken for bacteriological analysis showed the presence of B. coli as indicated by the attached form. The spring is located in a field near the barn and cattle and horses have free access to the immediate area. Fecal matter of these animals could find its way through the soil into the spring, thus causing the B. coli in the samples taken for analysis, although this seems quite unlikely in the winter when the ground is frozen and the immediate area of the spring is covered with snow. However, no other source appears to be the cause.\n\nThe attached chemical analysis indicates the water to be of good chemical quality although it is quite hard. The nitrate nitrogen content (0.41%) indicates the presence of stabilized organic matter, possibly derived from sewage.\n\nConclusions and Recommendations\n\nThe water at this Indian residential school is of good chemical quality but of poor bacteriological quality. It is recommended that the area in the vicinity of the spring be fenced off and no cattle or horses allowed inside. This fence should be built not less than 100 yards east of the spring and 200 yards to the south. If the bacteriological quality of the water does not improve then another source should be found, either a spring or a well. Since there is sometimes a shortage of water during certain periods of the year it might be well to investigate the possibilities of a well so that an adequate supply may be obtained the year round.\n\nStanley S.

The main buildings at both schools are the same size, namely length 99', width 35' and height 40'.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education visited this Agency last summer accompanied by Regional Supervisor Gooderham. The district in which these schools are located is subject to very high winds and as a result it has been necessary to have the exteriors painted every 2 or 3 years. At the time of the visit of the two officials just mentioned, it was decided that it would be advisable to cover both buildings with insul brick. Provision was made for this expenditure in the current fiscal year's appropriation, and the insul brick is being purchased by the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nIndian Superintendent McMillan has obtained the following quotations:\n\nW.H. Laidlaw, Pincher Creek, Alberta.\n(Scaffolding to be supplied by the Department)\nFor each building........................................$1,680.00\nGunnar Nelson, Fincher Creek, Alberta.\n(will supply his own scaffolding.)\nFor each building..........................$1,500.00.\n\nThree other firms were requested to quote,\nbut did not give a firm tender on the labour.\n\nIn view of the size of these buildings,\nconsiderable scaffolding will be necessary and\nIndian Superintendent McMillan recommends that we\naccept the tender of Gunnar Nelson, as he will\nsupply his own scaffolding.\n\nWe would like to have this work carried\nout before September 1st, and it would be\nappreciated if the Minister would approve acceptance\nof the tender of Gunnar Nelson for labour at a\ntotal cost of $3,600.00, namely $1,500.00 for each\nbuilding.\n\nActing Director.\nAugust 5, 1949.\n\nMr. A.

The Principal claims that with the equipment which he wishes to buy, it would be easy for him to keep the road open and thus give greater satisfaction to the parents of the children.\n\nMacLeod's who manufactures this snow plow must know the kind of tractor onto which it will be mounted, so you might mention when giving the order that the school tractor is a Massey Harris 44, model 1949.\n\nIf therefore you could supply this plow, the Principal would appreciate it very much.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O.

This he did and during the last five weeks, he has done approximately one third of the School, however he has been badly handicapped with high winds, and severe cold weather and as the crew he puts on this job has only to be carried for the job on hand, it was a case of hiring a new crew every time he got a break in the weather, and during the last two weeks has been unable owing to the frosty weather to get at the work.\n\nHe advises that unless we get a warm calm spell he will not be able to do anything till the weather breaks, as the Insul brick in cold weather breaks, and also the hammer will punch ahole in the insul brick when stiff.\n\nI will try and have this done whenever possible but with all contractors loaded with work it is a hard job to get them away from inside jobs.\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent.\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION          | PRICE | GROSS AMT.

Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith an application for the admission of Mary Catherine McGarty.\n\nThis little girl does not belong to the Peigan Reserve; Her father (Stephen McGarty) is a Treaty Indian, a Cree, belonging to the Onion Lake Band, an ex-pupil of Dunbow St Joseph Industrial School, and now a prisoner in Prince Albert!\n\nHer mother (Christine Greenwood) is a non-treaty Cree half-breed, and an ex-pupil of Crowfoot School, Cluny.\n\nStephen and Christine, although lawfully married in the church, went apart three years ago, and have never met since then; Stephen is in Prince-Albert Penitentiary, as I have just said, and Christine has been going from one town to another with her child, and you know what that means. She is now in Pincher-Creek, and the ex-mayor of that town (Mr Bossenberry, now a member of the Parliament of Alberta) has besought me to take her child in our school. So, Christine brought her in yesterday, and she is willing to leave her here, and later on, on the reserve.\n\nThis little girl, therefore, belongs to the class of orphan girls which you have kindly authorized me to accept: she is a real orphan indeed and worse off than many other orphans. She seems smart and perfectly healthy, and consequently I hope that you will kindly admit her.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith application handed in to this office by Father Levern of Mary Catherine McCarty, a Cree half-breed, for admission to The Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, also a letter from Father Levern in regard to this child.\n\nI wish to say that I find this child has been in the school for some weeks but that I had no knowledge of the matter until Father Levern brought in the application forms and the child today.\n\nI think the Principal should have requested the Department through me, authority to bring the child on the reserve and if I am correct would request that you so inform the Principal.\n\nIn regard to the mother of the child I have no information and am signing the application forms as the child appears to be healthy and intelligent.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.C.

You should ascertain by whom and for what reason they were placed in the home for delinquent children at Edmonton.

Father Sullivan, parish priest of Empress, Alta, has been asking me to take into our school Julia Allard, a Cree half-breed girl, aged sixteen years. Her mother, Mary Adams, is dead; her father, Louis Allard, is still living, but is not looking after her, and the girl goes from one place to another and is consequently exposed to all kinds of dangers. Both her parents and herself are Catholics.\n\nI have made some objections to the admission of that girl, especially on account of her age; but Father Sullivan, who knows well in what sad condition she is, is insisting so much on the urgent necessity of this act of charity towards the poor girl, that I have promised him to communicate his request to you. The Rev. Father says that the girl is willing to stay on the reserve after her discharge, and her father agrees to it.\n\nTherefore, kindly let me know as soon as you can, if you approve of her admission or not.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nPS.

Lancaster, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBrocket, Alta.\nOblate Missionaries of Mary Immaculate\nProvincial Administration\n9916 - 110 W Street\nEdmonton -- Alberta.\n\nApril 29th 1928\n\nHonorable Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Supt.Gen.of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nLately while visiting the Sacred Heart Indian School on the Piegan Reserve, Brocket, Alberta, I have again discussed with Rev. Father Levern, Principal, the question of admitting some orphan half-breed girls to this school. This matter had previously been brought to your attention, as ascertained by your letter to Rev. Father Levern, dated Ottawa Sept. 30th 1927, giving full authorisation.\n\nConsequently two girls, Loyer, were admitted in July 1928. Some time ago application for the admission of Laura Loyer, their younger sister, residing at Onion Lake, Sask., and also of another young girl, Louise Desjarlais, has been made; both girls are wards of the Dependent and Delinquent Children's Department at Edmonton. Apparently admission has been delayed by some misunderstanding somewhere. It appears that the Indian Department is demanding some informations concerning these two girls, their previous records of home, and concerning their parents. I have learned through one of its officials that the Department of Dependent and Delinquent Children is perfectly aware of all the conditions and circumstances of the children under its care, and if it agrees to have them transferred to the Indian School at Brocket, knows very well that these children will be incorporated into the Indian Band and that there is no objection whatever to this, and that no trouble from any source would be raised from any source, and thus is willing to the transfer without submitting to a scrutinous questionnaire about these young children.\n\nTherefore may I ask that your Department should not insist upon obtaining such detailed particularities as apparently required by some of the late correspondence through the Indian Agent's Office. The admission of the two Loyer girls in July 1928 was effected without any of these formalities and objected to by the Dept. of Dependent and Delinquent Children, Edmonton, and who makes a clear and simple transfer of these young girls to the Indian Department; these girls are simply orphans and have no bad previous records.\n\nThe Piegan Indian Band has not ceased to insist that these young girls and other young half-breed gizim orphans should be, upon their admission to the school, be at once taken into the Band and not to wait till their discharge and marriage with a member of the Indian Band. The fact is that today the girls, previously admitted, have been already taken into the Band by an unanimous vote and are on Treaty Tickets.\nFor the sake of the race, several of the Piegan young men, ex-pupils, are wishing to have the opportunity of marrying these outside girls thus admitted to the school, as they are of better health and dispositions.\n\nI hope and pray, Dear Sir, that you will deign to again take up this matter with Rev. Fr. Levern, Principal of the Sacred Heart School at Brocket, and communicate with him on this particular subject.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nProcurator.\nOttawa, May 7th, 1931.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to refer to your 2-30 of December 9th, last, and official reply of December 19th, last, with reference to two girls whom the Principal of the Sacred Heart Residential School requested be admitted.\n\nIt is found that you have not yet replied to this letter and the Department is now in receipt of a further communication from Rev. A. Massens, O.M.I. For your information, I am enclosing a copy of our reply to Father Massens and, as soon as he writes you giving the particulars required, the Department will expect to hear from you. Mr. Agent Turner, Onion Lake, may have some information about these girls.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nH. C. Lancaster, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBrocket, Alta.\nOttawa, May 7th, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, in connection with certain girls whom you desire admitted to the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School.\n\nIn giving the decision in 1927 to favourably consider the admission to the Sacred Heart Residential School of half-breed girls who will remain on the reserve after graduation, the Department provided that each case would have to be decided on its own merits and that the initial steps should be taken at the office of the Indian Agent. Consequently, it is necessary that full information regarding the antecedents of each girl for whom application is made should be supplied to the Indian Agent. The Department desires definite assurance that applicants are half-breeds, physically fit and have normal mentality.\n\nI note that, at the present time, you suggest the admission to the Sacred Heart Residential School of Laura Loyer and Louisa Desjarlais. Please let Mr. Indian Agent Lancaster have complete information regarding these two girls. I am today advising him that he can expect to hear from you in the near future and that, as soon as he does so, he should report to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

The mother is dead and the father ill and unable to support them and they are now in St. Bernard's Mission at Grouard, Alta. Their ages are eight and five respectively. An early reply will be appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nH.C. Lancaster,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 22nd, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your 2/31 of the 13th instant, with reference to the request of Father Levern to have two half-breed girls, Mabel and Charlotte Gladu, admitted to the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School.\n\nI note that one of these girls is only five years old, which is under the age for admission of a pupil to an Indian residential school.\n\nIn giving the decision in 1927 to favourably consider the admission to the Sacred Heart Residential School of half-breed girls who will remain on the reserve after graduation, the Department provided that full information should be given regarding the antecedents of each girl for whom application is made. Definite assurance is required that applicants are half-breeds, physically fit and have normal mentality. Please let me have, as soon as possible, complete information regarding the two Gladu girls and, on receipt of your report, further consideration will be given to the question of admitting them to the Sacred Heart School.\n\nI desire, also, to direct your attention to official letters of December 19th, 1930, and May 7th, 1931. It is noted that you have not yet replied to either of these letters and the Department would appreciate hearing from you with regard to the matters mentioned in them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

Victor Webb, Esq.,\nClerk-in-charge,\nIndian Office,\nBrocket, Alta.\nSacred Heart Indian Residential School, Brocket, Alta.,\nJune 22, 1934\n\nThe Honourable H. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI hereto acknowledge receipt of your Circular of the 15th inst., No I-I-IO, and to say in reply that since the opening of this school in 1906 we have always kept the pupils until they reached the age of eighteen years. I beg to say also that, if we are obliged to discharge them when they are sixteen years of age, the only thing to do is to close this small school on this small reserve, where there are so few children and where it is so difficult to get them from their parents.\n\nOn the other hand, the long experience of many past years has shown that school girls should never be returned single to the reserve, where they would be exposed to too many dangers; the practice that has always been followed is to arrange their marriage during their last year of school and to celebrate their wedding on the day of their discharge. A few exceptions have taken place for different reasons, but in most cases it has been to the detriment of the girls.\n\nAs for the boys, I must say that since the Department has obliged us to run a farm in connexion with the school, I do not see at all how we could discharge them at sixteen; They start to work on the farm, as a rule, only when they have reached that age. Then, what would be the use of a farm? No training could be given them in that line, and besides, the grant should be increased in order to enable us to hire extra men to do the work.\n\nHoping that you will understand these reasons and allow us to continue to do as in the past, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nYour humble Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 28, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, with reference to circular letter of the 15th instant, regarding children 16 years of age and over, in the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School. It is not the Department's intention to insist on the discharge of children simply because they have reached the age of 16 years, but, in order to carry out the Indian Act, Principals are required, when pupils reach the age of 16 years, to apply to the Department for permission to keep them for a longer period.\n\nI would therefore appreciate your forwarding, through the office of your local Indian Agent, a list of the children at present in your school who are 16 years of age and over and who, you consider, should remain in the school. In each case, you should state your reasons for desiring these children to have the advantage of further educational training.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nfor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev.

In the case of those who, you consider, should remain for a further period, permission should be requested and your reasons stated. The Department realizes that there are often very good reasons for keeping children in a residential school after they reach the age of 16, and we are prepared to consider representations in this regard, made by the Indian Agent or you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nfor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. L. Levern, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSacred Heart Indian Res. School,\nBrockst, Alta.\nPeigan Agency, Brocket, Alta.\nJuly 15th, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI would request the Department to authorize the discharge of Rita Little Plume, Pupil No. 067, Treaty No. E-7 of the Sacred Heart Boarding School.\n\nThis girl is almost 10 years of age, is deaf and dumb and her father requests that she be discharged, also her sister, a married woman with a sickly baby and herself handicapped with an artificial leg would like this girl to be with her on account of the help she could be.\n\nThe principal, Father Levern insists the girl be not discharged until married but I think under the circumstances the girl would be better unmarried, being deaf and dumb, and also practically all the marriages of recent years are those of Indians who are destitute and as their families increase the number of our destitute or near destitute increase.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.C. Lancaster\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 26, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to the proposed discharge of Rita Little Plume, No. 069, from the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you probably are aware, the Deputy Superintendent General has recently written the principals of all residential schools advising them that permission must be secured if they desire to keep children after the age of sixteen years. In reply to this letter, the Principal of the Sacred Heart School wrote regarding Rita Little Plume as follows:\n\n\"She is deaf and dumb and has no home. Her father is arranging her future marriage, and as soon as this matter is settled she will go; in the meantime, it would not be prudent to turn her loose on the reserve.\"\n\nI note from your letter that her sister is prepared to provide a home for this girl. Possibly Father Levern was not aware of this fact when he wrote the Department. I would appreciate your discussing the matter with him again and making a further recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nH. C.

Your letter of the 6th instant does not state that you carried out these instructions. If not, the Department would appreciate your doing so.

He has put his son in our school very willingly and without any suggestion on my part; he wants his boy to stay in school, and he says also that he will put all his children in school, and in the catholic school because he is a catholic.\n\nBut, on account of the sad circumstances of the recent death of his daughter, Gertrude Crow-Eagle, Pupil No. 070, he has decided that he will never sign any application for their admission! Why? Because he is afraid that he might have the same bad luck with them, if he signs his application! We would think that Charles could never have such a queer idea; but he is an Indian also, and he is superstitious and stubborn like the rest.\n\nNow, you may be able to persuade him; and anyhow, it seems to me that, in a case like this, you have the authority to sign in his place, and I hope therefore that the Department will approve the admission of this boy.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nNote:\nIn regard to above the father of the child is willing he should be in school (and he is in school now) and I have signed the application as agent and I think it would be in order to admit him.\n\nH.C.

I have one son at the present time attending the Catholic School on the Peigan Indian Reserve. He is 17 years old. I am anxious to take him out of school for the purpose of assisting me in my farming operations. I am not feeling very well and would like to have my son to assist me.\n\nI do not know whether under all the circumstances I would be entitled to take my son out of the school and keep him at home with me to assist me in my farming operations.\n\nI would ask you to please make the necessary inquiry in regard to my application which I now make to you and advise me if I am at liberty to take the boy from the school.\n\nA reply to this letter will greatly oblige,\n\nYours truly,\n\nTom Four Horns.\nOttawa, October 29, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Tom Four Horns requesting the discharge of his son from the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School. A letter was received from the Principal dated July 5th, last, in which he recommended that this boy remain in the school for another year.\n\nPlease consult the Principal and advise the Department if you consider the boy should be discharged at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nH. G. Lancaster, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBrocket, Alta.\nAttention of J.D.

School was taken up with Father Levern, Principal, and he is not willing the boy should be discharged and states they require him to help on the farming operations.\n\nThis boy ran away twice and was taken back to school and during the early hours of Friday morning he and another pupil 14 years of age stole two horses and saddles, a pair of gloves, broke into the store room and took some dried fruit and ran away from school. They were apprehended and tried here today by magistrate Plunkett for stealing, the younger boy was sentenced to a whipping by the magistrate, with the consent of his father, and the older boy was given the choice of a whipping or a month in Lethbridge Jail, and took the jail sentence, after serving which he will be returned to the school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.C.

I am so advising the Reverend Principal of the Sacred Heart School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nH. C. Lancaster, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBrocket, Alta.\nOttawa, November 21, 1934.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department has recently been informed by Mr. Agent Lancaster that Edmund Four Horns has recently been convicted of theft and sentenced to one month in Lethbridge Jail. The Department regrets that this action was taken.\n\nMr. Agent Lancaster is being informed that when this boy serves his term he should be allowed to go home, as it does not appear advisable to make any further attempt to keep him at any Indian residential school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. L. Lever, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSacred Heart Res. School,\nBrocket, Alta.\nSacred Heart Indian Residential School, Brocket, Alta., November 18, 1934\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn accordance with the kind decision given on the 30th of September 1927 (Letter No. II6-2-IO) by the Honourable D.C. Scott, I beg to submit you the present application for the admission into our school of Margaret and Frances Thompson, both halfbreed orphans and actually wards of the Provincial Home of Delinquent and abandoned children, Edmonton. Here are the particulars that I have just received from this Institution:\n\n\"By a strange coincidence these two children came under our care on the 21st of August 1934. They happen to be the sisters of Grace Thompson who was sent to you in July 1928. They are very nice children and quite desirable, and physically and mentally O.K. Margaret was born on the 6th of February 1928, and Frances on the 14th day of August 1925. The mother of the above named children is a half breed; the father is unknown.\n\n\"We are quite willing to send these girls to your school and will also agree to conform to any requirements that you may have pertaining to their staying on the Reserve.\"\n\nThese two children, therefore, belong to the class of orphan girls which you have kindly authorized me to accept, and consequently I hope that you will approve their admission. You might object that we have our full number; in fact, we have 50 on the roll, but three are at their homes on account of sickness, another one is out also, another one is to be discharged very soon, and six others next summer.\n\nOn the other hand, I must say that the Peigans will be only too glad to adopt them and to take them into the Band.\n\nFinally, I am glad to certify that Grace Thompson, the sister of these two little girls, did very well in every way at the school and is married now with one of our best ex-pupils.\n\nExpecting a prompt and satisfactory answer and thanking you in anticipation, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nYour faithful Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nPeigan Agency, Brocket, Alta.\nNovember 21st, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter from Father Severn, Principal of the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, requesting the Department to admit two half-breed orphans from the Provincial Home of Delinquent Children at Edmonton, to the Sacred Heart school.\n\nIn reference to this I may say the school now has 52 pupils on the roll and there are at least eleven Peigan children from nine to seven years of age who are eligible for admission to this school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.C. Lancaster,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 26, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, enclosing communication from Father Levern, Principal of the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, requesting the admission of two half-breed orphans to that school.\n\nIn view of your statement, that there are at least 11 children of school age on the Peigan reserve who should be placed in a residential school, the Department is not prepared to approve the admission of any half-breed children at the present time.\n\nIn connection with the Department's willingness to consider admission of half-breed girls when such action is believed advisable, I would refer you to official letter of September 30, 1927, addressed to the former Agent, Mr. C. A. Arthur, and subsequent correspondence. You will remember, also, that certain half-breed girls were admitted to the Peigan Band by a vote of the band members on June 10, 1930.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nH. C. Lancaster, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBrocket, Alta.\nSacred Heart Indian residential School, Brocket, Alta,\nNovember 29, 1934\n\nJ.D. Sutherland\nActing Supt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your favour of the 21st inst., No II6-2-10, and to submit you in reply the following remarks:\n\nFour Horns has been trying since last August to obtain the discharge of his son, Edmund, and boasting that he will get it in spite of the Agent's and Principal's opposition. He is accused also by the Indians of having been coaxing his son to misbehave for the same purpose. Under those circumstances, therefore, it would seem unwise to turn Edmund out at present; it would look like siding with his father, and it would also be considered by some pupils as an encouragement to misbehave in order to be discharged sooner.\n\nOn the other hand, a letter written by Edmund from Lethbridge to his parents a few days ago shows that he is repentant, and determined to amend his conduct. Besides, the Superintendent of the R.C.M.P. Police has assured me that he will give a good talk to Edmund before he leaves the jail.\n\nFor those reasons, I would like to have him returned to the school so that he may have a chance to make up for his past bad behavior and to leave the school later on with a better name. If he misbehaves again, we may give him his discharge after a while.\n\nExpecting that you will take these remarks into consideration, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nYour faithful Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\n\nEXHIBIT REPORT\n\nDetachment File No. 194-34\nDistrict File No. 54K 149-252\n\"Hdqrs\" File No.\n\nDetachment: Pincher Creek\nSub-District: Lethbridge\nDistrict: Alberta\nDate: 13-11-34\n\nRE: Benedict BUNYALOR-Peigan I.R., Alta., Juvenile Del., Theft Saddle 386:\n\nOn November 15th, 1934, I, A.R.

C. Plunkett, Juvenile Commissioner, instructed and later during the day he apprehended both lads riding eastward from the agency and returned with them to the Agency at Brocket. Benedict Buffaloe was placed in charge of his father overnight. In the morning he enrolled to Brocket and laid charges against Ben Buffaloe for theft of the theft of a stock saddle. The boy appeared with his father before C. Plunkett, Juvenile Commissioner, and pleaded guilty. Joe Buffaloe, father of defendant was given the option of paying a fine or voluntarily whipping the boy. He consented to whip the boy which was carried out and the boy was then returned to the Indian school in care of Mr. Lawrence the principal.

Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, with further reference to Edmund Four Horns. The Department has carefully reviewed previous correspondence regarding this boy, and it is not considered advisable to return him to the Sacred Heart School when he completes his jail term.\n\nA report recently received from Mr. Agent Lancaster states that there are a number of children of school age on the Peigan Reserve who are not attending school at the present time. You should, therefore, have no difficulty in obtaining the number of pupils whom you require to bring your enrolment to the number for which grant is provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. L. Levern, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSacred Heart Indian Res. School,\nBrocket, Alta.\nPeigan Agency, Brocket, Alta.\n\nDecember 13th, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI have a request from Paul White Cow, the father of Ben White Cow, Pupil No. 65, Annuity ticket No. G 4, at present in the Sacred Heart School, that this boy be discharged from school to assist him; the boy was 16 years of age on September 3rd of this year.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.C. Lancaster,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 18th, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the request of Paul White Cow for the discharge of his son from the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School.\n\nYou do not state in your letter if you have consulted the Reverend Principal regarding the father's application for the discharge of his son. The Department is, also, doubtful if White Cow really requires his son's assistance at the present time. I am inclined to feel that it would be in the best interests of this boy to remain in the Sacred Heart School until the close of the academic year or, at least, until the spring work commences.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nH. C. Lancaster, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBrocket, Alta.\nIn writing the above I wished to present before the department my position in the matter as regard the relation of the agent with the Indian and the school, but in no way will it affect my efforts in regard to getting pupils for the schools except how it will affect the parents of the children.\n\nThe R.C. School have almost their quota of children now, which I understand is fifty, and there are ten or twelve children of school age available. The C of R School have eight or ten children of school age still on the reserve and I have been working on the parents for some time, in an effort to get them into school, and as soon as the measles epidemic is over, hope to get them in, but find the parents very reluctant to send the children and any feeling between the schools and the parents greatly retard the work.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.G. Lancaster,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. Sutherland, Esq.,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reference your letter No. II6-2-10 of 15th inst., re request for discharge of son of Paul White Cow from the Sacred Heart Indian School\u2014 I beg to say that I did not consult Father Reverend as I know he is opposed to discharging any big boys from the school as he wants to keep them for farming purposes, but I had the request from White Cow and as agent here, I transmitted it to the Department.\n\nI might say that in the past, the agent's recommendation for discharge, or application for entry into school, has always been asked for, but during my illness last summer this matter has been taken out of the hands of the agent and only the school principals recommendation is accepted, so that if an Indian requires a child at home, who has passed the school age, and comes to the agent, who knows the circumstances of the Indians much better than the principals, the agent will have to forward his request to the Department or inform the Indian that he has no authority in the matter, and I might also add that the Indians regard the agent as being his representative with the Department. The correspondence referred to re school age of children was forwarded direct to the school principals, and authority to keep certain children beyond the age of 15 years was granted, but nothing was sent to this office to inform the agent on the subject, and consequently, the school principals regard the agent as having no authority over the schools or children but still look to him to keep the schools supplied with available children and keep the schools in repair.\n\nIn regard the White Cow boy I believe he would be as well or better off in school until the spring but it has been customary to discharge pupils from the schools at the end of the December and the June quarter and that is why the father asked for his son at this time, also he has two children of school age and if he had the son out he would be willing to send the two younger children, but wishes to put them in the C of E school, as his wife is a protestant and he claims he no longer belongs to the Roman Catholic faith.\nOttawa, January 2, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the request of Paul White Cow for the discharge of his son from the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School.\n\nThe principal of the residential school concerned and yourself are the two persons who are most conversant with the facts when application is made for the discharge of a pupil. Consequently, the Department expects that, when an Indian Agent receives an application for the discharge of a pupil, he should consult the principal. The Agent is aware of local conditions while the principal knows the progress that the pupil has made in his school work. Therefore, an application received from a parent for the discharge of his child should not be forwarded to the Department simply as a matter of course, but the principal and the Indian Agent should confer on the request and, as a result of their deliberations, make a definite recommendation stating whether or not they consider it advisable to grant the request for discharge.\n\nI feel you are under a misapprehension regarding the circular letter forwarded some months ago to principals of residential schools. This letter, a copy of which is enclosed, simply pointed out that the Indian Act provides that children are kept in a residential school after they reach the age of sixteen years, that the permission of the Department must be secured. Principals were requested to forward a list of the children in their schools who were sixteen years of age and over, and, in the case of those whom it was considered should be kept for a longer period, they were requested to state their reasons. When they forwarded this information, they were informed that at the end of each academic year in future they should forward through the office of their local Indian Agent a list of pupils sixteen years of age and over, as mentioned above, and state their reasons for desiring to keep any pupil after such pupil reaches the age of sixteen years.\n\nI note your opinion that the school principals regard the Agent as having no authority over the schools or children, and I presume you refer particularly to the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School. In order that there may be no misunderstanding, I enclose, for your information, a copy of letter which is being directed to the Principal of that school.\n\nIn view of your statement that you consider the White Cow boy would be better off in school until Spring, the Department believes it undesirable to discharge him at the present time. He may, however, be discharged at the end of March, when he will be able to help his father with the Spring work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. G. Lancaster, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBrocket, Alta.\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, January 2, 1935.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department has been corresponding with Mr. Agent Lancaster regarding a request which he received for the discharge of the son of Paul White Cow from the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School. Mr. Lancaster believes this boy would be as well off in the school until Spring. He is being informed that the Department considers that the boy should be retained in the Sacred Heart School until the end of March, at which time he should be discharged, in order that he can help his parents.\n\nMr. Lancaster further points out that White Cow has two other children of school age, and if the son was discharged, he would be willing to send the two younger children, but wishes to place them in the Church of England School, as his wife is a Protestant, and he claims he no longer belongs to the Roman Catholic faith.\n\nIn replying to Mr. Lancaster, we are pointing out that, when a request for the discharge of a pupil is received, the Department expects the Indian Agent and the principal to consider the matter jointly. The Indian Agent is aware of the home conditions and the principal knows the progress the pupils is making in his school work. Consequently, when a request is received for discharge, the Indian Agent and the principal should consider the matter, and the Indian Agent should then write the Department making a definite recommendation either for or against the request for discharge.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of June 26th last, it is not the Department's intention to insist on the discharge of children simply because they have reached the age of sixteen years, but, in order to carry out the provisions of the Act, principals are required, when pupils reach the age of sixteen years, to apply to the Department for permission to keep them for a further period. You will remember that in the last paragraph of official letter of June 26th you were further informed that, at the end of each academic year in future, you should forward to the Department, through the office of your local Indian Agent, a list of children in your school who are sixteen years of age and over. When presenting this list to the Indian Agent to send to the Department, you should go over each case with him and the two of you should decide whether or not it is better to keep certain children or discharge them.\n\nThe Department trusts that the Indian Agent and yourself will co-operate fully in connection with future discharges.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. L. Levern, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSacred Heart Indian Res.

This boy has a poor health, and his parents need him; therefore I am willing to let him go out this fall.\n\n2-Susie Yellow Wings, 17, No 073\n\n3-Louise Lover, 16, No 088\n\nThose two girls just got married and are out.\n\n4-Delima Lover, 18, No 089\n\n5-Irene Salway, 17, No 085\n\nThose two girls are Cree halfbreeds and have no home; when I got permission to take them in, it was understood that they would remain in school until they get married on this Peigan Reserve, and I regret to say that I have not been able yet to arrange their marriage.\n\n6-Ertha Buffalo, 17, No 078. She is at already, with her parents.\n\n7-Nellie White Cow, 16, No 076\n\n8-Julia Striped Squirrel, 16, No 092.\n\nThose two girls are too young to get married and it would be a crime to turn them out on the Reserve.\n\nHoping that this statement will be found correct, I am, dear Sir,\n\nYour faithful Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, August 16, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School regarding certain children who are sixteen years of age or over. You may inform him that the discharge of the following pupils is approved:\n\nNo. 61 - Hector Good Rider\n\" 073 - Susie Yellow Wings\n\" 085 - Louise Loyer\n\" 076 - Esther Buffalo.\n\nIn view of the Principal's recommendation, the following children may remain in the school for another year:\n\nNo. 059 - Delima Loyer\n\" 085 - Irene Salway\n\" 076 - Nellie White Cow\n\" 092 - Julia Striped Squirrel.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Phelan,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nJust a few lines to tell you that Sister Gertrude is still waiting for the book-case, which you promised her for the class-room; she will be very much obliged indeed if she gets it.\n\nI wish to speak to you also about something else: it is this, I have been told that at the Calgary Convention you have publicly repeated that it is not the intention of the Department to discharge the pupils at sixteen. Now, the trouble is that the Pelican Indians still remember well what Mr. Christianson told them last year: \"The law is changed... From now on, your children will leave the school at Sixteen...\" More than that: they understood \"as soon as they are coming on sixteen...\" and therefore, since then, they are trying to get their children out, as soon as they are fifteen!\n\nYou may easily imagine all the trouble that this is causing me, and consequently it seems to me that Mr. Christianson should be told to go and let the Indians know that such is not the case. Otherwise, it will be a source of continual difficulties.\n\nThe Sisters and myself, we have kept a delicious souvenir of your visit to our small school and thank you for your great kindness towards us.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, September 4th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, in which he states that the Peigan Indians are under the impression that children must be discharged from a residential school when they reach the age of sixteen years.\n\nAs you are aware, Section 10 (1) of the Indian Act provides that, for valid reasons, the Department is given authority to consent to children remaining in a residential school until they reach the age of eighteen years.\n\nWhile some children should be discharged at sixteen, I think you will agree that it is in the best interests of others to remain until they are eighteen years of age. This applies particularly to the girls.\n\nOn the occasion of your next visit to the Peigan Agency, I should appreciate if you would discuss this matter fully with Mr. Agent Lancaster and the Indians and point out the exact meaning of Section 10 (1) of the Indian Act.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Charles has told me publicly that he will put all his children here, but will not sign the application for the admission of any of them\u2014on account of what happened to his daughter \"Gertrude.\" In fact, when he put his other son \"Francis\" here, he did the same.\n\nMrs. Two Chiefs says that she wants her grand son \"Philip Yellow Wings\" to be educated here, but she claims that she's too old to sign the application.\n\nHoping that this will create no objection to the admission of those two children, I remain yours truly,\n\nJ.

Victor Webb,\nIndian Agent,\nBrocket, Alta.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFollowing our conversation concerning John William English, Pupil IO4 of the Sacred Heart School, Brocket, I beg to make this statement:\nThat, having taken the matter of his standing in class with his teacher, and of his relations with the other boys, with the disciplinarian, I have found that this boy John William English, although not an extra bright pupil is far from being what his father would like us to believe, namely that his boy cannot and will never learn anything, and that he is abused by the other children. It is true that the boy stutters and has difficulty to express himself; he is what a school Inspector would term a pupil below the average. His teacher states that the intelligence is fair but the memory defective.\n\nOtherwise, he is physically strong and healthy and can and in fact does very well look after himself. Personally, I believe it would be too bad to deprive the boy of the chance he has to learn: with many children the intelligence develops slowly, as may be the case with him.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Signed) E. Riaux, O.M.I.\n\n(COPY)\nSir,\n\nI have a request from John English one of our Peigan Indians who has a boy in school at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, aged 13 years, named Willis on the Treaty Book, and registered on the school books as John William English.\n\nI understand he is practically a mute & of sub-normal intellect, and the father asks that he be discharged from school to return home. The father claims he would be better at home and could assist him around the place, and states that the boy is very good working around farming at home, and would be of great assistance when the father is laid up with periodic attacks of arthritis.\n\nFather E. Riaux as per my request has submitted his observations on the boy, and I am appending a copy of his letter to me, and beg to ask a decision from the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Although this child is only five years of age, I have no doubt that the Department will ratify her admission, given the circumstances of her parents. Joe Stump, her father, is destitute, suffering from a sprain of the spine, which renders him unable to work and to support his family. I took this child into school over a year ago through charity, but I believe that she should be admitted regularly and take her place on the roll.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nI would certainly recommend that this child be admitted on the school roll; the facts as stated above are correct.\n\nT.W.

Bessette of J.L. Bessette & Son, General Merchants, Notikewin, Alta. I have recently had a letter from Mr Bessette expressing his willingness to take Clara & provide for her & was wondering what the reaction of the Department would be to his.\n\nI might say that Clara is temporarily employed at the school until such time as a proper home can be found for her.\n\nI understand that Mrs Bessette has been down here on previous occasions trying to get the child from the school, but apparently was headed off, but whether the matter was ever taken up with you, I do not know.\n\nS.T. Faunt,\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 15, 1944.\n\nMr. J.T. Faunt, Acting Indian Agent, Brocket, Alta.\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, regarding Clara Nosekaye, No. B.68. I have also reviewed the correspondence between the Department and the Pelican Indian Agent's office at the time this girl was admitted to membership in the band. I note that the girl is now temporarily employed at the Sacred Heart School, but I infer from your letter that you have not discussed her case with the Principal of the school. I believe that he is fully familiar with the circumstances under which this girl was admitted to membership and placed in the Sacred Heart Residential School. Before taking any further action regarding her I feel that you should discuss her future very carefully with the Principal of the Sacred Heart School. In any case she should remain at the school until the Department makes a final decision regarding her.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 28, 1944.\n\nDear Father Crepeau:\n\nI have your letters of January 28, January 31 and February 21 with reference to the application for the admission of Violet North Peigan to the Sacred Heart Residential School. When forwarding the application form the Indian Agent stated that the father, Hartwell North Peigan, had come to see him and claimed that he had signed the form under a misapprehension. He further stated that the family are Protestants. The Department reviewed the application form very carefully and, in view of the fact that the child was only seven years of age and the present school term was over half completed, we felt that the matter of her admission to a residential school should be allowed to stand until the end of June next. This was the direction given to the Indian Agent in a letter dated January 27, 1944.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. G. Crepeau, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSacred Heart Indian Residential School,\nBrocket, Alta.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Clara Nosekay, No. B.65.\n\nI have your letter of 15th Inst., in regard to the above girl, written in reply to mine of 10th Inst.\n\nIt would appear that you were under the impression that I had not discussed this girl's case with the principal of the school, but this is not the case.\n\nWhen the matter of discharge came up, the question of the girl's future was talked of & the Rev'd Father spoke of the aunt & agreed to make enquiries as to their position, character &c. before letting the girl go to them, as she wanted to do.\n\nI then wrote to the people asking them if they were still anxious to have her & they said they were & would arrange to come after her at any time they were advised that they could have her.\n\nThe Principal, on talking to him this morning, says there is no future for her on the reserve & it would be in the girl's best interests that she should go to her own people.\n\nSo far as working at the school is concerned, I asked the Principal if he could not arrange to give her something to do till such time as satisfactory arrangements could be made for her and I might say that at present she is an observation case as the result of an X-Ray examination in connection with a T.B. clinic recently held, and is not working.\n\nJ.T. Faint,\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 4, 1944.\n\nMr. J.T. Faunt, Acting Indian Agent, Brocket, Alta.\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd ultimo, in further reference to Clara Nosekeye.\n\nIf you refer to official letter of the 15th ultimo you will note that before writing to you at that time we had reviewed the correspondence between the Department and the Peigan Indian Agency office at the time this girl was admitted to membership in the band. No doubt you have also read the correspondence to which we refer and you are aware of the particular circumstances that induced the Department to encourage her admission to the Peigan Band.\n\nBefore placing the girl in charge of Mr. and Mrs. Bessette, we feel that legal adoption papers should be taken out by them. As stated above, this girl is a member of an Indian band and, if we simply allow her to go to the home mentioned and things do not work out satisfactorily, she will be left without anyone to look after her. We do not wish this condition to arise and I think both the Principal and yourself will recognize the importance of arranging legal adoption.\n\nR.A.

You will note that J. L. Bessette of Brocket, who is the uncle of Clara Noskiye, made application to legally adopt her and it might therefore be advisable to have the Minister issue an Order under Section 15 of the Act removing her from membership.\n\nIt is possible that a number of the girls admitted have married Indians, which would qualify them for membership. If they are not married, should they be included in the Minister's Order if Clara Noskiye is to be removed from membership?\n\nD. J.

I believe the remarks of Dr. Brayton are very close to the correct reason for the actions of this woman.\n\nAfter the Doctors examination, I had Mrs. Yellow Wings in the Office with the Police Scout and after talking the whole matter over I warned her that although prosecution was concluded, for the time being that if she got herself into any further trouble that the old case might be brought up again, and reminded her that for the next four years her behaviour would have to be of the best.\n\nThe problem which now places itself before me is the request of the mother for her children; she has a baby and the second youngest child with her, while Guy Yellow Wings her husband, has the other two children aged 5 and 6. Guy however is not taken these children under his control, he has placed them in the home of his Sister, Mrs. Paul Smith, who have their own children to look after as well. Guy is travelling around the country making his home at MacLeod where he has some work, and is co-habiting with a girl of similar character to the one he left behind. Guy Yellow Wings is living by herself in her own home, and has requested that she have the two older children with the intention of placing them in the Anglican School immediately; Although I have not seen Guy Yellow Wings I understand he wishes to put them in the Catholic School. I would like your advice regarding the action to be taken and whether you would consider accepting Mrs. Guy Y Wings application for admission, or The Husband's, I would on the knowledge I have be inclined to favor the mothers signature as she seems to be mostly interested in the children.\n\nIt is my intention to try and straighten out this case by having them both come to the Office, but would not like to make any statement re the children till I have had your advice.\n\nFor three months previous to the Arson case this family were only together for short periods the husband meeting the other woman in Macleod during that time; and although Mrs. Guy Yellow Wings has committed a crime the loss of her child during the Xmas season plus the trouble she had with her husband calls for a grain of sympathy.\n\nI will be glad of your instructions and advice regarding the School I should place these children in, and any further suggestions I should take in settling up their troubles. It is certain that it will be an impossibility to get them together again.\n\nAnthony McMillan,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 16, 1945.\n\nMr. A. McMillan, Indian Agent, Brocket, Alberta.\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the two children of Mrs. Annie Yellow Wings. I understand from your letter that these children are legitimate, and I also presume that the father is recognized as a Catholic. Under these circumstances, it is felt that the father should be allowed to direct the religion under which the children should be educated, and therefore you might submit application forms and certificates of health for their admission to the Sacred Heart School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nMarch 20, 1945\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: Rosaline Yellow Wings\nEnglish name: Rosaline Yellow Wings\nAge: 4 yrs. 7 months\nName of Band: Pagan\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid:\nFather's full name and No.: Guy Yellow Wings\nMother's full name and No.: Adriel Bull Pen\nParents living or dead: Living\nState of child's health:\nReligion: Roman Catholic\nDoes applicant speak English?

When application is made for the admission of such cases, full particulars should accompany the application.\n\nFORM NO. 1-A 406\nIndian Affairs Branch Dept of Mines & Resources Ottawa.\n\nI beg to request That I be given the following advice;\n\nA girl by the name of Doris Rabbit was admitted to the Sacred Heart School by authority of your letter File 116-2-10 of November 10th 1941. From the information I am able to get from the Sacred Heart Principal and files this girl was placed in school as the mother was not capable of looking after her, this child up to 16 months ago I understand was being taken care of by the school, when at that time this girl was turned over to Harold Sharp Adze, which the Sacred Heart Principal states was arranged between him and the Agent at that time.\n\nHarold Sharp Adze has now signed papers for the admission of this child to the Anglican School, claiming guardianship owing to having looked after this child for the last eighteen months, he took the Child to the Anglican School last Friday.\n\nThis is being stoutly argued by the Principal of the Sacred Heart School, who was very indignant, and annoyed when bringing this to my attention.\n\nI have advised the Principal of the St Cyprians School by letter to return this child to Harold Sharp Adze while the Department make a decision; this will be done immediately and the child left with the Guardians till a decision is arrived at. This Girl Doris Rabbit will not be seven till February 25th 1946.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the Application for admission which I received from the Principal of the Anglican School which I trust you will return after you have looked it over with further instructions.\n\nAnthony J. Millar\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 15th September, 1945.\n\nMr. A. McMillan, Indian Agent, Brocket, Alberta.\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant with reference to Doris Rabbit. This girl was regularly admitted to the Sacred Heart School in the Fall, 1941, and the application form states that her father was dead at that time and the form was signed by the mother and approved by the Agent Mr. T.W.V. Webb. Her religion was stated to be Roman Catholic. The Quarterly Returns from the school show that she was allowed out for holidays on June 30th, 1944, and did not return on the expiry of her leave.\n\nIn view of the above, the Department considers that this girl should be returned immediately to the Sacred Heart Residential School. We are not prepared to approve her admission to the St. Cyprians School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSeptember 20th 1945\n\nSTATEMENT MADE BY MRS ANNIE RABBIT BEFORE INDIAN AGENT,\nAT OFFICE.\n\nDoris Rabbit was turned over to Harold Sharp Adze owing to mother being a widow and could not take care of her, after having taken the child over Harold Sharp Adze was convicted and sent to Jail and the child was turned back to the mother, and she asked the R.C Principal to take the child into School. This child then was just over a year old, and authority was granted to place the child in the School.\n\nThis child stayed in School till June 1944 and was turned back to Sharp Adze, who looked after the child each summer. Last fall he went to the U.S.A. to work and the child was not returned to School being under school age.\n\nDuring this period she never asked the return of the child, and harold has been keeping it since it left school.\n\n..............................\n\nAgents Comment.\n\nI did not ask Mrs Annie Rabbit to sign the above statement, and just took down what she said, I feel that this information should be passed on to the Branch, so that when the child is placed in a School no further argument can come up.\n\nIndian Agent.\nPeigan Indian Agency, Brocket, Alberta.\nNovember 13th, 1940.\n\nAgreement for Adoption of child.\n\nI Annie Rabbit hereby agree to hand over my child Doris Rabbit born February 11th, 1939 for adoption by Mrs Harold Sharp Adze.\n\nIn consideration of adoption & the previous care I will pay to Mrs H. Sharp Adze $5.00 now and from this date the child is under all care of Mrs H. Sharp Adze, who will draw her Treaty & Interest money until the child is of school age & enters school.\n\nI hereby waive all claim to the child Doris Rabbit after this date, my signature as witness below.\n\nAnnie Rabbit\n\nAgnes Weasel Woman X\nMrs H.

This is a special concession for this year only in view of the necessity for providing accommodation for children who have not yet obtained any education.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\n**ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT Sacred Heart SCHOOL DURING Third QUARTER, 1947**\n\n| No. | NAME                      | Date of Admission | Age | Band | Name of Parents and Living or Dead (Insert L. for living, D. for dead, after name) | Father                  | Mother                  | Religion of Parents | State of Education upon Entering the School | Place and period of Previous Education |\n|-----|---------------------------|-------------------|-----|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|     |                           |                   |     |      |                                                                                  |                         |                       |                     |                                             |                                        |\n| 0164 | Berrie Baptiste           | Nov. 1/47         | 8   | A-76 | Prigard                                                                          | George Baptiste         | Alice Prigard         | R.C.                |                                             |                                        |\n| 0165 | Margaret Bad Eagle        | do                | 8   | D-37 | Pat.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nI am having trouble with the R.C. School on account of my oldest girl. She is kept back at the school when over a holiday come on, the rest of the school boys and girls all go home at Easter time. She stayed back for 10 days; she is not allowed to come home with us. Whenever we go there, they don't show up. They say no notice was given. They are telling her she was not fit to marry. I have written to the principal. He got his brother at the school, he will look after my daughter to marry him. This fellow has been friendly with the girl. My daughter said she didn't want him at all. I told her to tell him to keep his sisters by his side too. You can't go by the Indian agent's orders. This man has been seen with my daughter going around with her alone. My daughter says he is too old for me.\nHe is too gray hair man and I am too young yet him for my husband.\n\nMy daughter told the other school girls that principal and the agent a parish priest will look for a job for her and I don't think I will be able to come back. They told me never to go home again more, to keep off from home because my flock are too poor that no place for you to be.\n\nWell this is my greatest reason why I change my children to the other school, so my children would be better like this again.\n\nIt looks to me that my days there going to be chase out from the teacher I'm not a kid free to see her.\n\nOn May the 6th all children went home up to Sunday my daughter was wanting\nto come home with the next, the next day will be her birthday she will be 16 she want to go home she was just jumping for joy girls to girl she told I before I shake it home this time to see my dear mother & dad? Then it will be Mother's day too She told them if she could come home they told her The government wrote you should not be home On Feb 20th I went to the school I ask for my oldest daughter to leave school I wanted her to get married when she will be 16 she likes the boy all right they all had a hold event too At the time the girl was\nAt the time the girl she went to dances and to town with him. That's Archie Big Swan they want to visit his home. The girl she so like the place she wanted to stay there I went for her to get back. It was time for them to go back to school she told me. I hate to go back. Now look how they are doing in the first place. Dear the agent, Patrick Price the Scout to let my daughter come of that School today they all calling down the boy I got for Son-in-Law. I have a trust in thee.\n\nFrom\n\nMr Sam Yellow Face\n**Form No. I.A.411**\n\n**ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT Sacred Heart Res. Ind.

As the children were admitted to the school on September 2nd, the Department can allow 29 days grant for each of these pupils. We are, therefore, amending the Return accordingly.\n\nWith reference to pupil # 172, the Principal has indicated that this pupil was admitted on September 15th and later this was amended in ink with the result that the indication is not clear whether this pupil was admitted to school on September 15th or 25th. The Principal claimed 15 days grant for him. We are disallowing the 15 days grant claimed until we are advised definitely the date of this boy's admission to the Sacred\nHeart school. The Principal may claim this grant on the December Return but he must give a full explanation in the Remarks Column.\n\nOn checking the September Return against the June Return it is noted that pupil # Cl46 was dropped. As this pupil was in residence during June, the school is entitled to 62 days grant for her. If this pupil was overlooked her name should be included on the December Return claiming the 62 days grant and in the Remarks Column giving the reason for claiming this grant. The note in the Remarks Column is required by the Treasury officials when checking the Return.\n\nThe Department approves the discharge of the following:\n\n| #   |       |\n|-----|-------|\n| 0149| 0155  |\n| 0145| 0162  |\n| 0156| 132   |\n| 0161| 136   |\n| 134 | 138   |\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nOctober 25th, 1952\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Sacred Heart Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: Lucy Little Mustache\nEnglish name: Peigan\nAge: 8\nName of Band: Peigan\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid: 00\nFather's full name and No.: Albert Little Mustache\nMother's full name and No.: Alice Big Snake\nParents living or dead: living\nState of child's health: good\nReligion: oath\nDoes applicant speak English?: no\nPreviously attended: school for all years\n\n(Signature of father)\n\nNOTE\u2014If mother or guardian signs, agent must forward full explanatory note.\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\nSignature of Missionary or other Witness\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNote\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

School\nApplication Valerie Yellow Wings:\n\nReference is made to your letter of January 8, 1953 regarding the application of Valerie Yellow Wings, to the Sacred Heart Residential School. It is regretted that this application was forwarded without a covering letter of explanation.\n\nValerie Yellow Wings is a child of a very poor family. The mother often abandons the child and the father is a very poor provider. As the child reached the age of six years on December 4th, 1952, I considered it would be in order to submit her application, when the principle stated he would make room for her in his school.\n\nAlthough as stated in your letter, the Sacred Heart Residential School has more than authorized enrollment, could consideration be given to the approval of this application, due to the circumstances of the child's home.\n\nL.

Father Levern, Principal of the R.C. Indian Residential School on the Peigan Reserve, who asks to be supplied with certain equipment this Spring, in order that he may start to prepare a farm before the new school is in operation, which I think is a very wise plan. He asks for three sets of harness, plow with breaker bottom, disk, waggon and anything else that may be required. He asks for six work horses. I do not know that I am prepared to recommend the purchase of six horses, as I think four should be ample, but the implements asked for seem to me to be necessary.\n\nI shall be glad to know if this equipment can be supplied to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Our funds are extremely limited and only the most pressing requisitions can be given favourable consideration.

I wish to inform you that this school has nothing in the way of implements, as they have previously done no farming as the school was situated on a gravel bed where it was not possible to do any farming. The only things that I would recommend for the use of the school this year would be; 2 teams of horses, 2 sets of harness, a plow, a disc and a set of harrows.\n\nI shall be glad to have your authority to make this purchase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Indian Residential School.\n\nThis is a matter that can stand for this year and nothing should be bought.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMy dear Mr. Scott:\n\nReverend Father J. L. Levern, Principal of Peigan Indian Residential School, had requested from the Department the purchase of a few horses and agricultural implements, all of which were to be used in order to prepare the land for next year.\n\nIf my memory serves me right, the Department advised Mr. Graham on June 13th to comply with the Reverend Principal's request. On July 25th, the Commissioner answered the Department that the above articles were not needed for the present year. Of course, he knows best.\n\nOn September 25th, Reverend Father Levern spoke of the necessity he had for horses and the implements to Mr. Christianson but on October 16th no news had been received as yet. The Reverend Principal insists upon the urgent need of horses, at least to bring over different things from the old school to the new one. Do you think that he could be accommodated and therefore given authority to buy a few horses for his present needs?\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nNovember 9, 1926.\n\nDear Father Guy:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to work horses and agricultural implements for the Peigan R.C.

School. As already reported, the implements are not needed until next Spring, and it now appears that the Principal is not even in a position to take over the horses which I instructed the Inspector to buy while he was in the West. In referring to your letter No. 116-2-14 of November 9th., I note that you point out - \"The Rev. Principal has urgent need of horses for hauling from the old school to the new.\" I am of the opinion that with the horses he has on hand he can find a way of getting along until Spring.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\n\nREGINA, SASK., Dec. 8th, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honour to report on the progress of the two new schools that are being erected on the Peigan Reserve.\n\nThe Roman Catholic School is pretty well advanced. The outside of the building was nearly finished and the lathers were at work when I was there and the plasterers arrived the day I left. The plumbing and steamfitting was also well under way, as they expected to be able to turn on the heat as soon as the chimney was finished which they were working at then. The outbuildings which I arranged for on my last visit were also well under way and should be nearly completed now. The Contractor expects to finish the school about the 15th of January.\n\nThe Church of England School is not as far advanced. They have, however, made good headway since my last visit. The walls were up as far as the roof, but the part housing the engines and so forth at the back of the school had not been started on, simply the foundation put in.\n\nThe barn and other outbuildings which I arranged for on my last visit were almost completed. The men expected to finish a day or so after I left. They have made a very fine job of the buildings and the Principal was highly satisfied with the buildings and the workmanship.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nthe workmanship in general. Mr. Graham, the Contractor on the school, thought he would be able to finish up by the end of January. I doubt this; if he puts on enough men, he will no doubt be able to finish it by then, but the weather will be a big factor in the matter.\n\nRegarding the implements and horses asked for by the Principal of the Roman Catholic School and authorized by the Department. The implements, of course, are not needed at the present time but the two teams of horses asked for, which I had your authority to purchase, will soon be required. However, I found that the Principal was not in a position to take the horses at the present time as I knew previously. He has only a small amount of feed and no place to keep them at the present time. I, however, picked out some horses and instructed Mr. Arthur to purchase them at such times when the Principal would be ready to take delivery of them. I did not think it wise to buy the horses now and take delivery of them and turn them out on the prairie.\n\nI did not visit the Church of England School, but I was over at the Roman Catholic School and I had the Principal from the Anglican School up to the office to see me. On the whole, conditions are satisfactory at both schools.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, January 20, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have learned that the principal of the Sacred Heart (Peigan R. C.) Indian Residential School has urgent need for a wagon at the time that the horses for which you have made arrangements are purchased. Please purchase a suitable wagon and have it delivered to the school when the horses are secured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20th instant #116-2-14, in which you authorize me to purchase a wagon for use at the Sacred Heart (Peigan R.C.) Indian Residential School, and reply to say that this matter will be attended to, although I think that a wagon is unnecessary. The question of supplying a wagon was discussed with the Inspector who recently visited the Peigan Agency, and he told me that he thought they could very well get along without one. However, they took this matter up direct with you and I am now authorized to buy the wagon. I think you will admit this puts the Inspector in a very awkward position. It would be much better for the Inspectors not to say anything about matters of this kind, as they would not then be placed in the positions which they sometimes are. Personally I think it would be much safer to rely on the word of the Inspector than on that of the Principal or the Indian Agent. There is a tendency, as you know, on the part of the school authorities to get as much as they possibly can out of the Department when a new school is opened up.

Levern, O.M.I., Principal of Piegan Indian Residential School, is writing to me in connection for a request for a wagon.\n\nThe Reverend Father has an old wagon which in the opinion of the agent himself is rather old and not worth much though it can be utilized for some purposes. The Reverend Principal states that it is impossible to unload cars at the station or to do any work at harvest time with only one wagon. In fact the Reverend Father needs three wagons in all and he says the sooner he gets them the better.\n\nI hope that you will give the Reverend Father's request your kind attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJoseph Henry, O.M.I.\nOttawa, March 2, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to my letter No. 116-2-14 of January 20th, last, and your 406-11A of the 24th idem in reply.

I am somewhat doubtful whether his wishes could be met, but I will take the matter into consideration, reserving decision for the present.\n\nI am returning herewith the duplicate of letter addressed to me by Father Beys.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott.\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. A. Therien,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOttawa.\nSacred Heart Indian School, Brocket, Alta., August 23, 1933\n\nH.C. Lancaster,\nIndian Agent, Brocket.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI regret very much to tell you that we are out of water: This morning we were not able to get any water from the old well neither from the spring, although we pumped for a long time.\n\nAs you are well aware, a short while after we moved into this school, we built a good dam across the coulee at a certain distance from the spring in order to gather all the water running from it and to form a pond for our stock. This pond has given perfect satisfaction until the spring was piped to the house; since that time, there has been no overflow running into it; however, the melting of the snow and some occasional heavy rains have kept it almost full the most of the time till this summer. It is dry now: it went dry last week, and therefore we started to pump for the stock as well as for the house, and that is how we ran out of water.\n\nAfter all, this has not surprised me: the same trouble happened already last Christmas, just because we used on that occasion more water than usual. There is very little water in the old well, and the spring itself has never been strong, as Mr. Gardner-Smith stated it in his letter of October 1931 to the Department.\n\nStill, I hope that by using it sparingly, we may get water enough for the house and the milch cows; but we must absolutely send the rest of the stock somewhere else, where they can drink. Napoleon Provost is willing to take charge of them at his place near the river, for $25.00 a month; I hope that the Department will approve of this arrangement and pay this monthly bill.\n\nIf we have a good rain to fill the pond again before the winter, we will be glad to take them back to the school; if not, we will have to leave them there and to take the trouble of hauling hay for them to that distance of six miles!\n\nUnder all these hard circumstances, it would be much more pleasant indeed for me to have no cattle at all here; but then how could I run this small school and pay all the expenses if I had to depend on no other revenue than the per Capita Grant?\n\nHoping that you will kindly communicate about this matter with the Department as soon as possible, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nAugust 26th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith a letter received from Mr. Tavern, Principal of the R.C. school on this reserve in reference to the water situation at the school. In regard to this I may say that owing to the drought this year spring on the reserve are running very little water and our range conditions both for water and grass are very poor.\n\nThe R.C. school here were given an extra quarter of land to enable them to raise feed for their stock; they are farming on a large scale and have about eighty head of cattle and it is water in this quantity of stock that has caused most of their water shortage and I think something should be done to have them cut down their herd. They claim the prices are low and they do not wish to sacrifice stock but the Indians have to do it and these cattle being turned on our range makes that much less feed and water for the Indian stock and I do not think the department is in any way responsible for the $25.00 per month they wish to pay the Indian for looking after the stock.\n\nIt appears to me that the welfare of the Indian children is a secondary consideration with our boarding schools now and that most of their exercises are directed toward making money in farming and raising stock and that they should only be allowed to raise or hold the number of stock that can be pastured and fed on the land allotted to them.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.O. Lancaster,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 30, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, enclosing a communication which you received from the Principal of the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, on the Peigan reserve, with reference to the water situation and the quantity used for stock purposes.\n\nIt is considered that the school authorities themselves should be responsible for the payment of $25.00 per month to an Indian for the watering of the stock. It is noted that the school is farming on a large scale and has about 80 head of cattle. There does not appear to be any necessity for keeping such a large number. If this school keeps more stock on hand than conditions warrant, the management should dispose of part of the herd. In any event, as stated, the Department is not prepared to incur any expense in the providing of water.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nH. C. Lancaster, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBrocket, Alta.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Complaints of principal, Brocket School, Alta.\nATTENTION: Mr. F. Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Reverend Father G. Cr\u00e9peau, O.M.I., of the above school, in which he complains of the damages that one of the bulls of the Agency has caused to the milk herd of the school. It appears that this bull fought a royal battle with the school bull and broke the fence around the latter's corral. To keep the peace the school bull had to be killed eight months before he was to have been disposed of.\n\nIt also appears that this same Agency bull attacked a cow and so violently that it tore an eye out of its socket and the cow had to be killed immediately.\n\nThese complaints were made to the Agent and the stockman without any avail. The bull is still on the school premises and is continuing to cause very serious damage. Father Cr\u00e9peau says that his claim for the above is $250.00 and asks the Department to pay it without any delay.\n\nThe above complaints seem a little strange, I admit, but if true, something should be done about it, as agents must protect not only the property of the Indians, but to the same degree that of the Department of Indian Affairs. After all, it must not be forgotten that the Brocket School is Government property and the stock is also owned, at least in part, by the Department.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.O. Flourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, September 10, 1946.\n\nMr. A. McMillan, Indian Agent,\nBrocket, Alberta.\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter received from Reverend J. O. Plourde, O.M.I. The letter explains itself and the request contained in the communication is unusual. However, I would appreciate it if you would discuss the matter with the Principal of the Sacred Heart School and let me have a report.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEncl.\nIndian Affairs Branch Dept of Mines & Resources Ottawa.\n\nAttention B F Neary Esqr.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th inst File 116-2-14 (W T 1).\n\nAs you state this is an usual letter; and would seem to be a very petty complaint of the past Principal. I approached the new Principal for information this being the first I had heard of it, also my Stockman, and the Clerk in the Office to find if any such complaint had been made. It was found that the phone calls advising me that the Bull was in their field was all the Principal said. The new Principal advises me as follows that according to his employees, the Bull occasionally got into the field and when possible, battled the School Bull, but without damage. The question of the Cow is very far fetched, no one saw the cow attacked, the cow is still alive without the sight of one eye, and according to School employees they do not know how the cow got hurt.\n\nOur Bulls are only out for July, August, and part of September, and the rest of the year are in the Bull pasture 12 miles from the School; Every time we received a complaint one of our stockmen went down and removed the Bull and put it on the Range. However the main dam on our summer range where approximately 1200 cattle and 25 Bulls congregate is only one mile from the School fence, and we cannot control them all the time.\n\nIn conversation with the new Principal, he advises me that he intends to have a change of breeding cattle at the School and will likely change from Jersey's to shorthorns, if so he intends to ask permission to use our Bulls at odd times, so that I see no reason for this matter coming up again.\n\nThe claim is ridiculous, as the animal supposed to have been killed immediately is still very much alive, while I am advised the Bull was undamaged.\n\nAnthony McMillan\nIndian Agent.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, 26 September 1946.\n\nDear Father Plourde:-\n\nOn receipt of your letter of Sept. 5th in connection with complaints made to you by Rev. G. Crepeau, O.M.I., the Indian Agent was written and we have just received his reply.\n\nHe states that he interviewed the new Principal and it has been found, that, while one of the cows that belong to the school lost the sight of its eye none of the present school staff are aware of how this accident happened. In any case the animal is still alive. The Agent also reports that the school bull was not seriously injured.\n\nIn view of the information that we have received from our Agent, it does not appear necessary to take any further action.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

One of the Sisters was with the girls at the time.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMy name is Sister St. Clotilde. I am second disciplinarian for the girls at Sacred Heart School Brochet Alta, and was on duty at 7 P.M. Sept 12, 1937. Here is what happened while on duty. I took the small girls to the chicken coop for a visit. On our way back to the girls' playground, they saw the trailer which is used to bring supplies to the school from Brochet and they began to play with it. Some girls pulling at the front and others pushing at the back, and some others taking a ride by turn and going forward and turning around and coming back a short distance, and then all of a sudden the trailer came at a place where the ground is sloping a little towards the ice house. I was standing about 20 feet from the trailer. Three girls were riding inside the boy, two were pulling at the front and two were pushing at the back: Josephine Little Leaf and Laura Black Eyes. Some girls standing by a little way, seeing the trailer backing on the ice house, shouted to stop. Laura Black Eyes jumped aside. Josephine Little Leaf remained behind and was crushed between the back of the trailer and the wall of the ice house. The trailer rebound, and Josephine ran to me and I ran towards her\u2014took her in my arms, her legs gave way under her, thinking she was fainting. I left her on the ground, ran for water to wash her face, on my return I noticed a little blood coming though the nose and the mouth. I shook her a little to revive her without success.\nthen I ran to the house to get the matron who came at once with all the sisters of the staff\u2014Sister Armstrong first. Disciplining of the girls felt the pulse and could not feel any movement; we carried Josephine little girl to the girl infirmary and laid her on a bed. Sister Armstrong went to telephone to the doctor. It was about 5 P.M. When Josephine was caught between the trailer and the wall of the ice house, and 5.15 when she was on the bed at the infirmary. The doctor arrived from Pincher Creek about at 6.30. When I saw the girls playing with the trailer I never thought that such an accident might happen.\n\nSister St. Clotilde.\nREPORT\n\nRe: Josephine LITTLE LEAF...Peigan Indian Reserve-Brocket Alta., A Accidental death of - Internal Hemorrhage.\n\nF.U.R.\nNIL\n\nat the front of the trailer-My sister, Josephine, and another little girl were at the back-there were two girls in the trailer - we were giving each other rides-we had been playing for a little while-when Christine Provost & myself started to pull the trailer ahead, the two girls at the back pulled against us and as it was downhill they pulled us with the trailer and my little sister Josephine, was caught between the trailer and the dairy-there is a little hill down to the dairy-where my sister and the other girl pulled the trailer- I thought my sister was hurt- We all ran away - I didn't go back-I was afraid.\n\nSept.12th,1937\n\nLaura BLACK EYES:\n\nI was at back with Josephine, pulling down and up, both The trailer nearly reached the wall so I ran away-Josephine got caught - I saw Sister running towards the trailer and saw her catch Josephine and put her on the ground.\n\nI then inspected the trailer and demonstrated to the Jury, how hard it would be to stop this trailer once it started down the incline to the dairy and ice house-Without anyone in it, it was all that I could do to stop it, after putting it into motion, before it struck the wall of the ice house.

Peigan Indian Reserve, Brocket Alta., Accidental death of - Internal Hemorrhage\n\n1. At about 7.05 P.M. 12th Sept. 1937, Dr. K.J. Brayton phoned me from Sacred Heart Roman Catholic School on Peigan Indian Reserve that a little Indian Girl had been killed at that place the evening before he had been called in but the child was dead when he arrived.\n\n2. I proceeded to Peigan Reserve at once making the patrol by pte auto.\n\n3. Upon arrival at the school I found the body of a little Indian girl (Josephine Little Leaf) lying on a bed in the girl's infirmary. There was a slight depression on the left side of breast; bloody matter was oozing from the nostrils and mouth. No bruises or scars.\n\n4. I took statements from persons at the School knowing anything about the matter using both French and Indian interpreters to do so.\n\n5. There are no suspicious circumstances surrounding this death. My investigation showed that the deceased was a little girl of 8 years of age an orphan had been living with her uncle on the reserve, his name being Chief John Yellow Horn. The little girls had come to the school the night of Sept. 1937. During the afternoon of the 12th Sept. 1937 six or seven little Indian Girls had gone out with Sister Ste Clotilde to look at the chickens in the Chicken house on their way back the children started to play with a trailer used by the school to pull supplies behind a car from Brocket. Two of the girls were pulling the trailer two were pushing it and three riding in it. They were taking turns at riding and pushing and pulling. Little Josephine had had her turn at riding and was taking her turn at pushing. They were attempting to turn the trailer at the top of a little incline leaning down to the garage and ice house, the trailer got the better of them and rolled down the incline crushing Josephine between the rear of the trailer and the wall of the ice house her chest was literally caved in she died in a few minutes bleeding inwardly so fast that the outer parts of the body did not discolor.\n\n6. After getting the statements I phoned Sub-Div. headquarters at Lethbridge and was instructed to notify the coroner at MacLeod. I did this after I had notified the Indian Agent at Brocket Alta. The Coroner A.F. GRADY after hearing the result of my investigation ordered an Inquest to be held at the School next day at 9.30 A.M. and instructed me to have a jury ready.\n\n7. I knew I could get 2 men at Brocket, I brought four more with me from Pincher Creek; The Jury were as follows:\n\nI.L. Montgomery - Pincher Creek - Foreman\nH.F. Fette - Pincher Creek\nD.J. McLean - Pincher Creek\nR.W. Cain - Pincher Creek\nRene Mongeon, Brocket\nT.W.V. Webb, Brockett.\n\n8. The Jury were sworn in at the Indian Agency then adjourned to the Sacred Heart R.C. School.

Today, these salaries are greatly diminished, by the arrangements of our Local Government; consequently, it is utterly impossible for us to continue the work, unless we receive from the Government a sufficient grant that will enable us to meet all expenses.\n\nWe therefore request that a grant of $100 (one hundred dollars) be given, per annum, for each child in attendance at the St. Albert Orphanage School. We desire also, that Reverend Sister Dillon be employed as assistant or secretary of the above mentioned school, at a salary currently allowed to such employes, the great amount of governmental correspondence requiring her a day's full time, enables her to this request as much of her time is taken up making out reports, answering inquiries, etc.\n\nPlease forward this immediately.\nImmediately to the Honorable Minis\nof the Interior, by so doing you will\nmuch oblige\n\nYour humble servant\n(signature) John Brassard\n\nSt Albert, Alta.\nMarch 9th, 1892\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, enclosing copy of a letter from the Rev.

Andrews\nSup't Genl. of Ind. Affairs\nrequirements upon which\nthe $100 grant is paid to\nother schools, viz., teaching\ntwo trades to boys in\naddition to farming and\ngardening and training the\ngirls in sewing, knitting,\ncooking & other useful\nindustries, along with\ngeneral housework, and\nthe retention of the\npupils at the institution\nin accordance with the\nDept's wishes, there\nwould seem to be no\nreason why the request\nshould not be complied\nwith, especially when\nit is remembered that\nno aid has been given\nthis institution for\nbuildings as well as\nothers. The Commissioner\nalso remarks that the\ninternal economy of the\nschool is all that can\nbe desired & is deserving\nmuch praise.\n\nIn this connection the undersigned begs to state that the present grant to this institution at $60 per pupil each amounts to $3600, and were it increased to a per capita allowance of $100, the amount would be $6000 per annum, or $2400 in excess of the aggregate sum now annually paid.\n\nThe Superintendent will remember in considering this matter, that there is at Morley a similar institution to which a like grant of $60 per capita is contributed, and the question arises whether, if the per capita grant is increased to $100 for the St. Albert School, the authorities of the\nMorley Institution will not claim a similar increase.\n\nThe undersigned would also remark that it is now probably too late to consider the question of including an amount to increase the per capita allowance to the St. Albert school in the supplementary Estimates for the present year, as all the items have already been considered & decided upon which are to be included in those estimates. There is no doubt, however, considerable force in what [the Commissioner states] in favor of the increased grant, provided the conditions referred to by him are fulfilled at the institution in consideration of the\nsaid increase; but probably it would be better to defer the matter until at least the next meeting of Parliament.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Date]\nIndian Commissioner\n\nFOR\nManitoba and the N.W.

Bishop Macdonald,\nIndustrial School,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, Nov 7th 1893\n\nAs you know this is a very creditable establishment but the reason they have not received the $100 per capita has been that they have not met the requirements of the Dept. by having at least two trades taught apart from carpentry. They are now receiving the allowance by grants to Boarding Schools such as Bishop's Boarding School etc. We have never queried any thing towards building as in other cases.\n\nO.C.

Sister Brassard\nIndustrial School\nSt Albert, Alta., N.W.T.\nI have the honor of acknowledging the receipt of your letter No. 97754 of the 13th inst., informing me of your intention to present to Parliament my request for an increased grant to the St. Albert Industrial School.\n\nShould the increased allowance be voted, you expect us to have at least a couple of instructors to teach trades.\n\nI shall be most happy to conform to this arrangement and while thanking you for the kind interest you manifest, allow me to assure you of my eagerness to comply with all your wishes.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour humble servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSt. Albert Industrial School\n\nNovember 27th, 1873.\nI have the honor to inform you that two women of the Reserve are each desirous to send a child to the Industrial School at St. Albert, having already 2 children at that school. The Sisters say they are willing to accept these two children but would like to be informed if the Department cannot allow a per capita allowance for an increase in the number of pupils, the Institution having already over 20 pupils for whom it receives its remuneration from the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nRegina\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo D.W. Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, 14 July 1894\n\nThere were 57 pupils on the last Return March Quarter:\n30 boys & 27 girls. The allowance last year provided for 50 pupils @ $72 each.\nPlan 50 are needed @ $60/00 - 60 -\n50 @ $600 = 3000 -\n50 x 72 = 3600\n$72/1400 - 19\u00bd The Grant\nfor the current year will provide for 19 more pupils than last year at same rate.\nThe best recommendation\n\nRegina\n\nSCHOOL BOARD\n\nSask. 16 TE 1894\n\nThis letter has been sent\n\nSir,\n\nI have today the honor of\n\na copy of a letter from Mr.\n\nof College, stating that\n\napplication has been made\n\nfor two additional rooms of\n\nschool for women of two children\n\nto the St. Albert's Industrial School\n\nand that the Sisters in charge of\n\nthe institution will also apply\n\nfor grant for an increased number\n\nof pupils, and in reply they say\n\nthat the last statement given\n\nwhich is that the number of\n\npupils as 57-50 of whom\n\nare receiving the present grant.\n\nMore money will be available\n\nfor this school next year if the\n\nSisters should like to do so. They\n\nmay take 15 more pupils\n\nmaking the total number allow\n\n65\n65 lots of the above lot at\nArrangement of four caps. Hope caps\nfront will be covered at\n$72.00\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the requisition forwarded by you for the June Quarter Rent to the St Albert Orphanage I beg to inform you that an amount for this school for the first three quarters of the year 1903-4 has been overdrawn to the extent of $19.40 which amount has been deducted from the earnings of the past Quarter-$19.40- leaving a balance of $899.60.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Assistant Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, S.W.T.\nFrom the above it will be seen that, while the Department has exceeded by $18.40 the year's grant of $36.00 for 50 pupils at $72 each, and has thus allowed $18.40 for a $12 grant for tuition of those over 50; it has now withdrawn $19.40 (or $7.60 plus $11.80) of the $20.60 similarly earned in the December and March quarters and at first allowed. The difference between the above $20.60 and $19.40 or $1.20 earned under the $12.00 grant has not been withdrawn, apparently for the reason that under the $72 grant there was a saving of this amount in the September quarter\u2014that is $900 less $898.80.\n\nIn view therefore of the fact that the Department has exceeded the fourth quarter's grant by $18.40 and has allowed that amount for the June quarter of 1894 and $1.20 for the December quarter of 1893 for tuition of those in excess of the 50 earners of the $72 grant, it is hoped that it will see its way to applying the same method to the December and March quarters, so as to repay the $19.40 now deducted from the $20.60 earned in those quarters under the $12.00 grant.\n\nIn this connection I would state that the Department's letter No. 101,370 of the 28th December 1893, paragraph 2, page 2, is understood to mean that tuition grants may thus be earned for any children in excess of those for whom a $72 grant is provided.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Commissioner\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Department's letter of 26th ultimo relative to the grants paid to the St Albert Boarding School for 1893-94, and to say in reply that any excess of $900 paid in each quarter was for a $12 grant for tuition of pupils in attendance over the number of 50 authorized earners of the Department's $72 annual capitation grant.\n\nThe amounts earned were as below:\n\n| Quarter       | Under $72 grant | Under $12 grant |\n|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| September 1893| $898.80         | nil.            |\n| December 1893 | $900.00         | $8.80           |\n| March 1894    | $900.00         | $11.80          |\n| June 1894     | $900.00         | $13.40          |\n| **Totals**    | **$3698.80**    | **$39.00**      |\n\nThe amounts paid by the Department were:\n\nFor September quarter 1893: $898.80\n\nDecember 1893 (since withdrew): $7.60\n\nMarch 1894 (since withdrew): $11.80\n\nJune 1894 ($918.40 less $19.40): $899.00\n\nTotal: $3618.40\n\nThe Deputy of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nEXAMINED\nSCHOOL BRANCH\n\nThe Ass't Superintendent\nRegina\nN. T. G.\n\nTHIS LETTER HAS BEEN SENT\n\nAugust 15th 1894\n\nSir,\n\nI have to add the rest of my letter off the 9th inst. relative to the funds paid to the Albert Boarding School during the past year. I regret very much that the request that I made for the $19.42 balance granted by this Institution. The full amount of the grant for the school is $300 being for 50 pupils at 70 per cent.\n\nIt was never intended that a tuition fee should be paid to pupils in excess of the number promised for at an earlier date of this class and although the tuition fee has been paid in the past, the practice will have to cease as the school grant will not bear such a charge.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Superintendent\nHas in the case of some boarding schools which are taking the place of day schools there may be a limited number of pupils.\n\nThat day pupils may not be permitted at boarding schools where Res. have all to settle and a small number boarding + where Res. are instead of day schools where Res. such as Muskegwayans Indians File Hills + not at Birtle St Albert & Edmonton Prince Albert\n\n(Sgd) D.C Scott\nfor All.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to certain items of information in the \"Remarks\" column of the St Albert Boarding School attendance Return, for June 1896 quarter under the heading of \"Answers to Circular of June 3th 1896\" and to say, that the circular referred to was not sent from, or through, this office.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nCommissioner.\n\nThe Deputy,\nof the Supt General,\nof Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, and also the return from the St Albert Boarding School for June quarter last; and in reply I beg to say that this is one of the returns which should have reached the Department earlier and I would like you to impress upon the school authorities the necessity for sending in such returns promptly, more especially at the end of the year when the appropriation is only available for a month or two at the most after the close of the fiscal year.\n\nIt is noticed that the Principal has written under the column for remarks, answers to the circular issued on the 5th June last to the Principals of Industrial and Boarding schools, a copy of which is enclosed herewith. This circular was prepared as a guide in preparing their annual reports. In this instance a copy of the Principal's remarks has been made, which will answer for the Annual Report.\n\nIn this connection I beg to enclose herewith a copy of the Inspector's report for the year 1893 on the Reformatory and Industrial schools of Great Britain from which it is thought\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\nthought many useful hints might be had by our Inspectors and Agents in the preparation of their school reports, and you are at liberty to detach a few of the detailed reports for their information and guidance. I should like you to return this report after you have read and noted its salient points.\n\nThe Department would be glad to receive the Principal's annual reports on the schools under their charge as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs:\nTranslation.\n\nSt. Paul des Oiseaux,\n15th March 1893.\n\nMr. A. Forget,\nIndian Commissioner,\n\nSir,\n\nI take the liberty to write to you these few words to ask you some assistance for next spring and summer. As you are aware I am established on the Half-Breed Reserve, I have taken a piece of land and propose to cultivate it this year.\n\nI have been a year in the employment of Rev. Father Therien and have earned one set of harnesses, one wagon, a plough, a mower and rake. I have a yoke of oxen which has been given me by the Government. Actually I am cutting and hauling logs for Rev. F. Therien which helps me to subsist, but I am anxious for next spring and summer. If I do not get any help, I will not be able to remain on my land and do the necessary work. I therefore take the liberty to ask for help in order to go along. I would be much obliged if I could get seed, flour, tea and sugar.\n\nMoreover I should like to have a couple of cows to be able to raise stock.\n\nYours... (sd) Pierre Dion.\n\nSt. Paul des Metis,\n(via Saddle Lake, Sask.)\n15th March 1893.\n\nA. Forget,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSome time ago I understood from you that the Department might possibly give something to pupils discharged from Industrial Schools in order that they be put in position to settle down. I have asked Pierre Dion to write to you in this connection.\n\nThe young man deserves that something be done for him by the Department towards helping him. He has courage and desires to make a decent home for himself. He has taken a piece of land but the trouble is that he is poor. If the Department could help him this year by giving him supplies so that he may wait for his crop, Mr. Subaid could easily see that what is given him is not wasted.\n\nYours.... J.A. Therien, Pte. O.M.\nOffice of the Indian Commissioner,\nNorth-West Territories,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to transmit translation of two letters lately received from the Rev. Father Therien and Pierre Dion of the Lacombe Halfbreed Reserve near Saddle Lake, which explain themselves. Pierre Dion, an ex-pupil of the St. Albert Orphanage, is the same one mentioned in Department's letter No. 116652-10, of the 20th of August 1894, who after having married one of the pupils of St. Albert was provided with some household equipment by the authorities there and also a yoke of oxen by the Department, one of which having died by accident was since replaced by another. The reports received from various sources are all in favour of the boy and I would recommend his being granted a couple of cows, the country there being well adapted to cattle raising. I am writing the Agent authorizing him to help the boy to a limited extent with rations during spring work, the same as we do with regard to other Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 21st April, 1896.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the pleasure of acknowledging receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, No. 76/49, in respect to Pierre Pien, an ex-pupil of the St. Albert Orphanage.\n\nIn view of the statement made by Pien himself and by the Rev. J. A. Th\u00e9rien, the department agrees with your recommendation that this young man be given two cows to start him in cattle-raising. The animals can be paid for out of the sum voted for stock for the Edmonton Agency this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. Moulton,\nSecretary.\n\nA. R.

Certain alterations and improvements may be necessary to bring the buildings at this school up to the required standard. An officer of the Department will inspect and report upon the improvements required at the school and a reasonable time will be allowed to have them carried out.\n\nThe Department learns with pleasure that the management has decided to utilize the dormitory in the new school building for the Indian girls attending the institution. This will entitle them, provided this agreement is completed, to the maximum grant of $125.00 per capita and payment will be made at that rate from the 1st of April, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRt.

My motive for transferring the charge of principal to this sister is, that my various occupations of Provincial Superior of ten institutions scattered over the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Mackenzie, make it impossible for me to give due time to the details of boarding school direct management. Reverend Sister M.A. Daguere has been local superior of St. Albert's Convent for some time past, and is, I can assure you, quite competent for the duties of principal.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMother M.A. Carroll,\nProvincial Superior.\nOttawa, March 25, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th inst., and in reply I beg to say that the explanation of the Principal of the St. Albert Boarding School in regard to the separation of Indian children from the White pupils in that institution is satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nHon.

Another reason is that the Provincial Programme of Studies is so varied and difficult that the Indians are somewhat of a drag on the others with unprofitable work for themselves.\n\nHowever, total separation does not take place, as the children are really together in recreation, in certain classes and most of the time except as above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSt. Mary's Rectory\n\nCalgary, Alberta\n\nTo the Secretary,\n\nDept. of the Interior\n\nOttawa.\n\nJuly 4th, 1911\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI acknowledge receipt of the two copies of agreement concerning the Native Boarding School at St. Albert. As I am away from home, it will take little time before these documents can be duly executed, but they will be returned to you as soon as possible.\n\nI believe there would have been better executed in the name of the Rev. Sisters themselves, as they are the owners of the property, yet I will consent to sign them, but ask that the signature of the Bishop be also, as a collateral guarantee.\n\nI suppose this will be even more satisfactory to the Dept.\n\nI have the honour to remain,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

It was this very attitude which resulted in the keeping of the Indian girl referred to at the School without having ascertained that she was in Treaty, and, therefore, strictly payable for by the Department. It seems to me that the Department should compensate the School at the regular rate, for the time the girl was in residence, and as if she had been formally admitted when she entered.\n\nIf the evidence of her being a Treaty Indian offered in the letter be not considered sufficient, I would suggest that communication be had in the matter with the Sister\nPrincipal, and the Indian Agent,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\nYouville Convent, St. Albert, Alberta,\nDecember 1, 1911.\n\nJ.

S.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nOne of our Indian pupils Mary Ann Delorme nine years of age, daughter of Pierre Delorme, and Mary Courteoiselle, died in our Institution on the fifteenth of November. This child has been under our care for four years, and in spite of our repeated inquiries during that time, we failed to find her parents' Treaty Number, so we kept her as an abandoned child.\n\nA few days previous to her death, her relatives, for the first time, wrote asking informations as to the child's health. On hearing of her decease, they will likely make earnest endeavors to obtain her Treaty.\n\nAllow me, dear Sir, through your kind and influential mediation, to solicit the Department to grant us an indemnification for having kept this child during four years, besides defraying her funeral expenses.\n\nI beg to thank you in anticipation for your kind\nfor, as well as, for the deep interest you take in our School\nand your appreciation of the work we are doing.\n\nMay God, who is the Author and source of all good, bless\nyou and your dear family, and grant you yet many years of health\nand happiness.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nDear Sir,\nVery Respectfully Yours,\nSister Diquiere, Principal.\nOttawa, January 11, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant forwarding a communication from the Principal of the St. Albert Boarding School, and in reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that it cannot indemnify the institution for the maintenance of Mary Ann Delorme, deceased, while a pupil of that school, as she was never admitted to the institution by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ.

A few days previous to his departure he was called to the school to attend to one of the pupils who was suffering from a severe attack of Tonsilitis. He advised us to send her to Edmonton to be operated upon as soon as the inflammation would subside. In the meantime he left for France in the meantime so the poor child is still suffering.\n\nMay I ask you to kindly appoint a Medical Attendant for our school as soon as possible. It is absolutely necessary that he be a resident in St. Albert for it is far too inconvenient to have him so far away.\n\nI have the honor to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, September 4th, 1914.\n\nSister M.

Brisault has been appointed to take her place.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the appointment of Sister Brisault as principal of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nGeorge H.

The circumstances of the case are as follows:\n\nFor some time the boy has been trying to get out of the school and his father has been worrying to have him discharged - anything I refused to do as the lad is only 12 years of age. It seems that the boy has been talking to his brother-in-law one Trottier who it is said burned the St. Paul de Metis school down - in fact he brags about it today - and this Trottier told the boy that if he wanted to get out of the school all he had to do was to burn it down as he Trottier did the St. Paul School. The boy - so the Sisters tell me - got some matches and was going to pour coal oil on the floor of one of the rooms and then light it. The plot was discovered fortunately before he had time to put it into effect.\n\nSo far I have taken no action save to have the boy carefully watched and kept from the other pupils and also I have spoken to the Archbishop Legal on the matter who suggests that the boy be sent to the Qu'Appelle school. In this I agree for the reason that it would be very difficult to prove in a court that the boy really did contemplate burning the school down and it would never do to let him go unreproved. To send him to the Dunbow school would be no use as he would run away from there and so defy us again.\n\nI therefore ask that authority be given for his transfer to the Qu'Appelle school at once.\nOttawa, January 26, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, in which you inform the Department that Sam Gallihoo, a pupil of the St. Albert Boarding School, made an attempt to burn the school buildings and request that authority be granted to transfer him to the Qu'Appelle Industrial School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department cannot consent to this boy being transferred to the Qu'Appelle School, where there would be the same danger of his making an attempt to also set fire to the buildings of that school.\n\nIt is considered that the most suitable place for this boy is in a reformatory and, if there is such an institution in the province of Alberta, you should take immediate steps to have the boy committed and the Department will pay the expenses of his maintenance while he is an inmate of the reformatory. You will be good enough to inform the Department of the action taken by you in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGeo. H. Ross, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nFebruary 2nd, 1917.\n\nMEMORANDUM -\n\nHon. Dr. Roche -\n\nWith reference to the attached communication from Mr. H. Le Landry, it was reported to me that this boy had made an attempt to fire the St. Albert Boarding School, and the authorities of the institution recommended his transfer to the Qu'Appelle Industrial School. This I did not agree to, but suggested that he might be sent to a reformatory.\n\nI think that as the school authorities are anxious to get rid of him he might be granted his discharge and sent home. I am taking this line of action today.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, February 2, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 18th ultimo and the Department's reply thereto of the 26th of that month regarding the case of Sam Callihoo, a pupil of the St. Albert Boarding School, who recently made an attempt to burn the school buildings, I beg to say that upon reconsideration of this matter it has been decided to have this boy sent home to his father, instead of placing him in a reformatory. You will, therefore, be good enough to see that he is sent home as soon as possible and the Principal of the school is being instructed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGeo. H. Race, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOttawa, February 2, 1927.\n\nMadam,\n\nThe Department has been informed by Mr. Agent Race regarding the case of Sam Callihoo, a pupil of the St. Albert Boarding School, who recently made an attempt to burn the school buildings. The Department has considered this case and has decided that this boy should be sent home to his father. You will, therefore, be good enough to grant him his discharge and see that he is placed in the care of his father as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. MOLAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister M. O. Briault,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Albert Boarding School,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nIn reply to above letter re the boy Sam Callihoo and his attempt to burn the St. Albert School, I beg to say that I made another visit to the school and made a more exhaustive enquiry into the matter and I find that although the boy Sam is really the guilty party and the prime mover in the scheme, there are some 13 other small boys implicated. Outside the evidence of these children there is no good direct evidence that could be utilized to commit the boy Sam without doing something to the other boys in punishment. It has therefore been decided that so far as bringing a case is concerned it would be better not to rather than to bring a case and have it dismissed as it most indubitably would be.\n\nIt is my intention to have the whole school present and in the presence of the Principal and Staff give them all a very serious talking to. I trust this will be sufficient and be with the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to above letter re the boy Sam Callihoo remaining in the school at At Albert, I beg to say that I am very, very sorry the Department have changed their views on this matter as I am afraid the sending of the boy home to his parents is the very thing he has been wanting to do; and without any punishment at all in any way will, I am afraid, be an incentive to others to do as he has done when they want to get out of the school and the results may then be more serious and disastrous. It is also to be feared that the school staff will lose authority with the other children and Agents also will have little influence with the parents if this boy is allowed home now. The children at the school are already under the impression that the boy was to go home as Sam's father had seen a lawyer in Edmonton who had told him that he would get Sam home in spite of the Sisters or the Agent.\n\nI earnestly hope the Department will again reconsider their decision.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nArchev\u00each\u00e9 d'Edmonton\n\nMr. Duncan Scott,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nSt. Albert \u2014 Le 13 Feb. 1917\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am shown a letter dated 8 February int. and signed by Mr. Scott concerning the boy Sam Callihoo, who had made some attempt on the 20th of Jan. last, to start a fire in the Indian Boarding School house at St. Albert and directing the Re. Mother of the institution to put the discovery of the boy out to remit him to his parents.\n\nI wonder how such conclusion has been reached. It must not be forgotten that this was precisely the object sought out by this boy and his accomplice; namely to have the place burnt down so that they could all be turned out and returned to their families, as it had happened after the burning down of the St. Paul de L\u00e9vis Boarding School. Therefore, in place of a sanction it would be really a gratification granted to the boy, and an incentive to the other pupils to do the like.\n\nI understand some lawyers at Edmonton have been interfering in this case. This is unfortunate. What do they know of the Indian temper and what instinct lies in their educational training?\n\nIt seems to me that the only sensible course to be taken would be, if not to take the boy immediately to the reformatory, at least to keep him, but to keep him in the school, under suspended sentence, and the intelligence that, on the first new offence, the sentence would be executed.\n\nHoping that this course will be sustained by the authority of this Department, I have the honour to remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYour very respectfully,\n\nEmile J. Pape,\nArchbishop of Edmonton.\nSt. Albert Boarding School.\nSt. Albert. Feb. 13, 1917\n\nHonorable Duncan G. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nI received your letter concerning the pupil, Sam Callihoo, who made an attempt to burn the School.\n\nPermit me to state that I have taken the liberty to retard the execution of your request, to send the boy home. Since the reason he had for wishing to burn the school was -- he wanted to go home. I think that by sending him home now, it would rather be encouraging his act. And any other pupils, having the desire to go home, will certainly try the same means.\n\nTherefore, I beg of you for the good of the School, not to insist upon discharging him at the present time; rather to leave them under the impression of what our Indian Agent, Mr. Race told them.\n\nPardon the liberty I have taken, and I beg a reply as soon as convenient.\n\nI have the honor to be.\n\nYour humble servant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

The principal informed me that she was very disappointed at not being allowed the grant for 40 more children as asked some time ago.\n\nThe discharged is asked for of Mary Smith No. 0362 who is married and her Brother Edward No. 363 who has not returned to the school and whose whereabout is not known.\n\nThe new brick building will probably be ready for occupation about the end of this month or the beginning of next.\n\nMr. Inspector Fyfe of the Provincial Education Department made an exhaustive inspection of the school a short time ago.

There was one case of small pox amongst the Indian children and about 40 cases of chicken pox. All cases have been isolated and patients all in a state of convalescence. Doctor Whitlaw the Health Officer of the Province in company with another doctor visited the school on the 13th inst and vaccinated all those who had not been vaccinated. Every precaution has been taken by the school authorities and I think it may be safely said that the worst is quite over.\n\nIn all other respects the school is being carried on as usual.

H. Race, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nRegina, December 7, 1920.\n\nTo W.M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nST. ALBERT SCHOOL, near Edmonton.\n\nHere we find 43 boys and 37 girls very healthy and well cared for in a new and thoroughly modern building and under a most competent administration. There are 290 pupils altogether in this school, of whom 80 to 85 are Indians. In looking over the Indian children carefully I did not discover any who should be sent home. In general health and appearance they are all fully up to the standard of good health. Though a number have enlarged glands of the neck there are none suppurating or ulcerating and I am satisfied the very efficient care they receive in this institution should meet all requirements, and I can cheerfully commend this school as being well equipped and well managed in every particular.\n\nIn conclusion I would again mention only to emphasize the desirability that all Indian schools be provided with wide balconies properly screened so that the children may be kept in the open air to sleep during as much of the year as is practicable, and all the better if it be throughout the whole year, after sanitarium methods, as in this way alone can the prevalence of tuberculosis disease among the Indians be reduced and the health of the bands be brought up to a desirable standard.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nF. A. Corbett, M.D.\nCommissioner's Office\nRegina, Sask., Dec. 9, 1920.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI was exceedingly pleased with what I saw at St. Albert School. This is truly a wonderful place. The school building, just completed, is without doubt the finest Indian Institution I was ever in, large, airy and well lighted. The beds and bedding could not be better. There was no crowding, and the food was good and wholesome. The children looked the picture of health, as the Doctor's report bears out.\n\nMostly everything in the way of food used in this Institution is produced on the premises. The wheat is ground into flour at the mill nearby; the beef, pork, eggs, milk and fruit used in the School are raised or grown on the home farm.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nCommissioner.\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 11, 1920.\n\nHonourable Sir James Lougheed,\n\nI beg to send herewith important reports from the Indian Commissioner and Doctor F. A. Corbett, of Regina.\n\nWhen I was in Regina last summer I had an interview with Doctor Corbett, and it was arranged that he should make these inspections. Doctor Corbett is greatly interested in the welfare of the Indians, and his report justifies the inspection.\n\nI regret extremely that it is possible to draw such a comparison between the Protestant and Roman Catholic schools. The Creesfoot, Quinaskin's and St. Albert schools are all conducted by the Roman Catholic Church, while the Old Sun's and Sarcee are conducted by the Church of England. The comparison does not hold good over the whole field, however, as we have excellent Protestant schools in other parts of the country. The Anglican schools in the diocese of Calgary have always unfortunately been badly managed.\n\nThe conditions at the Old Sun's school are disgraceful, and the principal and medical attendant are worthy of serious censure for allowing such health conditions to exist.\n\nAs you are personally aware of the general conditions at the James reserve, this additional information with reference to the school and the Indians there will be of special interest. If the best is to be saved at all we must take vigorous measures and I would propose to turn the school into a hospital and to treat the whole reserve as a hospital area. These Indians have a large reserve and more of it should be turned into cash as soon as possible and used for their benefit, and the funds we have on hand should be fully used.\n\nIt would be advantageous if Doctor Corbett could continue his inspections and visit all our reserves and schools, but as he has a large practice in Regina, I do not think we could expect him to spend the necessary time in making inspectorial visits.\n\nI should like to discuss these matters with you.\n\nDuncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSt. Albert Boarding School,\nDecember 12th, 1920.\n\nMr. W.M. Graham,\nRegina.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs you have just visited through our institution and seen the affairs as they are standing, which seemed to prove very satisfactory to you, we kindly ask you if there is any means in your power of helping us to receive the grant for one hundred pupils, instead of eighty. Our grant earning pupils are eighty only, but we always have over this number, so if you would kindly speak in our favor on this point, we will be very grateful to you, as you know our institution is large enough to admit the number of twenty more.\n\nA year ago we had an addition built to our school, which cost $800,000; you understand by this number, that we have a great debt before us, but we are willing to do anything for the comfort of our Indian children. For the past years, we always have had five or six children, exceeding the number, these you understand have to be clothed and fed, without any payment for them, as they were over the grant number, so if we could receive the grant for twenty more, which would make the hundred, we would be very glad, seeing we have the place for them. There is a number of children on the Reserves, who are the age to be admitted, if we could receive the grant for them.\n\nTrusting to receive a favorable answer from you, I am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(SGD) SISTER M.O. BRIAUT,\nPrincipal.\nSir,-\n\nI am enclosing copy of a letter which I received from the Rev. Sister in charge of the St. Albert Boarding School, in which she makes the request that they be allowed an additional twenty pupils at their school. You will notice that the Sister points out that there are children on the Reserves available; she also draws my attention to the fact that they have built a school costing in the neighborhood of $200,000, and that they have ample accommodation for the pupils. I am writing, I may say, to the Sister, telling her that the matter has been brought to your attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 28, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, enclosing a letter from the Principal of the St. Albert Boarding School in which he requests an increase in the pupilage of that school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, at the present time the Department allows grant for 80 pupils at the St. Albert Boarding School and there are no funds available to increase the pupilage at present. Provision, however, is being made in the estimates to be submitted to Parliament at its next session to increase the pupilage at this school to 90 pupils. If this increase is allowed, grant will be paid for 90 pupils from April 1, 1921.\n\nThe principal will be further advised in regard to this matter after the estimates have been considered by Parliament.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\nSt. Albert's Bdg. School,\nJan. 15th, 1921.\n\nMr. W.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are in receipt of your kind letter, and beg to inform you that we are very disappointed in seeing that the increase is for 90 pupils only, when 100 were asked for. Seeing that we have the accommodation for the hundred, and also the necessary conveniences required by the Department, and everything proves satisfactory when visited by our Inspectors, we do not see why we cannot obtain the number asked for, when we have the full accommodation for them. Hoping you will receive a favorable answer for us, I am\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(SGD) SISTER M.O. BRIAUT.\n\nPRINCIPAL.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your No.110-1-10 of the 23th ultimo, I beg to state that I communicated the contents to the Principal of the St. Albert's Boarding School, and beg to enclose herewith a copy of her letter of acknowledgement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDuncan Scott,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nMy Dear Mr. Scott,\n\nInspector Graham of Indian Affairs here desires that the classification of the St Albert Convent be raised to 100; they recently built a large addition and are well able to accommodate this number. I understand that your intention is to increase the classification to 80 but the inspector would like to see it increased to 100. May I therefore that the latter design be followed.\n\nI would also recommend that the Blue Quill school at Saddle Lake be raised in its classification from 45 to 60. I understand that this is the desire of the inspector.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nArchbishop of Edmonton.\n\nJan. 21st, 1921.\nOttawa, January 27, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant enclosing a copy of a communication which you received from Rev. Sister Briault, Principal of the St. Albert Boarding School, requesting that the number of grant earning pupils be further increased to provide for one hundred.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it will not be possible at the present time to increase our obligations without obtaining funds from Parliament. We are receiving a good many applications for increased pupilage at our residential schools and these are being noted and will be included in the Supplementary Estimates. It will, therefore, remain for Parliament at its next session to approve of the necessary funds being provided to further increase the pupilage in the cases requested at the residential schools.

Your Grace's request for increases in the pupilage at both these schools will receive consideration when the Supplementary Estimates for the next fiscal year are being prepared.\n\nWe are receiving a good many applications for increased pupilage at our residential schools and the appropriation for the present fiscal year will not stand the expenditure required in making these increases.

The children looked well, except perhaps a few of the boys who were rather pale. I drew the attention of one of the Sisters to this, as I thought the boys had not been getting enough fresh air.

Your request has been given thoughtful consideration, but I regret to inform you that the Department cannot alter its policy in this connection. All Indian residential schools are requested to supply qualified teachers in the classrooms and the salaries of such workers are in every case met from the per capita grant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Scott,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable Sir;\n\nPermit us to draw your attention to the salary for a diplomed teacher of Alberta, for our senior indian classroom. We wrote Mr. Ferrier in regard to this, being the superintendent of Indian Education; but, he being absent at the time, his letter was answered by another, and did not prove satisfactory to us. On seeing this, we thought it better to take up the matter with you at once, and explain clearly to you, that for us to take this salary of twelve hundred dollars per year ($1200.00) from the per capita grant as was mentioned in the reply received from Mr. Ferrier's letter, is impossible, as at the present time, we have a very heavy debt on our hands, coming from this new school, that we had erected solely for the comfort and progress of the indian pupils...\n\nHowever, Honorable Sir, we trust you will take this affair into consideration, as no doubt, this diplomed teacher, will prove more satisfactory to the pupils.\n\nRelying upon your generosity, hoping to receive a favorable answer from you before the school term opens.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSister Gosselin, prn.\nOttawa, Sept. 2, 1924.\n\nReverend and dear Sister:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th ultimo, with reference to the salary of the teacher in the senior room at the St. Albert Indian Residential School. I regret that it will be impossible to make an exception in the case of your institution. All Indian residential schools, whether Church or State owned, engage qualified teachers in the classrooms and meet their salaries from the per capita grant.\n\nI trust that the pavilions are completed and will be a source of much comfort to the Sisters and Indian pupils.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Sept. 18th, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nWhen I visited the St. Albert Boarding School nearly a year ago, Sister Weeks, who is a registered nurse, made a request that she be paid a salary, pointing out that the nurses at other schools and hospitals are paid. At the time I did not take any action, as I intended to look into the matter further, in fact it escaped my memory. This sister was in my office recently and she again brought the matter to my attention. It seems to me that this nurse is entitled to a salary, and I would recommend that she be paid at least what is paid to nurses occupying similar positions, viz.: $360.00 per year.\n\nA similar case exists at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, where we have 225 Indian children. I would recommend that Sister Reardon of that institution who is a trained nurse be paid a similar amount.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan J. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Sept. 29, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your No. 403-11 of the 18th instant, with reference to the provision of a salary for the nurse at the St. Albert Indian Residential School. All regular members of the staff at Indian residential schools are paid from per capita grant and I regret that favourable consideration cannot be given to your recommendation. Years ago one or two exceptions were made; but of late the Department has adhered to the general rule that the management must provide for a residential school such sufficient number of teachers, officers and employees as may be necessary for its satisfactory conduct.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, November 26, 1924.\n\nReverend and dear Sister:\n\nI wish to acknowledge, with thanks, the receipt of three fine pictures of the Indian children and pavilions at the St. Albert Indian Residential School. I trust that continued success is rewarding the efforts of yourself and those that are associated with you in the education of our wards.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Sister Gosselin,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nDear Mr. Giroux:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, enclosing a copy of a communication you have received from the Sister Superior of St. Albert Indian Residential School. The nature of this school and its splendid results are well known to the officials of the Department of Indian Affairs; but, because it is largely engaged in the education of children who are not wards of the Federal Government and whereas the property is entirely church owned, it is considered that capital expense, except under quite exceptional circumstances, should be met by the school authorities.\n\nThe Department recently was unable to give favorable response to a request for replacements to the buildings and for new equipment. As you are aware, expenditures of this nature are precluded unless Parliament has provided the necessary funds. Our willingness to assist this school, when possible, with grants for other than current expenses, is proven by the fact that during the past two years over $4,000 has been expended for buildings and furnishings. One of the recent requests was for expensive playground equipment which the Department does not supply to Indian residential schools. However, a substitution was made, and there was provided athletic equipment which is considered suitable for Indian children.\n\nRelative to the amount of the per capita grant, I wish to point out that the St. Albert institution ranks as a boarding school, and receives $165. Other schools in this category in Alberta receive as little as $140. The Edmonton Institution is an industrial one, and receives $170 per child, which is the amount of the grant for this class of school.\n\nI regret that there are no funds available at the present time to assist with the necessary improvements. If requests are placed before the Department, the consideration due them will be given when future estimates are being prepared.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.

I have explained that funds are not available at the present time, but that an effort could be made in a few months to secure an appropriation for the purpose. Please let me have a report and recommendation.\n\nSister Gosselin states that wrote the Department in March, last, in this connection. I am unable to find any trace of your letter.

To this letter I received an answer that no increase had been made in the grant.\n\nThe number of pupils at present on the roll is 93 which may be increased to over 100 at any time and the grant being only for 100 places the Sisters in the position that they have to feed, cloth, educate and care for so many for nothing.\n\nIf the Department would make the appropriation for 120 pupils the funds would be on hand to pay for the support of all pupils over 100.\n\nThere are a number of children growing up and will soon be of school age and these children will then be placed in the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nTh Secretary\n\nIndian Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 11, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, concerning the pupilage at the St. Albert Indian Residential School.

If we cannot recruit a number large enough to fill up the vacant places, this is not due to our negligence; as we have done and are always doing from day to day, what we can to take in the Indians and civilize them, to the best of our knowledge........\n\nAs this building has left a heavy debt on our shoulders, and the interests on this heavy amount eating up every cent we can spare leaves us at the present in a very critical condition..... This present year 1926, now on the spot, keeps us worrying from day to day, how we are to meet the heavy interests so near at hand.... Last year we had to have the building repaired throughout; and this owing to the work not done as it should have been by the labor hands... However, this work had to be paid for, and it amounted to fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00)\n\f\nFebruary 11, 1926.\n\nReverend and dear Sister Gosselin,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, asking for some financial assistance towards the capital expenditure at your school.\n\nI beg to assure you that there is no institution in which we take a greater interest, but it would hardly be possible for us to come to your assistance as you desire. I do not know how the misconception could have been formed to the effect that if there is a balance left unexpended of the school appropriation it might be used for this purpose. Such is not the case.

The children at this school receive most excellent care; they are well dressed, well fed, and present a healthy appearance. There are six classes here in this institution. Three of them are used by Indian children, and three by whites. A great deal of attention is given to the feeding of the children, and they certainly seem that they are well nourished. The dormitories were scrupulously clean. The washrooms are provided with individual basins, towels and tooth brushes. Each child has a number and each space is marked off. Everything was shining and there was no inspection parade, as my intention of visiting the school was not known beforehand. A great deal of attention is also given to the pleasure of the children. In the playroom I found all kinds of games, and the play yard is really a treat to see. This yard had no less than a dozen swings, a merry-go-round, tennis court and basketball apparatus, and the children are really happy and lively. I cannot say too much in favour of this school. They only made one small request, and that was that they be supplied with a few library books. If the Department will authorize this, I will send in a list of the books required.\n\nW. M.

They really could accommodate another hundred, as they could discontinue their white work altogether. In this event, we should be slow about re-building the Ermineskins Indian Residential School.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier\nDear Sir,\n\nWe wish to draw your attention to the condition of our children at school. We find that they are taking into our school at St. Albert many children other than those from the reserve and we consider this is determinative to our children's education.\n\nAlso that they are not teaching music which we want our children to learn. Would you please see that our rights are protected?\n\nYour Truly,\n\nChief Solomon Ballahoo\n\nPlease address Bullahoo P.O. Reserve.\nOttawa, May 22, 1929.\n\nMadam:\n\nThe Department is desirous of learning if the older girls at the St. Albert Indian Residential School are being trained in milking cows. As most of the graduates of your school will return to reserves that are largely farming communities, it is very important that the girls be fully competent in this particular. The Department expects that the older girls, under proper supervision, will be given a course of instruction in milking, and I shall be pleased to learn that suitable arrangements have been made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister Broux,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nAt the request of the Indians who are under your care, I was requested by them to refer to you how the pupils of the Indian school at St. Albert are treated. Through complaints of the children it seems that they are treated names of dogs, pigs etc., and moreover the sisters use them very roughly, as much as to use heavy sticks on them and striking them on the back. A short while ago a child through weakness of the kidneys was put to sleep in a cold bathtub, so as not to destroy the mattress, the child was mostly frozen as it was a very cold time of the year when the coincidence occurred. They do not approve of their children being treated so, and ask you to see into the matter at once. The superior of the school is French speaking and does not speak the English language, and therefore they say does not take for them only those of her nation, these being the white. She appears it seems to be a very rough woman in her manners and in her words and the children have acknowledged that they have no love for her. We citizens of Canada cannot see into it, how you can let things as this run on so long without taking means to stop it.\n\nA citizen of the Province of Alberta,\nCanada.\nDecember 26th, 1930.\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\nMinister of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Stewart,\n\nDuring your visit to St. Albert this fall, you expressed your willingness to give the Rev. Grey Sisters some financial assistance in their severe losses.\n\nWe realize that your policy of building and maintaining your own schools makes it difficult for you to do justice to the Sisters of St. Albert, either by bonuses or otherwise.\n\nHere the Rev. Grey Nuns, the pioneers in Indian and charitable work in the west, have built and maintained at their own expense an institution which represents several hundred thousand dollars.\n\nThere they are doing Indian work for the Government and because they have invested their own money and thereby saved the expense of building to the Department, they are penalized for it and cannot receive any compensation for their investment, risks and losses. Does that seem fair?\n\nWe know that no one is responsible for this. It is the result of circumstances. But we respectfully ask you, is that a justification for allowing present conditions to remain. Would it not be better and fairer to all parties concerned to have the Government offer to buy the St. Albert school from the Rev. Sisters and run it as it runs its other schools. The school would be a credit to the Government and it would be very convenient for the Department to have its Indian schools near Edmonton.\n\nWe therefore ask you dear Mr. Stewart to give the question of buying the school of St. Albert your earnest and early consideration and if you think favorably of it we shall convince the Sisters that you can only do justice to them in following the same policies for St. Albert as any place else. It may save your Department the expense of building a school at Robbema, by transferring the Indians to this institution.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd.) A. Jan, O.M.I.\nSt. Albert, Alta.\n\nP.S. Before writing this letter, I consulted M.M. Boudreau and Mr. Giroux.\nSuperintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\nCanada\n\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJanuary 9, 1930.\n\nDear Father Jan,\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo\nand note your suggestion that we purchase the St. Albert\nSchool from the Reverend Grey Nuns.\n\nOne of the difficulties in connection with\nthe use of this school exclusively for Indian purposes is its\nlocation. We will have a Roman Catholic school at St. Paul\nand I do not think it would be possible to get the children from\nRobbena Reserve so that, if we purchased the school, I doubt if\nwe could use it.\n\nI will ask the Deputy to survey the situation\nand report to me. In the meantime, if the Sisters are desirous of\nre-building the hog-pen, we will try to be of some assistance to them.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd.) Chas. Stewart.\n\nReverend A. Jan, O.M.I.,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nIn a letter, addressed by the Sister Superior at St. Albert, to the Honourable Mr. Stewart, it is stated that the work commenced in 1861. The present buildings were erected as follows:\n\n- 1920 - New main building - $180,000.\n- 1921 - Cesspool - 7,000.\n- 1927 - Implement shed - 1,300.\n- 1928 - Septic tank - 10,000.\n- Ice house - 2,100.\n- 1929 - Laundry - 10,000.\n- 1930 - Hog pen - 5,100.\n- Pump house - 500.\n\n(Of course, the Department has helped a little from time to time).\n\nThe Sisters state that the school buildings and farm lands, counting interest and taxes, represent an expenditure of about $400,000. There are 35 Sisters employed. During the last 9 years, they have been unable to pay anything on their debt.\nOttawa, January 28, 1930.\n\nDear Sister Proulx:\n\nI have your letter of recent date, with reference to the large capital expenditure which the Grey Nuns have undertaken in the past few years at the St. Albert Boarding School. If it were possible to centralize the Roman Catholic Indian educational work at St. Albert, there might be advantages to the scheme; but, before serious consideration can be given, the management of the Ermineskins Indian Residential School would have to cooperate by agreeing to close their doors. Further, it would be necessary to satisfy ourselves that a central school at St. Albert would have the good will of the Indian communities to be served.\n\nThe United Church Residential School at Edmonton was established by pre-arrangement. Old schools were abandoned and recruiting grounds were thrown open to the Edmonton management. In addition, the entire proceeds from the sale of the former boarding school at Red Deer were used for the new establishment.\n\nI am pleased to inform you that I am asking Parliament for a vote of $2,000, which can be allowed as a grant towards the cost of your new hog pen and pump house.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. Sister Proulx,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nSt. Albert, Alta., January 23/30.\n\nDear Mr. Stewart:\n\nI thank you for your letter of the 9th inst. and for the kind interest you are taking in our St. Albert school.\n\nAs the assistance you are so kindly willing to the Rev. Sisters to re-build the hog-pen destroyed by fire, I am glad to advise you that it is re-built (but not paid). They built a modern, serviceable one with water at hand. It has cost a little over \u00a35,000.00. It is not painted yet.\n\nI know that the contractor has not been fully paid so that the sisters will certainly appreciate any assistance you can give them.\n\nAs the suggested purchase of the St. Albert school to transform it into a central modern model school for the Indian Children, I note that you have instructed your Deputy Minister to survey the situation. How I wish St. Albert was nearer Ottawa. Half an hour conversation would clear up the situation and I am convinced that we could offer suggestions as to the splendid use that the Department could make of the school.\n\nI realize your fear concerning the filling up of the school but I am convinced that it can be easily filled first by keeping the children a little longer, second, by a more systematic recruiting and finally by bringing the overflow from Hobbs.\n\n1. At present our boys especially leave too young to benefit by the sacrifices made for them. If there was a model farm with a qualified farm instructor, they could be induced to remain until they are 15 and then they might have acquired some knowledge and above all \"taste\" for farming.\n\n2. At present all the recruiting done by the Sisters is done in one or two days.\n\n3. Part of the Hobbs school is getting old and will soon be unfit for the work. If at that time the Department has purchased the St. Albert school, it should be more difficult to send the Catholic children here than it is to send the Protestant children.\n\nIn this regard I may assure you of the hearty support and cooperation of the Oblate Fathers with your Agent.\n\nThe Hobbs Indians would not lose by getting out a little more.\n\nKnowing that you will do what you can if you believe that the Indian children will benefit by the scheme, as we believe they will,\n\nI am dear Mr. Stewart,\n\nYours very respectfully and gratefully,\n\n(Sgd.) A. Jan\nO.M.I.\n(COPY)\n\nMINISTER OF THE INTERIOR\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJanuary 25, 1930.\n\nDear Father Jan,\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant.\n\nI note that the Reverend Sisters have re-\nbuilt the hogpen. I will ask the Department of Indian\nAffairs to make a contribution towards the cost of this\nbuilding.\n\nI cannot say anything more about the pur-\nchase of the School. We are inquiring into the matter but\nI wish you to understand that I hold out very little hope for\nthis purchase\u2014for the reasons already stated to you.\n\nSo far as Hobbs is concerned, it is be-\nlieved that the Church authorities will have to take up with\nthe Indians otherwise in a very short time the Hobbs Band\nwill be demanding construction of the new school building\non the Reserve.\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.)

I beg to assure you that I have given this matter very careful and sympathetic attention. I covered this ground pretty fully in my letter to you of January 28th last and I do not think I can add anything to that letter.\n\nThe Department appreciates the work you are doing for Indian children but cannot go beyond the grants made to institutions of a similar character. Viewing all the circumstances of your case, I do not see how we can be of further assistance unless some arrangement can be made to secure a sufficient number of Indian children to fill your school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nReverend Sister Proulx,\nPrincipal, Indian Residential School,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE\n\nREGINA, SASK., March 31st, 1930.\n\nInspector Harrison's Report on Schools in the Edmonton Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nST. ALBERT R.C. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nI beg to report that I visited this school on February 5th, and made a complete inspection of the building and visited the classrooms. I have reported very fully on this building in previous reports. It is a very fine building and provides accommodation for 250 boarders. Space is reserved for 100 Indian children. There were 96 present on the day of my visit. It is managed by the Order of Grey Nuns, and there are usually about 35 Sisters in residence. I was informed by the Sister Superior that they would very gladly dispense with the white boarders and utilize their whole space for the accommodation of Indian children if they could get the required number. The school building is in excellent condition and is always kept immaculately clean. The children also presented a healthy and cleanly appearance.\n\nIn addition to the classroom work, the boys assist in the farm work and feeding of cattle, and they also do the milking. The girls are taught butter-making, bread-making, general domestic work, and sewing. I took up the question of giving the girls practice at milking cows and was told that they had made an attempt to have the girls milk the cows, but they found that the cows did not take kindly to them, and that they gave a better flow when milked by the same person regularly.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nST. ALBERT R.C. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nThis is a well known fact, but I suggested that they set aside a few of their inferior cows, if they had any, for the girls to practice on.\n\nFARM\n\nThere is a large farm operated in connection with this school. Last season 150 acres of wheat yielded an average of 17 bus. per acre; 100 acres of oats averaged 45 bus. per acre; 45 acres of barley averaged 40 bus. per acre, which is a very good out-turn for last season. They had 10 acres of potatoes which yielded 1,500 bushels. They also have a large vegetable garden. Their stock consists of 123 cattle, 19 horses, and at the present time they have 14 brood sows. They raise between two and three hundred hogs each year. The farm supplies the institution with their meat, milk, butter and vegetable requirements. The boys, as I said before, assist in the farm work. There are six hired men kept in the winter and seven during the summer months. The Farming Instructor appears to be a very capable man. He received an agricultural college training. He informs me that it is their intention to feed all the grain to live stock that they grow on the farm.\n\nThey sustained a severe loss on September 28th, last, when their pigery burnt down. In addition to losing the building, they lost 30 hogs, which were ready for the market, 5 which were almost ready, 5 sows, a pure-bred boar valued at $75.00, and several young pigs. The intention, I believe, is to build a new hog house, which they expect will cost $6,000.00, and the Superior said that she would be very grateful if the Department could see their way clear to assist them towards defraying the cost of this building.\n\nThe Sisters\nSt. Albert, Alberta,\nMay 7, 1930.\n\nHonorable Chas. Stewart,\nMinister of the Interior,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nWe are again appealing to you, Honorable Sir, for assistance of some kind, either financial or otherwise. As you had mentioned in your letter of March 25th, that you do not see how the Department could give any further assistance, unless making some arrangement to secure a sufficient number of Indian children to fill the school, by this, we beg to draw your attention to the Saddle Lake school, having heard that you were not fully decided to build, and were thinking of transferring the children to our school; if such is the case, this would help us out immensely, as we can fully accommodate the number with all the necessary conveniences. If the rumour is false, could you not, Honorable Sir, come to some decision, as to helping us out by a bonus for this year at least, as you no doubt can recall to your mind, that you had mentioned in your last visit to our school, that you thought the Department would consent to giving us a bonus, as they had never helped in any way towards the upkeep of the school, in the past.\n\nThe way we are standing today, we cannot see our way through to meet our expenses.\n\nMay we again, Honorable Sir, remind you of your letter of January 24th, concerning our new nursery, when you were to ask Parliament for a vote of $2000.00 as a grant towards the cost.\n\nBegging an early and favorable reply,\n\nI have the honor to be, Honorable Sir,\n\nYour humble servant,\n\n(Sgd.) Sister Proulx,\nprin.\nDear Sister Proulx,\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant. In reply, I may say that it is the intention to proceed with the construction of the Saddle Lake Indian School but action has been delayed on account of insufficient supply of water.\n\nAs for St. Albert school - we are making a canvass through the North in an endeavour to secure more pupils for your school. It is hoped that the number will be increased materially.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.) Chas Stewart.\n\nReverend Sister Proulx,\nPrincipal, St. Albert Boarding School,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nRegina, Sask., April 2nd, 1930.\n\nDear Mr Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith Inspector Murison's report of an inspection made at the St Albert and Edmonton Indian Residential schools.\n\nThe report on St. Albert is very satisfactory. I would recommend that the Department meet the request of the Sisters at this institution that a grant be given the Callihoo girl so that she may attend Normal school in September. I believe this is a case where further education would be of benefit.\n\nW. M. Graham.\nIndian Commissioner.\nSt. Albert, Alta., July 3 / 30 193\n\nMr. R. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Education\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nOn my return I told the Sisters about the two suggestions you had made to help them in their financial difficulties and your kind offer to help them in securing an increase in the number of pupils and in the grant for each pupil.\n\nNeedless to say that they were very pleased and are deeply grateful to you for this new mark of interest in their institution.\n\nMay I ask you if they must make the application in the regular way by applying to the Deputy Minister, making a formal request for these increases?\n\nI know that you will support their request even if it is for a grant higher than the other schools because you realize that they are working under a great disadvantage.\n\nEven if it can be said that they are responsible for it, it is truer to say that they are victims of their great desire of doing good to poor, underprivileged children.\n\nThey commenced their work long before there could be any expectation of any financial assistance.\n\nThey kept enlarging the institution without stopping that it would place them in a very difficult and disadvantageous position.\n\nYou realize also that they are saving the Department large sums of money since the Government has given grant, built schools, paid employees.\n\nThe Sisters tell me that as soon as they make the children work, the parents complain and want to take them away. Is there no regulation about it?\n\nCould not the Indian Parents be made to understand for instance that when the children have reached a certain grade and age, one half day should be given to manual labor?\n\nThanking you again,\n\nI am Dear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, July 8, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to the pupilage and the per capita grant at the St. Albert Indian Residential School. I will take the first opportunity of discussing this with the Deputy Superintendent General and will take a note for next year's Estimates in the matter.\n\nConcerning the last paragraph of your letter, I may say that the Department not only authorizes, but requests, that all Indian residential schools use the half-day system. The only exception is in the case of the younger children and those in the primary grades. We consider that the vocational training which is secured in one of the departments other than the classrooms is of equal, if not more, importance than the academic training of the youth of our wards. At all other Indian residential schools this is the practice, and the Rev. Sisters Superior should not hesitate to have the older children profitably engaged for half of each day. Parents who complain may be told that it is a regulation of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. A. Jan, O. M.

From time to time, there are increases and adjustments in connection with our grants to Indian Residential Schools. This school is close to the railroad and would normally receive $170, but as the property is church owned, it should receive a slightly larger grant, viz., $180, which is the amount paid to some of the schools farther north in Alberta.\n\nFor some time, I have been aware that the Reverend Sisters were having difficulty with their financing of the St. Albert Institution. It is a combined white and Indian school and I fear that, in the past, there was very little income on account of many of the white pupils. I have urged that more Indian children be taken in and I propose to increase the pupilage from 130 to 160 as from April 1st, next.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDecember 2, 1930.\n\nMr. Duncan G.

Bennett, K.C., LL.B., LL.D., P.C.,\nPrime Minister of Canada,\nOTTAWA.\nFARM\n\nThe larger boys assist with the farm work and in caring for the stock. They also do the milking.\n\nThe crops seeded last season included 20 ac wheat, 80 ac oats, 186 ac barley and 30 ac hay. They threshed 1000 bu of wheat, 3900 bu oats, 5100 bu barley all of good quality. Only about one half of the oat crop was threshed. The hay land produced about 60 tons of hay mostly timothy.\n\nThe garden produced an ample supply of potatoes and vegetables for their requirements including 2500 bu of potatoes of exceptionally fine quality, 60 bu of carrots and other vegetables in proportion.\n\nThey have 150 hens which is all that their hen house will accommodate. The Sister in charge stated that she would like to have double that number of hens but they could not afford to build the necessary accommodation as yet.\n\n30 brood sows are kept and they have at this time 94 other pigs a number of which are ready to be butchered.\n\nThey hope to raise 300 young pigs during the coming season. The raising of hogs provides a most important source of income and food supply for the institution.\n\nA very fine piggery has been built since my last visit at a cost of $5093.00. The Department assisted with the cost to the extent of $2000.00. It provides a feed house with two stories and a cellar. The size of this is 18'x 27'. Attached to this are two wings which provide 10 pens in each. This building is well ventilated, dry and comfortable. It is the most convenient hog house I have seen but I am of the opinion that it cost more than it should have done. I am of the opinion that this building could be duplicated for one half what it cost.\n\nThey have 139 cattle including two pure bred bulls and 46 milch cows. They milk between thirty and thirty five cows regularly throughout the year.\n\nTheir cow barn is old cramped and out of date having been built about twenty five years ago. A modern barn with plenty of room and air space as well as good drainage would add greatly to the comfort of the cows as well as promoting cleanliness in milking time.\n\nThe same remarks apply to the horse barn which has no drainage and is in a badly shaken condition. It would add to the appearance of this institution if the old outbuildings were torn down and replaced with buildings set farther away from the school in an orderly formation. They are now scattered all over the place and have anything but an attractive look.\nInspector Marison's Report on Schools Edmonton Agency\n\nDear Mr Graham,\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the two residential schools in the Edmonton Agency.\n\nSt Albert Residential School (Roman Catholic)\n\nThis school is under the management of the Grey Nuns with the Rev' Sister Proulx in charge as Superior. She has an adequate staff of Sisters including three teachers, a seamstress, cook and boys and girls supervisors.\n\nThe heating, lighting and laundry equipment is in charge of a competent engineer and the farm and general outside work is in charge of Mr Fontaine who is a graduate of an Agricultural College.\n\nSchool Building\n\nThe main building has three storeys and a basement. It is a spacious brick building with high ceilings, good ventilation and is provided with easy accessible fire escapes on each floor. Fire protection is provided by means of stand pipes with hose connections on each floor as well as chemical fire extinguishers which are conveniently placed.\n\nI examined this equipment and found it in good condition. The pupils have been given two lessons in fire drill by a fire inspector from Edmonton and I was informed that they will be given regular fire drill practice from now on.\n\nAn ample supply of good soft water is obtained from a well under the building at a depth of 157 feet. The pump is operated by a steam engine and they have no difficulty in keeping up the supply and pressure.\n\nI made a complete inspection of the whole building and found it well kept throughout. The dormitories provide ample air space and are provided with comfortable beds with homemade wool mattresses and are provided with an ample supply of bed clothes.\n\nThere are three bright class rooms with a teacher for each. 104 Indian pupils are enrolled; 46 boys and 57 girls.\n\nThe teacher in the senior room holds a 2nd class certificate for the Province of Alberta. The teachers in the intermediate and junior rooms have not had Normal school training. I find that the children are making good progress in acquiring a knowledge of the English language.\n\nThe girls assist in the kitchen and in the general housework of the institution and are given instruction in cooking, baking, the making of butter etc; practically all the clothing for both the boys and the girls is made by the girls under the supervision of an experienced seamstress. They are also taught knitting. The provision of wool balaclava caps was much appreciated. These are unravelled and the wool is utilized in making stockings. They have a knitting machine of an obsolete type which they purchased 45 years ago and they now find it impossible to get repairs for it.\n\nThe seamstress expressed a wish that a new machine be provided. I would be glad to see her get it as I think that the work which she is doing deserves encouragement.\n\nRooms have been assigned and equipped as an infirmary for the sick. It was noted that only common kitchen chairs were provided and the Sister in charge expressed a wish that a Morris chair be supplied.\n\nThe health of the pupils is very good at present and they presented a clean and well nourished appearance. Plenty of milk is supplied and wholesome meals provided.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina - Sask;\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., Feb. 13th, 1931\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report of an inspection made at the schools in the Edmonton Agency by Mr. Murison.\n\nThe situation at both the St. Albert and the Edmonton Residential Schools seems to be quite satisfactory, and the equipment is reported to be in good condition. The training that the children are receiving seems to be carried on in accordance with the Department's regulations, excepting that the milking is done by the boys, which, of course, is absolutely wrong. There has been a good deal said on this subject recently. We are trying to assist in the building up of the health of the Indians by making the girls who attend our boarding schools competent to carry on and care for their homes in a proper manner when they return to their reserves, and if they know little or nothing about milking they are going back under a great handicap, because any milking of cows that is done on an Indian reserve is done by the women, and for this reason I think the Department should insist on the milking at all schools being done by the girls.\n\nI note that the seamstress at the St. Albert School expressed a wish to be supplied with a new sewing machine. I do not know why the school should not supply this themselves. My understanding was that such equipment was to be kept up by the school.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n(Signed) W.M. Gordon\nIndian Affairs\nFebruary 19, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 403-11 of the 13th instant, enclosing Mr. Inspector Murison's report on the St. Albert and Edmonton Indian Residential Schools. This is being given attention by the proper officers. I note your remarks regarding milking at our institutions. I cannot agree that the girls should do the milking as a regular practice. I believe that they should be trained to milk and that such training should be once a week during the summer time, under proper supervision. I understand that only three or four lessons with practice teach one how to milk, and, if the older girls have weekly instruction for three or four months each year, they should be properly equipped in this respect for life on the reserve.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nJuly 13th, 1931.\n\nMadam,\n\nI desire to inform you that the Department has provided in the current year's estimates for a pupilage of 160 at the St. Albert Indian Residential School. It has also been arranged to pay per capita grant at the rate of $180. Both these increases will date from April 1st, 1931.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev.

Scott,\nDeputy Supt. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nPermit us to draw your attention to a rumour that is spreading around here, and which has caused us great anxiety.\n\nWithout a moment's hesitation, we decided to appeal to our Kind Doctor Scott, as this decision of the Dept. of Indian Affairs, if true, places our school on a very serious standpoint.\n\nWe know, Honorable Sir, that you fully understand the financial conditions we are up against, and moreover, the school being our own property, makes it more serious for us, as we have to meet all expenses whatsoever. At present, with the grant that we are now receiving, we have all we can do to make the both ends meet, so what will it be if the Department decides in making a decrease.\n\nBegging you, honorable sir, to have the Dept. take this matter into consideration, and kindly asking your generous assistance in this serious situation.\n\nI have the honor to be, Kind Sir,\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nSister Superintendent, Priv.\nMarch 26, 1932.\n\nDear Sister Surprenant:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to a reduction in the per capita grants to be paid to Indian residential schools. It has been found necessary to make a decrease of 10% for the coming fiscal year. Mr. Ferrier is sending out a circular letter in this connection. I know that this will make it difficult to finance in the case of the St. Albert School, but I regret that no other course is open to the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. Sister M.A. Surprenant,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI have been requested by the Michel Band to place before the Department a request which they made to me while paying Treaty on their reserve;\u2014the Band have asked for the Department to place a day school on their reserve, when questioned why they wanted a school built on their reserve I was informed that all members are very dissatisfied with the treatment of their children at the St. Albert Boarding School. I questioned them regarding this and was informed that very few of the Teachers could speak English and that instead of the children being taught in the Class room they were made work and that all their children were very backward in their studies.\n\nI am informed that the Band are willing to have the cost of the school house paid for out of their Band Funds, and that they will do the work themselves, they claim that at the present time the Grant paid by the Department would more than pay a Teachers Salary.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.C. Laight,\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 20, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, relative to the request of the members of the Michel Band to have a day school established on their Reserve, as they do not wish to send their children to the St. Albert Indian Residential School. The reasons stated for this request, viz., that few of the teachers speak English and that the children are over worked and backward in their studies, have been noted.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Provincial School Inspector, in a report on his inspection of the school in November, last, states as follows regarding the classroom activities and general conditions at the school:\n\n\"Sister Perreault is kind and genial and wins the confidence of her pupils. She is conscientious and diligent and uses fair methods. The discipline is good and the pupils are kept well employed. Sister Comeau - a good voice and uses good English. She is clear and definite in her statements and her questioning is good. Sister Champagne is a qualified teacher and is a strenuous worker and a competent teacher. She is doing conscientious and thorough teaching. ....... The children are neatly and comfortably dressed and act and look as if they are well nourished. The whole of the school apartments and classrooms are scrupulously neat and clean. The relations between teachers and pupils are very pleasant.\"\n\nIt would appear from the Inspector's report that the Indians of the Michel Band have very little cause for complaint. The Department has no funds to establish a day school, and we will be unable to give consideration to the request of the members of the Michel Band. The Department is not prepared to take the expenditure required for this purpose from the funds at the credit of the Band.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Laight, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nEXTRACT from Inspector Christianson's Report, dated March 9th, 1933, regarding his inspection of the St. Albert Indian Residential School.\n\nOriginal on File 110-1-6.\n\nAt the present time, the school is having a very difficult time. A few years ago they had 175 White children and around 90 Indian children, whereas at this time, as I mentioned above, they have 100 Indian children and only 35 White children, and the parents of some of the White children that are attending now are unable to pay for the keep of the children. Therefore, practically the only money that is coming in is the Indian Department Grant. The Sister Superior in charge is naturally very anxious to get some more Indian children, but I do not see where they would come from, as the only place they have of recruiting is the Edmonton Agency. Blue Quills School takes care of all the Roman Catholic children in the Saddle Lake Agency, and as some of the Indians in the Edmonton Agency are Protestant, their children attend the Edmonton School. There are some surplus children at the Hobbema Agency, I believe, but Father Moulin, Principal of the Hobbema School, is not very sympathetic towards sending children to St. Albert's. I am merely mentioning this, as no doubt application will be made in due course to the Department by the Church authorities, for the recruiting of more Indian children for this school.\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to inform you that on my way to the Lesser Slave Agency two weeks ago I had over half a day to spend in Edmonton, so I took this opportunity to inspect the St. Albert School. As our Department do not own the building or equipment there is very little to report.\n\nI found 105 Indian children in residence there and they presented a very healthy and well-kept appearance. This institution lacks children, as originally it was built to accommodate both White and Indian children and at the time of my inspection there were only 20 White children in attendance. Naturally the Sisters in charge are anxious to get more Indian children, but as I told them at the time, I could not see where recruiting could be done for this institution at the present time.\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nThe girls at this institution, as I have reported before, get an excellent training in household science. There is a large farm operated in connection with the school and the boys do a certain amount of work on this, but in my opinion do not get as thorough a training as the girls receive.\n\nI checked over the clothing, &c., and found everything in very satisfactory condition.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

I am informed by the Sister Superior that there was one occasion when the cake that was made for the children was a failure but it was fit to eat; the Sister Superior is of the opinion that it must have been a piece of this cake that was sent to the Department; the Sister Superior also informs me that they have never given the children sour potatoes to eat. I wish to state that I have been at the school several times at meal times and have inspected the food and have never found anything wrong and have always considered that the children have been well fed at this school.\n\nRegarding Callihoo's statement that he took his children away, this is not correct; he has one boy which went into the school after the holidays and the boy is still at the school and has never been taken away. Callihoo did take this boy (the only child) to the Edmonton Residential School and left him for two or three days and then took him away and put him in the St. Albert Residential School; I have asked the Sister Superior to forward this boy's application to me at the earliest possible date.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.C.

On November 16th, at the request of the Chief and Councillor of the Michel Band, I met several of the parents of children attending this school for the purpose of investigating the complaints; we met at the St. Albert School and the meeting was attended by the Rev. Sister Superior, Principal of the School. The following complaints were made.\n\nAlex Callihoo complained that the Sisters spoke French to the children and that the children could not understand and were then punished because they did not do what they were told. The Rev. Sister Superior stated that this was not correct as it was very seldom that any of the children were addressed in French, but that the Sisters when alone did converse with each other in French. He also stated that the children were not taught what they wanted to learn; I explained to him that the children were taught the regular studies as laid down by the Department and that it would be impossible for every child to be taught just what he fancied.\n\nMrs Courterille complained that the children were not allowed to go to the toilet after they had gone to bed. At my request the Sister in charge of the girls' dormitory was brought to the room and I asked her if the children were allowed to go to the lavatory during the night after they had retired, she stated that at no time during the night or day were the children refused this permission. Mrs Courterille then asked that her two girls be brought in and questioned, this was done. Both girls were questioned and stated that on more than one occasion one or the other had got out of bed for the purpose of going to the toilet and before they could get to the door the Sister had asked them where they were going and when told had ordered them back to bed. The Sister denied this and also the Rev. Sister Superior stated that such a thing had never happened in the school to her knowledge. I then dismissed the two girls and after they had left the room several of the parents who were present stated that the children were all afraid to speak as they would get a whipping after I had left the school. Mrs Courterille also complained that the fish served to the children had sugar sprinkled on it and the children could not eat it, the Sister in charge of the girls' dining room stated that if there was sugar on the fish at any time it must have been spilt out of the sugar basin accidently by some of the children.\n\nM. Christiansen, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate,\nCalgary, Alta.\nMrs Sam Callihoo complained that the Sisters in the big boys' room did not speak any English and that the boys were punished because they did not do what they were told, she states that this is not fair as the children do not understand French. The Rev. Sister Superior stated that the Sister in charge of this room was not Sisters sent to her by the Rev. Mother Superior and was allotted by the Rev. Mother Superior to this particular position, but stated that she would endeavour to have a Sister placed in this room who spoke English. Mrs Callihoo also complained that there was too much Religious teaching at the school and that the children had one hour prayers before school and that they were at prayers three and four times a day, she asked that more time be given to the regular educational studies.\n\nLeo Breland complained that the children did not receive sufficient food and also complained regarding too much Religious teaching.\n\nSimon Breland complained regarding the food served to the children and stated that they did not always get enough to eat and that on some occasions they had been given sour potatoes to eat; he also complained that the children were whipped too much. He stated that one boy had been whipped until his hands bled. I made inquiries into this case, the Rev. Sister Superior informed me that when this boy was being whipped on the seat that he had put his hand back behind him and the strap caught him on the hand sideways.\n\nI have also received several complaints of a similar nature from the other Bands but chiefly about the food, thinking there must be some truth regarding the food served at the school. I made a surprise visit to the school at the noon hour yesterday, I went through all the dining rooms both girls' and boys' while they were at dinner and inspected the food. The children were having for their dinner, soup, shepherd's pie, this being made with the potatoes cooked on top of the meat, tapioca pudding, bread and butter and tea, there was plenty of food in each dining room and was well served by a Sister in each room. I tasted the meat pie and it was very good. I questioned all the children in each room and asked them if they were getting enough to eat every day and if the food was good, in each case the children all replied \"yes\".\n\nAfter dinner the big boys asked if they could see me their request was brought to me by their master, I then went back to the boys' room and was informed by three of the big boys that they were called every morning between 4:30 A.M. and 4:45 A.M. to get up to go out to milk the cows, they stated that they did not mind the milking but they thought it was too early to be called up out of bed every morning. The Rev. Sister Superior who was present at the time, stated that this was not correct as she had given instructions a year ago that the boys were not to be called until 6 A.M. to get up to milk. I again questioned the boys and they insisted that this was the time they were called, they also asked that they be given turns to do the different work and not kept at one job for three or four months at a time, after the boys had left I went with the Rev. Sister Superior to the hired men's quarters and interviewed one of the men who assists with the milking; I asked him what time they started to milk in the mornings, he stated that they commenced to milk at 5 A.M. every morning; he also stated that the boys arrived at the barn about the time they had one cow nearly milked.\nthe boys being a little late as they were given coffee and toast before they went to the barn. In my opinion 4:30 A.M. is too early for these young boys to be called up out of bed every morning and I have asked the Rev. Sister Superior if she will arrange for the boys who are milking to be called at 5:45 A.M. instead of 4:30 A.M. so that the boys can get to the barn by 6 A.M., even this is early for these young lads.\n\nThere is no question in my mind that there is a certain amount of truth in the complaints made by the parents regarding the treatment of the children, but just at the moment I am unable to locate just where the trouble is; however, there has been some changes made at the school since the summer holidays, the boys have a new master, there is a new cook and a new Sister in charge of the big girls. I am of the opinion that the Rev. Sister Superior became aware that something was wrong and removed those who were responsible for the trouble. I think that with these changes that the children will be treated better and we will not have so many complaints in the future.\n\nIn conclusion Sir, I do not think the matter is serious enough for you to make a special trip to Edmonton to investigate these complaints, but I would ask that on your next visit to Edmonton that you would spare the time to go to the school with me to interview the Rev. Sister Superior regarding the complaints.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.C. Laight,\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith copy of a report from Mr. G. C. Laight, the Indian Agent at Edmonton in connection with complaints he has had about St. Albert R. C. School at St. Albert, Alta. I met Mr. Laight in Edmonton a couple of weeks ago on my way to Saddle Lake, and he discussed this matter thoroughly with me, when I advised him to go into it very thoroughly with the Sister Superior, stating that if necessary I would come back to Edmonton and look into the matter further.\n\nYou will note from the Agent's report that everything has been done to investigate the complaints, and I do not anticipate any further trouble in this regard, and more than likely if things were not right, this was because there were new sisters on the staff. I must say that in the past I have found everything very satisfactory at this institution and have had no complaints.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, December 7th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nInspector Christianson has forwarded to the Department, a copy of your letter to him of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the action taken by you in connection with complaints received regarding the treatment of the children attending the St. Albert Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is considered that the action you have taken should result in improving certain conditions that exist at the school. It would be advisable, however, for you to visit this school more or less frequently during the next few months, in order to assure yourself that the instructions you have given are being carried out.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

To avoid further confusion, I hereby apply for a change in the name of our school.\n\nThe old part of the institution, namely the Staff's quarters, has been known since 1859 as the Youville Convent.

C. Laight,\nEdmonton Indian Agency,\nWinterburn, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRE: LOTTIE BRELAND.\n\nI wish to submit the following information regarding the accident which happened to Lottie Breland in December 1938.\n\nIt was on Monday morning, December 12, around 8 o'clock, that Lottie was sent with another young girl, Louise Ward, to help the laundress, Sister Xaverine, to pass the clothes through the mangle.\n\nAfter assigning each girl her task, Louise feeding the mangle and Lottie receiving the dried clothes at the table of the mangle, the Sister went some ten feet behind them to prepare the indigo for the day's washing.\n\nNo more than ten minute had elapsed when the Sister heard a little cry upon which she turned towards the mangle but, very quiet and calm, neither of the girls called her. However she had scarcely turned her back again when she heard a scream. Instinctively she ran to the mangle, seized the lever, stopped the machine and loosened the rollers. This was the work of a second. Immediately she called the engineer, Mr. J. W. Meloche, from the adjoining room, who was already on his way to the laundry having been roused by the girl's scream. He at once turned back the mangle in the opposite direction and the hand was freed.\n\nThe laundress brought Lottie directly to the dispensary where Sister Quenneville, R.N., gave her the first treatments while Dr. R. Fairier was called by phone. When the girl reached the dispensary her right\nhand was flattened and white but not otherwise deformed. A very thick picric ointment dressing was applied until the arrival of the Doctor some twenty minutes later. The hand was then uncovered; the fingers were examined; they showed no sign of fracture and moved naturally and without great pain. The dressing was made over, the fingers being wrapped separately.\n\nOn the Doctor's advice, your authorization, Mr. Laight, was asked to transfer the patient to the General Hospital; and according to your instructions, she was taken there at once.\n\nSuch are the details relating to Lettie Breland's case which I respectfully submit.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSister V.M. Corriveau, principal.\n\nSD\nAugust 8th, 1939.\n\nMr. G.C. Laight,\nWinterburn, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:- Re: Lottie Breland\n\nThis girl met with an accident December 12th, 1938. It appears that she caught her hand in a mangle. Her hand was badly burnt and as a result she will probably not be able to do very much work with this hand for the rest of her life. Her hand is all healed up from the burn but her fingers are stiff and contracted as well as the whole hand too. In fact it is questionable in my mind at the present time if some or all of her fingers should be removed some time in the near future.\n\nIt is some months since I have seen this girl and if you would like a more vivid description of her hand I will send for her to come to my office.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.H. Conroy M.D.\n\nJHC/BC\nMACKIE & HART\nBarristers and Solicitors\n109 Commercial Building,\n10120 Jasper Ave.\n\nEdmonton, Alberta,\nJuly 12th, 1939.\n\nSt. Albert Convent,\nSt. Albert, Alberta.\n\nDear Sisters:\n\nRe: Lottie Breland, by her father Leon Breland\n\nLottie Breland, around about Christmas, 1938, was put to work in the ironing department of your Institution by Sister Hoode.\n\nWhilst alone operating a mangle, her hand was caught therein and every bone broken and otherwise burned. She is deformed for life and shall not be able to use that hand at any time. It is, in fact, likely to cause her further trouble, since she has no control over the fingers thereof. The Doctor has suggested amputation of the whole hand. That possibly might make it better for her since an artificial hand could be used to some advantage, whereas it is her hand can not be used without pain and danger of being subjected to further injury.\n\nThe child was at your Convent for tuition and on the assumption that it is reasonable to put a child to work in your institution, your duty is to give careful supervision and see that no harm comes to any child, even though she may be only an indian child.\n\nA settlement of this matter will avoid the issuance of an action in damages against your institution, which we shall take as soon as vacation of the Court is over, by September. I hope in the meantime you will see that your own solicitors get in touch with me so as to effect settlement and avoid unnecessary costs.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. A. MACKIE, K.C.\n\nPer\nSir:\n\nPlease find enclosed copy of letter addressed to the Rev. Sister Superior, Youville Indian School from Messrs Mackie and Hart, Barristers and Solicitors, Edmonton, in connection with an accident at the Youville School last December when Lottie Breland No. III Michel Band had her hand caught in the electric mangle while working in the laundry at the school, her hand was badly crushed and she was sent to hospital in Edmonton.\n\nUpon receipt of this letter I at once asked the Rev. Sister Superior and Doctor Conroy for a report on the case, copies of their report are also enclosed herewith. The delay in forwarding this report is due to the fact that I did not receive Doctor Conroy's report until the 11th instant although I asked him for it on the 26th, 1939.\n\nWill you please advise me what action to take if any in this matter.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Laight,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMackie & Hart\nBarristers and Solicitors\n109 Commercial Building\n10120 Jasper Avenue\nEdmonton, Alberta\n\nSeptember 18th, 1939\n\nTo the Commissioner of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe - St. Albert Convent\n\nThe Indian children of Winterburn Reserve are compelled to attend the above named convent. It appears that the children are given one-half day's work and one-half day's manual labour or technical work.\n\nSeveral of the Indian families are desirous to know what are the regulations of that Convent regarding Indian children. Has a Convent any right, in other words, to teach the child one-half day according to curriculum and the balance of the day to put the child to work at whatever work he or she may be directed within the Convent walls?\n\nIf there are any regulations please let me have them and oblige. In any case the courtesy of a reply if you please.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. A. MACKIE, K. C.\n\nHAM/M Per\nOttawa, September 25, 1939.\n\nRe: Children in attendance at St. Albert Convent\n\nDear Mr. Mackie:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of September 18, in which you seek information with respect to the Indian pupils enrolled at the above institution.\n\nThe education of Indian children and the responsibility of the Government therefor is covered in a general way in section 10 - subsections 1 and 2 - of the Indian Act.\n\nThere are at this date 16,297 children enrolled at Indian day and residential schools throughout the Dominion. Of these, 9,040 are enrolled at Indian residential schools. At these residential schools the provincial curriculum, with certain modifications, has been adopted in each case. It has always been the policy of the Department to make provision at these schools whereby approximately half of the day is spent in regular classroom work and half in what one might term vocational or semi-vocational instruction: elementary agriculture, milking, the care of live stock, the cultivation of gardens, etc., in the case of boys, and in the case of girls, elementary domestic science, dressmaking, crochet work, fruit canning and preserving, cooking -\n\nH. A. Mackie, Esq., K.C.,\nBarrister,\n109 Commercial Building,\n10120 Jasper Avenue,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\ncooking, etc. The officials of the Training Division inform me that there is a constant demand from Indian parents for an extension of vocational instruction and still further curtailment of academic studies. It is my personal opinion that the present program is reasonably well balanced and adapted to the peculiar needs of the Indian pupil. Experience in this and other countries has taught educationists that it would be very unwise to take the average Indian pupil from life as it is lived on the reserve and confine him for lengthy periods during each day in the ordinary classroom.\n\nOur Indian residential schools are inspected regularly by the provincial inspectors, who send forward their reports to the Department. The public school inspector, in his last report on the St. Albert school, states:\n\n\"Carefully planned lessons, with a good wealth of illustration, are provided at this school. Sound methods of instruction are very much in evidence. Grades 5, 6 and 7 receive classroom instruction during half of the teaching day on an alternate basis. The remainder of the pupils enrolled are taught during the whole of the day. The pupils are tidy in dress and appearance, well behaved and appear to be very happy in their school environment. Their application to study is well sustained. I am fully convinced that the classes know much more than they show to the supervising inspector under direct questioning. Very good exhibits of art work and writing were observed.\"\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nYouville Indian Residential School,\nSt. Albert, Alberta,\nAugust 9, 1940.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Department,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of January 9, 1940, in which allusion is made to the improvement of our teaching staff as recommended by Inspector Scott's last report, I venture to state that a copy of such report would be very useful to me at a time when I am contemplating the possible improvements in our classrooms for the opening of the scholastic year.\n\nConsequently I take the liberty of requesting a copy of the above mentioned report at your earliest convenience, if such is possible.\n\nThanking you for the favor, I remain, Sir,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nSister V.M. Corriveau,\nSister V.M. Corriveau, principal.\nSummary of Inspector Scott's report on Youville Indian Residential School, November 22, 1930.\n\nIntensive reading and language training appears essential in this school. In lesson preparation the encouragement of oral response should be a definite aim. The preparation of any materials that will tend to encourage spontaneous oral response will serve good purpose. Written work required exacting checking and follow-up discussions, and as far as possible a spirit of self criticism should be developed.\n\nIn junior grade reading teaching methods should aim for improved recognition span and better phrasing. The voice tone should improve throughout.\n\nThe classroom libraries are fairly good and accordingly some further effort may be made to encourage pupil research and oral reports in Social studies, Science and Health.\n\nTraining in the fundamental processes in Arithmetic was satisfactory.\n\nThere are many pupils who are age-retards for reasons which may be uncontrollable. Especially is this noticeable in grades 4 and 5. Approved remedial exercises should be planned to assist these pupils with their difficulties that they may progress reasonably before they become of age to leave the school.\n\nGrades 6, 7 and 8 and the larger pupils in grades 4 and 5 receive academic training for a half day only each day. The other half day is utilized in the case of the boys for farm training and a certain limited amount of woodwork training. The girls are taught to sew or to keep house through kitchen and household duties. As result the academic training in these grades is based in the skill subjects largely.\n\nSewing for -\nSewing for the girls receives considerable attention. The room for manual training for the boys is too small and is poorly equipped. A better equipped room with some skilled instruction in woodwork, metal work and simple electrical work should prove beneficial for the boys.\n\nThe playground equipment is not extensive. A skating rink is provided for skating and hockey. Physical training is confined to that done in the classroom.\n\nSinging receives due attention throughout.\n\nMany of the pupils have limited background of general information and the process of learning is quite labored. Their powers of retention appear faulty. They require teachers who have had training in remedial teaching as it would require skilful teaching to meet their difficulties and needs effectively. Although the present teachers possess creditable aptitude for teaching I feel that better results would be achieved by teachers who had specialized training.\n\nUnder the supervision of Sister Corriveau the management of the school is orderly and systematic. The children are polite and show due respect to their teachers and to visitors. They pass back and forth to the classrooms in a very orderly manner. All rooms throughout the building appear neat and clean. The children are cleanly and comfortably dressed.\nOttawa, August 14, 1940.\n\nDear Sister Corriveau:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 9th instant, in which you ask for a copy of Inspector Scott's report on the Youville Residential School.\n\nI regret to state that it has never been the policy or practice of the Department to supply copies of Inspectors reports to the Principals of our residential schools or to Indian day school teachers. These reports are really official documents and can only be released by an order of Parliament. However, I am enclosing herewith, for your information, a summary of Inspector Scott's last report, in the hope that it may prove helpful.\n\nI want to thank you for your interest in this matter. It is my hope that you will succeed in the attempt you are making to strengthen the teaching staff at your school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A.

Laight,\nIndian Agent.\nEDMONTON INDIAN AGENCY\n\nMeeting of the Members of the Alexis Band, held on their Reserve\nJanuary 6th, 1941.\n\nChief Alexis asked if the visiting day at the Youville Residential School could be changed from Saturday to Friday, he stated that the only way the parents had of going to the school was by train and that the train left from Glenavon on Fridays arriving at St. Albert station at about noon and returned the same days leaving at 5 P.M. If they went on Saturdays or any other day it meant that the Indians had to stop over for one or two days. Agent Laight stated that he would take the matter up with Rev. Sister Superior and explain the situation to her and ask if it would be possible for the parents to see their children on Fridays. He explained that this might be done if the parents were willing to see the children between school hours.\n\nG.C. Laight,\nIndian Agent.\nAgent Laight informed the meeting that he had made a visit to the Youville Residential School and investigated the complaint made by Councillor William Morin. He stated that he had visited all four of the dining rooms and found that the children that day had a very good meal and that the food was good. The meal consisted of meat stew with boiled potatoes, bread and butter with bread pudding with raisins in, and plenty of milk to drink. Agent Laight stated that he asked the children in each room if they were getting all they wanted to eat and all the milk they wanted to drink and that in each room all had replied \"Yes.\" He also stated that he had asked each room if they had any complaints to make regarding their food and with the exception of one boy had all replied \"No.\" The complaint made by one of the big boys was that he wanted tea to drink at dinner time, the master in charge of this room informed me that the boys were given milk to drink at noon and tea in the evening. Agent Laight also stated that the children were well dressed and that the Rev. Sister St Sabine, Principal of the school had informed him that the children did not want to wear the clothes their parents gave them at the school but wanted to keep them until they went back home.\n\nNo comments.\n\nG.C.

A new installation of heating system had to be put in all the classrooms and dormitories, and all the children's quarters need painting very badly, work that hasn't been done for good many years on account of insufficient funds.\n\nWith your keen understanding of the financial expense needed for the maintenance of Institutions you will realize that at the present time the high cost of labor and materials adds to our difficulty.\n\nWe are now asking you, Mr. Phelan, to present our request to the Department that they come to our assistance to help us to defray our expenses.\n\nIn soliciting the help of the Department, we wish to state that we do appreciate all that it has done in the past for our school.\n\nWe hope that this request will be taken into consideration and that we may receive a favorable reply.\n\nPraying God to bless you and your work,\n\nwe remain,\n\nYours very grateful.\n\nSister Rose Vincent,\nYouville Indian Res. School,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nDecember 7, 1944.\n\nDear Sister:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, with reference to the expenditure that you have been obliged to make in keeping the Youville School in repair. Very careful consideration has been given to your request and I am extremely sorry to say that we cannot see our way clear to giving a favourable reply. Present regulations class the Youville School as a non-Government-owned building and for this class of building only specific amounts are included in our appropriation and we are not allowed to expend more than the sum provided. In the current year's appropriation it was only found possible to include an amount of $250 for the Youville School. We have already expended practically all of that amount in purchasing linoleum.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nSister Rose Vincent,\nPrincipal,\nYouville Indian Residential School,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nThe Indian parents of this reserve have asked me to write you and make a request that their children be allowed out of school for Christmas.\n\nI have explained to them that it is against the regulations to allow children out of school between September & July except in the case of sickness or some such other emergency.\n\nFurthermore, I explained to them, that if their children were allowed out, the parents of the other reserves would want their children out also & I had already had a lot of trouble getting these children back and I would have a whole lot more trouble now, that the parents were away in the bush trapping & logging.\n\nWould you please advise by return mail your decision in the matter, in order that I may convey same to the parents.\n\nI might say also that the Sisters in charge of the school are not in favor of the proposal.\n\nT. Scott,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 14th December, 1945.\n\nAIRMAIL\n\nMr. J.T. Faunt, Indian Agent, Winterburn, Alberta.\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant with reference to the request you have received from certain Indians to have their children allowed holidays at Christmas from the Youville Residential School. I note from your letter that you are acquainted with the instructions previously issued, namely that holidays at Christmas are not allowed.\n\nThis whole question was recently reviewed by the Director and myself in consultation with the Minister and it was decided that it would be inadvisable to make any change this year in the policy that has been followed for many years.\n\nIt is intended to arrange to have an review of Indian administration in Canada within the next year. At that time the question regarding holidays for pupils attending residential schools will be reviewed.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nCalgary, August 5th, 1946.\n\nRe-Edmonton Indian Agency.\n\nWith regard to Schools: An interview was held with one Alexis Simon, an Indian who has a very good command of English. He is not a farmer. He belongs to the Indian Association of Alberta, and stated emphatically that he and many others want to have the school returned to a Day School on this Reserve. Apparently he had been educated at the United Church Day School on Wabamun Reserve many years ago, and felt that he had benefited by the same, although he had to go several miles each day to attend it. He indicated\u2014as others did, that the parents were not pleased with the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nActing Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nYOUVILLE\nIndian Residential School.\nSt. Albert, Alberta.\n\nAugust 12th 1946.\n\nJ.T. Faunt, Indian Agent,\nEdmonton Agency,\nWinterburn, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Faunt:\n\nIn preparing our budget for the next school year we are more than ever embarrassed to meet the necessary expenses.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs is well aware of the increased cost of living and wages, and that the cost of maintenance of buildings and equipment has practically doubled. They also know that we clothe, feed, shelter, instruct and give nursing care to all the Indian children placed in our institution. In order to give them the proper attention and care, we consider it impossible to carry on in the future at the present rate paid and I am sure that the Government will easily understand that it is inadequate.\n\nWe consider that we should receive not less than $25.00 per month per child, to meet the expense which we incur in furnishing the services above mentioned, and we trust that you will pass on to the authorities charged with the administration of Indian Affairs, our request, with a strong recommendation that the increase from $15.00 to $25.00 per child be authorised and made effective on September 1st. Under present conditions it is impossible to make ends meet and we trust that in all fairness to the Institution, our request will be granted.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain\n\nGratefully Yours,\n\nsigned Sister Rose Vincent\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nEnclosed herewith please find copy of a letter recently received from the principal of Youville Indian Residential School, in which she refers to the increasing cost of maintenance of the children in the school and suggesting that the allowance for these children be substantially increased.\n\nIn talking to her, she pointed out that she was receiving the same grant as you were paying to the operators of government owned schools and this was hardly fair, as you had no investment in the building, which was being maintained by them for the convenience of these Indian children.\n\nI really think the Sister has some real grounds for her request, as the cost of maintenance in all its branches has greatly increased and I would therefore respectfully recommend that consideration be given to her request.\n\nJ.T. Faunt,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 29, 1946.\n\nMr. J.T. Faunt, Indian Agent, Winterburn, Alberta.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, enclosing a request from the Principal of the Youville Residential School for an increase in the Per Capita Allowance.\n\nThe basic Per Capita rate for this school is $180.00 per pupil. In addition we are allowing during the current academic year a Special grant of $15.00 per pupil. Funds for paying the grant at the rate stated are included in the current years' appropriation and at the present time we are not in a position to make an increase.\n\nBernard F.

Nt. Rlys. Between Bissell and Winterburn stations, just West of Edmonton.\n\nOn September 12th, 1947, at about 7 a.m., while freight train, extra west, engine No. 2166, Canadian National Railways, in charge of Conductor Butler and Loco. Engineer Franchuk, was proceeding west out of Calder Yards, North Edmonton, on reaching a point at mileage 9, ran into an obstruction on the rails in the form of used Railway track ties. A short distance farther at mileage 10, the train was brought to a standstill, it having been\n\n....... noticed by the\nInspector of Indian Agencies,  \nSeptember 23rd, 1947.  \nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nnoticed by the Engineer that two track rail angle bars were placed lengthways on the track rails, they having caught in the pony truck wheels on the engine and skidded them some distance.\n\nThe engineer's words in this connection were - \"it is lucky our engine wasn't derailed and damage done\". Obstructions of two inch boards and two other angle bars found farther on till mileage 11 was reached. The points mentioned are nine and 11 miles west of Edmonton C.N.R. station, and between the flag stations of Bissell and Winterburn.\n\nMy investigation disclosed the obstructions were placed on the Railway tracks by two Indians Boys named Albert Ward, age 13 and Percy William Papin, age 13, residing on Stony Plain Indian Reserve, about five miles west of Edmonton. The two boys, in the presence of Indian Agent E.A. Robertson and R.C.M.P. Police Constable B.R. Boyer and myself confessed to doing the mischief, saying they had run away from the Residential School at St. Albert on Friday morning early, September 12th, and it was while they were going to their homes the mischief was done.\n\nThe Railway Management and Board of Railway Commission take a very serious view of such happenings as above, and I would be pleased if it may be arranged to have the two boys appear before a Juvenile Court Judge for any action he cares to take, after hearing the circumstances.\"\n\nAs the actions of the two boys concerned may have resulted in a very serious accident it is thought that the boys should be taken before a Juvenile Judge for such action as he may see proper under the circumstances, as no doubt they were not aware of the possible results of placing obstructions on a railway.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(C.

On the 17-9-47, Mr. George KEMP, of the C.H.R. Investigation Dept., called at this office, and stated that the above mentioned juveniles were suspected of placing three angle bars and three pieces of planking across the railroad tracks at or between miles nine and eleven. In view of this, Mr. KEMP requested assistance.\n\n2. It was learned that these two juveniles aged thirteen, were Treaty Indians, belonging to the Knock Band, on the Winterburn Indian Reservation. They had been attending school at the St. Albert Mission, at St. Albert, Alta. Mr. KEMP and the writer interviewed the Sister in charge of the school, and the Sister in charge of the classroom where the juveniles had attended. They stated that the juveniles had left the school at approx. 2:00 p.m. of the 12-9-47, but without permission, and they were likely to return to the Reservation.\n\n3. At 6:45 a.m. of the 12-9-47, it was alleged that the juveniles in question, had placed these obstructions on the tracks. Two or three people who lives nearby were interviewed, and it was found out that they had seen two juveniles coming from that direction of the tracks where the obstructions had been placed, but they could not positively identify them as such.\n\n4. However, the writer and Mr. KEMP patrolled to the Reservation, and on contacting the Indian agent, succeeded the two juveniles. On being questioned, they quite readily admitted having placed the obstructions on the tracks, giving no reason for doing so.\n\n5. There is no action being taken at this point by this office, as Mr. KEMP is contacting the Supt., of Child Welfare Dept., to be advised as to the proper action necessary in this case.

McKinnon, Inspector of Schools for the Northwest Territories has been carrying out inspection work in the Territories this summer. While at Hay River he met an Indian, William Nelson and was quite impressed with this lad. He is twenty-seven years of age and is quite anxious to continue his education. He wishes to become a school teacher and his present standing is grade nine in accordance with the Alberta standards.\n\nMr. McKinnon recently received a letter from William Nelson in which he stated he was a patient in your hospital. As we are very anxious to try to help out Indians who are sincere in their desire to get higher education and particularly those who want to become school teachers, we would appreciate your help in this instance.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. E.A. Robertson, Indian Agent, Winterburn, Alberta and also to Mr. Neil Walker, Superintendent of Indian Agencies, Fort Vermilion, Alberta. The point is to get definite information from this Indian as to his plans, etc., I am attaching one of our regular tuition grant forms which Nelson could fill in and return here. As Mr. Robertson is our nearest field official he could handle this for you.\n\nI realize that this is somewhat out of your normal line of duties but realizing your interest in your patients, I am approaching you in this way.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDr. H.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Youville Indian Residential School.\n\nWhile at the Youville School yesterday, the Sister Superior advised me that they have two pupils from Enoch's Band, who are taking the Provincial Government's Correspondence Course at the school. These boys are George Ward No. 611 at Henry Ward No. 621. George is taking grade 8 and Henry grade 7.\n\nWhen the Provincial School Inspector was at the school this Fall, he recommended that these boys take the correspondence course as the school only had the one pupil in each grade. The Sister Superior advises that the boys are doing exceptionally well with the course.\n\nThe cost of this course is $6.00 each per year. Will you please advise if the Department will bear the expense.\n\nE. A. Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 25, 1947.\n\nMr. E.A. Robertson, Indian Agent,\nWinterburn, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant, the Department is prepared to pay the cost of the correspondence courses for George Ward, pupil No. 611 and Henry Ward, pupil No. 621.\n\nIt is noted that the cost will be $6.00 each per year.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nColonel Neary:\n\nYouville Residential School:\n\nWith Mr. Supt. Robertson I visited the school on June 11 and talked with the Mother Provincial and the Sister Superior.\n\nI got the impression that the Order would prefer to use this institution for purposes other than the education of Indians. The Mother Provincial, indeed, indicated that she will require an early guarantee that the Department will provide per capita grant for eighty pupils; if that is not forthcoming, she prefers to make an arrangement with the provincial government. This arrangement would allow her to dispose the present teaching staff in accordance with increased requirements elsewhere, chiefly at our residential schools.\n\nAs Stonyplain and Michel will enroll Youville pupils in September, and Alexander's band want their school within a few months, I cannot see how we can meet the guarantee of eighty pupils for the whole of next year unless we enforce the attendance of children from Alexis (which now sends only a few) and from the Saddle Lake agency where Blue Quills cannot take in all who should be in school. The Hobbema Reserve also has more children than Ermineskin can accommodate.\n\nAlready a large number of school desks are piled up in the pavilion awaiting disposal. These are single desks of the conventional type. They would be quite appropriate without re-conditioning for a set-up like Prince Albert. Our new one-room schools are such splendid buildings that it would be a pity to equip them with shabby old-type furniture.\n\nC.A.F.

Gooderham, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Calgary, Alberta.\n\nWe have just received Major Clark's letter of June 14th regarding the Youville School and it is noted that copy of this letter has been forwarded to you.\n\nAs Superintendent Robertson and yourself are conversant with local conditions, we would appreciate it if you would let us know if there is a prospect of securing eighty children for the Youville School for the academic year 1948-49.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nThe Provincial of the school should immediately be advised what you are prepared to do.\n\nG.H. Gooderham\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nATT: Mr. B.F. Neary\n\nRE: Attendance, Youville Indian Residential School\n\nA copy of your letter of the 21st., file 110-1-1 (E.1) has been forwarded to me at Edmonton. I am now conferring with Mr. Robertson.\n\nHe advises me that there are 35 children of school age in the Alexis Band, 2 orphans from Michel and 6 R.C. children from the Wabamun Reserve who might attend the Youville Residential School, if all Alexander's pupils left to attend Day School.\n\nAt best, the Day school on Alexander's Reserve cannot be ready before the first of 1949 and it is doubtful if any school can be running on that Reserve during the year 1948-49.\n\nThe Indian children of Michel, Stony Plain and Wabamun Reserves can always be taken care for in some other way.\n\nThe parents do not voluntarily send their children to school nor do the parents remain on the Reserve and as a result some provision must be made for the Alexis Band for some years to come. The only place available at present is the Youville institution.\n\nIt is our recommendation, therefore, that the sister-hood who operate the Youville institution be guaranteed the per capita grant for 80 pupils and that the children from all these Reserves be, including Alexander's, returned. Some force will be used to insure the attendance of children from Alexis Band and it is our surmise that the total will be very close to that required by the sisters.\nJune 30, 1948.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Calgary, Alta.\n\nWe have your letter of the 28th instant with reference to the Youville Residential School.\n\nWe feel that there should be no difficulty in obtaining eighty pupils for the Youville School for the academic year 1948-49 but in order to do so you must have the co-operation of all the Indian Superintendents in the district from which pupils are obtained for the Youville School.\n\nRegarding the payment of per capita allowances, regulations are such that we cannot pay per capita to any school unless the pupils are there. In other words, if we pay for a pupilage of eighty at Youville, that number must be in the school.\n\nBefore we write to the Provincial of the Order operating the Youville School, we would like your definite assurance that eighty pupils will be available for the coming academic year.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nG.H. Gooderham, Esq., Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nRE: Attendance - Youville Indian Residential School\n\nReference to your letter of July 5th., in connection with the above.\n\nI cannot see any possibility of securing 80 pupils for Youville School for the year 1948-49.\n\nPaul's Band have 3 Roman Catholic children of school age, 6 of whom attended school last year and will probably attend the coming year.\n\nAlexander's Band have 21 boys and 24 girls of school age. Of these, 7 boys are 12 years and over and would very likely be refused admittance. As you know during the past year or two the sisters have not had any male teacher and have sent the majority of the older boys home. Last year Alexander's Band had 33 children in school and I think 35 would be the limit we can expect to get in this year should their school not be completed in time for the fall term. The fact that a day school is being built might cause some difficulty in getting these people to send their children in to the Residential school as they will no doubt want to keep them at home until the day school is ready.\n\nAt Alexis Band they have 23 boys and 18 girls of school age, 10 of the boys being 12 years of age or over. Last year this Band had 6 pupils only at Youville. As you know they object very strongly to sending their children to school but if the department will sanction strenuous and continuous prosecution we could no doubt get possibly 25 in school. This would, of course, be a rather costly procedure as these people leave the Reserve in August and early September for bush camps and trap lines which are scattered over a very large area of the foothills.\nThere were also 5 pupils from Northern Agencies who would no doubt attend again this year and one from Saddle Lake.\n\nLast term they had 73 pupils in attendance, 18 of whom were from Enoch's Band and 4 from Michel Band. These latter pupils will not be attending this year as their day schools will be in operation.\n\nProvided Alexis pupils can be forced in and a reasonable number from Alexander's Reserve will attend I do not think more than 65-70 pupils can be obtained.\n\nE.A. Robertson,\nSuperintendent.\nB. F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Attendance - Youville Residential School\n\nUpon receipt of yours of June 30th, file 110-1-1 (E.1), I communicated with Mr. Robertson, Superintendent Edmonton Agency, and asked if it would be possible to give a guarantee that there would be eighty pupils attending this school next year. I am attaching hereto his answer in which he states it is not possible.\n\nI talked this matter over with him again last week, when he stated further that it has always been very difficult to get children from the Alexis Band into school, and these people will possibly hide away when it is known considerable force is being used to get their children into school. There is nothing more to be added, and it is regretted that you have to advise the provincial of the Order that we cannot guarantee eighty pupils.\n\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nEnc.\nJuly 23, 1948.\n\nReverend and dear Sister:\n\nIn a letter dated June 14th, Major C.A.F. Clark, our Educational Survey Officer, stated that he visited the Youville School on June 11th and talked with the Mother Provincial and yourself.\n\nMajor Clark obtained the impression that you were not prepared to accept Indian children for the academic year 1948-49 unless we could guarantee per capita grant for eighty pupils.\n\nWe have been in correspondence with Indian Superintendent Robertson and he states that as far as he can see at the present time, there will not be more than sixty-five or seventy pupils that can be obtained for the Youville School.\n\nPresent regulations only permit the Department to pay per capita allowances for the pupils in attendance. We trust that you will find it possible to provide accommodation in the Youville School for the academic year 1948-49, for the number of pupils just mentioned.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

A copy of our letter is attached hereto.\n\nWe have now received an answer from Sister Letarte, reading as follows:\n\n\"In answer to your letter of July 23rd, we regret to inform you that due to the uncertainty of attendance of the small number of pupils available, and with present regulations of payment per capita for the pupils in attendance, it is impracticable for us to accept your proposal.\n\n\"In severing our relations with your Department may we thank you for your kindness and courtesy in the past, with our best wishes for the future.\"\n\nA copy of this letter is being sent to Mr. Indian Superintendent Robertson, as it is anticipated that you would wish to advise the Department concerning the action indicated in view of local conditions.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. Robertson.\nB. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Youville Indian Residential School & Alexander's Indian Day School\n\nYour File #110-1-1 (E)\n\nMr. Robertson Superintendent Edmonton Indian Agency has advised me that the Youville R. C. Convent will not accept any Indian children this year. This means that there will be no school for the children of the Alexis and Alexander Bands.\n\nAs you know, the attendance at Youville from the Alexis Band has always been poor; the parents do not co-operate and our superintendent finds it very difficult to locate the families during the Fall and Winter as they leave the reserve to camp wherever the father finds work; this may be in lumber camps or on trap lines. The closing of Youville is therefore not so serious, at the moment, insofar as the children of the Alexis Band are concerned.\n\nHowever it is a serious matter for those from the Alexander Band; there are a number of children from this Band who would attend and their parents want them in school.\n\nI suggest that the day school on this reserve be erected as quickly as possible. In order to accomplish this, it may be necessary to accept an offer to build it at a figure much higher than originally estimated or if need be, to accept an offer on a cost plus basis. You will no doubt have found it impossible to keep within your estimate for schools and still carry out your program owing to the steadily mounting costs. In this province up to the moment no contracts have been placed so far as I am aware and it is not because our superintendents have not tried to get bids. I know nothing has been done about the Good Fish Lake school, Saddle Lake agency. This school could be left for another year because the pupils can enter the Edmonton Residential School; in fact Mr. Staley needs this extra pupilage. In such an event could you not allow more money to complete the Alexander School?\n\nA contracting firm might easily be located to erect this school and have it in readiness for occupancy by January 1949 if terms of the agreement were relaxed by the inclusion of an escape clause or as stated, if the contract were laid on a cost plus basis.\n\nI see no other way to get these Indians into school. A few may get into provincial schools but the number would be negligible.\n\nIt is assumed that you have an overall appropriation allocated to this province; why not erect the most urgently needed schools even if the cost appears excessive? I have no other alternative to suggest in answer to your letter of August 13th, file 110-1-1 (E) just received.\n\nG. H. Gooderham\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, August 20, 1948.\n\nMr. G. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nYouville Indian Residential School\nand Alexander's Indian Day School.\n\nI have answered your letter of August 16\nand, by now, you will have received my letter of August 13\ndealing with the same matter.\n\nI note your recommendation that we erect a\nday school on the Alexander's Reserve as soon as possible\nand that, if necessary, the extra funds required be taken\nfrom the Goodfish Lake School, Saddle Lake Agency. Would\nyou please interview local contracting firms for the\nsubmission of contracts on either firm or a cost plus 10%\nbasis. I note that you will try to make arrangements to\nhave some of these children sent to provincial schools\nif possible.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOttawa, August 23, 1948.\n\nMr. H.A. Robertson,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nWinterburn, Alberta.\n\nYouville Indian Residential School\n\nIn view of the fact that the Department will no longer be using this school for Indian pupils, it is requested that you interview the Reverend Principal with regard to the taking of an inventory of all Departmentally owned equipment in this school.\n\nAny items such as linoleum, etc., which are in place should, of course, not be listed, but such items as desks, beds, etc., should be accounted for.\n\nWe have not provided many major items of equipment at this school in some years. You should inquire, however, concerning the following items:\n\n(a) 2 filing cabinets,\n\n(b) 2 sewing machines - supplied Oct. 30, 1946,\n\n(c) 50 gallons of white paint, etc., supplied June, 1948.\n\n(Please find attached account covering this point.)\n\nIt is suggested that these items be shipped to either the Edmonton Residential School or to the Ermineskin Residential School.\nThe school books, pencils, library books, etc., can be shipped to either the Michel or Stony Plain Schools. Some of the desks can also be stored for use in the projected Alexander School.\n\nI would recommend that you have the two teachers of the Michel and Stony Plain Schools visit the Youville School and arrange for them to take over the text books, scribblers, etc., such as they require. Other stocks of text books left over can then be shipped to the Ermineskin school.\n\nWe will expect a report from you in due course concerning this matter.\n\nA letter has been sent to the Reverend Principal advising her of this matter.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nc/c to Mr. Gooderham.\nOttawa, August 23, 1948.\n\nReverend Sister Angelina Letarte,\nPrincipal,\nYouville Indian Residential School,\nSt. Albert, Alberta.\n\nReverend and dear Sister:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of August 7th, we have advised Mr. Indian Superintendent Robertson to visit you in the near future with regard to the preparation of an inventory of all Departmentally owned furnishings and equipment in your institution.\n\nIt is our intention to use the desks, books and other items in other day and residential schools in your vicinity.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Henry\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nBFN/MGD\nOttawa, September 3, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nYouville Indian Residential School.\n\nThis school is a church-owned institution, operated by an Order of Sisters. It has always accepted old people and feeble-minded people requiring institutional care and assigned to it by the Provincial Department of Welfare.\n\nFor many years we have felt that the education of the children at this school was not being conducted in an atmosphere conducive to the best results.\n\nWe have, therefore, built two new day schools on the home reserves of the children who formerly attended this residential school. We will shortly submit to your office an Order-in-Council covering the building of a third day school.\n\nWe have, therefore, not been able to provide the minimum number of Indian children required for us to continue our contract with the Sisters operating this school. A letter has now been received from the Reverend Principal, reading as follows:\n\n\"In answer to your letter of July 23rd, we regret to inform you that due to the uncertainty of attendance of the small number of pupils available, and with present regulations of payment per capita for the pupils in attendance, it is inadvisable for us to accept your proposal.\n\n\"In severing our relations with your Department may we thank you for your kindness and courtesy in the past, with our best wishes for the future.\"\n\nIn view of this information, we have requested...\nour Indian Superintendent to take an inventory of the departmentally-owned equipment at this school and it is our intention to transfer the desks, books, etc., to our other day and residential schools in the immediate vicinity. With the two day schools now erected and the one now planned, we will be able to offer adequate educational facilities for the Indian children who formerly attended this school.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the YOUVILLE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30th, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated JULY 4th, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nEDMONTON INDIAN AGENCY\n\nDated at Winterburn, Alta.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 21st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils in residence ended on this Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, any payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the YOUPILLE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 30th 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated OCTOBER 4th 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at EDMONTON INDIAN AGENCY OCT 16 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFound No. I.A. 406 Rep.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The average per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils during the quarter, and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the YOUVILLE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended MARCH 31st 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 1st, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Winterburn Alta this 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAME OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|---------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 674             | Peter Cunningham | 10  | 1   |      |                |                    |                        | Oct 23/44                  | Not returned - Jan/48     |\n| 675             | Harry Paul    | 11  | 1   |      |                |                    |                        | Nov/44                     | Not returned              |\n| 676             | Leonard O'Gillies | 10  | 1   |      |                |                    |                        | Dec/43                     | Not returned - Jan/48     |\n| 677             | Ernest Callinco | 10  | 1   |      |                |                    |                        | Dec/44                     | 91 40 Illness            |\n| 678             | Fredrick A Callinco | 7   | 1   |      |                |                    |                        | Dec/44                     | 91 40 Illness            |\n| 679             | Francis R Callinco | 6   | 1   |      |                |                    |                        | Dec/44                     | 91 40 Illness            |\n| 680             | Edward Morin   | 8   | 1   |      |                |                    |                        | Dec/44                     | 91 40 Illness            |\n| 681             | Alex Aiguebelle | 11  | 1   |      |                |                    |                        | May/46                     | Not returned - Sept/47    |\n| 682             | Alfred Arcand  | 9   | 1   |      |                |                    |                        | June/46                    | 91 59 Illness            |\n| 683             | Dolphus Kootenay | 8   | 1   |      |                |                    |                        | July/46                    | 91 59 Illness            |\n| 684             | Wilfrid Thomas | 8   | 1   |      |                |                    |                        | July/46                    | 91 59 Illness            |\n| 685             | L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence by all pupils entering the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the PUVILLE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended AUGUST 31st 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 10th 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nE.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils in residence during quarter as shown on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the YOUTLE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30th 1948\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated JULY 3rd 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nE.A.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate of grant per pupil. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the YOUGILLE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31st, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated JANUARY 4th, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at Winterburn Alta., this Jan. 15th, 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. J.A. 465\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pacing it No. 2, and carry forward all totals placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils included on the Return, ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the YOUGLE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 7th 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at Winterburn Alto this Oct. 17th 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will there be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Youville Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated July 2nd, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Stamp]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the YOUNVILLE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended MARCH 31st 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: APRIL 2nd 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Youville Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated October 2nd, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Edmonton Indian Agency OCT 23 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the number given in the \"Total number of pupils in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the YOUVILLE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30th 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated JULY 1st 1945.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Edmonton Agency this 10th July 1945.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Youville Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated APRIL 3rd, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated APRIL 9th, 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Additions to be correctly made and entered at the foot of column.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the YOUNVILLE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31st, 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated JANUARY 4th, 1945.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at EDMONTON INDIAN AGENCY JAN 8 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

of column.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils named on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the YOUVILLE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30th, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated JULY 4th, 1944.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Additions to be correctly made and entered at the foot of column.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days that each pupil was present at school, excluding Sundays and holidays, including the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal.\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

column.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days resident of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Youngville Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated July 6, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nthis 10th July, 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return, and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added, and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................School for the Quarter ended .................................................. 193 .....\n\nPrincipal ..............................................................\n\nDated ............................................................ 193 ....\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent ..............................................................\n\nDated at ............................................................ this ........................................... 193 ....\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils attended school during quarter, obtained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. This Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is calculated by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

column.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the column \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of quarterly grant due per quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Yorkeville Indian Res. School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 7, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n| Register Number | Names of Pupils | Age | Boy/Girl | Band or Reserve | Class of Study | Standing in Class | Trade of Other Industry | Date of Entrance to School | Attendance |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|----------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 633             | Dan Rotts       | 10  | I        | Alexis         | IS             | I                 | Carpentry, chores        | Sept. 1/39                | 8450       |\n| 634             | George Laflche  | 10  | I        | Alexander      | IS             | I                 |                          | Sept. 1/39                | 90         |\n| 635             | Joseph Gladu    | 12  | I        | Enoch          | IS             | I                 |                          | Sept. 1/39                | 90         |\n| 637             | Daniel Kootenay | 10  | I        | Alexis         | IS             | I                 |                          | Sept. 2/39                | 26         |\n| 638             | Stanley Ward    | 10  | I        | Enoch          | IS             | I                 |                          | Sept. 3/39                | 90         |\n| 639             | Roy Collingbull | 10  | I        | Enoch          | IS             | I                 |                          | Sept. 6/39                | 90         |\n| 640             | Edward A.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, signing it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Youville Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1941.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: November 16, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Signature]\n\nthis 17th December 1941\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Perceau\nIndian Agent\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOur big boys have been asking me this long time for a game of Billiard. I would be delighted to give it to them, but I have already gone to so many other expenses for their convenience, that really I do not think the Institution could possibly afford to incur this new expense; therefore, dear Sir, I take the liberty to ask you to kindly make application in our behalf to the Dept. I know that our boys will greatly appreciate this favor, especially during the long winter evenings, when they are inclined to seek enjoyment outside of the school, and the result is always fatal, for they come into contact with boys of their own age but whose lives are not exemplary, and you know, dear Sir, how quickly...\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo. \u2014 In forwarding the enclosed letter from the Principal of the St. Albert Boarding School asking for a billiard table for the boys of the school I would say that there is no doubt that it would be of great assistance in providing amusement for the elder boys and tend to make them more content to stay in the building in the winter time than surreptitiously leaving the school to engage in pastime detrimental to their wellbeing.\n\nShould it be considered favorably I would remark that probably a second hand table could be procured for about $75 or $100.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo. \u2014 In forwarding the enclosed letter from the Principal of the St. Albert Boarding School asking for a billiard table for the boys of the school I would say that there is no doubt that it would be of great assistance in providing amusement for the elder boys and tend to make them more content to stay in the building in the winter time than surreptitiously leaving the school to engage in pastime detrimental to their wellbeing.\n\nShould it be considered favorably I would remark that probably a second hand table could be procured for about $75 or $100.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 3, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo enclosing a communication from the Principal of the St. Albert Boarding School, and in reply I beg to say the Department cannot grant provide this school with a billiard table.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nUrban Verreau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that I visited St. Albert, and the boarding school located at that point, on the 1st instant.\n\nThere are about 335 acres of land in connection with this institution and about 200 acres are farmed. This insures plenty of work for the advanced male pupils at farming.\n\nThe original main building is 4 stories and 35' x 180' in extent. A new brick structure about 50' x 100' and with 3 floors and a basement was erected a couple of years ago.\n\nThe girl pupils occupied the original building and the dormitories are located on the upper floor. There are 3 of these dormitories the air space and number of beds therein, are:\n\n1. With air space of about 7230', cap. 14, beds 25\n2. \" 2640', \" 5, \" 9\n3. \" 3532', \" 7, \" 17\n\nTotals: 26, \" 51\n\nThis means that there are 25 too many occupying these dormitories, providing there were proper facilities to admit fresh and carry off foul air. No such appliances are provided.\n\nWhen the reverend sisters learned that these dormitories would only accommodate 26 pupils they decided that\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOTTAWA.\nit would be expedient to abandon the use of these rooms for sleeping use for grant earning pupils and to fit up dormitories in the new brick building for the girls. Grant earning boys have been using the new building from the time it was completed.\n\nThe basement of the new brick building contains the laundry, steam heating plant, a dormitory for those who work on the farm and other rooms.\n\nThe dormitory in the basement, referred to in the previous paragraph, is 19'x 40' and with a 10'9\" ceiling. This will accommodate 17 persons and it was in use by 18.\n\nAs it was not definitely settled by the reverend sisters as to which rooms would be set apart for dormitories it was deemed prudent by me to defer a final inspection until this question is finally settled. The sisters now know the area of air space each pupil requires in the dormitories and in the class rooms and I presume they will be governed accordingly.\n\nThree rooms on the 1st floor are reserved for classes, however, and these rooms are connected by wide doors. When these rooms are required for an assembly of pupils the doors will be opened and the three rooms form one room about 72' long and 21' wide. The distance from floor to ceiling is about 12'. The capacity of these 3 rooms is about 72 pupils.\n\nA number of the rooms are connected to ventilating shafts which run up through the partition walls adjacent to the 6'10\" corridors which extend the full length of the building and on every floor. Some of the rooms are not provided with these shafts, however. The location of the face plates in the walls does not appeal to me to be proper to carry off foul air. These open\nface plates are about 10\"x 14\" and are set into the partition wall about 20\" from the ceilings. I have suggested that these open face plates be taken out and connected to the ventilating shaft near to the floors in the various rooms and provide and place where the face plates now are controllable registers. My idea is that with such registers placed 20\" from the ceiling that they can be closed during the cold weather and opened during the warm months. If so controlled they should retain the heat in the room during the cold weather and tend to suck off the warm air in the room during the warm months.\n\nThe open face grate placed near the floor, and connected to the air shaft, should carry away the foul air. Fresh pure air can be admitted into the various rooms by lowering the upper portion of the window sash.\n\nThis is a first class building and in my opinion it can be arranged to provide for about 70 pupils. There will be ample accommodation in the old building for hospital wards and when it is settled as to which rooms are to be used for such purposes the ventilation of the wards can be provided for.\n\nThis institution has accepted white children in the past. I was told that it has been decided to abandon the keeping and tuition of white children in the future.\n\nThe refectory for grant earning pupils is to be in the new brick building, too. The room selected is about 43'x 20'x 10'9\" and the air space about 9245'.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nInsp.\nOttawa, March 26th., 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to your report on the inspection of the St. Albert Boarding School, forwarded to the Department on the 6th ultimo, in which you stated that it was the intention of the Sisters in charge to transfer the girls from the old building occupied by them to the new building.\n\nI have to request you to again visit the school and report as to whether this transfer has been made. As soon as the Department is assured that this has been done, the new Agreement for the future maintenance and management of the School will be forwarded to the Church authorities for execution and they will then be entitled to receive the increased per capita grant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. A. Markle, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nEDMONTON, Alta.\nSir,\n\nI visited the St. Albert school yesterday and learned that the intention of moving the girls from the old to the new dormitories had been abandoned and that the management did not intend to ask for an increased grant for the girls.\n\nI intimated to the Rev. Superior that it would be a great improvement to the dormitories in use by the girls if chutes to carry off the foul air, and means to admit fresh air, were provided for the dormitories but no promise to this effect was made.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 26, 1911.\n\nMadam,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. Inspector Markle in which he states that the management of the St. Albert Boarding School has abandoned the intention of moving the Indian girls from the dormitories in the old building to those in the new and that consequently they do not intend to ask for an increased grant for the girls.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that the Department regrets very much to learn of this decision. It will, however, be absolutely necessary to provide in some way more and better accommodation or else the number of children must be limited to about twenty-six. The dormitories in the old building have air space for only twenty-six pupils, whereas they are at present occupied by fifty-one. In order to obtain even the minimum grant under the new agreement with these schools sufficient dormitory space is necessary. It is provided in the letter which accompanied the agreement that if after due notice any school does not conform to the terms of the contract and of the memorandum of classification it will not be entitled to receive any grant. It will, therefore, be necessary for you to take into consideration either the reduction of the pupilage or the provision of suitable accommodation.\n\nIn Mr. Markle's letter he states that it was intimated\n\nThe Principal,\nSt. Albert Boarding School,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nto him that it was not your intention to ask for any increased grant for the girls, but the Department cannot allow approximately thirty Indian children and twenty-one whites and half-breeds to be kept in dormitories which have only accommodation for half the number, as their sleeping under such conditions would be most detrimental to their health. The Department would be pleased to hear from you at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSt. Albert Boarding School\nAlbert, Alberta\n\nJune 7, 1891\n\nTo the Honorable Secretary of the Dept.\nOttawa\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nYour letter of May 26th file No. 116652-5 has been received and contents carefully noted.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that at the time of Mr. Inspector Macleod's visit to our school in Feb., we were decided to move the dormitory from the old building to the new one, but when we came to put this plan into execution, we found that it would be impossible to give the necessary conveniences to the pupils without incurring heavy expenses; therefore we abandoned the project and decided upon putting...\nSt. Albert, Alta.\n\nup another wing wherein the girls could take up their quarters and have ample air space, of course, this could not be done immediately, so in the meantime we were having the old dormitories repaired.\n\nSince the matter is so urgent we will come back to our first decision and move the girls to the new building, but as school will be going on until the 1st of July, will the Dept agree to the postponing of this moving until that time.\n\nWe trust that we will be entitled during this time, if not to an increased grant at least to the minimum grant for the girls.\n\nHoping this will prove satisfactory.\n\nI remain, Cordially,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nPater Duguay, Principal\nOttawa, June 14, 1911.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department learns with pleasure that you have decided to utilize the dormitories in the new school building for the Indian girls attending the institution. This will entitle you to the maximum grant of $125.00 and payment will be made at that rate for this quarter. On this understanding the contract for this school will now be forwarded to His Lordship Bishop Legal for his signature.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThe Principal,\nSt. Albert Boarding School,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| 1911 | St. Albert | Boarding School |\n| 6 Oct | 3 boxes, static | $5.75 @ 15\u00a2 | $25 |\n|       | 3 boxes, static | $4.10 @ 15\u00a2 | $60 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed, and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOffice of the Indian Agency,\n\nSIR,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 1880, amounting to $5.25\n\nfor 6 big slabs for St. Albert School.\n\nThis Expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 116652-4 dated 12 Aug. 1911.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSt. Albert Boarding School,\nJan. 27, 1913.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nFive years ago, in compliance with the wishes of the Department to improve the situation of the Treaty Children under our care, we undertook to build a new wing in brick vencer 100 by 50 for their accommodation.\n\nThe expense incurred by this undertaking was about $40000.00, a debt which is still impending on the school, and which is increasing yearly, as we cannot see our way to gather sufficient funds to cancel it.\n\nThe Salary to which the sisters who are members of the staff are entitled, is sacrificed in favor of the pupils and the hired instructors, as the Per Capita Grant is quite insufficient to cover all these expenses.\n\nTrue, the farm produce and stock bring us a large revenue, but this is mostly employed in supporting some ninety orphans.\nwho depend solely upon us for their subsistence.\n\nAfter giving you the above information, may I be permitted to solicit the Department to condescend to help us as far as circumstances will permit or to reduce our debt.\n\nThanking you in anticipation for the favor and trusting you will give the matter your kind consideration,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. A.

General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nre St. Albert Industrial School.\n\nWithout exceptions, St. Albert's Indian School is the best Institution I have visited so far, which I did on Saturday morning January the 24th.\n\nIn the morning I telephoned Mr. Race, Indian Agent for St. Albert, and he arranged to meet me at St. Albert's Industrial School in the afternoon. So I motored out, after picking up Dr. Giroux, to the Institution, where Mr. Race was waiting for me. The Sisters took us all through the buildings. They have eighty-three Indian children and a great many more who are not receiving support from the Government. The children are as contented and healthy a looking body I ever had the privilege of looking at. The place was spotlessly clean from top to bottom, good high ceilings, with a modern ventilation system, an infirmary at each end for the girls and boys respectively, and an isolation room for infectious diseases. The water is in abundance and pure in quality, being remarkably soft, a hot water heating plant, which is the best kind, and good drainage facilities. The only recommendation would be an outside laundry, as I do not like laundries in the main buildings, and besides it would give them added room.\n\nThey have had no epidemics, and the children according to the reports of Dr. Giroux and the Sisters, are singularly free from sickness.\n\nO.I.Grain,\nMedical Inspector, etc.\nThe Alberta School Supply Company\n\nSchool Supplies, Debentures, Treasurers' Bonds\nInsurance, School Plans\n\nEdmonton, Alberta\n\nJ.

General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nWhen good kind Mr. Markle visited our school last January he found the management satisfactory and every think in good condition except the Laundry.\n\nHe suggested that a new one be built outside of the school and the old one used to enlarge the big boys' quarters as the air space in this play room is not quite sufficient.\n\nSince this is necessary and even urgent I would like very much to put up something substantial with all modern equipment, but with the heavy debt still weighing on the school I cannot see my way to do so. Therefore I have recourse to the Department for assistance. You have been so kind and liberal towards us on several occasions that I feel convinced you cannot refuse me this one favor.\n\nTrusting you will kindly consider this matter and after seeing the necessity of it you will act according and complete our school by adding to it an \"Up to date laundry.\"\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSister M. A. Leduc, S.P.\nOttawa, May 27, 1914.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant asking the Department to erect an up-to-date laundry in connection with the St. Albert Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is regretted that your request cannot be complied with, as this school is not the property of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Now today it is impossible for us to do so, since the building of our new institution which has left us a great debt.\n\nWe have always looked for the comfort of our Indian children but at the present time, without some help, we cannot do so, as our means will not permit it; therefore, we place the case before you, to see what you think about it.\n\nIn our school the bedsteads and springs are too old for reparation, and therefore the pupils sleeping on such uncomfortable beds, cannot as we see be healthy, owing to the old springs and unsteady bedsteads.\n\nWe would be most grateful to you, Honorable Sir, if you could help us out on this point, as it is impossible for us to make that expense. Permit me, Honorable Sir, if this favor is granted to inform you of a place in Edmonton where we could have them for a very reasonable price, seeing that it is for an institution.\nWe need 19 of 6 ft. 24 of 5\u00bd ft. 45 of 4\u00bd ft.\n\nThis would amount to 88, enough for all our Indian children.\n\nTrusting, Honorable Sir, to receive a favorable answer from you,\n\nI am,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nSister [signature]\n\nPer Sec.\nOTTAWA, July 8th, 1922.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, requesting that a supply of bedsteads and springs be supplied for the use of the Indian children at the St. Albert Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is considered that furnishings of this nature should be supplied by the school authorities from the per capita grant.\n\nAt the present time it is regretted that we are unable to comply with your request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Now today, owing to the new institution that we had erected with every modern convenience, and which has left us in great debt, we, once again, Honorable Sir, take the liberty of asking you, to kindly make application in our behalf to the Department, to defray the expenses of the purchase.\n\nThe total expense amounts to the sum of $1,173.00.\n\nHoping and trusting that the Department will be able to render effectual and necessary assistance, by the donation of the requisite amount and confident that you will grant us a favorable and early reply.\n\nI am, Honorable Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPer Sec.\nOttawa, Sept. 25, 1922.\n\nReverend Sister Superior:\n\nYour letter of the 12th instant, asking the Department to assist the school in the payment of an account for one hundred beds for the Indian pupils, has been received.\n\nI wish to assure you that I am always pleased to assist the school authorities in the purchase of necessary equipment, especially when the work is being conducted in such a satisfactory manner as is that of the St. Albert Boarding School; but I regret to inform you that there is a recognized procedure in connection with all departmental expenditure, from which we are unable to depart. Each year we anticipate our needs and we ask Parliament to vote the funds necessary for carrying on the work of Indian education. An amount of hundreds of dollars requires a special item in our appropriation.\n\nFurther, before purchases are made, the requirements of the Purchasing Commission must be fulfilled, and I trust that when other equipment is needed, you will give us an opportunity to have the necessary funds voted, and that you will ask us to call for prices.\n\nI wish you every success in your new position, and, if you in the future have any requirements, if the Department is able to assist, I will be pleased to hear as to your wants.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Scott,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n572987\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nYour kind letter of the 25th ult. was received, and we thank you most sincerely for your kind attention.\n\nIn regard to the remark about the requirements of the Purchasing Commission to be fulfilled, and the calling for prices, we beg to inform you on this point, that we already made our appeal before the purchase was made, and received the answer on July 8th, that the Department was unable to comply with our request. Therefore, seeing the condition of the beds, and having been notified by the travelling nurse Miss Johnstone, that they were very unhealthy for the pupils, we went ahead and made the purchase for the best, as they were really needed.\n\nNow, having come to the conclusion, that we have very scanty means before us, which are unable to cover the purchase, we decided to make an appeal to you, knowing that you would do all in your power to help us out in such circumstances.\n\nBegging you once again, Honorable Sir, to render us the necessary assistance, by the donation of the requisite amount, and confident that you will grant us a favorable answer.\n\nI am, Honorable Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPer Sec.\nOttawa, Oct. 12, 1922.\n\nReverend Sister:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge your letter of the 2nd instant, referring again to your request that the Department assist the St. Albert Boarding School in the payment of an account for 100 beds for the Indian pupils.\n\nI have to state that this matter has received the serious consideration of the Deputy Superintendent General, and I regret exceedingly that the decision in his communication of the 25th ultimo has been found necessary. The funds at our disposal are very limited this fiscal year. Considerable work that we wished to undertake has been postponed, and the Department is unable to reverse its recent decision.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister Gosselin,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Boarding school,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nAlthough the Universal Drive is recommended as the best drive for a separator, a Crankshaft Pulley is supplied for use with small animal tread power or where it is desired, for some special reason, to belt direct to the slow moving crankshaft, but its use is not recommended unless the variation in speed of the driving shaft is very slight. This pulley is put on and taken off in exactly the same manner as the regular crank, thus making it quickly interchangeable. A special form of hand crank (shown in illustration) is attaching to the rim of the pulley is supplied where it is desired to use a crank without detaching the pulley.\n\nThe following table gives the part numbers, prices, revolutions and dimensions for this pulley for the different sizes of De Laval Hand Separators.\n\n| Size of Machine | Part No. | Diam. | Face | Belt Width | Rev. per Min. | Price |\n|-----------------|----------|-------|------|------------|---------------|-------|\n| 4-5-10-12       | 3161     | 10    | 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 1\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) | 60            | $2.50 |\n| 15-17-21-22     | 3422     | 12    | 2    | 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 48            | $3.50 |\n| 15 before No. 1,069,000 |        |       |      |            |               |       |\n| 17 \"           | 1,085,000| 12    | 2    | 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 48            | $3.00 |\n| 22 \"           | 1,092,301|       |      |            |               |       |\n\nATTACHING AND USING CRANKSHAFT PULLEY\n\nOn No. 15 machine before No. 1,069,000, No. 17 machine before No. 1,085,000 and No. 22 machine before No. 1,092,301 the pulley is held on the shaft by a set screw; after this number and also on all 4-5-10-12 and 21 machines the pulley hub has three ratchet teeth and a crank screw the same as the crank, also a flat spring, one end of which is attached to one spoke while the other end passes through a hole in the hub and enters the groove in the crankshaft keeping the ratchet teeth of the pulley mesh with the teeth on the ratchet collar for driving in the proper direction.\n\nThe driving shaft should be located so that at least 15 ft. of single leather belting is used. Have the pulleys in line and the pulley shafts parallel, otherwise the belt will not remain on the pulleys.\nSAINT ALBERT INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL\n\n1o-SEPARATOR:- The Rev. Sister Superior asks for a De Laval Separator with the exact attachments shown on the enclosed model. As all specifications are indicated I submit this request to your judicious consideration.\n\n2o-COOKERS:- The following cookers are considered a necessity at the School and I recommend that the request for same be included in the estimates.\n\na) Seamless Cast-Iron Steam Cooker, capacity 3 bushels. Inside dimensions: 29\" x 22\u00bd\" x 12\u00bd\", with draw-off faucet and four heavy tinned baskets with drop handles.\n\nb) Cast-Iron Steam Jacket or Cooker, capacity 40 gallons. Outside dimensions: Diameter 2'7\u00bd\", height 3'2\".\n\nJoseph [signature]\nSir,\n\nThe Principal of the St. Albert Boarding School is requesting a steam jacket cooker, a boiler or steamer and a No. 17 DeLaval cream separator, the latter to be operated by electricity.\n\nThe boilers at present in use are of copper and there seems to be some alkaline substance in the water at the school which acts on the copper and everything cooked in the boilers turns black. I would recommend that the Principal be given authority to exchange the copper vessels in use for the two shown in the attached photos. It is probable that the old ones may be sold for about $15.00 each.\n\nThe cream separator in use at the school is worn out and of no further use and I would recommend that a new one be allowed them. The cost will be about $130.00.\n\nThe Principal is also requesting 10 desks for junior pupils. Many new pupils have been taken in to the school recently and they are short this number of smaller desks and I would request that these be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Dec. 20, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, regarding the request of the Principal of the St. Albert Boarding School that the Department supply for the use of the school a steam jacket cooker, a boiler or steamer and a cream separator.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is considered that equipment of this nature should be furnished by the school authorities. As this is a combined white and Indian institution, the cost of the above articles would not be a fair charge against Parliamentary appropriation and we are not prepared to authorize their being supplied. The cuts which you enclosed are returned herewith.\n\nRegarding the request for ten desks, I beg to say that further particulars are required before we can supply these. I would point out that in 1914, 60 desks were purchased and in August 1921, 12 more were furnished. This is a total of 92. Grant is only allowed for 90 pupils and there should be sufficient desks to accommodate the Indian children. Explanations should be given as to the need for the extra desks at this time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nGeo. H. Rice, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the ST. ALBERT BOARDING SCHOOL. January 23, 1923.\n\nThere are 21 boys and 15 girls in the primary class room and they are divided into three grades. This room is in charge of Sister Monerd.\n\nI notice that six small desks are required for this room as a number of pupils are seated at tables there being no desks for them.\n\nINFIRMARIES.\n\nThere are separate infirmaries for isolation in case of sickness. The building throughout is kept clean and tidy. It is steam heated and lighted with electricity.\n\nI inspected the kitchen, store-rooms, refrigerator, etc., and found everything clean and in good condition.\n\nMy attention was drawn to two copper cookers in use in the kitchen. The action of the copper turns the vegetables black and I would consider it advisable to have them replaced.\n\nW.

City or town................ Province................\nAt the request of the Rev. Principal of the St. Albert Boarding School I have obtained competitive prices of kitchen equipment from various firms handling these goods and beg to enclose abstract of same.\n\nThe McClary people quote prices on their own make of goods.\n\nThe Kelly Co. quote on the McClary catalogue but their prices are away too high for consideration.\n\nMr. Henderson quotes on the Prowse goods which are used by many of the largest hotels on the continent.\n\nMr. Greer has quoted prices on various makes taking as his guide the kind of article used by the majority of Hotels, Caf\u00e9s and bakeries in the town and which by use have proved the most popular and serviceable.\n\nThe list of articles tendered on is the same as was submitted to the Department sometime ago by the Sisters but the Rev. Principal has since decided that she would dispense with the upright sectional cooker and in its place would like to have a potato peeler, meat chopper, sink, bread slicer and food rack. In this respect would say - if I may be permitted to offer an opinion- that this change is advisable but the potato peeler and bread slicer should be hand worked machines rather than power driven as the difference in cost is considerable and further more there are lots of boys and girls in the school who can do this work of operating the hand machine.\n\nI am given to understand by the Rev. Principal that authority was promised for the purchase of these articles after competitive prices had been obtained; if so I would be glad to have instructions if the Department wish me to take further action in the matter.\n\nI might add that in getting these prices and seeing the working of some of these machines at different places I came across a battery of urns in one of the caf\u00e9s in town which could be bought very cheaply-it is in very good shape. There were also one or two other articles which could be bought worth the money which are not new but which have been in use only a short time.\n\nThe \"Beatrice\" separator is the kind in use by the Edmonton City Dairy and highly recommended by them.\n\nI have gone into this matter very thoroughly to get all the information possible on the various makes of machines and the prices quoted are the lowest obtainable for first class goods and are all F.O.B. St. Albert.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Sept. 26, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, enclosing an abstract of tenders with reference to the purchase of kitchen equipment for the St. Albert Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I wish to state that the Department promised favourable consideration to requests for this type of equipment, not exceeding $500, and I should be pleased if you would communicate with the Sister Superior, with a view to ascertaining which articles to this value she would like the Department to purchase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nGeo. H. Race, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06", "metadata": {"Source-File":
