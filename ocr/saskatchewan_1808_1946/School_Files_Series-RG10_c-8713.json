However, there is a note on the return reading as follows: \"Holidays took up most of the quarter\". As you are aware the Department only allows grant for 62 days for holidays. If the annual holidays have commenced on July 1 and all pupils returned promptly on September 1 the return is correct. If, however, as might be supposed from the statement appearing on the return, many of the pupils did not return upon the expiry of the two months holiday leave the return is incorrect.\n\nDr. W. Barr Murray,\nIndian Agent,\nMorley, Alta.\nIt should be pointed out to the Principal that when preparing the September quarter return grant should be requested for the number of days a pupil is actually in residence during the September quarter plus 62 days holiday leave for which grant is allowed. This applies to the quarter in the case of all pupils who were in the school on June 30. For those pupils who entered the school during the September quarter grant should only be requested from the date of admission to the end of the quarter. I, therefore, find it necessary to send back the return in order that it may be reviewed and the Department advised whether or not it has been prepared in accordance with our requirements as stated above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into\nthe INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nat Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Department of Indian Affairs may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child:\nEnglish name:\nAge:\nName of Band:\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid:\nFather's full name and No.:\nMother's full name and No.:\nParents living or dead:\nState of child's health:\nReligion:\nDoes applicant speak English?:\nPreviously attended school for years.\n\n(Signature of Father)\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read aloud and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that she contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\n(Signature of Missionary or other Witness)\n\nNOTE\u2014If mother or guardian signs, agent must forward full explanatory note.\n\nI recommend the admission of the above child, who is of good moral character and is eligible to be admitted as a grant-earning pupil.\n\nAgent\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNote\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

Please let me have further information regarding this girl.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. W.

Staley, Principal\n\nAttention Mr. Phelan,\n\nDr. W.Burr Murray,\nIndian Agent,\nMorley, Alta.\n\nDear Dr. Murray:\n\nWith reference to the Department's request for more information regarding the girl Ruby Snow shown on the last quarterly returns, I beg to advise that this girl as you are aware has been in school since the early part of 1938, but her name has always appeared up until this time on the day school returns.\n\nWith the cancelling of the grant for day school, her name was transferred over to the regular Residential School list. We are aware but perhaps this is not clear to you why it was necessary for us in order to obtain the day school grant to show several children who were actually in residence on the day school return, the names of course never appeared on both lists. Now that all our children appear on the blue return the transfer was effected of Ruby Snow from the day school to the Residential School. At the time of her admittance application was made in the regular way and the necessary authority given.\n\nI regret the confusion caused by this procedure but hope that this explanation will clear the matter up.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nOct. 31, 1939\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child:\nEnglish name:\nAge:\nName of Band:\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid:\nFather's full name and No.:\nMother's full name and No.:\nParents living or dead:\nState of child's health:\nReligion:\nDoes applicant speak English:\nPreviously attended:\n\n(Signature of father)\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\nSignature of Missouraj or other Witness\n\nNote\u2014If mother or guardian signs, agent must forward full explanatory note.\n\nI recommend the admission of the above child, who is of good moral character and is eligible to be admitted as a grant-earning pupil.\n\nAgent\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNote\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

These two children were pupils at the Youville Indian Residential School for several years. I am informed that a year ago last September the local Agent took these two children out of the Youville School and entered them at the Morley School. It would seem that this was done without the authority of the parents.\n\nAs these children were brought up as Catholics and as their religious affiliation will almost necessarily be changed if they are allowed to remain in the Morley school, Rev. John O'Connell, Superior of the Youville School, would like to know if the Department would be good enough to have these children transferred back to the Youville School.\n\nAnything that the Department may be able to do in this matter will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

I took this matter up with the Principal of the Residential School, Rev E.J.

Sabine's letter of December 4 which you left with me.\n\nIt refers to Clara Labelle who is stated to be a pupil of the Morley Indian Residential School. In your previous letter of November 7, 1940, it is evident that the girl about whom the Sister is writing at one time attended the Youville School.\n\nOn the recent return of the Morley School there is shown the name of Clara Labelle, 14 years of age, Shiniqui Band, daughter of Thomas Labelle. As the Shiniqui Band is in the Morley Agency I am doubtful if this is the same girl to whom Sister Sabine refers.\n\nThere is also in the Morley School a girl named Caroline Julia Labelle, a member of the Bearspaw Band and a daughter of Alec Labelle.\n\nYou might let me know if either of these girls is the one about whom Sister Sabine is writing and at the same time you should request the Sister to state the exact date that the \"Clara Labelle\" mentioned in her letter attended the Youville School, also her register number at that school. If we had this information we might be able to trace the matter further.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J.O.

The discharge of pupils numbered 075 and 095 is also approved.\n\nNo reply has yet been received to official letter of April 8 with reference to certain pupils at the Morley School who are 16 years of age or over. The Principal should either apply for their discharge or request permission to keep them for a further period. Please let me have an immediate answer to that letter.\n\nOn future returns from this school Reba Bearspaw should be shown as No. 076.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J.M.R. Iredale,\nActing Indian Agent,\nMorley, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI have your letter, file 119-1-10 dated 14th July 1942 for acknowledgment.\n\nWith regard to pupils at the school who are 16 years or over, I discussed this matter at considerable length with the Principal, Mr. E.J. Stanley. He said he would like to hold the matter over and release some of the girls until about the time of the opening of the school term, because he would like to settle about four of these older girls, but at this time he does not know which ones will be available.\n\nMr. Stanley is experiencing great difficulty in getting sufficient and usable help, chiefly due to the present conditions and labour shortage. The services of some of these older girls will help materially to relieve the situation.\n\nTherefore it might be in order to wait a while before submitting the requested discharge applications when a full detailed report will be submitted for your approval.\n\nTrusting the foregoing explanations are satisfactory to you, and that due consideration be given to the present unavoidable circumstances.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.M.

To remain in school another year\n\n064- Leta Powderface Died a few days ago. TB.\n\n067- Susan Smalleyes Born 24th Aug. 26. Will be discharged.\n\n068- Elba Lefthand 18 Nov. 28.

There were 6 but one died a few days ago, however I am pleased to state that there appears to be considerable improvement in the condition of most of the patients.\n\nI would like to mention that excellent progress has been made at the School in the manual training classes, the older boys are showing wonderful response in the making of various articles (household things), such as Medicine Cabinets etc. but what struck me most were the Kitchen Cabinets of which there were seven all completed, with the exception of 3 which still need the small heading and the glass in the doors.\n\nThey are all the same size and style they measure 42 in. by 24 in. x 66 in. high in the lower part. There are 2 cupboards and two drawers and above the table top there is another cupboard with glass doors opening in middle, with hooks for hanging cups and small heading inside near the back to set plates on their edges.\nThese cabinets are very well made and are attractively painted in various colors, I would estimate them to be worth at least $25.00 each.\n\nThe boys are very proud of their work and they will be allowed to take them home at the end of the school year. In my opinion, this type of training should be encouraged. I would suggest that further materials should be furnished for next year's manual training but, I think they should get their supplies during the summer vacation, in order that they may commence immediately in the new school year and also in time to allow the lumber to become properly dried out (most of the lumber purchased nowadays is very green).\n\nI cannot say that the progress in the class room is anything wonderful, the majority of the children are just mediocre but there seems to be a few bright pupils.\n\nThe sewing classes are doing very good work, repairing clothes and making over old clothes into various useful garments, this is very good training, there is also a beadwork class one afternoon each week, when the girls are shown how to make leather goods, gloves, mitts, mocassins and the like, with bead trimmings, some of the work is very good both in design and workmanship.\n\nJ.N.R.

The former is 4 and the latter is 6, both of them under the age of school admission children to residential schools, and I presume that the reason for your recommending their admission is that the father is dead. If you feel that no better arrangements could be made for these children until they reach school age, the Department is prepared to approve their admission to the Morley School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe.

Circular letter file 150-37 dated June 11th, 1943, I wish to report the following:\n\nThe Morley Indian School was not opened until September 13th; this was due to the extreme difficulty experienced by the Reverend Principal in engaging the necessary staff. However, within two days of opening most of the pupils returned to the school, about 70 reported on the first day. However, I find on 27th of September there are 14 pupils still absent from School.\n\nThe names of the pupils are as follows:\n\n| No | Name            | Age | Status          |\n|----|-----------------|-----|-----------------|\n| 75 | Wallace Snow    | 15  | To be discharged|\n| 61 | Carl Simeon     | 15  |                 |\n| 85 | Fred Selzer    | 15  |                 |\n| 61 | Rita Rider     | 15  |                 |\n| 67 | Susan Smalleyes| 16  |                 |\n| 69 | Georgie Daniels | 16  |                 |\n| 90 | Charlie Amos   | 15  |                 |\n| 75 | Wilfred Mark   | 14  | Absent          |\n| 82 | Cecil Smalleyes | 14  |                 |\n| 95 | Peter Powderface| 14  | This boy is sick|\n| 114| Isaiah Wesley  | 14  | Residing in Nordegg|\n| 88 | Georgie Rider  | 13  | Absent          |\n| 122| Charlie Amos   | 10  | Died in August  |\n\nI would request the first 8 pupils be granted their discharge from the school.\n\nOf the balance there are 3 whom I will insist return to school, namely:\n\nWilfred Mark\nCecil Smalleyes\nGeorgie Rider.\n\nThe other two boys, Peter Powderface and Isaiah Wesley are both T.B., cases one is living at home on the Reserve and the other Isaiah Wesley is living at Nordegg with his family.\n\nJ.N.R.

The explanations are as follows:\n\nNo. 86 - Scottie Roll-in-mud age 14. This boy is an active T.B. case. Dr Baker of the Calgary Sanatorium advised that he should be removed from School. He went home in March 1944.\n\nNo. 95 - Peter Powderface Age 12. This boy is also an active T.B. case. Dr Baker also advised that this boy be removed from the School. He went to his home sometime in January 1944.\n\nWith regard to the 3rd name on the list viz: Roy Hunter # 113. The principal, Rev E.J. Staley states this was an omission from the list. This boy was in residence at the school for the whole term.

As soon as he returns, these will be completed or forwarded to Ottawa.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, February 17, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Staley:\n\nWe have just received your December quarter return and on reviewing it find that you request 92 days' grant for each of the following pupils: Numbers 128, 129, 131 and 0137. On the I.A. 411 form you simply state that the pupils mentioned entered the school in December, 1944. You do not state the exact date in December when they actually entered at any time during the month of December, you are only entitled to grant from the date of entrance to the end of the quarter.\n\nI enclose another copy of circular letter of December 29, 1944, which you have evidently not studied carefully. The information regarding pupils should be the same both on the return and on the I.A.411 form. In addition, you will note the circular letter requires that under the heading \"Date of entrance to school\" you should show the exact month and day of the entrance of each pupil. As it is possible that you made a mistake on the I.A.411 form and that the pupils actually entered the school on October 1, 1944, whose dates would entitle you to 92 days' grant during the December quarter, I am sending back your return, in order that you may make any corrections necessary so that the information on the return and on the I.A.411 form will be the same.\n\nIt is also noted that the names of pupils numbered 074, 075 and 078 are not shown on the December quarter return, although they appeared on the September quarter return and no application has been received in the meantime for their discharge. Either you forgot to include their names on the return - in which case you are entitled to grant for them - or you neglected to include their names on the I.A.411 form showing the exact date on which each of them left the school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. E.J.

As it was believed that Lorraine was at the Stony Sun Dance being held west of Morley patrol was made to that point where her father was attending but stated he had not seen the girl, but thought it possible she might be staying by herself at some of the empty homes in or around Chinko village. Patrol continued around the Reservation until the girl was finally located staying with her grandmother Adeline Soldier. The girl was very reticent about returning back to school but after much persuasion agreed to go back, where she was handed over personally to Rev. E.J. Staley, Principal who reprimanded Lorraine.\n\n3. Lorraine explained that she ran away because she was being picked on by the other girls through some argument that had developed on 14-5-46.\n\n4.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, November 12, 1946.\n\nMorley Indian School\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nWe have just received a report from Mr. J.N.R. Iredale, Acting Indian Agent, Morley, Alberta, concerning a council meeting held October 15, 1946, to discuss school matters in the agency. The report reads as follows:\n\n\"I pointed out to the meeting that there were a number of vacancies for pupils at the school and asked them to get the school filled to capacity without any further delay. We still have room for about 20 pupils.\n\n\"I explained that I had discussed this important matter with the Inspector, Mr. G. H. Gooderham, and that all Family Allowances for children of school age would be withheld until the Morley Indian Residential School was filled to capacity. That only those who had made application for admission for their children would be placed on the grounds of no available room with the exception of those refused or unable to attend for medical reasons. This statement was in connection with children living in Morley and did not apply to children residing in the Nordegg or Pekisko areas.\n\n\"Eddie Hunter read a report regarding education which was submitted by the Alberta Indian Association to the joint committee of the House of Commons and the Senate this spring in which they ask for an addition to the present classrooms of another two rooms for day classes.\n\n\"There was quite a discussion by the Indians on this matter.\n\n\"Chief Enos Hunter asked 'If a child was attending a day school would the Family Allowance be continued to the parents?' I answered 'Yes'.\n\n....... Then I asked the\nThen I asked the meeting why it was that they were not placing their children in school as there are some 40 children who should be in school.\n\nEnos Hunter said there were lots of complaints. He said some of the boys who are now in school asked one of the members of the school staff, \"How much money am I getting for working half days doing chores at the school?\" The answer was \"You get nothing. You are working for your clothes.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I asked one of the older girl pupils, 'Are you getting proper education?' She answered 'No.' She also said 'We older girls have never been in the class rooms for two years.'\n\nAnother pupil told Enos Hunter that she did not like the school because \"We get too much games and playing and not enough time in school work.\"\n\nAlex Baptiste said \"I have four children in school and since Mr. Stanley went away the conditions are getting worse.\" He said the clothing issued to the children is very poor and yesterday he had to buy clothing for two of his children because the clothing they had on was not good enough to keep them warm.\n\nTom Kaquits said he asked two Indians, Moses Chiniquay and Noah Goat, why they did not have their children in school. Chiniquay said his boy Leonard was at school but during the last two years he was only in the class room once or twice a week and the rest of the time he was doing outside work. He said he got the same reply from Noah Goat.\n\nTom Simeon says he had one girl age 15 years, who should be in school. Asked \"Why is she not in school now?\" he replied \"She cannot get along with the staff at the school, always trouble and he said they don't get enough class room work and most of the time they have to do work and that is what causes the trouble.\n\nJohn Bearspaw said he had two girls in school. One was in for eight years. He was satisfied with her. The other was also in school for eight years and when she finished school her education was very poor. He said he asked her why she hadn't\nlearned more and she replied that the last two years she was in school she never went to the class room but was kept doing chores all the time.\n\n\"He continued, I have a boy eight years old but I hesitate to send him to school because I cannot be sure but that when he is old enough he will be made to do chores when he should be doing school work like the white children.\n\n\"Then quite a number of Indians started to talk and said they wanted to get a day school. Nearly all the Indians present at the meeting said they favored a day school.\n\n\"The chiefs and councillors went on record all stating they wished to see a day school opened as soon as possible which would operate in conjunction with the present residential school.\n\n\"David Simon said that all his children had finished school. They all liked to go to school but he did not like residential school. When he was young he went to school for two years and he liked it. He said a little work is alright but not too much. He liked to see children well fed and well clothed.\n\n\"John Powderface said he wanted to see all the children get well educated and he would be in favor of anything that would improve conditions. He was 100 per cent in favor of a day school.\n\n\"He said that half a day in the school room is no good. Sometimes the parents have to leave the Reserve to make a living and if they had to go away they could leave the children in the residential school and take them home when they return to the Reserve.\n\n\"He said that in his opinion if a child had to get a good education it should be in the class room all day because a child could not learn enough doing only half days.\n\n\"He said that at present the food at the school was not sufficient and the children do not get enough butter. This is the condition since Mr. Staley left. He said that the reason the children are running away from the school is that the matron is mean with them. He was told this reason by one of the girls. When asked for the girl's name he replied 'Heba Mark'.\n\n...... I then gave\n\"I then gave them a talk regarding the value of education and told them that as they knew we had a brand new staff at the school and that the staff were doing their best under certain difficulties and asked for the co-operation of every Indian parent.\n\n\"I told them that I wanted everyone to make application for admission for their children and also said that if we got more applications than we could accommodate I would be pleased and then I would go after the department to make some arrangements to take care of the overflow, but that up to the present time my problem has been to get sufficient children to fill the school.\n\n\"However I said I would ask the Department to give serious consideration to their proposal to open up a day school.\n\nThe meeting was closed at 7 p.m.\"\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

When she arrived home she was asked why she came home. She told him that she was doing work with other girls cleaning floors at the school. She said the girls were given occasional tasks as their particular tasks. When she had completed her part she said the matron Miss Hodgson told her to do another part. The girl said she refused to do any more. The girl said the matron got mad with her and told her she was no use around there and to get out of the school. So she went home.\n\nHer father then said he took the girl back to school. He said he and his wife called at the school next day to see how the daughter was. This time the girl said the matron had whipped her for running away. She claims the matron hit her with a strap over the body and shoulders and over the head.\n\nMoses Wesley said he now wants to take his daughter out of school. He does not want her to remain in school and be abused. He also said he did not want his girl to do chores. If she is in school she should be in the class room most of the time and not doing chores.\n\nMrs. Wesley, when asked by me, if what her husband has told is true said \"Yes, I was there when my daughter told her father.\"\n\nI told them I would investigate the matter at the school when the principal returned as he happened to be away in the city today.\n\nWith regard to the foregoing I interviewed the Principal of the school together with the matron Miss Hodgson. I read the foregoing to them. Miss Hodgson said there was practically no truth to the Indians statement. I asked Miss Hodgson to write her report of the incident which she said she would do.\nA copy of the Matron's statement is as follows;-\n\nMorley, Alberta.\nNovember 8th, 1946\n\nMr. J.N.R. Iredele.\nIndian Agent.\nMorley, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nI have read the statement made to you by Moses Wesley regarding my treatment of his daughter Rose. I wish to deny the charges made in this statement. I did not punish Rose for running away from school without cause, but did not strap her on the head and shoulders as claimed by her father. This is the only time that I have strapped her although on two previous occasions she had left the school without cause.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n(Signed) Florence M. Hodgson.\nMatron,\nMorley Residential School.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nAttached hereto is a report which is self explanatory regarding a complaint of Moses Wesley Jr.\n\nIt appears most of the Indians are complaining about the children having to do any work at the school. Owing to the shortage of staff at the school it is impossible to carry on without the help of the senior children to perform some duties and in a way this does not do them any harm, but, such a system means they are only in the classroom no more than half days.\n\nIt should be mentioned that at the present time there are no classroom teachers at the school.\n\nMiss Hodgson, matron, and the Rev. G.J. Inglis are doing the teaching along with the part-time assistance of Miss Bartner, the seamstress, and the handicap is being felt severely.\n\nI am satisfied that Mr. Inglis and his staff are doing a splendid job under the circumstances. Mr. Inglis has been doing his very best to obtain two teachers but it seems he cannot get them for the wages he can offer.\n\nIt should also be said that the boys are not getting any manual training. They have a very well equipped workshop but no manual training instructor.\n\nThere are 34 children in residence at the school and there is room for about eight more pupils, boys. But actually speaking they have all they can manage to do and greatly need a full staff.\n\nJ.N.D. Iredale,\nActing Indian agent.\nCalgary, November 13th, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Morley Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Acting Indian Agent has written to say that the Indians are complaining about the children having to do work at the School.\n\nOn my recent visit to Ottawa, I advised you that this school was under-staffed, and Mr. Leadale states that this condition still exists: There are no teachers; the class-room work is very sketchy, as the principal and matron have to do this in addition to their other duties.\n\nIt would appear that Mr. Inglis has done his very best to obtain good teachers, but cannot get them for the wages he is allowed to offer.\n\nAttached hereto is a complaint against the treatment of a girl -- Maggie Wesley. I do not think this is as serious as it would appear; however, we would appreciate direction as to the type of punishment that might be meted out at a residential school.\n\nThere are 84 children in residence, and it is hoped that the Church officials can and will very shortly obtain teachers, and supply the necessary other staff.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nRe: Morley Indian Residential School\n\nWe have just received from Inspector Gooderham further reports concerning the situation which exists at the above Indian school.\n\nI attach a copy of a letter which has just been forwarded by the Inspector from Mr. Iredale, Acting Indian Agent. I also attach a report from Mr. Iredale concerning a complaint received about the treatment that an Indian girl had received at this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F.

Mr. Hunter: Re Son, request for discharge from School at age 15 years. Stated that by an arrangement with former Principal and Agent, it was agreed that the boy was placed in school at age 6 years, that he would receive his discharge one prior to discharge age. At the same time he complained that as the boy was working outside the school and receiving no class room work, he might as well have him at home helping on his farmstead.\n\nAgent informed Hunter that the matter will be discussed with the Principal, and referred to the Branch for instructions.\n\n11. Tom Simeon also raised the issue of the boys only getting as far as Grade 6, due in his opinion to the half-day basis that the older pupils were subject to. It was explained as carefully as possible that a survey along educational lines was now being conducted across Canada of Indian Schools, and that out of such a survey, a change in our system as to class room work might be made.\n\nX X X X\n\nP.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nI beg to state that the following school matters have arisen in connection with the applications of two Indians for the discharge of their children from the Morley Indian Residential School.\n\n1. Gordon Hunter - Pupil No. 90, shown as age 14 years. Father states that this boy entered school 1/8/37, which has been verified from the school returns, and at time of entry to school was 6 years of age. He further states that he was told at the time of entry, that as the boy was one year younger than admission of age, that he would be discharged one year prior to discharge age. The boy is now 11 years of age, and the father requests that he be discharged.\n\nThe principal and myself cannot of course verify the statement of the father. Should this boy be discharged at the end of the school term ending June 30th next?\n\n2. Maxine Rider - Pupil No. 0157, shown as age 14 years. This girl truanted from school, and an interview with the father revealed that the girl had complained that she had been abused by the older pupils and that she was bruised when she arrived home. I endeavored to persuade the father to send his daughter to school, but he refused to do so, and has now gone South to work. In checking over the history of the girl it is found that she entered school at 14 years old, has attended since Oct 15th 1943, and in the opinion of the writer, this would appear to be a bad policy to admit Indian girls at that age, and anticipate that they would settle down with young children in classes and be normal, and from the complaint received it would appear that she might have been subject to teasing by older pupils.\n\nHaving appealed to the father and her uncle, with no effect, and her return not likely by moral persuasion, and in view of her age, should the truant officers be used, or should she be discharged?\n\nJ.E. Hugh\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, April 15th, 1947.\n\nMr. J.E. Pugh, Indian Agent,\nMorley, Alberta.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 4th instant, it has been decided to approve the discharge of Gordon Hunter, No. 50, and Maxine Rider, No. 0157, from the Morley Residential School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/NGD\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\nAgency: STONY\nBand: WESLEY\n\nChild's name: JOHN MORGAN ABRAHAM\nAge: 12\nWeight: 78 lbs.\nHeight: 5'9\"\nIs child undernourished?

Officer i/c Criminal Investigation Branch,\nper &.\nWith reference to the above and marginally noted report, the writer respectfully advises that \"Notice to Parent, Guardian or other Person by Truant Officer\" has been served on Isaiah CRAWLER, Indian of Nordegg in respect to Rose CRAWLER. CRAWLER could not be contacted sooner due to the fact that he was absent from his camp hunting squirrel. Service was made on the 25-12-47. Enquiries made at Nordegg among the Indians shows that Norman LEFRAID and John M. APABAHAN are presently residing on the Pelisko Reservation and have not been at Nordegg.\n\n2. CRAWLER was made thoroughly familiar with the contents of the \"Notice to Parent, etc.\" through an interpreter. He advised the writer that he did not have enough money to send his daughter back to the School at Morley. He was then advised to try to find the money and advise the writer. On the 27-12-47, CRAWLER advised that he had been unable to obtain sufficient money to send his daughter back to school and further advised that in his opinion, the Dept. of Indian Affairs was obliged to advance money for transportation of Students in the event that the parents did not have sufficient funds.\n\n3. At the present time, it would appear that CRAWLER will not be returning his daughter to School at the beginning of the new term and thus will be liable to prosecution. CRAWLER also advised that his daughter did not want to go back to school which might be another reason why he was unable to raise any money.\n\n4.

Pugh, Supt.\nStony Sarcee Agency.\n26th March, 1949.\n\nMr. J.E. Pugh,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nMorley, Alberta.\n\nWe have your letter of the 22nd instant with reference to the application which you have received for the discharge of Ronald Baptiste, No. 117, from the Morley Residential School.\n\nPresumably, the family has been able to get along without this boy's aid, and there is nothing in your letter to show that circumstances at home have changed to such an extent that they cannot continue to live without this boy's assistance.\n\nIn view of his age, we feel that it would be in his best interests to remain at the Morley Residential School for a further period, and consequently, the Department is not prepared to approve his discharge at the present time.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nExtract from the Minutes of a Meeting of the Stony Indian Band Council held on May 6th, 1949.\n\n12. Eli Rider made application for the discharge of his daughter from school, to look after his household. He was advised of the Baptiste case, and that no application would be made but notation made in the meeting minutes.\n\n(Sgd) John E.

Mrs. Enoch Baptiste, re application for discharge of Donald Baptiste made to Branch. Advised that application for this had been refused and an explanation made to the Council in regard to attendance at schools in general. Advised that no further application would be made, but that matter would appear in Minutes of the meeting.\n\n(Sgd) John E.

He then requested the writer to write Ottawa and ask permission to have Kathleen discharged from school.\n\nI questioned him as to why he wanted the girl home and his reply was that girls did not need education and that they did not learn anything at school.

Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Indian Agent Pringle, at Morley, enclosing receipts for the sum of $55.00, representing payment by Mr. Staley, Principal of the Big Hill Indian Residential School, for what is termed a 'pure bred Holstein Bull.' Mr. Pringle stated that he has had no word from the Department regarding this matter, but that Mr. Staley claimed he was informed that if the receipts were sent in, the Department would pay for the bull.\n\nWould it not have been better to deal with this matter through the Indian Agent? I cannot imagine what kind of a pure bred Holstein bull could have been bought for the sum of $55.00. At the sale in Calgary last week, Holstein bulls were sold for from $250.00 up; in fact Mr. Christianson, who is here, tells me that a pure bred Holstein bull cannot be bought for less than $250.00. Two years ago the Department bought five pure-bred cows for this school, and a great deal of trouble was taken by the Inspector to get the right sort of animal, and to use a bull of this kind should, in my opinion, be a great mistake. Mr. Christianson tells me that Mr. Staley does not know cattle. Would it not be better to carry on as we have been doing in the past and let such matters dealt with through the Department's officers? You are aware that a large percentage of our School Principals are not competent to buy cattle; it takes a trained man, and I can just imagine what the result is going to be if the price is any indication of what this animal is.\n\nI am not certifying to the account, because I am not sure that the Department did issue instructions of this kind to Mr. Staley, and the Agent is in the same position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, April 27, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 409-11A of the 13th instant, with reference to the purchase of a bull for the use of the Morley Indian Residential School. The Department issued no instructions in connection with this matter and you should return the receipts to the Rev. Principal with this comment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, May 14th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department understands that satisfactory arrangements have now been completed between the Principal of the Morley Indian Residential School and Mr. Sundgren with regard to Lots 7 and 8, Morleyville Settlement.\n\nThe Department has been requested to provide some live stock for this school. For your information, I may say that no funds have been specifically provided in the current year's appropriation for this purpose. Please let me know what additional live stock you consider is required at this school and the probable cost of obtaining same. On receipt of your reply, the matter will receive further consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nC. P. Schmidt, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter No. 115-1-14 dated the 14th ultimo re a request made by the Principal of Morley Indian Residential School for more live stock for the school, now that they have acquired Lots 7 and 8, Morleyville Settlement, for pastureage.\n\nIn the 10th instant I looked over the land in question, and found that it had been over-grazed last year, and probably for years previous, and suggested to the Principal that he complete rounding the fence around same, which he was doing at the time, and allow the land a complete rest this year, to give the grass an opportunity to come up. This he agreed to do on the understanding he would get 15 head of dual-purpose Shorthorn heifers and young cows next Spring.\n\nI naturally informed him that I could not make a promise, but asked him and Dr. W. B. Murray, the Agent, to place an item for this purpose in the Estimates for next year, which I would recommend.\n\nAs it is, I do not recommend purchasing more stock this year for the following reasons:\n\n1. The new pastureage acquired needs a complete rest, having been very badly over-grazed.\n\n2. Last year the Principal had to purchase feed for his stock, having been unable to provide same from his fields, and meadows on account of drought. Should same happen again this year, he will be hampered by having more stock and will have to sell off.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGrant Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nMorley, Alta., Jan. 19, 1958.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFollowing your letter No.409-11A, Sept. 8, Mr. Staley has seen the cattle of Jessie Starlight, and has applied that they be purchased by the Department for the use of the school.\n\nThe breeding stock consists of 8 cows at present market price of $25 each, and three heifers coming two at $20 each. Total value $200.\n\nMr. Staley further applies for the purchase of 4 additional cows at market price, which may be about $30 or $35 by the time the purchase is made, to make up the number of this lot to 15 head.\n\nI beg to recommend that this purchase be made.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nMr. C. P. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nCalgary, January 24th, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nReference your No. 119-1-14 under date May 14th, last, and my No. 409-11A, of June 14th, re request made to the Department to provide some live stock for the Morley Indian Residential School, I am attaching hereto copy of a letter received from Dr. W. Barr Murray, Indian Agent, asking that fifteen (15) cows and heifers be now provided.\n\nMrs. Gussie Starlight referred to by Agent Murray is an elderly widow, Treaty Indian, who transferred from the Sarcee Agency to the Stony. There being no one on the Sarcee to look after the cattle, these were transferred to the Stony Reserve this winter, and the same difficulty as regards feeding and caring for them has arisen there.\n\nRev. E. J. Staley, who called at this office today, says he has seen the cattle, and having sufficient feed on hand is anxious to increase his herd. If the Department can provide funds, I recommend that the purchase of the eleven (11) head from Widow Starlight be made, and that the money be placed to her credit and given to her in small payments when required, and approved of by the Indian Agent. Also, that the four (4) other cows mentioned in the last paragraph of Dr. Murray's letter be purchased, thus making a total of 15 head as mentioned in my letter referred to above. The latter 4 head will have to be purchased from outside. If authority is granted, I beg to ask that Mr. Agent Murray be instructed to make the purchases.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nDept. of Mines Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n& Resources, Alberta Inspectorate.\n\nC T A W A.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 29, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th instant you may arrange for the purchase of 11 head of cattle from Widow Starlight for the Morley Indian Residential School. It is noted from the Agent's letter that these can be secured at a total cost of $260.\n\nOur funds will not permit purchase of the 4 additional cows mentioned in the Agent's letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:-\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Indian Agent Pringle, at Morley, enclosing receipts for the sum of $55.00 representing payment by Mr. Staley, Principal of the Morley Indian Residential School, for what is termed a 'pure bred Holstein Bull.' Mr. Pringle states that he has had no word from the Department regarding this matter, but that Mr. Staley claimed he was informed that if the receipts were sent in, the Department would pay for the bull.\n\nWould it not have been better to deal with this matter through the Indian Agent? I cannot imagine what kind of a pure bred Holstein bull could have been bought for the sum of $55.00. At the sale in Calgary last week, Holstein bulls were sold for from $250.00 up; in fact Mr. Christianson, who is here, tells me that a pure bred Holstein bull cannot be bought for less than $250.00. Two years ago the Department bought five thoroughbred cows for this school, and a great deal of trouble was taken by the Inspector to get the right type of animal, and to use a bull of this kind would, in my opinion, be a great mistake. Mr. Christianson tells me that Mr. Staley does not know cattle. Would it not be better to carry on as we have been doing in the past and have such matters dealt with through the Department's officers? You are aware that a large percentage of our School Principals are not competent to buy cattle; it takes a trained man, and I can just imagine what the result is going to be if the price is any indication of what this animal is.\n\nI am not certifying to the account, because I am not sure that the Department did issue instructions of this kind to Mr. Staley, and the Agent is in the same position.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, April 27, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 409-11A of the 13th instant, with reference to the purchase of a bull for the use of the Morley Indian Residential School. The Department issued no instructions in connection with this matter and you should return the receipts to the Rev. Principal with this comment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Department understands that satisfactory arrangements have now been completed between the Principal of the Morley Indian Residential School and Mr. Sundgren with regard to Lots 7 and 8, Morleyville Settlement.\n\nThe Department has been requested to provide some live stock for this school. For your information, I may say that no funds have been specifically provided in the current year's appropriation for this purpose. Please let me know what additional live stock you consider is required at this school and the probable cost of obtaining same. On receipt of your reply, the matter will receive further consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nC. P. Schmidt, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter No. 116-1-14 dated the 14th ultimo, requesting me to advise Principal of Morley Indian Residential School for more live stock for the school, now that they have acquired Lots 7 and 8, Morleyville Settlement, for pasture.\n\nOn the 10th instant I looked over the land in question, and found that it had been over-grazed last year, and probably for years previous, and suggested to the Principal that he complete repairing the fence around same, which he promised at the time, and allow the land a complete rest this year, to give the grass seed a chance to come up. This he agreed to do on the understanding he would get 15 head of dual-purpose Shorthorn heifers and young cows next Spring.\n\nI naturally informed him that I could not make a promise, but asked him and Dr. W. B. Murray, the Agent, to place an item for this purpose in the Estimates for next year, which I would recommend.\n\nAs it is, I do not recommend purchasing more stock this year for the following reasons:\n\n1. The new pastureage acquired needs a complete rest, having been very badly over-grazed.\n\n2. Last year the Principal had to purchase feed for his stock, having been unable to provide same from his fields, due to drought. Should more happen again this year, he will be hampered by having more stock and will have to sell off.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGrant, Schwidt,\nInspector of Indian Affairs,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nMorley, Alta., Jan. 19, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nFollowing your letter No.409-11A, Sept. 8,\nMr. Staley has seen the cattle of Gusie Starlight,\nand has applied that they be purchased by the Department\nfor the use of the school.\n\nThe breeding stock consists of 5 cows at\npresent market price of $25 each, and three heifers\ncoming two at $20 each. Total value $260.\n\nMr. Staley further applies for the purchase of\n4 additional cows at market price, which may be about\n$30 or $35 by the time the purchase is made, to make up\nthe number of this lot to 15 head.\n\nI beg to recommend that this purchase be made.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nMr. C. P. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nSir:\n\nReference your No. 119-1-14 under date May 14th, last, and my No. 409-11A. of June 14th, re request made to the Department to provide some live stock for the Morley Indian Residential School, I am attaching hereto copy of a letter received from Dr. W. Barr Murray, Indian Agent, asking that fifteen (15) cows and heifers be now provided.\n\nMrs. Gussie Starlight referred to by Agent Murray is an elderly widow, Treaty Indian, who transferred from the Sarcee Agency to the Stony. There being no one on the Sarcee who would look after the cattle, these were transferred to the Stony Reserve this winter, and the same difficulty as regards feeding and caring for them has arisen there.\n\nRev. E. J. Staley, who called at this office today, says he has seen the cattle, and having sufficient feed on hand is anxious to increase his herd. If the Department can provide funds, I recommend that the purchase of the eleven (11) head from Widow Starlight be made, and that the money be placed to her credit and given to her in small payments when required, and approved of by the Indian agent. Also, that the four (4) other cows mentioned in the last paragraph of Dr. Murray's letter be purchased, this to make a total of 15 head as mentioned in my letter referred to above. The latter 4 head will have to be purchased from outside. If authority is granted, I beg to ask that Dr. Agent Murray be instructed to make the purchases.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 29, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th instant you may arrange for the purchase of 11 head of cattle from Widow Starlight for the Morley Indian Residential School. It is noted from the Agent's letter that these can be secured at a total cost of $260.\n\nOur funds will not permit purchase of the 4 additional cows mentioned in the Agent's letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

These heifers would be of the beef type & of either Hereford or Shorthorn breeding.\n\nA sum of \u00a31000.00 was asked in the 1936-1937 estimates for this purpose, but against this there would probably be a charge of \u00a3260.00 for 11 head purchased from the Sarcee reserve during the winter.\n\nMr. Staley also asks that he be reimbursed in the sum of \u00a375.00 which was the amount paid for a purebred Hereford bull, bought at the Calgary Bull Sale this Spring.

Hoey  \nSupt. of Welfare & Training  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nYou will recall that you were good enough two years ago to start us off in the fur farming business at the school and while as yet it is perhaps premature to begin to get enthusiastic about it, I can see that even if it is no gold mine it is a promising proposition. This year for the first time we shall be able to carry into account no capital expenditure for supplies or equipment and so I shall be able to furnish you with a much better idea of the situation this fall.\n\nJust a few rough figures. Last year we pelleted 75 mink. The grading of these showed a wide range in quality; the prices realized were all the way from $25.00 to $15.00. Moreover, we had a profit on the sale of $215. This year we have at the present time 50 breeding stock; all this, with the exception of some more males we purchased this spring, from the original investment of 6 mink of two years ago.\n\nThe Indian boys have taken to the work in a very fine way and I believe now that at least a dozen boys could find employment if they so desired among the large fur ranches in the vicinity of Calgary.\n\nWith average fur prices in the next few years the venture is a good one that we have every intention of giving a full and complete trial.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Residential School  \nUnited Church of Canada  \nRev. E. J. Staley, Principal\n\nMorley, Alta.  \nApril 17, 1941\nOttawa, April 22, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. Staley:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th instant and to thank you very heartily for the information contained therein.\n\nIt was to me and the officials here a source of satisfaction to learn that the mink ranch established at your school a couple of years ago has been reasonably successful. The fact that a number of Indian pupils have taken an active interest in this project is particularly encouraging.\n\nI was very much interested in your comments on the organization created at Morley by a group of the girl pupils. I am hopeful that a number of these organizations will develop at residential schools throughout the Dominion.\n\nI want you to feel free to send forward suggestions at any time with respect to changes that might be made in the course of study. If, in your judgment, a selected number of pupils could be given a short course of training in hunting and trapping, a recommendation to this effect would be very favorably considered by the officials here. A number of safeguards, however, would have to be erected and we would have to guard against the danger that would arise by the average boy looking upon this period as a mere holiday period or a time for rest and relaxation. This is a matter that you might discuss also with Mr. Doucet when he visits your school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nReverend E. J.

I am not sure that it is other than a good way of getting some revenue and giving the boys some idea of how they can find employment on a fur ranch. So far as developing fur farming amongst the Indians on the Morley Reserve is concerned, I think that is quite hopeless, because they will not stay at home all the year, and, after all, that is what is necessary.\n\nYours sincerely,\nGeo.

J. Staley,\n\n[Signature]\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of a request from Rev. E.J. Stealey, asking that consideration be given to the purchase of a new binder for the use of the School farm.

Gooderham Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nCalgary, Alta., 25 March 1912\n\nThe Assistant Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI write to draw your attention to the position our Church is in in regard to the new Blackfoot Boarding School. We were led to believe last fall that the school would likely be about the 1st December, and urged to have the staff in readiness. We accordingly engaged the Rev. Mr. Gardiner as Principal; he and his wife were on the ground by the first of October. The farm instructor and his wife were there by the 1st December and an Archdeacon has been there since the 1st of this month.\n\nWe have no provision for the salaries or maintenance of these people till the school opens and begin to earn a grant, and since acting in good faith on the Department's instructions we desired the staff as early as possible in\nCALGARY INDIAN MISSIONS\n\nVen. Archdeacon Fans\nSecretary-Treasurer\n\nCalgary, Alta., 191\u2014\n\nhope the Department will consider itself responsible for the salaries and maintenance until such time as the school is completed, especially as the delay is in no way owing to ourselves.\n\nWe fear from what we hear that further delay will be necessary owing to the quality and insufficient supply of water on the spot.\n\nI may say that we have been obliged to advance the salaries to the 30 December amounting to $144.17. But we have no funds to meet the present quarter's salary amounting to about $65.00 or to pay the cost of their maintenance details of which are not yet to hand.\n\nI shall be glad to have the assurance of the Department that all money paid out for salaries and maintenance prior to the completion of the school and its water supply\nCALGARY INDIAN MISSIONS\n\nVen. Archdeacon Fans\nSecretary-Treasurer\n\nCalgary, Alta., 191\u2014\n\n(Which must be remedied before the children can be taken in) will be defended by the Department.\n\nI am,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. W. Fans\nIndian Agent's Office,\n\nFebruary 5th, 1918\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise the Department there are lbs of Biscuits on hand in the storehouse here, not likely used since Old Suns Day School closed.\n\nAs the biscuit is likely to be destroyed left here, on account of mice, I would be pleased if the Department would let me know what I am to do with it.\n\nYours in Obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, April 6, 1912.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo in reference to the payment of salaries of the staff at the Old Guns Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, if you will refer to the official correspondence with His Lordship the Bishop of Calgary, you will find that the appointment of Rev. Mr. Gandier as Principal was to take effect when the school was ready for occupation. In view of this arrangement it seems strange that the Principal should have been installed in the position so long ago as October 15th last, at a time when there was no immediate prospect of there being any work for him.\n\nAs to the Farming Instructor, who has been at the school since December 1st last, I may say that this is apparently the first intimation the Department has had of the appointment, an intimation which under the circumstances would not have been ratified, as there was no prospect of work for such an employee for sometime after that date. These latter remarks apply also in the case of the Assistant Matron.\n\nI have, therefore, to say that the Department cannot assume any obligation for the salaries of a staff.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. W. Tims,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, October 24, 1912.\n\nVenerable Sir,\n\nMr. D. C. Scott, Superintendent of Indian Education, who recently visited some of the Indian schools in your diocese, reports that the Principals of the Old Guns and Peigan Boarding Schools, conducted under the auspices of your church, had not been supplied with copies of the agreement between the church authorities and the Department for the maintenance and management of these institutions and were consequently ignorant to a certain extent of their responsibilities.\n\nIt seems strange to the Department that you should not have made them aware of the conditions under which these schools are managed and the Department is sending them by concurrent mail copies of the agreement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. STEWART\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. W. Tins,\nCalgary, Alta.\nOttawa November 14, 1912.\n\nRight Rev.

The Agent states that the Principal is handicapped in having to act as teacher as well as Principal and that he finds it difficult to fill both these duties satisfactorily. When he is teaching he is often wanted elsewhere to attend to other matters and the class-room work is thus interrupted.\n\nIn view of the enrolment now attained and the prospect of obtaining the full quota in the near future, the Department has to request that you will be good enough to obtain the services of a teacher with as little delay as possible.\n\nThe Department is pleased to learn that the members of the staff are performing their duties satisfactorily and that the school is kept in good order.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your of 27 December (117004/1) I have to say that while the numbers in residence remain under forty the church does not consider it possible to provide a teacher in addition to the Principal and Farmer. The Principal is a Certificated teacher but his duties as such have naturally been somewhat interfered with recently by the almost daily visits of the Indians at all hours to see recent arrivals or to bring in new pupils. As soon as the pupils are settled down these interruptions will probably cease to a large extent.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. Archibald Ross\nSecretary-Treasurer\nThe Church is anxious as the Department to carry on the school as efficiently as possible, but up to date it has paid out more for salaries than has been received from the Department in grants.\n\nAs soon as the number of pupils reaches forty the Church will find a teacher to assist the principal in class work.\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

In view of this information I have to ask you to be good enough to submit a statement showing the amount of money received by you in payment of the per capita earnings at this school and also disbursements made on behalf of the school during the past year.

This school has been without a regular teacher since the 1st of November last. The Principal has been doing this work since the date mentioned. It goes without saying that with a staff of five, thirty seven children and extensive buildings to care for the staff is too limited, by at least two.\n\n9. The staff is too limited in numbers to properly keep this institution in the order it should at all times be kept and the apparent reason seems to be lack of funds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n(sgd) J.A.

Frequent changes of teachers is not productive of rapid advancement of the pupils even if all are efficient for it takes some time for the teacher to learn the temper of the individual pupil and time for the pupils to understand the teacher. When these conditions are taken into consideration I think the pupils have advanced reasonably well at their studies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd.) J.A. Markle\nInspector.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report that I inspected the Old Sun's residential school on the 15th inst.\n\nI was informed that the previous teacher was succeeding well, had good control of the pupils and that the pupils were daily advancing under her tutelage. I may say that it does not appear reasonable to me to expect efficient teachers to remain for long periods on the small salary offered. When the Department and the various Church authorities were arranging new terms and additional per capita grant I feared at the time that some of the schools would suffer for the want of efficient teachers if no such provision was made and the result has been about what I predicted. When 3rd class teachers are able to command equal to $55.00 per month and board it is not reasonable to expect them to accept about $20.00 per month in an Indian school and where the working hours are usually longer than they are in a country school. If ever the per capita grant to these schools is again considered I trust that the foregoing suggestion will receive attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n(sgd) J.A. Markle\nInspector.\nOttawa, February 3, 1915.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report on the Old Guns Boarding School from its Inspector, in which he states that the school has been without a regular teacher since the first of November, last, and that the Principal has been doing this work since that date. He considers that the staff is too limited in numbers to keep the institution in the order that it should be kept at all times. It is also stated that during the eighteen months the school has been in operation there have been several teachers. Frequent change of teachers is not productive of rapid advancement to the pupils even though all are efficient. Under the last teacher it is stated that the pupils were getting on well and she had good control of them. The reason assigned for the frequent changes is that the salary paid is too small to secure a permanent staff.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will be able to secure the services of a competent teacher for this school, who will be offered sufficient inducement to remain permanently.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. W. Tims,\nCalgary, Alta.\nCALGARY INDIAN MISSIONS\n\nParlee Reserve,\nCalgary, Alta., 11 Oct. 1914\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of 3rd (117004/1), re the Inspector's visit to our new school.\n\nIn reply I may say the Inspector was uninformed as to the date of the teacher leaving the school. Miss Foster was there until the last week in November. She was a competent teacher and was the second teacher we have had since the school was opened. She did not leave on account of the insufficiency of the salary but to become a bride.\n\nThe Principal has been authorized to secure another teacher but during the meantime the Principal will have a good man to assist him in the institution,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Seal]\nCALGARY INDIAN MISSIONS\n\nSarcee Reserve,\nCalgary, Alta.,\n\nis teaching in the Class-room.\n\nA great deal of additional work and worry is laid upon the Principal just now owing to the state of the water system. Writing last week Mr. Gaudier says:\n\n\"The water is a worry. The pump is wearing out, not being broken to pieces. The joints in the pipes leading to the pressure tank are leaking and I can't stop them with packing. We cannot get water into the tank so water is being carried into the residence in pails. I have to put water into the steam boiler by hand\u2014a hard tedious work.\"\n\nWe are of the opinion that the staff can keep the institution in order provided they are not handicapped as they now are by an inadequate water supply and the difficulty they have in obtaining such water as they can.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. Tims\nExtract from the Inspector's Report on the Old Sun's Boarding School dated Feb. 17, 1916. Original on 117004-6.\n\nThis School, at its present location, has been in operation about 2\u00bd years and during that period there has been about 7 other teachers of one kind and another. Under such conditions satisfactory progress of the pupils in class work could not be expected and in my opinion has not been realized.\n\nIf these pupils were proficient in the standards enumerated there would not be much ground for complaint as regards advancement. My impression is, however, that the majority classes under standards III and IV would be more correctly rated if in standard II.\n\nIn my opinion this institution has seldom, if ever, had a full staff to properly handle the work. Although Mr. Moore is herein reported to be employed I understand that he had recently resigned. Another male and another female should constantly be employed to keep the outside and inside work up to a reasonable standard. Now the larger boys are expected to help at various duties and too much I suspect without direct supervision. Such supervision I consider absolutely necessary about an institution of this sort for if otherwise they acquire slovenly habits at their work and such habits are most likely to remain with them in after life. The same may be the outcome with the girls and for the want of close and proper supervision when they are engaged at various household duties. Moreover I entertain the opinion anyway that the boys do not spend sufficient time in the class-room. Not more than two boys should be absent from class work any school day and these two for not longer than a half day for stated days in each week. During the season of gardening and farming such a rule might be deviated from with advantage to the larger boys, providing they are closely supervised at such work and idleness on the part of these pupils guarded against.\n\nSgd. J. Markle, Inep\nOttawa, February 29, 1916.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department is in receipt of a report on the old Sun's Boarding School from Mr. Inspector Markle from which it would appear that he is still of the opinion that the staff at this school is too small to properly carry on the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. W. Tiss,\nCalgary, Alta.\nOttawa, October 19, 1916.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to call your attention to the unsatisfactory condition of the Old Suns Boarding School as shown by a late inspection report.\n\nThe Inspector states that there seems to be an entire want of discipline and order. The floors or wall did not appear clean and the bake house was filthy, bags of flour lying around on the dirty floor and indications of mice in the flour. The building is overrun with mice and apparently nothing has been done to destroy them. A want of care seemed to prevail all over the buildings and there was a noticeable lack of management and constant changes in the staff. The Inspector also says that pails are used for toilets in the dormitories and then carried to the lavatories next morning, when they are emptied and left and they smell horribly. He considers that the children could be trained to use the closets made for them, without having to use the pails.\n\nThe Inspector remarks that this school is anything but the object lesson it should be, as it is close to the station and in easy access to the public, who might visit it.\n\nFrequent complaints have been made of the management of this school without any effect and it is trusted that it will not be necessary to again call your attention\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. W. Tims,\nCalgary, Alta.\nto the matter. The principal and his wife are said to be very nice people, but without the faintest idea of managing an institution of this sort.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\nOld Lewis Boarding School,\nGlenbow, Alberta\n13th October 1916\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Gaudier has permission from the Bishop to be absent for special Theological studies at Wycliffe College, Toronto - for the period of three months. During his absence the Bishop has asked me to come into residence - & I therefore write to report the fact which I hope will meet with your approval.\n\nA few days before Mr. Gaudier left, two of our older girls ran away, just before the tea bell rang & were not recovered until about 7 a.m. the following day. Mr. Gaudier went himself in search of them, & less than half an hour after the girls disappeared, he reported the same to the parents, & then to the police, who sent out the native scouts. The girls appear to have taken shelter in the house of Harry Reddish Gun, whom they accused (rightly or wrongly) of assault. The statements of the girls & certain evidence given by the school matron, were of so serious a nature that Mr.\nGaudier felt it his duty, with my own approval\u2014to lay a charge against Harry Reddick Gun. The Sergeant of Police, with interpreter\u2014interviewed the girls & collected as much 'evidence' as possible, & it certainly looked very serious. When the preliminary hearing came off before Mr. Vigas J.P., the relatives of Harry Reddick Gun employed a lawyer, who did all he could to upset & 'scare' the girls\u2014who are under 15 years of age\u2014with the result that they opened their lips, and the case was dismissed on insufficient evidence.\n\nI feel strongly that such cases as these should be undertaken by a sympathetic lawyer in behalf of the Crown; on the ground that these poor people are wards of the government.\n\nI can assure you, the utmost vigilance exists among both girls & boys, & that everything we can possibly do for them is being done, for their general good\u2014and I must say the general behavior of our children is really excellent.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nH.W. Gibbon Stockton\nActing Principal\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Address: \"Cyclone College, Doncaster\"]\n\n[Note: The Rev. M.C.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant reporting that at the request of the Bishop of Calgary you have taken temporary charge of the Old Suns Boarding School during the absence of the Principal, the Rev. M. G. Gandier, and also reporting the circumstances connected with the case of two girls in this school, who ran away and took shelter in the house of Harry Reddish Gun, who was prosecuted for criminal assault and the case was dismissed on the ground of insufficient evidence.\n\nThe Department agrees with you that a lawyer should have been engaged for the prosecution and before proceedings were taken against Harry Reddish Gun the Agent should have been communicated with, when no doubt counsel would have been obtained. As the case has been dismissed no further action can be taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nRev. H. W. Gibbon Stocken,\nActing Principal,\nOld Suns Boarding School,\nGleichen, Alta.\nOttawa, October 31, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from the Rev. H. W. Gibbon Stocken, Acting Principal of the Old Suns Boarding School, in which he states that shortly before Mr. Grandier, the Principal, left two of the older girls ran away just before the tea bell rang and were not recovered until about 7 a.m. the following day. He says that the girls appear to have taken shelter in the house of Harry Reddish Gun, whom they accused of assault, and that the statements of the girls and certain evidence given by the school matron were of so serious a nature that a charge was laid against Harry Reddish Gun, but the case was dismissed on account of insufficient evidence.\n\nThe Department would like to have a full report from you in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nJ. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Rev. Canon Stocken, Acting Principal of Old Suns Boarding School as follows:\n\n\"An epidemic of whooping cough which has been at work on the reserve and in town for weeks past has entered our School, and four or five cases are down with it, necessitating the attention of a trained nurse. I learn from Archdeacon Tims that our School funds cannot stand the extra expense, in view of the increased cost of food, etc., and he asks me to ask you to approach the Department in the matter, in the hope that they may see their way to sanction the employment of a nurse for the purpose, at $15.00 a week, which is $20. less than the usual charge. I understand they sanctioned the employment of a nurse at the Peigan School (the Victoria Home) when measles broke out last spring.\"\n\nThere is no doubt that additional help is required at the School, and if it is customary for the Department to pay nurses for cases of this kind, would recommend that the same be done in this case.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter dated Oct. 31st, No. 11704/1 in regard to the two girls who ran away from Old Suns School, and on account of whom a charge was laid against Harry Reddish Gun, I have to report as follows:\n\nI have gone carefully through all the evidence and find it so conflicting that no reliance could be placed in it. Harry Reddish Gun, the accused, is one of our best farmers, and one of our most reliable young men, and is a married man with one child. Harry, with his wife and child, and an ex-pupil, David Greasy Forehead, were living in a tent near his own house.\n\nOn the night the girls ran away from school, they came to Harry's tent about 7 P.M., and according to the evidence left there about 9 P.M. Harry's wife was with them in the tent all this time. She sent them away lest they should get into trouble for keeping them. David, the boy who worked for Harry, and another ex-pupil, Donald McMaster, Jr., were outside of the tent the greater part of the time, and are supposed to have heard the conversation.\n\nThe girls stated that after leaving the tent, they slept in the stocks all night. The two boys mentioned are supposed to have slept in Harry's house, as they came out of the house in the morning.\n\nI may say that both boys and girls from this school\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nschool have in the past been allowed to go home on Saturdays, and sometimes failed to return until Sunday or even Monday. I spoke to the Principal several times about this, but the practice was continued until this took place, since which time it has been discontinued.\n\nEvery opportunity was given to the girls to give their evidence, but they refused to be sworn, and their stories were so conflicting that no dependence could be placed upon them.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 23, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant embodying a copy of a communication which you have received from the Acting Principal of the Old Suns Boarding School, in which he states that there are four or five cases of whooping cough in the school, necessitating the attention of a trained nurse, and asks the Department to sanction the employment of a nurse for the purpose at $15.00 a week.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will allow $15.00 a week for the services of a nurse to look after the children who are sick with whooping cough. It is considered that the nurse should not be required for more than a month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGlenburn, Alta.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR MARKLE ON THE OLD SUNS BOARDING SCHOOL.\n\n14. This school is located on 160 acres of fairly good land and my impression is that if a fairly practical farmer was employed and retained for reasonable periods, that considerable farm products could be grown and that such products would be of considerable importance with regard to the financial aspect of the school. I do not think, however, that an efficient man for the position of farmer can now be secured for $40.00 per month and board. A married man would likely remain for longer periods than would a single man. My impression is that few married men would accept such a position, if he were efficient, and reside within the school. He would expect a cottage for the exclusive use of himself and wife.\n\nUnless there are very radical changes made at this institution I am not likely to be convinced that the annual expenditure to the Department for this Institution is worth to the interested Indians its cost. The Church, under whose auspices it is, apparently have not funds available to properly conduct it, if it has the ability and the rapid advance in the cost of foodstuffs etc., during the last year or two years has strained its resources to the breaking point.\n\nDate of Inspection\u2014February 28th, 1916.\nOttawa, March 9, 1918.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report on the Old Suns Boarding School, in which it is stated that radical changes are necessary there.\n\nIt is stated that, if a fairly practical farmer were employed and retained for reasonable periods, considerable farm products could be grown and that such products would be of considerable importance with regard to the financial aspect of the school. However, an efficient man for this position can hardly be secured now for $40.00 per month and board.\n\nIt is hoped that there will be an improvement this year in the farming operations at this school and that better reports will be received in future.\n\nI may inform you that unless some changes are made there the Department will have to take into consideration the question of closing this school, as the expenditure incurred for it is not justified by the results obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

The farm employed there for the past year was a practical farmer of some years experience and we thought ourselves fortunate in securing his services.\n\nThe school had about 30 acres under cultivation last season, and grew a variety of things such as alfalfa, wheat, oats, barley, and roots as well as vegetables.\n\nThe school has not been able to go largely into farming because of the initial cost of breaking up the ground as well as the small number of boys capable of assisting.\nOttawa, April 13, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nOn the receipt of your report of the 12th of February, last, on the Old Sams Boarding School the Venerable Archdeacon Tims was written to and informed that the Department has been advised that some radical changes are necessary at this school. He was also informed of your remarks in connection with the farming operations there and that, unless some changes are made at the school, the Department will have to take into consideration the question of closing it, as the expenditure incurred for it is not justified by the results obtained.\n\nThe Department is now in receipt of a communication from Archdeacon Tims, in which he says that he would be glad if you would state specifically in what way the school fails to satisfy you and they would then endeavour to so arrange matters to meet the wishes of the Department.\n\nKindly let the Department know what changes you consider should be made at this institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Tims,\nSarcee Reserve,\nCalgary, Alta.\nSir,\n\nAnswering your letter of the 15th ultimo I have the honour to state that when I wrote my report of the 14th of February, on the inspection of the Old Sun's school, I wondered why it was that so good results had not been obtained from the garden at the Old Sun's, since it has been operated at the present site, as has been obtained, only on a larger scale, of late years at the Sarcee school and which I think the Venerable Archdeacon will admit was a great help to the institution under his direct charge. I have already stated in my reports on the Sarcee school that the garden was a credit to the institution. Moreover, the stock were better cared for of late years at the Sarcee school\u2014so I thought, anyway.\n\nMy impression is that there never has been anyone in charge of the farm, the stock or the garden at the Old Sun's school with the capacity for such work as the Mr. A.R. Holt who was employed, and glad if still there, as farmer at the Sarcee institution. If Mr. Holt, or some one of equal capacity, can be secured to take charge of the farm, the stock and the garden work at the Old Sun's I'm confident that better results will be attained than were attained in the past. The example to both the Indian children and their parents when stock, farm and garden work thoroughly done cannot be estimated.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n[Signature]\n\nInsp.\nOttawa, May 15, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant in regard to the farming and gardening operations at the Old Guns Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Archdeacon Tims is informed that you are of the opinion that, if a good man can be secured to look after this work at this school better results will be obtained than in the past.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

R. Holt, who was employed at the Sarcee School. Mr. Markle also states that, if Mr. Holt, or someone of equal capacity, can be secured to take charge of the farm, the stock and the garden work at the Old Sun's School, that better results will be obtained than were obtained in the past.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Gooderham Esq.,\nIndian Agent, Blackfoot Reserve,\n\nDear Mr. Gooderham,\n\nI have carefully considered the question of a team of brood mares for the use of the school \u2014 the purchase of which the Department sanctioned, on the agreement to repay by installments \u2014 and I am now anxious to put a different proposition before you.\n\nI have satisfied myself that even with a good big team, I shall never be able to break & disc even 40 acres at this time of the year. I have tried for the last 2 years and again this year to get 60 acres broken for us \u2014 I have tried to secure both white men & Indians & have had promises from both \u2014 but both have failed me. Only a week or two ago I offered a man with a tractor $6 an acre to break 60 acres for me, he wanted me to provide the gasoline as well, which seemed to me utterly unreasonable, & I am still struggling to get the work done.\nMy proposition is this\u2014 I can buy a tractor (the \"Bachelor Boy\") and can see my way to finance the same inside 18 months, if the Department will allow the cost of a team to be transferred to the tractor, as the first cash payment. This amount (about $500) would be repaid to the Department inside five years\u2014I think I can promise it in 2\u00bd years, without relying upon crops.\n\nOur pigs will bring us in between $800 and $1000 within the next six or seven months\u2014six of them will be fit for market about September.\n\nWe have two young beef cattle coming on, and prospect of more.\n\nThe potato crop appears healthy & promising. It should yield several tons more than well, & should yield several tons more than will be required for our own use.\n\nI am not building on any crop of wheat or oats\u2014though they are not yet in a hopeless condition. Our rape is good.\n\nThe cost of having to buy oats & hay for a big team promises to be very high. If we can avoid this expense by securing a tractor at once we shall really save a considerable sum.\nWith the tractor we could not only do our breaking but all our summer fallowing - we could use it with the cutting & binding. We could also use it for hauling our coal from the Station - bring large loads, too save the cost of paying the Brown Transfer people to haul it for us, where purchased by the Carload.\n\nWe have examined the \"Waterloo Boy\" tractor carefully & have watched it breaking some of the hardest lands round here, & are satisfied that it is a good reliable affair. It is very highly spoken by men who have handled tractors for years.\n\nI may add that if we get the machine we shall endeavour as soon as our own breaking is finished, to break land for anyone else so as to bring in cash towards its cost.\n\nMr. Armstrong, who will have the handling of the outfit, is a man of considerable experience & will teach our senior boy to use it successfully.\n\nI shall be glad if the Department will sanction the transfer of the amount named from the team to the tractor.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.W. Gibbon Stocken\n\nPrincipal\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNo. 85\nALSO\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER\n\n25th June 1918\n\nI am enclosing a letter from Rev. Cannon Stocken, which is self explanatory, and may add, that I consider the proposition a very good one.\n\nI saw this tractor demonstrating on the School farm, and it did good work.\n\nAs the breaking season is well advanced, will you please wire if this exchange is allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secty.\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nPurchase of team authorized by letter dated May 27/18 to agent Goldham in file 4270174.\nOttawa, July 3, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nIn May, last, Mr. Agent Gooderham forwarded an application from the Rev. Canon Gibbon Stocken, Acting Principal of the Old Suns Boarding School, for assistance in obtaining a team of horses for carrying on farming operations at the school. Mr. Gooderham was authorized to purchase a suitable team for this work, the purchase price of which was to be repaid in five annual instalments, the first instalment to be deducted from the per capita grant due the school after the first crop is taken off.\n\nA letter has just been received from Mr. Gooderham enclosing another communication from Canon Stocken, a copy of which is enclosed herewith, in which he states that he wishes to substitute a tractor in place of the team which was authorized.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to deal with this application as you consider in the best interests of the school. It is just a question whether the Indians on the reserve, who have a number of horses, could not do the necessary breaking. As it is urgent that something should be done at once, I should be pleased if you would take this matter up with Mr. Agent Gooderham as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, July 5, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo enclosing a communication from the Rev. Canon Gibbon Stocken, Acting Principal of the Old Guns Boarding School, in which he asks if the Department will sanction the transfer of the amount authorized for the purchase of a team of horses for this school to the purchase of a tractor.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a copy of Canon Stocken's letter is being sent to Mr. Commissioner Graham, who has been instructed to deal with this application as he considers in the best interests of the school. He has also been asked to take this matter up with you as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nOttawa, August 20, 1919.\n\nNOTE:\u2014\n\nF. H. Gentleman, late teacher of the John Smith's Indian Day School, has been appointed Principal of the Old Guns Boarding School, to take charge on or about the first of September, 1919. For all correspondence regarding this transfer see file 117084-1A (John Smith's Day School).\nOld Sun School,\nGlacier, Alta.,\nNovember 8,\n1919.\n\n529546\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 311398 of the 4th inst. stating that Bonus cheques for the month of July will be paid as soon as possible. These will be acceptable, but to learn that we are only entitled to the month of July more than astonishes me.\n\nI am fully aware that under the arrangements for the care of Boarding schools no name would not appear on the pay list of the Department, but the fact remains that I am still teaching Indian children coupled with proper responsibilities from John Smith's reserve, and in addition to this I have your letter before me in which you agreed to pay the transfer from John Smith's reserve to the Blackfoot reserve, as it would be considered a transfer within the Department; and so my mind a transfer within the Department carries with it such benefits that we have previously enjoyed unless otherwise stated. I did not think for one minute that my giving up John Smith's school at a rather unjust desire of the Department that it meant giving up the Bonus cheques and your letter of June 23rd, does not dismiss me from the Department's employ, as under the arrangement for Indian Education with the Churches the practice is for you to state to, in John Smith's case, His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan that my services in the school was not satisfactory, give him the reason and request a new teacher to be nominated. You failed to do this for the simple reason that there was nothing that justified your so doing. His Lordship wished me to remain doing so far as saying that he would take the responsibility of my doing so, and take such action with the authorities of the Church. This excuse a reason to be forthcoming for our removal.\n\nNOV 27 1919\nFurthermore in addition to the Bishop's support, after enquiry Mr. Knepp also saw fit to support my claims as, as he says in his letter to me, that he had heard good reports of my work at John Smith's, and on the face of this it appears that you contend that the reports of these gentlemen are not truthful ones.\n\nSo far, you have given no reasons for your statement that my services at John Smith's were unsatisfactory, although you have had the opportunity of doing so to the Bishop of Saskatchewan and also myself, and while I greatly desire to know what these charges might be, it is only reasonable that I compare the work of the Indian Agents at the Pagans, and here, as well as the schools themselves, with our late home, and Mr. J.F. Schmidt whom appears to have received directly opposite instructions on school matters to those issued by Messrs Graham & Gooderham. The class work of neither of these schools can touch my work. You have seen fit to issue a diploma to a late pupil of this school and the writing book that is forwarded with this letter is the best of a pile I have found here. My school work was acknowledged by Provincial Inspectors as Prince Albert fair as creditable, and I will submit the John Smith's children's books with these before as if you wish. As a sample of what you might look for I also enclose work of the girls here that I would rather not comment upon. Before I could start the work of the classrooms I had to go to Mr. Gooderham for sisters and pencils for there was just nothing in the schoolroom other than a pile of dirty writing books and a few readers with most of the pages torn out; the blackboards are scratched, the walls are filthy and the floors and windows have not been cleaned in the schoolroom to the knowledge of the kitchen matron for the last four years.\n\nIn addition to this one of the boys is serving a term of imprisonment in Lethbridge Jail, and the condition of three or\nfor the eldest girls is such that their discharge will have to be made within a few weeks as maternity cases are just an impossibility in an establishment of this kind. I have also before me an account for work done on this building which has not received the sanction of the Department, which seems to be the practice here; a matter which I cannot refrain from pointing out in view of the fact that I never submitted an account from John Smiths for which I did not hold the Agents authority.\n\nUnderstand that I am not finding fault with the late management of this establishment, but your action, just or otherwise in bringing about our removal from John Smiths at a great loss to ourselves, has only given me cause to seek reasons by comparing the work of others under the Departments direction with my own, and in conclusion I must say that I fail entirely to see why these bonus cheques should not be continued.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 28, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant relative to the continuing of the bonus to you as Principal of the Old Suns Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as you were advised by official letter of the 4th instant, you and Mrs. Gentleman are entitled to the bonus for the month of July, the last month for which you received salary from this Department. As Principal of the Old Suns School your salary is not paid by the Department, but by the Church authorities. It is hoped that the balance of bonus due to you and Mrs. Gentleman will be paid at an early date, as soon as the pay list has been approved by the Civil Service Commission.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. J. MacKenzie\nfor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nP. H. Gentleman, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nOld Suns Boarding School,\nGlenichen, Alta.\nDecember 5, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Gentleman,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 19th ultimo, I may say that I am glad to observe that you have so earnest a desire to bring about progress at the Old Sun's school, and I certainly agree with you that there is much room for improvement there.\n\nYour request with regard to school material that is required should be embodied in the form of a requisition and forwarded to the Department through the Indian Agent in the usual manner.\n\nI trust that you will be successful in your work, and I shall be glad to hear from you further in connection therewith.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP.H. Gentleman, Esq.,\nOld Sun's School,\nBlackfoot Reserve,\nGleichen, Alberta.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nThe M.J.J.J. Commission in Calgary could not undertake my appointment to either here or the Petans in July last saying that it would be necessary to await a meeting of the Council of the Society in Toronto to be held during the first week in September. I was then told that the Secretary would visit these schools in November, and would come to some kind of agreement. James Gould reached Calgary last week, and James Stocken went up to see him, and although James Gould wrote me in October saying that he would certainly visit the school, James Stocken has returned from Calgary telling me that James Gould will not be able to visit the place as he thought, and that meanwhile James Gould approves of our being moved here, but for the time being it was considered best that James Stocken had better remain in charge of the school owing to the number of accounts that he would have to present to the Department for work done around the place.\n\nAs I expected to meet James Gould I intended to have a good understanding with him, and for the time being I have refrained from writing you in connection with the schools, and I am now placing before the Commission an obligation to work under James Stocken, as it is a point to which they agreed upon before we came to the province.\n\nMeanwhile this correspondence takes time, and in your letter written in July you wished us success in our new undertaking, and so be quite frank I would entirely agree.\nwith your remarks that there is scope for work at this point, and I trust you will support me in our new work. Neither my wife or I myself wish to be antagonistic to the Department in any way and would like to have some expression of your support.\n\nI have refused the admission of a child three years old, as I find on file a letter of yours saying that no child under the proper age should be admitted unless in the case of orphans when special application should be made. James Stocken sent the child with its father over to the school but I refused its admission on the grounds of age! Is this correct? Somewhat against the wish of James Stocken I have also sent here a girl, Spotted Eagle who was allowed back at the beginning of the year and who was married to an Indian, and yet is shown to be confined. I fear that there are other girls in the same position, and they tell me that their discharge was promised as far back as last February. James Stocken maintains that if these girls are let go, the parents of the other children who are to be brought in will not bring them. There appears to be plenty of children out of school. The town of Gladstone seems to be full of Indian children all ages and abilities, robust, strong and otherwise; every afternoon, some of whom should be in school.\n\nI have had a great deal of cleaning done around the place; it seemed to need it. I would like you to have the walls of the school-room whitewashed. It is still rough plaster, never been painted and is just covered with dark pencil and chalk writing; an amount of scrubbing would improve it; it is the only thing around the place that I cannot clean.\n\nI would like a good supply of Nimblet rope material, half a dozen new hooks in order that each child can have a place in school.\nDecember 5, 1919.\n\nDear Canon Gould,\n\nI have received your letter of the 25th ultimo, and I am glad to observe that you are dealing with the matter of conditions at the Sarcee Boarding school, and that you anticipate an improvement in connection therewith.\n\nI have recently received a letter from Mr. P.H. Gentleman of the Old Sun's school on the Blackfoot reserve, of which I am sending you a copy, in confidence, as I thought you should see it. Mr. Gentleman seems to regret the fact that he was unable to see you upon the occasion of your recent visit to the west and it appears from his statement that the supervision of the school by Rev. Canon Stocken is not working out satisfactorily.\n\nMy memory of our discussions from time to time is that we agreed that the missionaries should not interfere.\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, M.T.,\n131 Confederation Life Building,\nCor. Queen and Victoria Sts.,\nToronto, Ont.\nwith the school work, and to come nearer the heart of this question, I am confident that you will as soon as you can arrange for a single control of these residential schools.\n\nIn my reply to Mr. Gentleman I am not laying much stress on the matter, as his abilities in conducting Indian educational work are yet to be demonstrated.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nI enclose a statement taken at the Regina Agency office by Constable Wright of the R.M.W.M.R. from George Baptiste, a pupil of the Victoria Home School, of which the Rev. W.H. Haynes is principal. It appears that this boy along with two or three other older boys ran away from the Victoria Home with the team and rig. On being returned to the school this George Baptiste, although the youngest boy, was most brutally and unmercifully beaten with a horse quirt until his back was bleeding and bruised. This man Mr. Gentleman who administered the thrashing to George Baptiste is now teaching Indian children at the Blackfoot reserve. I feel it my duty to lay this case before you.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) Thos. Graham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina.\nTo Mr. Graham,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing to you into Mr. Gentleman give me a good licking just because I'm running away from the school. He whipp me and hit my head all over, also my hand is awful sore. I was starting to go back to school. I didn't mean to do it. I was sorry afterward. You can see all the mark on my back.

Much obliged.\n\nFrom George Baptiste.\nAt Peigan Agency,\nNov. 27th, 1919.\n\nWe came back 2 days later and we went down to\nthe school. Mr. Gentleman put him up-stairs to bed\nand shackled my feet, tied my hands and whipped me with\na quirt. Sam Yellow Face said he gave me 75 lashes; he\ngave me another whipping in the morning, but no quite so\nhard; he took off my clothes before giving me the whipping;\nmy back was all sore from cuts which were bleeding. He\ndid not whip any of the other boys; they were all larger than\nme; he then turned me loose but worked me very hard. Willie\nKnowlton suggested taking the horses away.\n\nStatement taken by Const.

I could not use a cane on a boy 75 times even if I desired to do so. There was no blood nor any likelihood of their being any, but the boy might have been marked.\n\nGeorge Baptise is an adopted son of Rev. W.H. Haynes. He destroyed or rather spoilt a new outfit of clothes on the Saturday, absented himself from Church Sunday afternoon, and rode the only team we had with an Indian boy to the R.C. Mission five miles away & the following morning with three others run off with the team. We had been drawing water from the river, and for two days the school was without water entirely. Mr. and Mrs. Haynes were very angry with the boy and asked me to give him a sound thrashing on his return. The whip and snaffle was the same as Mr. Giggle had left in the school and was I am told, often using, for far less serious offences than this.\n\nI did not punish the other boys simply because I did not know the Peigan people well enough and I did not wish to cause any difficulty over school matters with them, but as George Baptise was brought up by Mr. Haynes who had, as well as Mrs. Haynes directed he should be punished I thought it correct that I should do so.\n\nMy wife and Miss Brooks, boys matron had gone to a great deal of trouble in finding clothes for the boy, and when he came home on the Saturday afternoon he had lost one of a new pair of boots.\n\nThe boys had been themselves drawing water and in taking our only horses knew full well the difficulty in which we were placed; my kitchen dept. were naturally hard put to know what to do for cooking, and if George was punished severely he fully deserved it. Constable Wright who is a far stronger man than I wished to thrash them, but I did not allow it because I thought he might be too hard upon them.\n\nI think if Mrs. Thomas Graham had informed Mr. Haynes the details of the case she would have found that it was not important enough to refer to the Department. Had he received a complaint from an Indian it would have been a different matter. Mr. Haynes has since written to me several times and made no comment upon the subject, and had I been unduly severe upon George he would have far more likely have written me about it before placing the subject before the Department.\n\nDuring the seven years I was at John Smith's the parents complained several times to the Indian Agent that I was too easy with the children which I think will show that I do not punish the children only as a last resort.\n\nI thank you for writing me, and I trust I have made the matter clear.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) P.H. Gentleman.\n\nP.S. I notice the statement before the Constable was given on Nov. 27th. The punishment was given on Oct. 8th.\n\n(COPY).\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nToronto, Ontario, January 26th, 1920\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Inspector General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nEnclosed please find copy of reply received from Mr. P.W. Gentleman in response to my letter concerning the punishment inflicted upon George Baptise, a pupil in the Peigan Boarding School. The case resolves itself, it appears to me, into the following two questions.\n\nFirst: Is corporal punishment for disciplinary purposes recognised or permitted in the Indian Boarding Schools?\n\nSecond: If corporal punishment is permitted at all, was the punishment inflicted in this case unduly severe?\n\nPersonally I should imagine that whether permitted or not, it is applied, more or less, in every boarding school in the country. The circumstances reported in connection with this case would seem to indicate that reasonable corporal punishment was fully deserved. The wisdom of selecting one culprit out of three or four\nD.C. Scott-2,\n\nand making him bear the punishment due to all, is, of course, another question and one which does not seem to be fully covered by the reasons submitted by Mr. Gentleman, viz: that he having but lately taken over the charge of the School did not know the temper of the Peigan Indians, and that George Baptise is an adopted son of the Reverend W.H. Haynes. The discipline of the school, I am free to confess from my own observations, was, and probably is, in a very low state. The permanent solution of the whole situation depends upon the speed with which the Indian Department is prepared to carry through the scheme of re-organization and consolidation agreed upon. We are unable to secure satisfactory agents for a temporary position such as that which now obtains in connection with the Peigan Boarding School.\n\nMr. Middleton, has, I believe, the rare faculty of impressing discipline upon the refractory Indian temperament and eliciting, through drill of cadet corps etc., commendable esprit de corps. I am wondering whether it will be possible to place both the Blood and Peigan Institutions under the principalship of Mr. Middleton, thus anticipating the position he will undoubtedly occupy when the two institutions are consolidated.\n\nAs soon as the Financial Appeal of our Forward Movement, February 9th-14th, is out of the way, I hope to be in a position to give the necessary time and attention to this important matter. Our whole programme, however, turns upon the plan of re-organization and consolidation in connection with the existing boarding schools in the diocese of Calgary, and I shall esteem it a great favour if you are able to give me precise information con-\nD.C. Scott:\n\nclosing the time when the Department will be prepared to provide for\nand carry through the necessary new construction or enlargement of\nthe buildings needed, and without which our plans cannot be carried\nthrough to success.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nSG/NV.\nCALGARY INDIAN MISSIONS\n\nVen.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. W. Tims,\nCalgary, Alta.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 5th January last, in which you advised me that you were taking up the question of the charges laid against Mr. P.H. Gentleman with Rev. Canon Gould. I shall be glad if you will advise me what has transpired in the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Sect. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMay 18, 1920.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to Mr. Gentleman. As I intimated to you I took the matter up with Rev. Canon Gould, but I did not come to any decision. Now is Mr. Gentleman getting on now, is he at all successful? Kindly let me know.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have your letter of the 13th ult., with reference to Mr. P.H. Gentleman at present engaged at the Blackfoot Reserve, Anglican Boarding School. When I last wrote you I was quite aware that you had taken up the matter complained of with Rev. Canon Gould, as you told me you had done so early in January last, but it was because I heard nothing further from you on this very important subject which I considered should not be passed over lightly, that I again drew your attention to it.\n\nSince the incident referred to took place Mr. Gentleman has been transferred to a larger and more important position. In my opinion this was a mistake. Instead of placing this man in a position of responsibility, where he might repeat his disgraceful acts, he should have been relieved of his duties. Mr. Gentleman is now at the Blackfoot School where Canon Stocken is Principal. I am told there is more or less friction between Canon Stocken and Mr. Gentleman, in fact there is friction among the whole staff, and whether Mr. Gentleman is responsible for this state of affairs or not I cannot say. I do know he is the kind of man that will make trouble wherever he goes and with a man like Canon Stocken for a superior, I can imagine the unsatisfactory atmosphere of the place.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD. C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOLD SUN SCHOOL\nBLACKFOOT RESERVE\nGLEICHEN\nALTA.\n\nJune 7th, 1940.\n\nDear Mr Scott,\n\nI recently obtained a little leaflet called \"British Columbia News\" in an account of a new church being raised on the Kootenay River and an effort to help the Indians who would be found there by the school and mission work with the church.\n\nThe article appealed to me, and I thought that we might be able to do something for them. We are doing more than we can at the present time, sending in these people already made friends through our missionary work.\n\nWe wrote to Archbishop DuVernay, and after correspondence agreed to block such an effort from the Indians. We believe that the Indians would be helped, and so turned the offer of assistance over to your Agent who appears to be of the same opinion.\n\nI now learn that your Agent has written to Archbishop DuVernay, and myself and wife have not heard from your approval.\n\nI am therefore writing to ask you, upon what grounds or objections recommendations have been rejected?\n\nYour Agent, being an Anglican clergyman in charge of an Agency for Indians, does largely belong to the Church of England. He seems to think that he could be of some use to us together, and so it was not very surprising to you. I would like to point out that the Department seem intent upon taking our little agency away from us.\n\nHaving been so long connected in the Department employ, I realize attitudes towards us is more than I can understand, and had I asked for transfer before, again, I feel sure, the same objections would have been raised.\n\nSome three years ago, when I did ask you for a transfer to British Columbia, you wrote me that my request was granted at that time, and I applied to Archbishop DuVernay. However, it did not occur to me that such an attitude would be adopted towards us.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP.H. [Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nP.S. I shall look with interest, for your reasons for this, which appears to me, very extraordinary treatment.\nOttawa, June 16, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant regarding your desire to be transferred to take charge of an Indian school in B.C.\n\nIn reply I have to state that the Department has no position to offer you in that Province, and as you have been transferred to the Old Sun Boarding School on the Blackfoot Reserve and as your services are paid for by the Anglican Church, it is considered that you should remain where you are so long as the Church and the Department are satisfied with the work you are doing there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Gentlemen,\nOld Sun Boarding School,\nBlackfoot Reserve,\nGleichen, Alta.\nDear Mr. MacInnes,\n\nI have acknowledged the receipt of your letter of the 16th inst., No. 117004-1A regarding the school in the Neas River Agency.\n\nIn reply I may say that in view of the fact that I have recently heard from Dr. Gooderham of the Department's intention of carrying out certain improvements necessary to this establishment, and your desire that we should remain here, we will do so.\n\nI might add however that my first communication with His Lordship, the Archbishop of Galveston, was in the first week of March. At that time the children were very anxious with the cold, and I could see no means of preventing their suffering; also the N.S.S. boys since then provided me with certain regulations regarding the staff, that will be a great way in helping us to get this place into some order.\n\nThe part of your letter I do not understand is the statement that you have no vacancy in B.J. In Mr. Jollisome's letter of April 25th, he informs me that Leklansap will be vacant at the end of September, and if you will choose a copy of this letter, you will observe that there has been an error on the part of someone.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Michael, Gleichen, Alta.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. XXXXXX dated Retirement.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOld Sun School, Gleichen Alta. July 1st.\n\nDear Mr. Knox,\n\nIt is very kind indeed of you to have interviewed Mr. D.J. Scott on our behalf, as mentioned in your letter of the 20th inst., for which I must thank you.\n\nI observe that he does not claim that he has got a vacant position in B.C., a point which his assistant secretary endeavoured to press upon us.\n\nI do not dispute his statement that my wife and I are suitable for our present work. This establishment certainly needs someone who has had experience with Indians, as well as Boarding school work, but when he claims that the position is a good one, he is quite mistaken. At John Smith's our total salary was $1000 a year (including war bonus) house, fuel, and part rations (flour, meat, rice tea soap). Our present salary is $600 a year, and board & accommodation for myself and my wife and as I have remarked before the I.D. do not pay the cost of running the school, so that the managing committee are compelled to buy in the cheapest possible market, which is at present a N.T. contract, which makes the living, the very poorest, and plainest. During the 15 years I have been in Canada this last twelve months has been the worst I have ever put in. In March, I was compelled to go up to Calgary to see a doctor, who told me plainly that such a change of living was having serious effects, so I do not see how the Department can claim that this position is a good one, from the salary point of view.\n\nI notice that the Government have recently put out posters offering $900 cad & board, clothes for raw recruits for the Canadian army, and I have had staying with me a cousin of Mrs. Gentleman's holding an important position with the C.T.F. in the Prince Rupert division, who came down to see us regarding our going to that neighbourhood, she started with the P.H.A. in 1911 at $600, and I myself was receiving $720 from the I.D.\nWith house, and rations while I was at Duck Lake in 1912. Since that time, I have been able until this year to send part of this home to my Mother in England, and from what I learn from home living in England is very high indeed at the present time.\n\nI think under these circumstances my wife and I can rightly claim that we are receiving an injustice at the hands of the Secretary. Doubtless he believed that I knew what I was taking on when I came here from the salary point of view, but it must be remembered that he dismissed us from John Smith's without taking any steps to ascertain if he was justified in doing so; also that it is impossible for anyone, by merely visiting one place to learn if it has been properly conducted, and my wife and I are having the brunt of a previous principle neglect.\n\nTo straighten out this neglect at an increased salary is one thing, but to do so at a greatly decreased salary gives a different viewpoint entirely.\n\nThe school at the Nana River came to my notice without being sought after. The authorities on the spot satisfied themselves that we could handle the situation, and wanted us to go, the salary would have been much the same as we did receive, and it would have been at no cost to the I.O., neither would they have had to hunt around for a man for this place, for that rests with the Missionary society.\n\nWe will, however, do our best here, and I will see to it that he has no cause to complain, but at the same time, I cannot help saying that their course of action tends towards a state of discontent, which, if I might be permitted to put it that way, is not very admirable to encourage in times like these.\n\nMy letter to Mr Scott merely asked why, Mr Jollissions recommendations were not approved of. I make no excuse, merely by no means wished to give any cause for offence, but you will see, my question was merely ended. Thanking you for your good wishes,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nPrince Albert\nSask.\nJuly 18th 20\n\nDuncan Scott, M.P.\nSuperintendent\nIndian Affairs\n&c.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI am enclosing a further letter from Mr. C.H.

H. Gentleman. I have noted the statements made by Mr. Gentleman in this letter, but that does not alter my view that he must be successful where he is. If he is unable to carry on his present work with success, it will doubtless be necessary for the Church of England to make other arrangements, as he is employed by that Body and not by the Department.\n\nI observe Mr. Gentleman questions the Department's letter of the 16th ultimo signed by the Secretary, with regard to a vacancy in British Columbia. The Department did not in this letter state that there was no vacancy in British Columbia, but merely that there was no vacancy for him. We have, as a matter of fact, no position, either in British Columbia or elsewhere that would be available for Mr. Gentleman.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nAndrew Knox, Esq., M.

A. Williams\nper M.O.C.\nJanuary 10th, 1921.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that some of the children of the Old Sune school are allowed to spend their week-ends at their homes. It is not considered that this practice is in the interests either of the school or of the children, and it should be stopped immediately upon receipt of this letter. These children should be treated, in so far as visiting their homes is concerned, the same as those who might come from a distance, and should be granted only the usual statutory holidays. It is understood, of course, that cases might arise in which there are extenuating circumstances, such as illness at home, etc., when the principal with the concurrence of the agent might allow a child to visit his home. The Indians too, should be given to understand that under the Indian Act as amended last session, the Department has full power, not only to take their children and place them in residential schools, but also to retain them there so long as is desirable.\n\nWill you be good enough to take this matter up with the principal at once.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\n\nG. H. Goodenough, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGlatschen, Alta.\nRegina, December 7th, 1920.\n\nTo W.M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOLD SUM SCHOOL near Gleichen on the Blackfoot Reserve.\n\nThe children of this school are generally below par in health and appearance. There are fifty pupils and 70% of them have somewhat enlarged lymphatic glands of the neck. Five of these have scrofulous sores requiring active treatment; first surgical and afterwards tonics and fresh air. In the case of three others with enlarged tuberculous glands, the same treatment should be recommended, while the remaining twenty-five of those affected with this scrofulous disease should have tonics and as much fresh air and highly nutritious food as possible. Milk and eggs should be used very largely and such tonics as Cod Liver Oil and Comp. Syrup of Hypophosphites, or other preparation of iron administered over a considerable period.\n\nOne little girl, Emma Big Old Man, has a large tuberculous abscess of the neck and jaw requiring prompt surgical attention, while Mary Red Morning is suffering from tuberculous ulcers of the chest and neck and requires equally urgent treatment. The cases of Felix Little Backbone, Sarah Turning Robe and Annie Cutter should also have prompt attention for tubercular glands. William Calfrobe is suffering from tuberculosis of the lungs, especially of the left apex and should not be in the school, as he is a danger to the other pupils as well as in a precarious state of health himself.\n\nFive boys and three girls are suffering from disease of the eyes sufficiently acute to require active treatment.\nSixty percent of the pupils have scabies or itch, many of them in an aggravated form. The condition has been neglected or unrecognized and has plainly gone on for months. The hands and arms, and in fact the whole bodies of many of the children being covered with crusts and sores from this disgusting disease. Two of the girls - Jean Spotted One and Elsie Many Goods, have sores on the backs of their heads fully three inches across and heaped up with crusts nearly a half inch deep. This condition urgently requires active treatment as it can be cleaned up in a short time with efficient treatment. The clothing and all articles coming into contact with the affected parts will require sterilization by boiling or being well washed with antiseptic. It would be advisable that a competent nurse be engaged to look after this process for a couple of weeks. The building in which these children are housed is far short of ideal. The dormitories are overcrowded and the ceilings are low. The floors are of soft wood and are not varnished and hence very hard to keep clean, especially as the children play through the halls and rooms since there is no proper play room. This also applies to the class room which is a detached building heated by a stove and in no sense modern. This could be made into a fair gymnasium if modern class rooms were provided elsewhere.\n\nThere is no infirmary in the building and only two small balconies, but as these are off the staffrooms they are not available for the pupils. This constitutes a very serious defect in the building as an Indian School, for an abundance of fresh air is essential for the health of all children, and much more so for the Indian, who has been for many centuries an out of doors animal and who, in the process of becoming a house dweller, suffers so severely from those diseases which may be classed as house diseases, among these, particularly, Tuberculosis.\nSpacious balconies should be provided on the south side of this and all other Indian boarding schools, where the pupils may sleep in the open air, during the greater part, if not throughout the whole year. It is a constant experience that Indian children being taken ill with tuberculous diseases while in schools, and sent home, make remarkable recoveries in the open air life of the tent, even though the surroundings may be otherwise very undesirable. If the sanitarium principle were adopted as far as possible in the construction of all Indian schools and hospitals the result could not be otherwise than gratifying and the prevalence of scrofulous glands and pulmonary consumption would be reduced to a minimum. The beds should be kept in the dormitories during the day in order to avoid dust during the summer and the chilling of the mattress and clothes during the winter when much heat would be abstracted from the bodies of the children before the bed would become warm enough to sleep upon, if the beds had been left out doors during the day. The pupils should dress and undress in comfortable rooms and after being warmly covered in bed should be pushed out into the open air for the night.\n\nP. A. Corbett, M.D.\nCommissioner's Office,\nRegina, Sask., Dec. 5, 1920.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith regard to the situation of the Old Sun School; while the building is not all that could be desired, there appears to have been gross carelessness on the part of those in charge of the school, to allow such a loathsome condition to exist. The local Doctor is not by any means excluded from this remark.\n\nThe School building is badly out up, and it seems to me that when the plans were drawn up, more attention was given to the accommodation of the staff than of the pupils. I consider the building very badly arranged. I understand Doctor Corbett saw the Medical Officer, and gave him instructions to clean up the situation at once. He also told the Principal what to do with regard to the treatment of the children. Doctor Corbett tells me, with proper care and treatment the Seabies should be cleared up in two weeks time. I have instructed Mr. Gooderham to do what he could in the way of getting what is required to carry the work out successfully.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nCommissioner.\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 11, 1920.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nHonourable Sir James Lougheed,\n\nI beg to send herewith important reports from the Indian Commissioner and Doctor F. A. Corbett, of Regina.\n\nWhen I was in Regina last summer I had an interview with Doctor Corbett, and it was arranged that he should make these inspections. Doctor Corbett is greatly interested in the welfare of the Indians, and his report justifies the inspection.\n\nI regret extremely that it is possible to draw such a comparison between the Protestant and Roman Catholic Schools. The Crowfoot, Ermineskin's and St. Albert schools are all conducted by the Roman Catholic Church, and the Old Sun's and Sarcee are conducted by the Church of England. The comparison does not hold good over the whole field; however, as we have excellent Protestant schools in other parts of the country. The Anglican schools in the diocese of Calgary have always unfortunately been badly managed.\n\nThe conditions at the Old Sun's school are disgraceful, and the principal and medical attendant are worthy of serious censure for allowing such health omissions to exist.\n\nAs you are personally aware of the general conditions at the Sarcee reserve, this additional information with reference to the school and the Indians there will be of special interest. If this band is to be saved at all we must take vigorous measures and I would propose to turn the school into a hospital and to treat the whole reserve as a hospital area. These Indians have a large reserve and money should be turned into cash as soon as possible and used for their benefit, and the funds we have on hand should be fully used.\n\nIt would be advantageous if Doctor Corbett could continue his inspections and visit all our reserves and schools, but as he has a large practice in Regina, I do not think we could expect him to spend the necessary time in making inspectorial visits.\n\nI should like to discuss these matters with you.\n\nDuncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nCOPY.\n\nOttawa, Ontario,\nDecember 17th, 1920.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMR. D. G. SCOTT -\n\nWith reference to the attached reports from the Indian Commissioner and Doctor F. A. Corbett regarding conditions in certain Indian schools in the Diocese of Calgary, the Minister, before leaving for the West, did not have an opportunity of reading the reports but I explained to him the contents. He instructed me to advise you to take whatever steps may be necessary to improve the dismal school conditions, particularly in the Old Sun and Sarcee Schools. It might be well however, to discuss this matter with the Minister immediately he returns, which will be on the 29th instant.\n\nJ. C. Caldwell,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nEnclosures.\nOttawa, December 30th, 1920.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI have read with great interest your letter of December 7th and Dr. Corbett's report of the same date. I sent it to the Minister with my own report and he has taken communication of it, but I intend to discuss it with him further.\n\nAs you had instructed Agent Gooderham to take the necessary steps to deal with the situation at the Old Sun's School I need not give any directions as to what should be done, but I would like to have a report as soon as possible showing what has been done.\n\nAs regards the Sarcee boarding school, I think our opinions agree that it should be turned into a hospital, and that the whole reserve should be considered as a hospital area. I will write to Cannon Gould and communicate Dr. Corbett's findings and suggest that we should immediately put in a staff of nurses and discontinue the occasional visits for which Mrs. Hannington called upon me this morning with reference to the scheme that we had previously discussed, of which you are aware. I think she might be able to help us out with nurses for the Sarcee Hospital if we require them. There is some possibility of our getting hospital outfit from the Guelph Hospital which has been donated by the Hospital Committee, and if we succeed in this it will place us in control of a fine lot of hospital equipment. I told Mrs. Hannington that I expected you at headquarters next month and that we should have a conference, and I look forward to that as being important.\n\nMeanwhile will you send me a report of the present conditions at the Old Sun's school and give me any further ideas you may have with reference to the Sarcee situation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, January 8, 1921.\n\nEncl. 547042\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nUpon my recent visit to the West I arranged that Dr. F. A.

Dr. Corbett completed his inspections in due course, and I am enclosing herewith, for your information, copies of his reports, which I have myself read with concern and regret.\n\nThe Department has taken prompt measures to alleviate the shocking conditions existing at these schools. The Indian agent has been instructed to take the necessary steps to deal with the situation at the Old Sune School, and I have asked that a report with regard to present conditions there should be forwarded to the Department as soon as possible.\n\nIn view of Dr. Corbett's report, it now seems more urgent than ever that steps should be at once taken to turn the Sarcee school into a hospital and the whole reserve into a hospital. It would appear necessary to suspend the educational work for the present, and there certainly would be nothing gained in transferring the children to the Old Sune School, until there is a change in the condition at that Institution.\n\nI shall communicate with you further when I receive the report asked for with regard to this school. The existence of such a situation is indeed discouraging, but I hope that by vigorous effort we shall be able to effect a rapid improvement.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould,\nGeneral Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England,\n131 Confederation Life Bldg.,\nToronto, Ont.\nBlackfoot Agency,\nGlenchen, Alta.\n3/1/21.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 4th inst., file\n100-14 re Old Suns Boarding School, I beg to report that I\nvisited this school on the 9th inst. and made it my duty to\nexamine the children who had scabies when Doctor Corbett made\nan inspection last fall.\n\nAs far as I could see all the children were clean, and\nno outward signs of the scabies apparent.\n\nOne of the worst cases, a boy, whose head and neck were\nvery bad, seemed to be all right as also were his hands.\n\nThe weeks following the visit of Dr. Corbett and\nyourself, all the children were bathed and treated by the doctor\nand staff as ordered, and this was continued until the infection\nwas apparently eradicated. Some of the clothing was destroyed\nand the balance sterilized.\n\nNo children examined for T.B., a boy Wm. Self Robe was\npronounced unfit for school by Dr. Corbett, the boy looks all\nright and I would like to know if he should be discharged.\n\nIn this connection may say that in leaving there is no\noption but to send him home unless it can be arranged to have\nhim admitted to some hospital.\n\nThe girls for whom the doctor ordered cod liver oil are\ngetting same and seem to be in good health.\n\nNo extra staff was engaged to clean up the scabies, but\nduring the past three weeks, one woman, the kitchen matron,\nresigned, there remains now the principal, 3 matrons, and a chore\nman, a total of five.\n\nThe school shows lack of proper attention and Mr. Gentleman\ninforms me that the present staff cannot possibly do all the\nnecessary work.\n\nThe Missionary Society have been asked to supply more\nworkers and I am convinced that a seamstress or a nurse or both\nare needed and if this school is to be of proper value, the\nMissionary Society, or some other body must keep a staff, which\nwill make the school efficient. I know that Mr. Gentleman and\nhis staff have worked hard particularly in the care of the children.\n\nI had all the children vaccinated in December and this\nincurred more work; I therefore ask that if in your opinion, this\nschool is understaffed, that pressure is brought to bear on the\nresponsible parties, to see that the place is staffed and run as\nit should be run.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(SGD) C.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\n\nREGINA, SASK. Jan. 11th, 1931.\n\n547057\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nIn response to the request contained in your letter of the 30th ultimo, I enclose herewith copy of report from Agent Gooderham on conditions at Old Suns Boarding School. Mr. Gooderham, you will note, suggests that the school is understaffed, but in making a comparison with File Hills Boarding School, there does not appear to me to be a necessity to increase the staff. At File Hills there is a principal, a hired man, teacher, seamstress, assistant Matron and a cook, a staff of six to handle from sixty-five to seventy pupils. At the Old Suns Boarding School there are only fifty pupils, and a very good reason should be given before the staff is increased.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(W.M. Graham)\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nJanuary 14, 1921.\n\nDear Canon Gould,\n\nWith reference to our previous correspondence, I send you herewith a copy of a report from Agent Gooderham on the conditions at Old Sute's school. Mr. Gooderham, I am glad to say, reports an improvement in the conditions. You might take into consideration the representations he makes with reference to the staff. Mr. Graham in transmitting the letter expresses the opinion that the school is not undermanned. However, that is a matter which requires careful attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould,\nGeneral Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England,\n131 Confederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nOLD SUN SCHOOL near Gleichen on the Blackfoot Reserve.\n\nThe children of this school are generally below par in health and appearance. There are fifty pupils and 70% of them have somewhat enlarged lymphatic glands of the neck. Five of these have scrofulous sores requiring active treatment; first surgical and afterward tonics and fresh air. In the case of three others with enlarged tuberculous glands, the same treatment should be recommended, while the remaining twenty-five of those affected with this scrofulous disease should have tonics and as much fresh air and highly nutritious food as possible. Milk and eggs should be used very largely and such tonics as Cod Liver Oil and Comp. Syrup of Hypophosphites, or other preparation of Iron administered over a considerable period. One little girl, Emma Big Old Man has a large tuberculous abscess of the neck and jaw requiring prompt surgical attention, while Mary Red Morning is suffering from tuberculous ulcers of the chest and neck and requires equally urgent treatment. The cases of Felix Little Backbone, Sarah Turning Robe and Annie Cutter should also have prompt attention for tubercular glands. William Galfrobe is suffering from tuberculosis of the lungs, especially of the left apex and should not be in the school, as he is a danger to the other pupils as well as in a precarious state of health himself.\n\nFive boys and three girls are suffering from disease of the eyes sufficiently acute to require active treatment.\n\nSixty per cent. of the pupils have scabies or itch, many of them in an aggravated form. The condition has been neglected or unrecognized and has plainly gone on for months. The hands and arms, and in fact the whole bodies of many of\nthe children being covered with crusts and sores from this disgusting disease. Two of the girls - Jean Spotted One and Elsie Many Goods, have sores on the backs of their heads fully three inches across and heaped up with crusts nearly a half inch deep. This condition urgently requires active treatment as it can be cleaned up in a short time with efficient treatment. The clothing and all articles coming into contact with the affected parts will require sterilization by boiling or being well washed with antiseptic. It would be advisable that a competent nurse be engaged to look after this process for a couple of weeks. The building in which these children are housed is far short of ideal. The dormitories are overcrowded and the ceilings are low. The floors are of soft wood and are not varnished and hence very hard to keep clean, especially as the children play through the halls and rooms since there is no proper play room. This also applies to the class room which is a detached building heated by a stove and in no sense modern. This could be made into a fair gymnasium if modern class rooms were provided elsewhere.\n\nThere is no infirmary in the building and only two small balconies, but as these are off the staffrooms they are not available for the pupils. This constitutes a very serious defect in the building as an Indian school, for an abundance of fresh air is essential for the health of all children, and much more so for the Indian, who has been for many centuries an out of door animal and who, in the process of becoming a house dweller, suffers so severely from these diseases which may be classed as house diseases among these particularly, Tuberculosis. Spacious balconies should be provided on the south side of this and all other Indian boarding schools, where the pupils may sleep in the\nopen air, during the greater part, if not throughout\nthe whole year. It is a constant experience that Indian\nchildren being taken ill with tuberculous diseases while\nin the schools, and sent home, make remarkable recoveries\nin the open air life of the tent, even though the surround-\nings may be otherwise very undesirable. If the sanatorium\nprinciple were adopted as far as possible in the construction\nof all Indian schools and hospitals the result could not be\notherwise than gratifying and the prevalence of scrofulous\nglands and pulmonary consumption would be reduced to a\nminimum. The beds should be kept in the dormitories during\nthe day in order to avoid dust during the summer and the\nchilling of the mattress and clothes during the winter when\nmuch heat would be subtracted from the bodies of the children\nbefore the bed would become warm enough to sleep upon, if the\nbeds had been left out doors during the day. The pupils should\ndress and undress in comfortable rooms and after being\nwarmly covered in bed should be pushed out into the open air\nfor the night.\nBlackfoot Agency,\nGleichen, Alta.:\n15th January 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nInstructions in your letter of the 10th inst.; to the effect that no children be allowed home from Old Sun's School for week ends, except under exceptional conditions, will be followed forthwith.\n\nIn this connection I have to say, that I issued orders to this effect to the Principal some time ago, and I regret that he has failed to strictly follow them.\n\nI took care to explain the amendment to the Indian Act with respect to schools and children, to the Indians at the same time.\n\nI will see that the Principal carries out these orders at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent/Indian Agent.\nGeneral\n\nDept:of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nOFFICIAL MAGAZINE\nThe Mission World\n\nEDITOR\nTHE GENERAL SECRETARY\nMRS.

Two sets of fire hose are in good order; one I have not seen and the other of the four has bent couplers. The fire hose cannot be used owing to the pressure tank being too small, it is difficult to obtain enough water on the main floor for the children to wash with. We have no fire buckets.\n\nThe water system, I pointed out to Mr. Orr during his recent visit, and in the improvements to be made next spring I trust this will be improved, and the hose used.\n\nMeanwhile I would like to have some fire buckets, and hooks provided, buckets should be made to hang, otherwise they would be used for other purposes. I would also like an electric inside gong with push buttons in various rooms, as to ring the only bell in the place it is necessary to go into the basement.\n\nIn the past little consideration seems to have been given to this important subject by those in charge, and I should add that I want my instructions to the Department to go into this matter after the improvements are made. Outside of the water pressure tank improvements could be made under the present conditions, which would still be good for the enlarged school, and remain in their places, and I can assure you that in event of any appliances being provided, they will be inspected daily by myself, and I will see that proper care is taken of same.\n\nI might also add that with an enlarged, and almost new staff I have been able, very recently to carry out considerable improvements which should be helpful.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI have been able to have the children drill, and a system of fire drill will be put into force.\n\nStovepipes are clean, oil lamps are not used, and smoking by the boys has been stopped. I have had to use stern measures to prevent both boys' and girls' lighting the gas in their dormitories during the nights with paper. The gas machine has one main cut off and when the new dormitories are built up, cut off, will I hope be arranged.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP. H. Gentleman.\nExcerpt:\n\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nToronto, Ontario, April 9th, 1921\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nInclosed please find copy of letter received from the Acting Principal of the Old Sun boarding school, through the Rev. Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary of the M.S.C.C.\n\nThis regrettable and alarming occurrence emphasizes the need, which I placed before you in my recent letter, that the detached building and equipment in question should be thoroughly overhauled and remodelled at once.\n\nBelieve me,\nYours very faithfully,\n\nS. Gould,\nGeneral Secretary.\nApril 2nd;1921.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate,\n\nI must inform you that somewhat of a serious occurrence happened this afternoon, the laundry building catching fire, which we were only able to prevent from spreading, with some difficulty.\n\nNo damage, or loss has occurred as the whole of the flames were around the engine, and up the stairway, and I think that they largely consisted of spilt gasoline, oil, and grease, which gathers round the engine. It just happened that the whole of the staff were close by, and their prompt action doubtless saved the whole school. Had the laundry got a good start we could have never saved the school building.\n\nI should say the Indian Department last fall asked me for a list of fire buckets and details of this kind. I sent my report pointing out that nothing suitable to put out fires seems to have been provided, and only last week, we received from Mr. Graham, Regina, four fire pails, and a five gallon tank with a pump in it.\n\nThese things afford us a very small protection, and a couple of dozen buckets and hooks would be none too many, and in addition to this the engine at the foot of the stairs is in a very dark place, and we cannot keep a pressure on the tank. On this occasion we had to use the soft water tank.\n\nI am afraid that I must urge that the present risks in the matter of fire protection, and such matters, be placed before the Indian Department. We feel that the improvements that\nDr. Westgate,\n\nwill, I hope, overcome the danger, must not be delayed. The whole difficulty and danger is in the location of the laundry building and engine.\n\nThe Northern Electric Co who do the telephone work, also are builders of fire alarm systems, and it would be a great help if a fire gong could be placed on the building. In my report to the Indian Department (which they asked for direct) I mentioned these things, and hoped that they would give the subject consideration.\n\nSuch an occurrence that happened this afternoon, could not have happened at the Agricultural School, or the Roman Catholic school. Their engines are both in fire proof rooms. In our case the fire got into the plaster walls under the stairway, and we had to make holes in the wall to get at it.\n\nThe outbreak occurred just at four o'clock, all the boys and most of the girls were out for the afternoon with their parents, the whole of the staff happened to be on hand, the matrons in the sewing room, Mr. Pardee and myself in the kitchen, and Mr. Shaw at the engine at the time. Mr. Shaw rushed out of the building with his overalls in flames, which the Matrons caught sight of. Just how it started is not quite clear. Mr. Shaw happened to have a new suit of overalls on. Had it been Smith I do not think he could have put the flames out.\n\nYou will, I am sure understand, that an occurrence of this kind makes us doubly careful.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) P.H. Gentleman.\nThe Executive Committee of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, having had before it the letter dated January 8th, of the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, together with the accompanying copies of the reports of Dr. Corbett of his medical inspection of the children in the Old Sun's Boarding Schools, Blackfoot Reserve, and in the Sarcee Boarding School, begs permission to bring the following points in connection therewith, to the attention of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\n1. That although Dr. Corbett's inspection was made on a date prior to November 25th, 1920, a copy of his report was not mailed by the department to this Committee until January 8th, 1921.\n\n2. That the children in question were, for sometime previous to Dr. Corbett's visit, under the treatment directed by the local medical men. Writing to the Executive Committee under date November 25th, 1920, the Acting-principal of the School says in part -\n\n\"Mr. Gentleman and Mrs. Bloomer spent a great deal of time treating sore places on the girls. Dr. Corbett pronounced this to be 'itch' and claimed that the treatment directed by the local doctor was entirely wrong.\"\n\nand further:\n\n\"Mr. Scott .........can be assured that the directions of the local doctor had strict attention and that Dr. Corbett's desires are being carried out.\"\n\nThe Executive Committee submits therefore, since the children in the Old Sun's Boarding school were, prior to the visit of Dr. Corbett, under the care of the local medical men and that the latter's instructions were carefully observed by the School's staff, that the staff cannot fairly be held responsible for the results of the wrong diagnosis made by the local medical men.\nThat the report of Dr. Corbett presents a strong condemnation of the adequacy and satisfactory character of the building occupied by the Old Sun's Boarding School - a building erected wholly by the Department.\n\nThe Acting-Principal writes that the recent work done in connection with the heating system has improved matters but little if at all, and that during a recent cold snap he was obliged to go himself and spend a great deal of time in the boiler room in the effort to secure some fair degree of heat in the building.\n\n4. That the Executive Committee, at its meeting on May 5th, 1920, adopted the following resolutions:\n\n\"That a sub-committee be appointed to interview the authorities of the Department of Indian Affairs with regard to the condition of the children in the Sarcee Boarding School and the future of that Institution. Consideration of the estimates being deferred pending report of this Sub-committee.\"\n\nand that on the 27th of the same month the Sub-Committee in question - C.B. Nicholson, Esq., M.P., and the General Secretary - had an interview with the Deputy Superintendent General in his office on this matter. At this interview the Deputy Superintendent General agreed to the views set forward by this Executive, through its representatives to the effect (1) that the physical condition of the vast majority of the children in the Sarcee Boarding School made it imperative that the institution should cease to be operated as a boarding school, and (2) that the few healthy children should be transferred to the enlarged building at Old Sun's.\n\nThe conclusions arrived at and accepted at this interview were set out in the letter dated June 2nd, 1920, of the General Secretary to the Deputy Superintendent General as follows:\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nIn view of my departure for England tomorrow, I am placing before you, in writing, the results, as I understand them, of the recent interview which you kindly granted to Mr. C.B. Nicholson and me, as follows:\nThe heating system of the Sarcee and Old Sun's Boarding schools to be immediately overhauled, and if necessary new systems to be installed adequate to the heating of the building.\n\nProvision to be made in the estimates of the Department for next year (a) for the erection, on a site to be selected of the new joint boarding school for the Blood and Blackfoot Indians, (b) the remodelling and enlarging of the building used by the Old Sun's Boarding School to make it possible to remove the girls dormitory at least from the ground floor and to provide such additional accommodation as may be needed for the Anglican children on the Blackfoot Reserve who are not now in the School, and for a few Sarcee children who are free from tuberculosis infections; providing that satisfactory arrangements can be made for the transfer of the latter from the Sarcee to the Old Sun's Boarding School.\n\nI am writing that you will agree with the above as stating the result of our interview, and thanking you for your ready kindness and sympathy in our efforts to place the Anglican work on behalf of the Indians upon a more efficient basis.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n(signed) S. Gould,\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nand acknowledged by the Deputy Superintendent General in his reply dated June 10th, 1920.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, June 10th, 1920.\n\nDear Canon Gould,-\n\nI have your letter of June 2nd last, placing on record your understanding of our recent interview in Ottawa.\n\nA few days after your visit here I reported to the Minister and I may state that my report to him of the interview practically coincides with the report submitted by you. I may say that I have taken action by way of communicating with our Agents regarding the heating system at both the Old Sun's and the Sarcee schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nthe Executive Committee therefore resolves\n\n(1) That this Executive Committee, having brought the physical condition of the children in the Sarcee Boarding School to the notice of the Department, as long ago as last May, renewed its grant to that institution for the current year with great reluctance, and only as an interim measure, pending the taking by the department of the action recommended that the Institution\nWe disestablished as a boarding school and provided with a staff and equipment necessary for the efficient medical treatment of the children. Further, that this Committee now earnestly request the Deputy Superintendent to put this change into effect at once, releasing this Committee of responsibility for the Sarcee Boarding School at a date to be set, which date should not be later than April the 1st of the Present year.\n\n(2) That this executive Committee requests the Deputy Superintendent to issue, forthwith, an order prohibiting the continuance of the practice, at the Old Sun's Boarding school under which the Indians have been in the habit of taking their children out of the school for Saturday or other short periods of absence; that the Department define the holidays or vacations during which either the parents, or guardians, may remove children from the school, or during which the principal may give them leave, that no local official, either of the Department or of the Missionary Society shall have power to vary the rule in question and should the Indians, under the enforcement of the rule carry out their threats to remove their children from the school, then the Department shall assume the responsibility for the return of the children, so removed, to the school, or, in the event of their non-return by the Department, the Department continue to pay the per-capita grant involved toward the maintenance of the school.\n\n(3) That this executive Committee assure the Deputy Superintendent General of its earnest desire to place the Indian boarding school, under the Church of England in Canada, upon a basis of efficiency in the shortest possible time. It points out to him the fact that its ability to accomplish its aim depends almost altogether, upon the replacement by the Department of such wholly unsatisfactory and worn out buildings as those at present occupied for boarding school purposes on the Blood and Peigan Reserves, and upon the remodelling, enlargement and re-equipment of such modern but very inadequate buildings as those of the Old Sun's School. This Committee further, expresses its great\nregret that the limitations placed upon the plans of the Department by the very great calls which the Minister of Finance is required to meet in other directions, has prevented the Deputy Superintendent General from placing in his estimates for the forthcoming year, a sum sufficient to cover the whole of the building operations agreed upon as urgently needed, at the interview of May 27th last, and as set out in the correspondence quoted above. This Committee further urges the Deputy Inspector General to make financial provision as soon as possible for the erection of The New Joint Boarding School for the Blood and Peigan Reserves, and, following the enlargement and re-equipment of the old Sun's Boarding school, give the claims of this Joint Institution, right-of-way as far as the Church of England in Canada is concerned, over all other needs for building.\n\n(4) That this Executive Committee submits to the Deputy Superintendent General the following immediate proposal,\n\n1. This Committee to select, employ, and pay a thoroughly qualified nurse who shall be appointed to the nursing care of the Indian Children in the Boarding Schools under this Committee. The nurse to travel from Institution to Institution seeing that the instructions of the medical officers of the Department are properly carried out, and spending in any one institution the amount of time which any special need of the children there may require.\n\n2. The Department to be responsible for (1) the nurses travelling expenses between institutions and (2) the needed medical and surgical supplies\n\n3. If this proposal is accepted and found to be satisfactory in operation, this Committee will in due time, if the need be shown to exist, consider sympathetically the appointment of a second nurse on the same conditions.\n\nJanuary 14th, 1921.\n\n(Signed) S. Gould,\nGeneral Secretary.\nToronto, January 17th, 1921.\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nYour letter dated January 8th enclosing copy of Dr. Corbett's report on his inspection of the children at the Old Sun School and the Sargee School received.\n\nThese serious matters were considered by our executive committee yesterday, and I enclose herewith the Committee's action on the communications noted. The Committee's action is so very full that I do not think it necessary to add much by way of further comment. I need only emphasize the point that the directions of the local doctor were carried out by the members of the staff and the conditions described by Dr. Corbett must be ascribed to the wrong diagnosis of the local medical man. Speaking from an entirely personal standpoint, and in the light of thirteen years medical work in Palestine, I found it very difficult to appreciate the following statement by Dr. Corbett \"Two of the girls - Jean Spotted One and Elsie Many Goods - have sores on the backs of their heads fully three inches across, and heaped up with crusts nearly half an inch thick\". As a condition caused by scabies, this description struck me as quite unusual. I read the extract, I may add, over the telephone to a very prominent medical authority in Toronto and he at once said that scabies did not affect the scalp. This, however, is after all a minor point, and I have no desire to discuss the diagnosis of the local medical man or of Dr. Corbett. Having just returned from the school, however, and noted its condition - conditions which were confirmed, as you told me, by Mr. Orr - I must ask\nto be permitted to say that I think Dr. Corbett's account to be somewhat over-emphasized.\n\nI shall regard it as a favour if you could let me have an early reply concerning the definite recommendation included in the resolution of the Executive Committee.\n\n1. With regard to the Sarcee Boarding School, the acknowledged physical condition of the children in this school making it imperative, in our estimation, that they should be placed entirely under a medical regime, - a regime which must of necessity involve considerable expenditure and require the services of specially trained agents and, therefore, should be, we think, conducted directly by the Department, though as a Missionary Society we should be glad to cooperate in any possible.\n\n2. The question of the short leave system for the children, which has been current in the Old Sun's School. You will remember that I brought this matter also, on a previous occasion, to your notice and I trust that there will be no difficulty in the issuing of necessary instructions by the Department.\n\n3. With regard to the nurse; we find that while there is a very definite need for the inspection and nursing care of the children, we do not find that there is sufficient work at any one institution to require the services of a qualified nurse all the time. We, therefore, trust that our proposal will meet with your approval as the best immediate solution of the need.\n\nI may say that the Acting-principal of the Old Sun's School advises us that the Indian Agent, on the request of Canam Stocken, has applied for the admission to the school of one or more children who were decidedly under age.\nOur Executive Committee laid down the ruling for its own Agents (1) that children under the specified age (laid down by the authorities of the Indian Department) could not be admitted to any school, without the express permission of the Executive Committee and, further, that the principal, or Acting-principal, and not the Missionary, must be the person to submit applications through the proper channel to the Department for the admission of all children. I am glad to know, from the letter of the Acting-principal, that you agreed with the above views of the Executive Committee concerning the admission of under-age children and that you declined the request submitted by the local Indian Agent.\n\nWe are engaged in the active search for a competent farmer for the Old Sun's school, and I shall be glad if you are in a position to let me know what steps have been taken by the Indian Commissioner with a view to securing, for the use of the school, the additional lands.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\nS. Gould,\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nP.S. If you think that under some system of special grants sufficient to enable the Missionary Society to pay the qualified agents needed, and to meet the other required expenses, we could conduct, as a Missionary Society, the Sarcee Institution as a Sanitarium, I shall be glad to submit your views to the Executive Committee. Needless to add, we are most anxious to do all in our power to meet and alleviate the distressing conditions existing at present.\n\nS.G.\nToronto; Ontario\n\n39-40 The Bible House, Alexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man., May 4, 1921.\n\nDuncan C.

I have noted again the necessity of extra class-room accommodation and can assure you that this matter will receive careful attention when preparing the Estimates for the next fiscal year. I am pleased to learn that the staff has been materially increased and that the visit from the travelling nurse may have beneficial results.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI beg to submit the following report on Old Suns School, for the month of December, 1921:\n\nI visited this school on the 14th and 23rd. On the first visit I made a careful inspection of the pupils in the class rooms and also had a talk with the staff on the general educational work ensuing to be operation, and the follow up system in all branches of the work. The necessity of the \"follow up\" system was brought to my attention by number of ex pupils asking for a night class, and also because I have found that girl ex pupils very quickly give up those things which they are taught in housekeeping.\n\nThe present pupils are doing very well in the class room, and on the 23rd they put on an excellent concert consisting of songs, recitations, and drills.\n\nI have made arrangements to start night classes for ex-pupils on January the 5th, and have the co-operation of the missionary school staff, and other interested peoples after this is gotted under way I will inform you of the nature of the work, and anything else which may be of interest.\n\nThe register was as follows:\n\n|                |       |\n|----------------|-------|\n| Girls in Kitchen | 2     |\n| Boys on Farm    | 2     |\n| Class Room 1    | 14    |\n| \" 2             | 18    |\n| \" 3             | 10    |\n| \" 4             | 4     |\n| Sick            | 3     |\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst: Deputy & Secretary,\nDept: of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 9, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your report on the Old Sun's School for the month of December, 1921. The Department is pleased to learn that the principal and staff are getting good results.\n\nThe plan of yourself, the missionary and school staff to operate night classes for ex-pupils appears to be an innovation in connection with our Indian work. I am personally interested in this activity, and wish you and those interested every success. The Department will be glad to hear of the nature of the work done at these special classes and will be pleased to learn something of the results obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

GOODERHAM,\nDATED JUNE 12, 1922, ON THE OLD SUNS SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File #104-1-7.\n\nThis school is also behind in instruction to boys on farming and stock raising, and the cultivation done on the school farm is certainly not an example that the boys should ever follow. More time should be given to this branch of the work. The barn at this institution is very small, and in poor condition; stock cannot be properly cared for in such a place, and replacement by a real barn, is one of the very first needs at this school.\nSir,\n\nI understand that P.H. Gentleman is being relieved of the position of principal of Old Sims School at the end of the present month, and I would like to know whom the M.S.C.C. will then put in charge of this institution.\n\nIt is important that a reliable person take charge, as the older boys and girls cannot be allowed too much freedom, and certain seasonal work must be under competent direction.\n\nCould you please ascertain what the M.S.C.C. are doing in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst: Deputy & Secretary,\nDept: of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 27, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, informing the Department that Mr. P.

Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary, Missionary Society of the Church of England, is being requested to nominate a thoroughly competent and practical man as principal of this school, to succeed Mr. Gentleman. As soon as we are informed as to the selection made for this position, you will be advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. H.

Gentleman who retires today, I beg to state that I am unable, at present, to furnish this information, but hope to be able to do so early in July. Our Commission have received a number of applications for this position and these will be considered at a meeting to be held next week when some decision, I trust, may be arrived at in this matter.\n\nAs I gathered from a letter from the Superintendent of Indian Education dated May 19 (Ref. 104-1-5) that alterations to the school building might possibly commence during the first week in July the children, except some of the older boys and girls, will be sent home on holiday from the first of that month and the staff reduced accordingly.\n\nFor the short period which it is expected may intervene between the retirement of Mr. Gentleman and the arrival of the new Acting Principal, Mr. Jas. Stone has been charged with the oversight of the property and any duties which may have to be carried on.\n\nBefore closing I should like to assure you that as our Society is rather painfully conscious of the necessity of having a strong and capable man at the head of this institution we will not fail to do our utmost to secure one.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\nOTTAWA, July 7th, 1922.\n\nRev.

I consider that it is practically a waste of money as far as carrying on the work of this institution is concerned. During the last year there has been absolutely no improvement and I think it would be wise if the Department would take steps to have this institution carried on in a more business-like way than it is now.\n\nW.

The Department to bear the cost of retaining the services of\nthe staff needed to care for the equipment of the Institution during the\nprocess of reconstruction and to secure its prompt re-opening at the\ndate noted.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nOttawa, Sept. 28, 1922.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nI have yours of the 16th instant, regarding the Old Sun's Boarding School on the Blackfoot Reserve.\n\nThis Department agrees to make some provision for the services of the staff in place of a per capita grant, until such time as the building is ready for the return of the students. I hope that the work will proceed rapidly and that the building will be ready for occupation at the end of the calendar year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

He comes from the county of\nIreland where he was a trained teacher and held the Principal-\nship of a National School, with one hundred and thirty\npupils, for six years. In the province of Manitoba the\nDepartment of Education informed me that they would grant\nhim not lower than second class teachers' standing on\ndiplomas which he presented with his application.\n\nHe also possesses considerable ability as a\nmusician, while his wife has exceptional qualifications in\nthis, as well as in other ways.\n\nAs Mr. Gibney possesses testimonials of the high-\nest quality as to his general suitability for the position\nto which he is hereby nominated, I shall be obliged if you\nwill furnish me with a statement to the effect that you\napprove of the same.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary and Acting General\nSecretary M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, Nov. 18, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, nominating the Rev. F. J. Ross Gibney to the position of Principal of the Old Sun's Indian Boarding School. I have noted Mr. Gibney's qualifications, and in reply I wish to state that the Department approves of his temporary appointment. The Rev. Gentleman appears to be well qualified for the work of supervising an Indian residential school, and I look for a career of much usefulness in his case.\n\nThe Department hopes that the building operations will be completed by the end of this calendar year and that Mr. Gibney will commence his new duties next January.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

S. C. C., and the Rev. Dr. Westgate has been informed that he will be expected to supply a suitable man to look after the mechanical equipment of the building to the satisfaction of the Department. He has also been instructed to submit to the Department, the qualifications of the man he proposed to assign to the work, before appointment is made.\n\nI agree with you that it is absolutely essential that a competent man be placed in charge of this portion of the work at the school, and the Department will insist that the church supply a man capable of carrying out these duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.

They found that to secure a man with the highest qualifications will cost them more in the way of salary than they can pay, as the demand, in each case in this respect, was for a larger amount than any of our Principals are at present receiving. The salary demanded by men with somewhat lower standard qualifications is also higher than our Society pays its male agents, such as the Turn Instructor, etc., and as the estimates for the maintenance of the Blackfoot School for 1923 were passed by our Society before we were assured that the enlargement of the building would take place, no provision had been made in those estimates for an Engineer. I shall be obliged if you will let me know if your Department can come to the assistance of our Society by making a small monthly maintenance grant, at least for the balance of this year, towards the salary of this Engineer.\n\nOf all the applicants interviewed by our Commission, they were most favourably impressed by Mr. W. H. Courtinall of Winnipeg, a copy of whose certificate is enclosed herewith, and they trust that his appointment may be acceptable to your Department.\n\nMr. Courtinall is a British subject, born in Suffolk, England, in June 1898, and consequently only 24 years of age. His certificate, which expired at the end of 1922, is being renewed, and a copy of this can be forwarded at a later date if required. We are confident that he can manage the whole of the steam-heating, electric lighting, and water systems of the Blackfoot Institution, and will undertake any minor plumbing repairs, etc., which may be necessary, if tools are provided.\nOttawa, Jan. 22, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to refer to your letter of November 14th, last, and answering official communication of the 21st of the same month, with reference to a grant for the Old Sun's Boarding School for the quarter ended September 30th, last. The Deputy Superintendent General is prepared to make a similar arrangement for the quarter ended the 31st ultimo. I would be pleased to have a statement from you regarding the expenses incurred at the Old Sun's Boarding School up to such time as this institution commenced earning a per capita grant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. H. Wattgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary &\nActing General Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n4-45 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, Jan. 22, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to official communication of this file number, of the 18th ultimo. The Rev. Dr. Westgate has nominated for the position of engineer at the Old Sun's Boarding School a Mr. W. H. Courtnall. This man is only 24 years of age but holds certain certificates that appear to qualify him for the position. This Department has approved of his temporary appointment, and I shall be pleased if you will make a report on his services after he has completed a term of one month. Consideration will then be given to confirming the appointment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nOttawa, Jan. 22, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the appointment of a qualified man to act as engineer-caretaker at the Old Sun's Indian Boarding School. The qualifications of Mr. W. R. Courtnall have been found, and his temporary appointment to the position is approved. I shall be pleased if you will inform the acting principal, Mr. Gibney, of your satisfaction with the services of this engineer at the end of a month's trial. Mr. Agent Gooderham will also be instructed to send in a report and make a recommendation regarding the permanent employment of Mr. Courtnall.\n\nIt is the policy of this Department to insist on proper care of the mechanical plant at modern Indian residential schools. At first glance, this practice would appear to place heavy expense upon the school management and the churches concerned. However, it has been found that such employee has, particularly at certain seasons of the year, considerable time at his hands and has been utilized as boys' supervisor, gardener, or in some other occupation in addition to his duties as engineer. In short, in actual practice it means that one of the male members of the staff shall be a qualified engineer with an adequate amount of his time released for the proper care and supervision of the heating, lighting and water systems.\n\nWith reference to the possibility of this Department making a grant towards the salary of the engineer employed, I regret to state that no funds are provided in this connection. It is understood that the school management will provide such sufficient number of teachers, officers and employees as may in the opinion of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs be necessary for the satisfactory conduct and management of the school, and funds are not appropriated for salaries at Indian residential schools. I have to intimate, however, that another communication is being addressed to you, with reference to a payment in lieu of unearned per capita grant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

A copy of your letter has been forwarded to Mr. Gurney and I have instructed him to report on the services of this engineer, after a months trial, to this office. This report will be sent to you in due course.\n\nI note the policy which obtains in your Department in regard to the proper care of mechanical plant at Indian residential schools. At certain seasons it may be possible to utilize the services of the engineer in another capacity.\n\nI note with regret that the Department cannot see its way to make a grant towards the salary of the engineer, and await with interest the arrival of the communication referred to in your letter.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\nField Secretary and Acting General Secretary M.S.C.C.\nSir,\n\nReference your letter of the 22nd ultimo file 104-1-5. I regret to say that Mr. Baird of the Baird Construction Co., has advised me that his company will not be responsible for damages to the plant at Old Suns School if Mr. W.R. Courtnall is retained in charge when his company hands over to the staff.\n\nOn my request Dr. Westgate sent Mr. Courtnall to the school on 2nd inst and he has been working about the place in the interim. It would appear that his knowledge is very limited and everything he did required supervision. Needless to say the plant cannot, therefore, be left in his charge for a month as specified in your letter, and I so informed the Rev. Mr. Gibney, principal of the school, on the 10th inst, and advised him to write Dr. Westgate immediately and request that a local man be temporarily employed provided no other competent mechanic can be secured. I can recommend the local man, Mr. Armstrong.\n\nI understand the Baird Construction Co., are responsible for the plant for twelve months and I know they merely want a responsible man to be in charge.\n\nFor your information, please.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Arrange for competent man to take his place on one months trial. Communicate with Indian Agent Gooderham.\"\n\nFor your information I may say that Mr. Gibney, the Acting Principal, has already been in communication with me on this subject but requested me, in his last letter, to take no further action until he had satisfied himself that Mr. Courtnall was not competent to handle all the machinery which would be installed. He stated that he had heard adverse reports on Mr. Courtnall's ability from the Contractors and the Indian Agent but he desired to assure himself that these reports were to be relied upon before making a definite recommendation. I am not ignorant of the fact that the Contractors had their own nominee for the position of Engineer at this School but as their nominee was unacceptable to our Commission he did not receive the appointment and I wish to make quite certain that the adverse reports on Mr. Courtnall's ability have not arisen in this connection. As soon as I am assured by the Acting Principal that Mr. Courtnall is incapable of handling the machinery installed he will be immediately dismissed and a fully competent man appointed to take his place. I do not, however, think it fair to Mr. Courtnall or to our Commission that he should be dismissed before he has had a fair trial.\n\nBelieve me Yours very truly,\n\nT.B.R. Westgate,\nActing General Secretary M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, March 3, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. B-12 of the 12th ultimo, in which you inform the Department that the Baird Construction Company advised you they would not be responsible for damages to the mechanical plant at the Old Sun's Indian Boarding School, if the services of Mr. W. R. Courtnall were retained.\n\nI have to inform you that, upon receipt of your communication, the Department telegraphed to Dr. Westgate of Winnipeg, requesting him to arrange for a competent man to take the place of Mr. Courtnall. The Field Secretary of the M. S. C. C. has replied that he understands \"the contractors had their own nominee for the position of engineer for this school but, as their nominee was unacceptable to our Commission, he did not receive the appointment, and I wish to make quite certain that the adverse reports on Mr. Courtnall's ability have not arisen in this connection.\" Dr. Westgate adds that it would be fairer to Mr. Courtnall and to the M. S. C. C. Commission if a fair trial was given to the officer in question.\n\nI should be pleased if you would secure a written report from Mr. Gardner Smith, relative to the ability of Mr. Courtnall as engineer-caretaker.

Mr. Gibney, and E. Gardner Smith, Inspector of Construction. The main part of the contract was then finished but considerable equipment was required to make it a complete up-to-date institution and requirements in this respect were tabulated and at the same time care was taken to put into use all old equipment which was not beyond repair.\n\nI am very favourably impressed with Mr. Gibney. He is young and enthusiastic and appears to have lots of common sense. The church has now an splendid institution and under a good organization it should be a credit to the Department as well as the Anglican Church.\n\nSix of the bigger girls and two boys are at present at the school; they are assisting the members of the staff in preparing to accept all the pupils who are now at their homes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

I do not consider this operator capable of successfully operating this plant.\n\nThe Boiler certificates are issued on condition that a capable operator is in charge of this plant.\n\n(Sgd.) A. W. Dick,\nInspector of Boilers,\nDept. of Public Works, Alberta.\nOld Suns School,\nGleichen, Alta. March 13th, 1923.\n\nGeo. Gooderham Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGLEICHEN, Alta.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith regard to your request for a report on the capabilities of Mr. Courtnall as engineer-caretaker for the Old Suns School, I would say that during the period of his being on trial, under the supervision of the contractors for the building, he did not show any evidence of being competent to look after the heating and mechanical plant. On the contrary, the general contractor, the heating and plumbing subcontractor, and the electrical subcontractor all reported that they were unwilling to leave him in charge and assume any responsibility therewith. As the contractors are held to a 12 months' guarantee of the entire plant, we could not ignore their feelings in the matter, and I asked them to call on you and inform you of their reasons for being dissatisfied with Mr. Courtnall, which they did.\n\nWhen the Provincial Boiler Inspector visited the School on Feb. 27th to make his inspection of the heating plant, he also reported adversely on the qualifications of Mr. Courtnall.\n\nUnder these circumstances there was no other alternative than to procure a qualified operator for the plant.\n\nI was sorry to see that Dr. Westgate was rather of the opinion that there was some prejudice against Mr. Courtnall, and that the contractors had some favourite they wished to see placed in the position. The only reason that I know of why the contractors mentioned the name of a man whom they would like to have seen selected was because this man had assisted in putting in the plant, and they had thus first hand knowledge as to his capabilities and reliability.\n\nThe present operator, Mr. Ball, whom Dr. Westgate sent to replace Mr. Courtnall, seems more experienced and gives promise of filling the position satisfactorily. I believe he is acceptable to the contractors.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nSir,\n\nAs requested in your letter file 104-1-1 dated 3rd instant, I attach hereto a report by Inspector E. G. Smith on Mr. Courtnall as engineer and caretaker at Old Sun School. I can assure you that Mr. Smith's statement is correct, and regret that Dr. Westgate apparently misconstrued the intentions of every responsible person on the job. Experience shows that you cannot always judge a mechanic by his papers, but rather by his work. Mr. Courtnall has been replaced by a man sent from Winnipeg. Reports on him are satisfactory to date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Agent,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 20, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 2-12 of the 15th instant, enclosing a report from Mr. Gardner Smith on the services of Mr. Courtnall as engineer-contractor at the C.I.S. Band's Indian boarding school. The Department hopes, with satisfaction, that Mr. Courtnall has been replaced by Mr. Bell, who gives better promise of filling the position satisfactorily.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGlenichen, Alta.\nReferring to your telegram of the 21st February, I beg to inform you that Mr. Gordon A. Ball, a competent engineer, was engaged to proceed to the Old Sun School and take over from Courtnall on the 1st instant. Mr. Ball reported, as instructed, and so far has given every satisfaction.\n\nI am writing the Principal of the School requesting him to furnish a report, in writing, at the end of the month, and will forward you a copy of same on arrival.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nOffice Secretary.\nOttawa, March 27th, 1923.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, informing the Department that the services of Mr. Gordon A. Ball, who is a competent engineer, have been engaged as engineer-secretary at the Old Sun's Indian Boarding School. We note that Mr. Ball has taken up his duties and that so far he has given every satisfaction.\n\nI beg to thank you for the action taken in securing a competent man for the above position to succeed Mr. Courtnall, and shall be pleased to have a copy of the report of the principal as to the success Mr. Ball is accomplishing in his work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary & Acting General Secretary,\nMissionary Society of the Church in Canada,\n41-45, The Bible House, Alexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nI would particularly draw attention to the Inspector's remarks relative to the inadequate training in farming given to the boys at these two schools. The Principal of the Old Suns school has had no agricultural experience, and knows very little about the care of stock, while the Inspector's report with regard to the farmer and stockman attached to the school is not very encouraging. The prospects of the boys receiving good grounding in agriculture and stock raising under the tuition of these men are not very bright. As I have pointed out to the Department on previous occasions, training in agriculture and the care of stock is of greater importance to Indian boys than classroom work as it is to these occupations they must look for a livelihood when they return to the reserves. Our experience has been that school graduates, in many cases, are very much less capable as farmers and stockmen than Indians who have not received a school training. This is disconcerting, and unless Indian boys receive an education which they can put to practical use when they return to the reserves the period spent by them at school represents a waste of time and money.\n\nI am of the opinion that the remedy for this state of affairs lies in the Department insisting that only men who are practical agriculturists be appointed as principals of our boarding and industrial schools, and trust that this matter will be taken up with the Church authorities as it is too bad that all these schools do not function as they should.\n\nI am disappointed to hear from Mr. Christianson that the teachers at the Old Suns School are not qualified in so far as that they have not received Normal training. The reports of the Provincial School Inspectors on Indian schools have been in the majority of cases unsatisfactory, and these gentlemen have invariably stressed the necessity for employing as teachers in our schools only men and women who have received Normal training. I am sure that this matter is one which will receive earnest consideration from the Department.\n\n(Sgd.) W. M.

Boarding School.\n\nOriginal on File 77-104.\n\n---\n\nThe same thing applies to this school as to the other school, the boys have received very little experience in the line of farming or looking after stock. I cannot say what Mr. Brown can do as farmer. From what I gathered from the agent the work on the farm last summer was not very creditable. Mr. Stone as stockman, from what I saw, is certainly hopeless. I will admit the stable at the school is very poor but the conditions around the barn were certainly anything but encouraging. The stock was in very poor shape and the grounds around the stable were very untidy, the manure having been piled around the doors and showed every lack of energy on the part of the stockman. The principal, the Reverend Mr. Gibney, before going into the Ministry was a teacher for a number of years and from what I gathered has not had any experience in farming or stock raising any more than that obtained as a minister in a rural municipality.\nOttawa, May 5, 1923.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nThe Indian Commissioner at Regina sends in a rather pessimistic report, relative to the training in farming the boys at Old Sun's Indian Boarding School will receive under the supervision of the officers who are employed at the present time. The Principal, the Rev. Mr. Gibney, has had, I believe, no practical experience; the Farm Instructor, Mr. Brown, has been criticized by our representatives; and it appears that the Stockman Mr. Stone, is practically unqualified. A training in farming, gardening and the care of stock is highly important to boys at Indian residential schools, and I should be pleased if you would seriously consider the situation at Old Sun's.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.G.,\n41 - 43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, May 5, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your No. 401-9 of the 16th ultimo, relative to the pessimistic outlook for the boys' training at the Old Sun's Indian Boarding School.

Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just received your letter of May 5th (No. 104-1-1), in which you have embodied adverse opinions of certain members of our staff at the Old Sun School, especially those who are more directly responsible for the care of the live stock and the operations and general management of the farm.\n\nIn reply I should like to assure you that any requests which you may forward to me will always receive prompt and careful consideration, and be followed by action, so far as possible, along the line which you have suggested.\n\nWith regard to the agents in question at the Old Sun School, I consider it my duty to inform you that in my opinion they are all fully qualified to discharge the positions which they hold. Mr. Gibney, the Acting-Principal, as well as Missionary on the Reserve, may not have had a great deal of farming experience, but this fact was taken into consideration by our Society when they gave to Mr. Kemp the position of Vice-Principal, and by the appointment of practical men to the positions of Farmer and Farm Instructor.\n\nAs the School was not, until last year, provided with anything like adequate farming equipment, and has not even now a barn of any description, or stabling accommodation suitable for housing stock, I do not think that either Mr. Brown, the Farmer, or Mr. Stone, the Farm Instructor, have had a fair chance to show what they can do. In addition to the difficulty which seasons of protracted drought present in that vicinity, our farm at the Old Sun School borders on land overgrown with Russian thistle, which the Indians on the Reserve to whom it has been assigned have made but feeble efforts to eradicate.\nDuncan O. Scott, Esq., C.M.G.\n\nIf your Department will be so good as to ask them to exert themselves in this matter, and furnish us at the same time with the necessary buildings for a properly equipped farm and some live stock, especially a thoroughly good strain of milking cows, I think I can assure you that our staff of agents will be able to carry on every department of the work to your complete satisfaction.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.O.\n\nTBRW/FEC.\nOttawa, May 28, 1923.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to the qualifications of those members of the staff at the Old Sun's Indian Boarding School who are responsible for the instruction in farming, gardening and the care of stock. I have noted that, although Mr. Gibney, the acting principal, has not had farming experience, the vice principal, the farmer and the farm instructor are all equipped with the necessary information, and that you look for good results as soon as they have had an opportunity to give instruction to the boys at the school. Parliament has appropriated funds for the purpose of providing barn accommodation at this institution, and I trust that building operations will commence in the immediate future.\n\nI am directing a communication to Mr. Agent Gooderham, instructing him to take steps to see that the Indian farms in the vicinity of the Old Sun's School are kept more clear of Russian thistle.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

C.,\n41 - 43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, May 28, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department has received information from the Church of England authorities, which leads us to believe that certain Indian farms in the immediate vicinity of the Old Fort Indian Boarding School are overrun with Russian thistle. I should be pleased if you would take steps to have the Indian farmers concerned remedy this condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAest. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nGlenbow, Alta.,\n5th June 1923.\n\nG.H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBlackfoot Reserve.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to our conversation re the weedy condition of the Old Sun's School farm, and the report made by the authorities of that institution that the cause of this state of affairs was owing to the weedy condition of the Indians' farms adjoining their land, I have to point out the following facts:\n\nThe Nome Farm No. 1 lands, under my charge, lie directly alongside the school lands, only a wire fence dividing them, and are also in close proximity to the Indian farms complained of, notwithstanding which, they were, and are, remarkably clean and free from weeds, and called for no adverse criticism from me. The Indians on the farm refuse to agree with one exception among the oldest and best farmers on the reserve, and have their farms in very good condition, taking everything into consideration. The exception I refer to is the Yellow Horse place, which, as you are aware, owing to the death of the owner, we had some difficulty in getting properly worked. I would also point out that the worst infestation of the Old Sun's School land came from especially the mustard family, while the Indian farmers have had most trouble with the Russian thistle. These Indians go very carefully through their crops when growing, and pick all the weeds in sight, preventing them to a great extent from becoming matured.\n\nI may also mention that last year, last spring, I pointed out to Mr. Smith, who was then farm instructor at the school, the dirty condition of the wheat seed he had purchased, and strongly recommended him to put them through the fanning mill, offering him the use of my outfit to do so, as they had none of their own. He did not take advantage of my offer, but the result was that his wheat came up badly, breaking, and summerfallow, the result being a very dirty crop. I would also say that during last harvesting season, the mustard rolled off their land onto mine in such quantities, that they had to send their boys on more than one occasion to clear them up, in front of my binder, to enable me to get my oats cut. The Indian farms adjacent to them had difficulty with their binders through weeds, while the school people had the utmost difficulty in cutting their crop at all. I would like to say that the present school authorities went to a great deal of trouble, pulling and thinning weeds on their lands last fall, and certainly did their best to better conditions.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) J.C. Hutchison,\nFarm Inst.\nSir,\n\nYour letter of 6th ultimo, No. 1-1, re weeds on Indian farms near Old Sun's School to hand. The Rev. Dr. Westgarth informs me that he made such a complaint as yours to the farmer and farm instructor at the institution against whom Mr. Inspector Christianson recently made an adverse report; the inference was that these men might be competent if the odds against them were not so great. I attach herewith a report by our farm instructor who lives near the school and has four Indian boys under his charge. His reports are regularly given to me and I am well aware. He \"Yellow Indian\" farm has been taken over by the Old Sun's School this spring. Last year Canon Stocken who then lived on the edge of this farm pleaded for the widow when I threatened to take the farm from her, and let the young Indians work it properly and finally convinced that she should remain. He provided the Canon took the responsibility of having the cultivated land properly worked. Unfortunately the land received very little cultivation and was overrun with Russian thistle when winter set in. May say that same was true of the original Old Sun's farm which had never been properly cultivated since I assumed office in 1870.\n\nThe present farmer at the school, Mr. Brown, is doing his best. He has over 300 acres of cultivated land to work with poor equipment. He is a man I would judge of 65 and his assistance to the Indian boys. The farm instructor is Mr. Jones, is highly incompetent and has little or no control over the boys. Now what can be expected under such conditions.\n\nIf the church authorities have at any time, no many grounds for complaint as to weeds, lack of supervision, or incompetency among this Agency staff as has been evident at Old Sun's School, I will consider myself a failure. The Department can rest assured that the Indian farmers adjacent to this institution will not pollute the school farm with weeds provided the staff of this Agency get the proper supervision and cooperation. I would strongly urge the Indians to be better people in all their walks of life.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 13, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Gooderham:\n\nYour No. E-12 of the 7th instant has been brought to my attention. I am pleased to have your report with reference to the farm management at the Old Man's Indian Boarding School. I am convinced that the Church authorities will be able to arrange for more competent officers at this school, and a communication is being addressed to Dr. Westrate of Winnipeg. I am also satisfied that, if the school farm is dirty with weeds, they are largely responsible for this condition themselves.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nR.H. Gooderham, Sec.,\nIndian Agent,\nGlenchen, Alta.\nOttawa, June 13, 1923.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI wish to refer to my letter of this file number of the 24th ultimo, relative to the staff at the Old Sun's Indian Boarding School. As I intimated to you, a communication was addressed to Mr. Agent Gooderham, instructing him to give the farm management at the school a fair chance by keeping the contiguous Indian farms more free from noxious seeds.\n\nOur representative has replied that, with one exception, the farms surrounding the Old Sun's property are quite clean, and he is under the impression that the farmer at the school last year was responsible for much of the trouble. I should like to quote from the agent's instructor's statement: \"I must also mention that a year ago last spring I pointed out to Mr. Shaw, who was then farm instructor at the school, the dirty condition of the wheat seed he had purchased, and strongly recommended him to put them through the fanning mill, offering him the use of my outfit to do so, as there had been of old. Mr. Shaw did not take me up on my offer, and the seed was put in as purchased. In new breaking and summerfallow, the result being a very dirty crop. I would also say that during last harvesting season the mustard rolled off their land onto mine in such quantities, that they had to send their boys on more than one occasion to clear them out from my binders, which made me to get my oats cut. The Indian farmers adjacent to them had no difficulty with their binders through weeds, while the school people had the utmost difficulty in cutting their crop at all. I would like to say that the present school authorities were to a great deal of trouble pulling and cleaning up on their lands last fall, and certainly did their best to better conditions.\"\n\nFurther, Mr. Agent Gooderham states that the present farmer, Mr. Brown, is doing his best, but that Mr. Stone is highly incompetent and has little or no control over the boys. It should be pleaded if you could again seriously consider the advisability of appointing a qualified officer to relieve Mr. Stone and urging the staff at Old Sun's, generally, to work in closer harmony with the agency officers, in whom I have much confidence.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to the last paragraph of your letter of June 10, (1924), I beg to state that in response to your request that I should \"seriously consider the advisability of appointing a qualified officer to relieve Mr. Stone\" who was described by Mr. Agent Gooderham as \"highly incompetent and having little or no control over the boys,\" I am taking steps to have Mr. Stone transferred to one of our other schools to serve in a different capacity from that of Farm Instructor, and have engaged Mr. J. Minnelli, who holds a degree of B.S.A. from the Ontario Agricultural College of Guelph, to take his place at the Old Sun School until such time as the new Blood School has been completed, when he will be transferred to that Institution. After Mr. Minnelli has been transferred to the Blood School, it is hoped (and expected) that a fully capable man may be found to take his place.\n\nIn taking this action, however, I beg to state that I shall lay before you in a later communication, extracts from letters just received from Mr. Stone and Mr. Shaw, which confirm me in my opinion that the statements made by your representatives concerning these two agents would have benefited by considerable revision and modification before being placed in circulation.\n\nWith regard to the second request in this paragraph of your letter, namely, that I should urge the staff at the Old Sun School to work in closer harmony with the Agency officers, I beg to state that the staffs at all our schools are under standing instructions to work in the closest harmony with the representatives of your Department, and I am fully\nD. O. Scott, Esq., C.M.G.\n\nfully convinced that our staff at the Old Sun School are\nloyally endeavouring to carry these into effect. I shall,\nhowever, address a brief communication to the Principal in\nthis connection, and ask him to let me know if there has\nbeen, to his knowledge, any lack of harmony, and the cause of\nthe same.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.O.\n\nTBRN/ECO.\nToronto, Ontario, June 29, 1923,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nDuncan C.

Mr. Stone's Letter.\n\n\"As per instructions I beg to report as follows re management of farm:\n\nMr. Shaw left Xmas 1921. Prior to leaving he bought Seed Wheat of the Alberta Pacific Elevator. There is no doubt that both Mr. Shaw and Mr. Brown are competent farmers. The Elevator belongs to a respectable Company, and a heavy penalty is attached to the selling of dirty seed. This seed was sown on the Blind Bird place, also on our own farm. It took three of us all day, and every day the whole summer to pull the Tumbling Mustard on the Blind Bird place. Our own farm was free of mustard and is free today. On the evidence we discussed any idea of the seed being foul. Although the land sown to wheat on the Blind Bird place was fresh broken 1921 we could only come to the conclusion that the mustard was the accumulation of the dry years we have had (since 1916 I understand).\"\n\nThe Yellow Horse place is now being worked by this school, the bulk of it is under corn which is coming along nicely. I would point out that the present school authorities mentioned at the end of letter from Dept. of Indian Affairs is the same farm management that has been from 1/1/22 to date of mailing this report.\"\n\n(signed) Jas. Stone.\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq., C.M.G.\n\n2. Mr. Shaw's Letter.\n\n\"I have your letter of the 19th inst., also enclosed copy from the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs. I can only refer to the Agency Instructor's reference to the wheat I purchased in the spring of '21. This statement is not quite correct. I have no recollection of his ever having even seen the small amount of wheat needed for the little field of about 16 acres, which I spring sowed. The wheat came up in good shape, and as clean a little crop as I ever saw. On July 1st '21 it got half eaten by the ground, came up again, clean, and was cut for fodder\u20143 or 4 loads, as far as I remember. There was no new breaking, or summer-fallow, on all our property. After that I started in to break on Blue Bird place, followed all of our own, and fall plowed what wheat land Blue Bird had used for wheat. This was all double harrowed, the breaking double plowed, and kept black. I did not fall plow the oat ground, as spring plowing was best. I can only say that Mr. \u2014\u2014\u2014 the Agency instructor\u2014with whom I got along splendidly\u2014must have got mixed up a little with the 2 amounts of seed wheat purchased, as we bought the seed wheat for the big crop in the fall, when much cheaper. I do not at all recollect his pointing out condition of wheat, as there is more time in the early spring months to clean all seed for sowing. I left the school in December.\n\nI have very kind remembrances of both Mr. Gooderham, and the instructor. They gave me every assistance in their power, and their advice was very valuable to one, unused to both climate and soil.\n\nAccepting this as early as possible, so that you may not be delayed in any communications you may send.\n\nYours faithfully,\"\n\n(signed) G. Murray Shaw.\n\nThe statements set forth above correspond very well with my own knowledge and recollection of the whole situation, and I must here re-affirm my confidence in the ability and integrity of our Society's agents who are, or who have been, responsible for the farming operations at the Old Sun School since the beginning of the year '21. They laboured indefatigably and patiently with the limited amount of equipment at their command, but their best efforts were constantly being negatived, to a very considerable extent, by the growth of noxious weeds on the adjacent Indian Holdings. However, as Your Department very kindly made arrangements last year for\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., C.M.G.\n\nfor what was known as the Blue Bird holding to be handed over to our Society for the use of the school, and as arrangements have been made with the Blackfoot Agency for the school authorities to cultivate (on shares) the holding of Mrs. Yellow Horse, from the beginning of this year, I am hopeful that better conditions may soon obtain.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/PGC.\nOttawa, July 5, 1923.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI have your letters of the 29th ultimo, relative to the farm management at the Old Sun's Indian Boarding School.

All pupils, except bigger boys and girls were home on holidays. Those remaining at the School were employed on house work and farm work and get their holidays in turn.\n\nThe staff has been somewhat changed; a new farm instructor who is a graduate of O.A.C. replaces Mr Stone and made a favourable impression, he is young and enthusiastic to get results. The farm showed little improvement and there remained a great deal of work to be done. Many of the staff were on holidays.\n\nWork in the laundry is completed as far as can be proceeded with until authority and instructions are obtained from Ottawa to complete this work.

GOODERHAM FOR MONTH OF DECEMBER ON THE OLD SUNS RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 104-1-7.\n\nThe pupils of Senior Class Room were busy; they were clean but responded very poorly to questions. This may have been due to the coldness of the room and failure of the teacher to grasp the finer points of his work.\n\nIn the Junior Room the children were not orderly nor were they as clean and tidy as the matron should have had them. They responded very well to questions.\n\nThe school on the whole was clean and the new kitchen matron, Miss Sellone, appeared as a distinct improvement over her predecessor.\nOttawa, January 24, 1924.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nMr. Agent Goucherham, in a report on his inspection of the Old Sun's Indian Residential School for the month of December, last, states that the pupils of the senior classroom responded very poorly to questions asked by him. He states that this may have been due, in part, to the coldness of the room and the failure of the teacher to grasp the finer points of his work. He also states that, in the junior room, the children were not orderly nor were they as clean and tidy as the matron should have had them.\n\nThese remarks of the Inspector are drawn to your attention with a view to your taking steps to improve the conditions referred to in both the senior and junior classrooms.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. F. W. R. Gibney,\nPrincipal, Old Sun's Residential School,\nGleichen, Alta.\nRegina, Sask.,\nApril 11th 1924.\n\nSir;\n\nI would also draw your attention to the Agent's remarks regarding the Old Sun and Crowfoot Schools. I doubt very much if the Principal of the former school will begin to carry on the work to the satisfaction of the Department. The latter School is scrupulously clean, the children well fed and clothed and the classroom work good. The farming, however, is not all that is desired, but I have promises that there will be a great improvement in this branch of the work in the future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) W.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nBlackfoot Agency,\nGleichen, Alta.,\nApril 8th 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nRe Schools: Neither school is giving sufficient attention to the training of boys in farm work and care of stock. More efficient work must be done in this branch of the Indian education. At Crowfoot School the farmer is industrious but not scientific and I found that the boys do little or no milking. Stock is mediocre and not fed to the best advantage. I arranged that this school get another 160 acres of land, which adjoins their present farm. The Department has therefor done its share and it is now up to the principal to show results.\n\nAt Old Suns School the conditions are somewhat similar, though the boys do milk and attend to the stock, but their instruction is far from being satisfactory.\n\nThe present farmer at this school is an old man of the old school - these Indians must have a young up to date instructor, and the authorities of this school must lose no time in getting such a person on the job. The principal of this school is conscientious but lacks force to get things in order and properly done at the right time and in the right way. He must buck up and with his staff get into the harness and get results.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) G.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 17, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. Indian Agent Gooderham's last report on the farmer at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School is such that the Department is drawing to Mr. Westgate's attention the advisability of securing a proper incumbent without delay. Please inform Mr. Gooderham of the Department's action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, April 17, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI regret to inform you that the reports concerning the farmer at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School are unsatisfactory. Last summer a graduate of the Ontario Agricultural College replaced Mr. Stone and made a favourable impression; but it is now reported that the present farmer is an old gentleman and that it is extremely desirable that you take immediate steps to secure a proper incumbent. Please advise me of the remedial action you take.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA.\n\nRegina, Sask.,\nApril 3rd, 1914.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have just returned from the Province of Alberta, where I have been for nearly three weeks. I visited the Blood, Peigan, Sarcee, Blackfoot, Hobbema and Edmonton Agencies, and eight Indian Boarding Schools.\n\nBLACKFOOT AGENCY.\n\nI next visited the Old Sun School. I was disappointed to find that the Instructor who was there last summer has been taken away. The management of the outside work is left in an old man seventy years of age, of whom you have had a report by Mr. Christianson last July. He is not at all qualified to carry on the work that is necessary. The grounds surrounding the building were very untidy. It might be said they did not want to put the time on the work in view of the fact that we are tearing down some of the buildings. This, to my mind, is no excuse. It was not just the old building, the whole Institution presented an untidy appearance.\n\nThe stable is too elaborate altogether. The same accommodation could have been provided for half the money that was spent. I think it was $10,500 - $6,000 would have provided the same accommodation.\n\nThe measure for the winter was not removed from the end of the litter carrier. This should have been taken away once a week. The explanation given was that they require a truck to do this work. I do not agree with this, a wagon would have done as well as a truck.\n\nThere are eight head of cattle in the stable, two of them Holsteins and six short-horns. The cattle were in fair condition, but the flow of milk was inadequate.\n\nI am afraid this school will not be successful, I hate to have to write officially about this matter, but I am satisfied that I waited sufficiently long before expressing myself. I think the Principal conducting an Institution of this kind should have practical experience in matters of academic training, but he should also have a practical knowledge of outside work, sufficient to be able to direct affairs and not be guided entirely by the advice of his outside staff. I regret to have to bring this matter to your attention, but I would not be fair to myself or the Department, if I did not express my opinion on this matter, and I can assure you it is not expressed hastily.\n\n(Sgd.) W. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, April 23, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to answer that portion of your general letter of the 3rd instant, which refers to the unsatisfactory management in the case of the Old Sun's Indian Residential School. The Department is corresponding with Dr. Westgate concerning the principal. As you were informed in my letter of this file number of the 17th instant, action has already been taken regarding the farm instructor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, April 23, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI regret to inform you that Mr. Commissioner Graham of Regina has reported as follows concerning the general management of the Old Sun's Indian Residential School:\n\n\"I am afraid this school will not be successful. I hate to have to write officially about this matter, but I am satisfied that I waited sufficiently long before expressing myself. I think the principal conducting an institution of this kind should have a practical knowledge, not only of academic training, but he should also have a practical knowledge of outside work, sufficient to be able to direct affairs and not be guided entirely by the advice of his outside staff. I regret to have to bring this matter to your attention, but I would not be fair to myself or the Department if I did not express my opinion on this matter, and I can assure you it is not expressed hastily.\"\n\nThe Department is satisfied that Mr. Commissioner Graham would not write in these words unless he was convinced that remedial measures were necessary. Please consider this report and inform me concerning what action can be taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th inst. No. 104-1-1, and note that you are taking up with Dr. Westgate the advisability of securing a proper farmer at Old Sun School, with the least possible delay. I fear, however, that there is more than a farming Instructor required at this Institution. I have great doubt whether the Principal has the qualities necessary to conduct an Institution of this kind. He certainly has no knowledge whatever of stock or farming, and has not yet shown any outstanding ability to learn. I have refrained from saying much about this man until I am satisfied he has had a fair chance. I was displeased, at what I saw there on my last visit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.H. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 17th instant No 104-1-1, in which you state that the reports concerning the farmer at the Old Sun Indian Residential School are unsatisfactory, and that it is extremely desirable to take immediate steps to secure a proper incumbent for that position I beg to inform you that your letter was placed before the Indian and Eskimo Commission of our Society at a meeting held here yesterday, and I was instructed to request you to kindly furnish me with the grounds of dissatisfaction on which those reports were based. As you mention in your letter that the present farmer is \"an old gentleman\" I can only infer that rejection is taken to his appointment on account of his age. In this connection however, I should like to point out that Mr. Brown, the present farmer, while much older than Mr. Minnely, the graduate who occupied a temporary appointment as Farm Instructor at this School last year, but is now Farm Instructor at the Elkhorn School, is by no means so old a man as to be unable to discharge the duties attached to his office with satisfaction to our Society. He is a younger, more vigorous, and fully as capable a man for this appointment as men who are occupying similar positions at Roman Catholic Indian Residential Schools in the Province of Alberta, and as those appointees still retain their positions and are not conducting farming activities on so large a magnitude as we are undertaking at the Old Sun School, the unsatisfactory reports which you have received, coming as they do, after the reports of a similar nature which reached you last year in the same connexion, appear to me to be discriminatory against the Church of England.\nAt the March meeting of our Indian and Eskimo Commission arrangements were made whereby the Principals of our Society's Schools in the Prairie Provinces, where farming activities are carried on, should have the benefit of the expert knowledge which Mr. Minicelly, B.S.A., the Farm Instructor at the Elkhorn School possesses; and as he has already, at the request of our Commission furnished the Principal and the farmer at the Old Sun School with instructions as to how the farming activities are to be conducted this year, I have every reason to believe that these will be carried out with satisfaction to your Department as well as to our Society.\n\nOur Society maintains four male agents at this institution, viz., Principal; Vice-Principal; Engineer and Farmer. During the summer months the Engineer, while his duties are not so heavy in the main building, will keep the school grounds in order and take charge of the garden.\n\nArrangements have been completed for planting about 5,000 trees during the spring and summer, and it will be a matter of very keen regret to our Society, as well as to the Principal and his staff, if any readjustment of the personnel of the staff should be made necessary through the receipt of adverse reports, such as the one referred to in your letter. I am hoping, however, that after you have received the explanation which this letter contains, you will find that further \"remedial action\" is unnecessary and that I may have a statement to that effect from you.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nSir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\n[Signature]\n\nTERW/K.\nDear Sir:-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 23rd instant (No.104-1-1) in which you have incorporated an extract from a report furnished you by Mr. Commissioner Graham concerning the general management of the Old Sun Indian Residential School I beg to state that, as the extract from the report deals almost exclusively with the ability of the Principal; and as all matters pertaining to the appointment, the transfer or dismissal of Principals are dealt with by the Executive Committee of our Society, a copy of your letter is being forwarded to our General Secretary for any action which he may think necessary.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/K.\nOttawa, May 16, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, with reference to the farming instructor at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School and the supervision of Mr. Minelly, B.S.A., who is at present at the Elkhorn institution. I believe there is considerable merit in the arrangement which permits a specially qualified farmer to visit your Society's Indian residential schools. Such supervision is more or less of a departure in the history of this work and the Department will watch with interest the progress that is made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.G.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF AGENT G. H. GOODERHAM, FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL, ON THE OLD SUN'S RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\n---\n\nWithin the building there was one thing that attracted my attention particularly and that was the sewing room. I am satisfied that it is not properly used and that the seamstress is not efficient. The Principal told me a change would be made in July. When proper instruction can be given, this school should be supplied with two sewing machines. Miss C. Hauver, the new junior teacher, is doing good work; her previous training in a white day school is showing results.\nBlackfoot Agency,\nGleichen, Alta., July 9, 1924.\n\nI beg to submit the following report for the month of June, 1924.\n\nGENERAL:\nRe Schools - Old Sun was not so good this month. The principal was again in charge and I regret to say that he does not get results. He lacks force and strength of character to make his staff show results. He is a fine Christian character and a good missionary but I am now convinced that he is not the right man to run an Indian Boarding School.\n\nNOTE:\nThis was my opinion from the start.\nHe is not getting results.\n\nW.M.G.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM MR. W. M. GRAHAM, INDIAN COMMISSIONER, DATED AUGUST 19, 1924.\n\nI know the Principal has elaborate ideas as to what he is going to get in the way of out-buildings, but I do not agree with his ideas, as he is a very impractical man, and is absolutely incompetent for his job. I believe the school is at a standstill if not going back.\nOttawa, September 5, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. Commissioner Graham has reported in part as follows with reference to the Rev. Principal of the Old Sun's Indian Residential School: \"He is a very impractical man and is absolutely incompetent for his job. I believe the school is at a standstill, if not going back.\" It is stated also that Mr. Gibney is a fine Christian type and a good missionary, but that he is not the right man to run an Indian boarding school.\n\nIn this connection I wish to refer you to official letter of April 23rd, last, and to your answer of April 29th. I should be pleased to have a statement from the M. S. C. C. with reference to the success of Mr. Gibney and concerning the advisability of continuing his services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nIn your letter No. 104-1-1 of the 23rd of April last you informed me that the Department were taking up with Dr. Westrate the matter of the unsatisfactory management of the Old Sun's School.\n\nAs yet I have heard nothing further from you regarding this matter, and it is now four and a half months since I received this letter. Some change must be made here if we are going to get any results.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nExtract from Agent's Report on the OLD SUN'S RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL FOR the month of AUGUST, 1924.\n\nThis institution was visited on the 26th. Classroom work was satisfactory and it was pleasing to know that the pupils had received a number of prizes at the Regina and Calgary fairs. The work exhibited was of a varied nature and the ability to compete is evidence of better tuition at this school than in former years.\n\nThe school farm was dirty - weeds having got ahead of the staff. A school farm should be an example and when the church authorities commence a programme of work it should be carried out in the proper manner. I am not at all satisfied that everything has been done which could and should have been done.\n\nCrops improved and there should be sufficient feed.\n\nJ. H. Gooderham,\nAgent.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nToronto, Ontario, 11th Sept., 1884\n\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 5th instant (104-1-1) in which you have inclosed an extract from Mr. Commissioner Graham's report on Mr. Gibney's qualifications for the position of Principal of the Old Sun School, I beg to state that your communication was submitted to a meeting of the Indian and Native Commission of our Society, presided over by His Grace, the Primate, on the 4th instant and I was instructed to inform you that the statement which you request with reference to the success of Mr. Gibney and concerning the advisability of continuing his services, could not be furnished until I had again visited this School and arranged for your Secretary a special report on the progress which had been made since Mr. Gibney was appointed to the position of Principal. As I am in Winnipeg to-morrow for Toronto to attend important meetings of our Society and cannot return until early in October it will not be possible for our Society to furnish you with the statement you desire until some time after that date, but I should like to assure you that the statement will be forwarded at the earliest date possible.\n\nIn the meantime I think I can assure you that, as information has reached me of the good opinion which one of your representatives expresses to the Principal of the work being done at the School as a whole and especially on the farm, there can be little cause for concern about the present system of administering this Institution. It may not be perfect and it cannot compare up to the standard desired by your Commissioner but from reports which have reached me from men who should know, some of them your own representatives, the work which is being accomplished at this School will favourably compare with that of any other Indian Residential School in that part of Alberta.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDictated but not personally signed because of absence from the office.\nBlackfoot Agency,\nGlenchen, Alta., Sept. 5, 1924\n\nI beg to submit the following report for the month of August, 1924.\n\nAt Old Sun's the weeds have got out of control - the Church authorities should staff this Institution, strong enough to keep their farm in good shape; present conditions are a very bad example, especially when every endeavour is being made to get good cultivation, not only among the Indians, but from our Lease holders.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nCommissioner's Office,\nRegina, Sask., Sept. 18, 1924.\n\nBar,\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of Indian Agent Goodrham's report for the month of August.\n\nI would particularly draw your attention to what the agent says regarding the condition of affairs at the Old Sun's School. Some time ago you wrote to me saying that there would be a change, but nothing has taken place so far. I think I pointed out in a previous letter that it was not the Farming Instructor that should be changed, but that the management was to blame; this report confirms what I have already said. To me it seems an absurd position, to have a man who knows absolutely nothing about farming or stock, managing an institution where farm work and the care of stock are the main features to be taught, to say nothing of the example that is being set by having the institution run on these lines in the midst of an Indian population. We will always have a situation of this kind unless the Department insist on approving of the nominees for the position of Principal before an appointment is made. We should not be experimenting all the time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, Sept. 29, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the Principal of the Old Sun's Indian Residential School. I have noted that you wish to visit the institution before making a report and I wish to state that your findings should be communicated to the Department at your earliest opportunity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. R. R. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOwing to pressure of other work this Institution was not visited. The writer was, however, in touch with the Principal re farming operations on the school farm and must again draw the attention of the Department to this branch of the work, because it is very bad indeed. The land is weedy and the crops badly harvested. In fact considerable of it will be of little value. The Church authorities are practicing the most flagrant false economy in not properly managing and equipping this farm. The Indian farmers as a whole have better kept farms and more returns than the school and this institution and its work is judged by the casual observer by what he sees. Needless to say the impressions are not likely to throw credit on the Church authorities or the Department.\n\nPublic School Inspector Boyce visited the school and advised me that he noted an advancement in school work and a good tone throughout the Institution. This is gratifying - but a chain is as strong as its weakest link, and this institution is therefore still much below standard.\n\n(sgd) G.H. Goodenham\nActing Agent\nOttawa, November 28, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to refer you to official letter of this file number of September 5th and to your answering communication of the 11th of September, relative to conditions at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School. The Department would be pleased to have your report at the earliest opportunity. I have before me a report on the Old Sun's institution for October, which indicates that there has been an advancement in academic work and that there is a good spirit in the school. However, it is stated that the farm is not properly managed and is no credit to the Church Authorities or the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev.

In your letters referred to above, your Commissioner is reported to have stated, inter alia, that -\n\n(a) Mr. Gibney is a very impractical man.\n(b) He is absolutely incompetent for his job.\n(c) The School is at a standstill if not going back.\n\nAs statements such as these, especially when they are made by one holding the office of a Commissioner, cast a serious and disfiguring reflection on our Society's system of administration, I am of the opinion that it would be quite in order for our Society to request your Department, before proceeding any further, to instruct your Commissioner to furnish in writing some, at least, of the specific grounds on which his statements are based. You will agree with me, I think, when I state that it is a comparatively easy thing to do to make certain damaging statements, but that it is not always so easy a matter to prove to the satisfaction of others that such statements are true. The absence of any definitely specific grounds on which the Commissioner has based his statements in this matter, renders it very difficult for me, and would also, I believe, for anyone else to examine the situation from his point of view. I can, however, and have pleasure in doing so, furnish you with certain facts about Mr. Gibney and the work which is being accomplished at the Old Sun School and after you have examined these I am of the\nopinion that you will receive a different and more favourable impression than the Commissioner's statements are likely to convey.\n\n1. WITH REGARD TO MR. GIBNEY'S QUALIFICATIONS.\n\nI beg to state as follows:\n\n(a) He was King's Scholar in 1906 at the Church of Ireland Training College where he qualified as a Teacher and subsequently taught school for six years in Ireland in the capacity of Principal.\n\n(b) He holds the Diploma of a Trained Teacher from the Board of Education in Ireland.\n\n(c) He is a graduate in Theology of Wycliffe College, Toronto, where he obtained the L.Th. degree, and is in full Orders in our Church.\n\n(d) He is 38 years of age, slight of build but energetic and active, enjoys good health, and has had charge of churches at Chapleau, in Ontario and Caron in Saskatchewan.\n\nFrom the above facts it seems to me to be clear that Mr. Gibney possesses qualifications which must surely help to fit him mentally, morally, and physically for the position he now holds, and that consequently he can not be so \"absolutely incompetent\" as your Commissioner states.\n\n2. It is, however, with the work itself which is being accomplished, not only on the School farm, but in the class room and other departments as well, that one would naturally look for evidence of Mr. Gibney's fitness for the position which he holds, and in this respect I beg to state that, in my opinion, the results are not disappointing. A few of these, out of many which might be mentioned, are as follows:\n\n(a) The excellent state of the health of the children at the time of my recent visit, their good behaviour, general tidy appearance and happy expression of countenance all impressed me as being such as could only be secured in a thoroughly well and wisely managed School.\n\n(b) The large number of Indians, larger than I had ever seen before, including parents of the children and others, who came to the School to visit the pupils and participate in the Sunday Services and their many expressions of satisfaction with the care which the present staff were taking of the children in residence, appealed to me with considerable force as evidences that the Principal possessed the good will of all, and was accomplishing a greater work in this respect than any of his predecessors had done.\n\n(c) With regard to the class room and all the indoor work no written report from the School Inspector was available, but I was\ninformed by the Principal that Inspector Boyce had reported verbally to the local Indian Agent that good progress had been made during the period since his last visit. As evidence that progress was really being made, and that the School was not at a standstill nor going back, I may state that at the Calgary exhibition held last July, this School, in proportion to the number of exhibits sent in, carried off the second largest number of prizes, even in competition with exhibitors from the Province of Manitoba.\n\nAt the Regina exhibition held in July-August last, the School secured 22 prizes\u2014a large increase over last year, and of these 8 were of the 1st, 7 of the 2nd, 6 of the 3rd, and 1 of the special classes.\n\nAt the local exhibition held at Gleichen last September it was still more successful and was awarded 26 prizes, 9 of the 1st class, 8 of the 2nd, 8 of the 3rd, and 1 special.\n\nWhile all of the above mentioned prizes were won for classroom and domestic science work, I find that this School was likewise very creditably successful in securing prizes for farm and garden produce. Owing to the cost of sending these exhibits to remote centres, they were entered only at the Gleichen Fair and succeeded in being awarded no less than 36 prizes, of these 15 were of the 1st class, 12 of the 2nd and 9 of the 3rd.\n\nA School that can show a record of at least 92 prizes in one year, 35 of which were of the 1st class, 30 of the 2nd, 25 of the 3rd, and 2 specials, does not appear to me to be accurately described as being \"at a standstill\" much less as \"going back.\"\n\nIn addition to this I found that despite the early snow fall which visited all that part of Alberta this year and caught many farmers unprepared for it, the silo was full and a sufficient supply of hay, oats, and other green feed put up, either in the loft of the barn or elsewhere, to carry the stock through until the Spring. I found also the small but inadequate root cellar as full as it could conveniently be with turnips, potatoes, beets, and other vegetables and ready for the use of the children and the staff. These things were, to my mind, just as they should be, and I am utterly unable to understand how a Principal who had managed so well could be described as either \"impractical\" or \"incompetent.\" My difficulty in this respect was increased also rather than diminished, when I remembered that Mr. Gibney is quite competent to handle gasoline engines, and has handled all those installed at this School on occasions when the engineer had been absent or laid up with illness.\n\nIn my opinion, therefore, and that of the members of our Commission to whom I have communicated the above information, I beg to state, Mr. Gibney is discharging his duties as Acting Principal of the Old Sun School in an efficient and satisfactory manner, and that it would be not only a grave mistake but an act of great injustice to have his appointment cancelled.\nWhen the Old Sun School has been linked up with the power from Bassano, the same as the Crowfoot School has been, it is probable that the present engineer may be discharged and a younger, unmarried man engaged in his place who will not only look after the furnaces in the winter, but along with the present farmer, devote practically all of his time to the work of instructing the boys as to how to obtain the best results from the garden and the farm.\n\nIn order to do this with the best prospects of success, it will be necessary to have the further equipment in the way of buildings already promised, namely - an implement shed, a poultry-house, pigery, granary, an ice-house, cold storage room and dairy, and a new and larger root cellar, and I very much hope that these may soon be supplied. When these have been provided and the Acting Principal and his staff receive from your Commissioner the whole-hearted cooperation and encouragement which they deserve, I am persuaded that the work of this School will be an unqualified success.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/IMC\nThe cost of this work I figured to be about $900.00. It may, however, transpire that we will not be able to use as much of the old material as we figured on at first. In that case some additional material may have to be purchased. The cost, however, will come well within the $1,000.00 which was authorized by the Department.\n\nI beg to bring to your attention the fact that I reported on this school in April, 1927, which was just a short time after the Church authorities took over the institution subsequent to its being remodelled. At that time I found Mr. Brown and Mr. Stone occupying positions outside men at the School, the former looking after the farming operations and the latter attending to the stock. I stated in my report that these men were not capable of doing the work. On my next visit to the Agency the services of a Farming Instructor named Mr. McMinieley who is now at Elk Horn - had been procured, and at that time I was very well impressed with him, and felt quite sure that he was capable of doing good work at this Institution if he received the proper backing. During this last summer I was aware that Mr. McMinieley had been transferred to Elk Horn School, but naturally I was under the impression that he had been succeeded by a man who was capable of filling his place. You can imagine my surprise therefore, when I visited the School, to find...\nold Mr. Brown in charge of all the outside work. He may be a fine old man, and I do not doubt that he is, but that is not a sufficient recommendation to enable him to handle a large number of Indian boys in addition to a farm which should provide the training for these boys that is an important part of their education.\n\nThe school might make good use of Mr. Brown to look after the gardens and the chickens etc., but he is not suited for the position he now occupies. Another thing, he could not get any assistance from the Principal, who is a man inexperienced in outside work, stock raising and in running an institution of this kind.\n\nThe farm work at this school is a huge joke. The crops raised last summer were grown up with weeds, and the Agent informed me that in a plot of cultivated land by the side of the road, one could not tell the corn from the weeds. No attempt had been made at cultivation. To give you an idea of the lack of management here I might mention that the crop raised last summer was practically all standing in stock. I presume it was the intention of the authorities to use this crop for feed. There was an empty loft in the barn and this could have been used as a place in which to store the crop. Instead of doing this, however, the grain was left standing and they are now picking it out of the snow. The authorities cannot\ncannot come back and say that the work at the school farm is no worse than the work done by the Indians, because out of 14,000 acres which are under cultivation by the Indians there is only one small farm belonging to an old man, that has been as poorly worked as the school farm. This is no excuse for the latter's present condition.\n\nI do not think this matter should be treated lightly by the Department. A serious situation exists here. Unless some steps are taken to change the management the place will become so infested with weeds that we will be severely criticised by outsiders. Not only that, but the work in general will suffer.\n\nWhen the first frost came, the water froze in the pipes in the barn, owing to the fact that they were neglected as the hay loft was empty and very few stock were in the barn. I also noticed that the litter carrier was out of order. The premises around the stable and barn yard are in a very untidy condition and no effort is being made to remedy this state of affairs. This deplorable situation should not exist in an institution of this kind. They have first class school buildings and everything else should be in keeping and up to the same standard. I have no personal grievance against Mr. Gibney. I think he is a fine man, but he is not getting the results he should. He is not aggressive, and lacks the force that is necessary to carry on the work of an institution of this kind successfully.\nOLD SUNS SCHOOL, C.O.F.E.\n\nAs per your instructions before I left, I arranged for the tearing down of the old out-buildings and using the material, as far as possible, for the erection of other buildings. I made arrangements for the erection of the following buildings:\n\n- **Ice House**: 16x12, with three thicknesses of lumber, capacity about 18 tons of ice.\n- **Chicken House**: to be moved to a new site and repaired.\n- **Pig Pen**: to be built, size 18x70 with four pens.\n- **Implement Shed**: 30x75, with a garage in one end for one car, and store house for oil, gas etc.\n\nThis space will provide for all implements they will need in connection with farming operations.\n\nThis will complete the number of buildings that are necessary at the present time. At some future date they may need a shed for stock, but at present they have not enough cattle to fill one side of the barn, so the necessity for a shed in this connection need not be considered for some time.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF COMMISSIONER GRAHAM,\nHis No. 401-9, addressed to Deputy Supt.

Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nWith reference to the matter of the deficit in connection with the operation for the year 1923 of the Old Sun Indian Residential School Blackfoot Reserve, and the agreement arrived at during our recent conversation that, in view of the special circumstances and agreement which led to the enlargement of the school, the deficit in question be shared between the Department and the Missionary Society, I beg to say that the total cost of operation for the year 1923 was the sum of $14,585.19, while the total receipts from per capita grants amounted to $7,123.00, leaving a net difference of $7,462.19 which sum, I understand, is to be shared equally between the Missionary Society and the Department. Allowing for this payment by the Department, I find that our total deficit in connection with the operations of the Indian Residential Schools under the Society will, at the close of this year at December 31st, be a total amount in excess of the sum of $40,000.00.\n\nOn my way recently to the Coast I stopped off at the Old Sun School, having in mind particularly the adverse reports made by Mr. Commissioner Graham with regard to the capacities and qualifications of the Rev. Mr. John Gibney, Acting Principal. After looking fairly fully into the situation I agree with the conclusions arrived at by the Rev. Mr. Westgate as already submitted to you. Mr. Gibney is not what might be described as a show man. He does not, on casual acquaintance, reveal his best qualities. I was persuaded, however, that he possessed excellent qualifications for the post, having, in particular, a strong sympathy with, and understanding of, the Indians both adult and children. He is steadily gaining a very strong influence over the adult Indian population on the reserve; this influence is shown in several directions not only in the fact that the pupilage of the school is steadily increasing being, I think, 69 at the time of my visit. Here appears, therefore, to be a fairly good hope that, in a reasonable time, the school may be brought up to a capacity attendance of 80 from the reserve itself.\n\nI was surprised to find that Mr. Commissioner Graham had sent an Inspector to arrange for the pulling down and reconstruction of all the outbuildings, other than the new barn, and that this was under way. The temperature had already fallen, during a recent cold\nspell about twenty below zero. Since my return the public press has reported still colder weather in Alberta. My point is that it is very difficult to understand why the work in question should have been postponed, apparently by the Commissioner, during the whole of the summer and autumn months, when it might have been carried out with speed and satisfaction, and delayed until the winter months thus subjecting the administration of the school to the great annoyance and difficulty of having its outbuildings dismantled at a time when the weather was ranging many degrees below zero.\n\nI hope to come to Ottawa in the near future, probably some day next week, for further talk with you if convenient.\n\nPlease accept this expression of my every good wish for the New Year and\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nOttawa, January 7, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing, for your information and guidance, a copy of the Deputy Superintendent General's letter of today's date to Dr. Westgate, relative to the management and particularly the farming instruction at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School.\n\nEnc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The management of this school and the instruction offered to the pupils have been subjects for careful consideration by the officers of the Department. Severe criticism of the farming activity and the farming instruction have been made and I have to request that you will strengthen up the outside staff of the school. A competent farmer, who is capable of instructing the older boys should be placed in charge of the outside work at Old Sun's before the spring activity. The Department will withhold further criticism of the general management of the institution until the results of the change you will make have been noted and reported.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nI beg to draw your attention to the fact that on the 17th of April last, just one year ago, you informed me that you were drawing Dr. Westgate's attention to the advisability of securing a proper Farming Instructor for the Old Sun's Indian Residential School without delay. I replied to your letter under date of April 24th, stating that I had great doubts whether the Principal at the Old Sun's School had the qualities necessary to conduct an institution of that kind, as he had no knowledge whatever of stock or farming.\n\nOn the 28th of April I received a letter from you, dated the 23rd idem, which was in reply to a portion of a general letter which I had written to you on the 3rd of that month, and which dealt with the unsatisfactory management in the case of the Old Sun's School. In this letter you informed me that the Department was corresponding with Dr. Westgate concerning the Principal, and referred me to your letter of the 17th in which you stated that action was being taken to secure a Farming Instructor. As no action had been taken I wrote you again on the 9th of September, saying that up to that time, five months later, I had heard nothing regarding the matter. This letter received no acknowledgement.\n\nSurely this is an important matter, and deserves the immediate attention of the Department. We are spending a large sum of money at this institution. We have some 40 boys there who are supposed to be acquiring a knowledge of practical farming. We are only wasting the boys' time, to say nothing of the girls. They are being taught nothing in this line.\n\nI would ask that the Department deal seriously with this matter. A whole year has passed and no action has been taken.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, April 14, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 401-11 of the 6th instant, with reference to the staff at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School.

I wish to refer you to my letter of this file number of January 7th, last, in this connection. At that time I enclosed a copy of official communication to Dr. Westgate. Mr. Indian Agent Gooderham also received a copy and will, no doubt, report as soon as a new farm instructor is at work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

GOODERHAM\nFOR THE MONTH OF MARCH, 1925, ON THE OLD SUN\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 104-1-7.\n\nThis school is inadequately staffed - Mrs. Gibney has three small children and is a matron at the school. On the day of inspection she was acting kitchen matron. Mr. Gibney has been advised that I do not consider that he and his family should live in the school nor Mrs. Gibney be on the Staff, unless she has a competent nurse or maid to look after the children.\n\nThe pupils lack energy and the doctor finds it difficult to locate the cause. Closer supervision, good diet, fresh air and regular exercise are necessary, and I am not satisfied that they are getting this. Weather conditions are bad, it must be admitted, and some allowance must be made, but intelligent and thorough supervision is necessary. By comparison, this school is not showing up as well in this regard as Crowfoot School.\nOttawa, April 17, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nA question arising out of your March report on the Old Sun's Indian Residential School is being referred to the Field Secretary of the M.

I am informed that the wife of the Rev. Principal cannot satisfactorily undertake the full duties of matron of the school, because of her three small children. Do you not consider it advisable to add a lady worker to the staff?\n\nI am informed also that the pupils lack energy and that the medical officer finds it difficult to locate the cause.

The name of the farm instructor who has been appointed subject to the usual period of probation is David James MacGlashan, who was at the time of his engagement by us on the C.P.R. demonstration farm at Strathmore Alberta. In a letter received from the Principal on the 9th inst., he is described, in part, as follows:-\n\n\"About 42 years of age, about 6 feet in height, and of military bearing. During the War he held the rank of Captain and was for some time Overseer of Internment Camps in Oxford and Berkshire, England. His record which I glanced through is very good. He directed some thousands of prisoners in these camps in breaking up and cultivating the land. Before the War he was engaged in farm work in Scotland, and since coming to Canada some three years ago, he has been engaged in farming until he entered the service of the C.P.R. on their Strathmore Farm. He is thoroughly conversant...\"\nwith mixed farming operations, filling of silos etc. He is also very much interested in the raising of stock and poultry. His manner is firm, but kind, with a slight Scotch lowland accent. He speaks as a man of considerable education. Taking everything into consideration I have no hesitation in asking him to come to us as farm instructor and Vice-Principal. He will also be able to direct the boys in their sports. He is a married man without children and his wife is still in England. She is prepared to come out to him as soon as he has secured permanent employment. She is an English woman of good education, a good musician, and also has a good knowledge of poultry raising. Mr. MacGlashan is anxious to have his wife with him and as she is only 34 years of age, of good health and physique, I would recommend that the Commission's general rule not to engage married couples be not enforced in this case, and that Mr. MacGlashan be allowed to arrange for his wife to come out during the latter part of the summer or early in the fall.\n\nAs the concern of our Department appeared to be centered so far as I can understand it on the farming activities of the school you will see that our Society has made a faithful effort to have these placed on an unquestionably satisfactory basis, and I trust the engagement of the farm instructor as mentioned above who will direct and assist the farmer in the farm operations may prove satisfactory to your Department.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL.B.R.

However, as you have taken the trouble to write me in this connection I can only conclude that the author of the report is one of your responsible representatives and that his opinion is worthy of attention.\n\nBefore going any further I should like to assure you that our Society will give to this matter, as it endeavours to do to all similar communications received from your Department the careful attention which it deserves, and in due course I shall have placed in your hands a report of action which has been taken. In the meantime I think I can confidently assure you that the health of the children and the work in general at this institution are not suffering to any extent through a shortage of food or through an inadequate staff. With regard to the food supply I have vouchers in this office which show\nthat under this heading bills have been met exceeding $800.00\nand other orders placed with bills outstanding at the end of\nthe quarter which brought the total amount spent to well over\n$1000.00.\n\nWith regard to the staff I may state for your infor-\nmation that this school has at the present time three male\nagents under permanent appointment and one probationer who will\nproceed to Hay River when navigation opens.\n\nIt has also six ladies including, of course, the wife\nof the Principal who is acting as Matron-in-charge. This\nappointment was, of course, only given to her from the middle\nof this month when the Matron-in-charge proceeded on furlough to\nEngland. The Principal's wife is a thoroughly conscientious and\na thoroughly capable woman and although she may have to devote\nsometime to the care of her own children she is able with the\nassistance of the other five ladies to devote all the time that\nis necessary to the duties of her office as Matron-in-charge.\n\nFor your further information I may state that the positions held\nrespectively by the other members of the staff are as follows:\nSenior teacher, Junior teacher, Boys' Supervisor, Girls' Super-\nvisor, Kitchen Matron, and it seems to me that a staff of nine\npermanent agents and one under temporary appointment ought surely\nto be sufficient to manage a school which has under seventy\npupils. Our Society however, will consider the question of\nadding another lady member to the staff in accordance with your\nsuggestion, but at present I am quite unable to see how this can\nbe done until a separate residence has been built for the\nPrincipal. This it seems to me is one of the most urgent re-\nquirements at the present time. After my last visit to this\nschool I embodied a recommendation to this effect in my report\nof our Indian and Eskimo Commission and this recommendation was\nunanimously approved. I have also reason to believe that your\nCommissioner will support this recommendation as he spoke to\nthe Principal at the time of his last visit of the necessity of\nthe same. In making this recommendation I would like to sugge-\nst that the most convenient and economical way for this residence\nto be provided would be through the erection of an annex to\nthe east end of the main school building. This arrangement\nwould not only keep the Principal in close touch with the in-\nstitution both day and night, but it would admit of the one\nheating, lighting and water systems being extended to serve the\nannex as well as the main building at a minimum of cost.\n\nIf provision were made for the Principal in this way\nhis wife and children would be removed from the main building\nwhere they are now obliged to live in circumstances which cannot\nbe beneficial to their own health and which might be consider-\nably aggravated if Mrs. Gibney were not allowed to discharge\nany duties and to have no official position whatever. Ladies of\nhigh moral character and with the musical and other qualifica-\ntions which she possesses do not abound in great numbers in these\ndays, and so long as she is obliged to live in the main school\nbuilding I am of the opinion that it would be a great mistake\nnot to allow her to continue to discharge the duties of the\noffice which she at present holds.\nThere is, as you will know, another very serious obstacle in the way of our Society appointing an additional lady agent, and that is a financial one. The total earnings of this School through the per capita grant for 1924 amounted to $3,255.80. As the total operating expenses according to our auditor's report amounted to $13,500.67 you will see that our Society had to find the sum of $5,244.87 to keep the institution going. As our Society is not in a position to pay out so large a sum from year to year not only for this but for other institutions you will see how difficult it is for us to increase our operating expenses until some provision has been made for increasing the School's revenue. At the present time the per capita grant is fixed at $140.00. If this were increased, as I think it should be, to at least $170.00 the question of adding an additional member to the staff would be easier of solution.\n\nI have written at considerable length in the hope that the explanations which I have given may reveal to you some of the difficulties which confront our Society in the administration of this School, and I trust that your Department may not, under the difficult circumstances which now confront us, press too heavily for standards which our resources will not admit of attainment.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\n\nTERW/JF\nOttawa, April 30, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to the staff at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School and dealing particularly with the position of patron. I note your opinion that the efficiency of the management is not impaired by the temporary arrangements which include the engagement of the wife of the principal. I note also that you will favourably consider adding another lady member to the staff, but that you believe a residence will have to be built for the principal. There are some funds available for building purposes at this school this fiscal year, and I will therefore urge Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham, of Regina, with reference to the advisability of providing a principal's residence without delay. I am pleased to have your suggestion that the residence, when erected, should be attached to the east end of the main building.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter, I wish to assure you that the Department understands the difficulties which confront Your Society in the administration of the Old Sun's Indian Residential School. Rest assured that we will not press for standards of instruction and care which will not admit of attainment because of any inadequacy of physical equipment. It is our aim to provide the necessary buildings, etc., at all Indian residential schools, so that the work among the youth of Canada will make progress. As funds are available, this intention will be carried out, and all we expect of your Society and the management of the individual schools is to do the best possible under the circumstances. You will understand, however, that the efficiency of personal services is not largely dependent on physical equipment at these institutions; and from time to time I will draw to your attention, when necessary, reports concerning the qualifications of members of the staff at this and other schools that are managed by your Society.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. H. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. G.,\n41-42 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nBlackfoot Agency,\nGleichen Alta., April 3rd, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following report for the month of March 1925:\n\nOLD SCHOOLS: was visited on the 30th. Classroom work is good and pupils show good progress. It cannot be said however that this Institution is orderly or spotlessly clean. The children lack pep and the staff does not appear to be able to cope with the situation to me, it is considered unfair to the Institution and to his family, that the Principal's wife is on the staff. Mrs. Gibney has three small children, the oldest not over three years of age and no person can persuade me that the Indian School, where these children mingle with the pupils, is the place for them. I cannot see how Mrs. Gibney can undertake her official duties unless she neglects her family or details her family duties to another. This school is inefficiently staffed and under present conditions, I cannot see that much remedy will be made.\n\nThere is a house formerly occupied by Canon Stocken, not far from the school, where, I think the Principal and his family should live.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nI am enclosing herewith Agent Gooderham's report on the Blackfoot Agency for the month of March.\n\nI would particularly draw your attention to what the Agent says regarding the condition in which he found the Old Sund's school. With regard to that portion which deals with the Principal's residence being in a school, I agree entirely. I remember this when the school was being built, and also a year ago when I was in Ottawa, when we were discussing the building of the St. Paul's school on the Blood Reserve. If the Department are building any more Protestant schools my strong recommendation is that the Principal live in a detached house.\n\nHowever, the above matter is not the most serious question. What are we going to do about these children who are unfed and are not getting a proper training? Now, it is very important that we get something done here, as we cannot go on in this way. I have been protesting against the management of this school for three years now, and it seems most unfair to the Indians to spend money and get the results we are getting.\n\nI would also refer you to Nurse Lorne's report on this school, in which she says the children are not getting enough proper food, that the lavatories are in poor working order, and unsanitary, and that many of the children are medically neglected. I am further informed that a report of the children with swollen glands, who do not have a resident doctor, should be had. However, I am writing to the Agent on this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nthe financial obligation of administering the enlarged Old Sun's School and\nwith no means of enrolling a pupilage which would enable the Society to\nearn annual payment under the per capita grant system proportionate to the\ntotal cost of administration.\n\nV. The result of this state of affairs is that, for the years 1923 and 1924,\nthe total cost of the operation of the Old Sun's School has placed an excep-\ntional burden upon the finances of this Society. For the year 1923 the total\ncost of operation was $14,365.19 and the total receipts under the per capita\ngrant system $7,128.00, leaving a cash balance provided by this Society of\n$7,237.19. Similar figures for the year 1924 were, total operating cost\n$15,500.67, total receipts under per capita grants $8,255.80, cash balance\nprovided by this Society $5,244.87. That is for the two years 1923-24 the Old\nSun's School cost this Society in cash the sum of $12,497.06. This sum $12,\n497.06, further, does not include the cost of the clothing of all the girl\npupils and that of the boy pupils under twelve years of age, for both years,\nfor which a very considerable sum should be added. On the other hand it does\nnot, I think, allow for the receipt of a certain number of cash sales of farm\nproduce, not more than a few hundred dollars in all. The total of such sales\nwould, in any case, be not more than one third of the cost of the clothing\nnoted. The sum given $12,497.06 is well below the actual net cost of this\nschool to this Society for the years 1923-24.\n\nVI. The matter of this excessive cost, and the circumstances causing it, of\nthe operation of the Old Sun's School has been the subject of conversation on\nthe following occasions:-\n\n(1) An interview towards the end of the year 1924, the res-\nulting agreement, as I understood it, was, in accordance\nwith our custom, placed by me in writing before you in\nmy letter dated Dec. 30th, 1924. The first paragraph of\nthis letter reads as follows:-\n\n\"With reference to the matter of the deficit in connection\nwith the operation, for the year 1923, of the Old Sun\nIndian residential School, sis-kfoon Reserve, and the ag-\nreement arrived at during our recent conversation that,\nin view of the special circumstances and agreement which\nled to the enlargement of this school, the deficit in\nquestion be shared between the Department and the Mis-\nsionary Society, I beg to say that the total cost of oper-\nation for the year 1923 was the sum of $14,365.19, while\nthe total receipts from per capita grants amounted to\n$7,128.00, leaving a net difference of $7,237.19 which\nsum, I understand, is to be shared equally between the\nMissionary Society and the Department. Allowing for this\npayment by the Department, I find that our total deficit\nin connection with the operations of the Indian resid-\nential Schools under the Society will, at the close of\nthis year at December, 1924, be a total amount in excess\nof $40,000.00\"\n\n(2) A talk with Mr. Ferrier, immediately following my inter-\nview with you, on Jan. 16th, 1925. On this occasion Mr.\nFerrier stated that there were certain difficulties con-\nnected with carrying out the proposal noted above under\nVI.(1), and suggested as an alternative that \"an incr-\nease should be made in the scale of the per capita grants\nto continue until the position in question is rectified\".\nI do not find that I followed my usual custom of setting out this proposal in writing and mailing it to you on my return to Toronto. The quotation is given from notes made by me within two hours time of my talk with Mr. Ferrier.\n\nVII. Apart from, and in addition to, all the foregoing considerations the per capita rate of $140 paid for the Old Sun School, as compared with $170.00 for the Elkhorn and Edmonton schools, seems to make it clear that a situation exists at the Old Sun's School which calls for immediate financial adjustment.\n\nFor all the foregoing considerations I beg to re-submit the subject under discussion to you for reconsideration, and, as I trust, early and favourable decision. Such action is, I respectfully submit, clearly needed from the general standpoint of the existing financial situation as stated above, and, in my judgement, a clear matter of equity arising out of the special circumstances surrounding the enlargement of the Old Sun's School.\n\nBelieve me, yours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nOttawa, May 16, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the deficit at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School.

Again, I regret that I find it necessary to ask you personally to measure these rooms. The information on our files suggests that the ceiling is higher than 8 ft. in the dormitories. Upon the occasion of your next visit to the school, please give this matter your attention and let me have the exact size - three dimensions - of the four rooms in question.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Gooderham\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs, OTTAWA, Ont.\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of May 6th, relative to the deficit incurred at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School, and particularly to Fact No. 4, which refers to the cost of administering the enlarged institution, with no means of enrolling a pupilage which would enable the M.S.C.C. to earn a per capita grant proportionate to the said cost. I wish to point out that, for the two fiscal years ended March 31st, last, the average enrolment at Old Sun's has been 60.37 and the average attendance, 57.63. I am informed by the Indian Agent, who secured the figures from the Rev. Principal, that the dormitories have a total air space of 22,280 cubic feet. This accommodation allows for a maximum pupilage of 84; and, as the average earnings for the past two years have been on the basis of more than 57 pupils, I cannot see how the enlarging of the school to its present size has inflicted any hardship upon those responsible for the management. The experience of the past two years has shown that the Old Sun's School is not too large for its community - the Indian children of Church of England faith on the Blackfoot Reserve.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, M.D., D.C.L.,\nGeneral Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n604 Jarvis St.,\nToronto, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nREGINA, SASK., October 29th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nUnder Department Letter #104-1-1 of the 22nd of April last, you informed me of the appointment of Mr. D. J. MacGlachan to the position of Farming Instructor at the Old Sun's School, and you added that he had been engaged at the C.F.A. Stratimore Farm and had also other experience that should fit him for his duties.\n\nI have been in communication with Mr. H. H. Gooderham with reference to a successor to Mr. F.J. Clarke and it would appear that Mr. MacGlachan has applied for the position. Mr. Gooderham states, however, \"I doubt whether he has had much all-round farming experience.\"\n\nWill you please let me know what credentials were presented by Mr. MacGlachan which led to his appointment at the Old Sun's School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 3, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 401-4 of the 29th ultimo, relative to the credentials of D. J. MacGlashen, farming instructor at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School. At the time this man was appointed at Old Sun's by the Church authorities, Rev. Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary of the M. S. C. C., in a communication to the Department furnished the following information as to Mr. MacGlashen's qualifications:\n\n\"About 42 years of age, about 6 feet in height and of military bearing. During the War he held the rank of Captain and was for some time Overseer Officer of Internment Camps in Oxford and Berks, England. His records, which I glanced through, are very good. He directed over thousands of prisoners in these camps in breaking up and cultivating the land. Before the War, he was engaged in farm work in Scotland, and since coming to Canada some three years ago, he has been engaged in farming until he entered the service of the C. P. R. on their Strathmore Farm. He is thoroughly competent with mixed farming operations, filling of silos, etc. He is also very much interested in the raising of stock and poultry. His manner is firm, but kind, with a slight Scotch Lowland accent. He speaks as a man of considerable education. Taking everything into consideration, I have no hesitation in asking him to come to us as farm instructor and vice-principal. He will also be able to direct the boys in their sports. He is a married man without children and his wife is still in England. She is prepared to come out to him as soon as he has secured permanent employment. She is an English woman of good education, a good musician, and also has a good knowledge of poultry raising. Mr. MacGlashen is anxious to bring his wife with him and as she is only 24 years of age, of good health and aqua I should recommend that the Commission's general rule not to engage married couples be not enforced in this case, and that Mr. MacGlashen be allowed to arrange for his wife to come out during the latter part of the summer or early in the fall.\"\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, February 11, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to quote from Mr. Indian Agent Gooderham's January report on the Old Sun's Indian Residential School:\n\n\"The temperature of the classrooms was far below standard, and, on enquiry, I found that this had been the case throughout the month. As the weather had been mild, I saw no excuse for this, but the Principal could suggest no remedy. On further investigation with the aid of a capable man, I found that the major part of the trouble was due to poor firing and operation of the heating plant. The omissions and corrections are being carried out and these rooms are being better heated and will be properly heated henceforth.\"\n\nYou will note that the classrooms are now being properly heated. My reason for writing was to let you know that there has been unsatisfactory supervision of the mechanical plant and to ask if you are satisfied with the services of the present engineer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Mr. Brown, our Society's agent who has been in charge of this department has never failed to give satisfaction, and I am surprised at the information which Mr. Indian Agent Gooderham's report contains. I may state for your information that a representative of our Society is now on his way to visit this school and he has been instructed to go fully into this matter with the Principal. I may also state for your information that Mr. Brown who has been in charge of the heating and lighting systems at this school will retire at the end of this month and that every effort will be made on our part to secure a man to take his place who will be fully capable of operating the mechanical plant connected with these two systems.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following report for the month of April 1926.\n\nSchools\n\nOld Sun's was visited and found in the usual condition. A new teacher, Miss Milljour, was in charge of the Junior room. She is young with little or no teaching experience and it is to be seen whether or not she can handle the job. Dr. Westgate was a visitor during the month; his interests were confined, as far as I am aware, to admissions of pupils to the school. He did not discuss other matters with the Agent.\n\nG. H.

In his reply dated Nov. 4th, he writes, in part, as follows:\n\n\"Mr. Hewett who came to assist during my absence states in a letter which he left behind for my information that 'the children have been very good, though it was some time before they all returned to School after the affair at Cluny'.\n\nThe affair mentioned was the unveiling of the monument to Crowfoot, to which it was ordered that the School children gather. The parents conveyed their several children to this spot about 12 or 14 miles distant, and some of them did not bring their children back at once...........a day or so this confused the routine of the School and during this period Dr. Stone visited the School and noticed this confusion, also a certain want of cooperation amongst certain members of the staff.\"\n\nIn this letter the Principal also states that the Indian Agent was aware of the fact of his going away, and suggested that he should take some extra time away, and not merely go and return immediately. I am furnishing you with the above information in order that you may be assured of the fact that the report of the\nIndian Agent has received our careful consideration. It will also indicate to you that the apparent lack of order was partly due to the breaking up of the usual school routine in connection with the unveiling of the monument referred to. I am pleased to be able to report that any lack of cooperation which may have existed at the time referred to by the Indian Agent has been completely remedied, and I have every reason to believe that the discipline and conditions in general at this School are such as would command the approval of your Department.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.

In the class rooms the teachers have given diligent service but I fear they have not had the best cooperation from the Principal and the rest of the staff. The M. S. C. C. will only get good results at this Institution when there is a good staff headed by a strong Principal. Mr. Gibney, in my opinion, is not a good principal.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRegina, Sask., June 16th, 1928.\n\nI would draw your attention to what the Agent says regarding Mr. Gibney, Principal of the Old Sun School. You have had many adverse reports concerning this Principal, and it seems to me that it is wrong to carry him on in a position that he is not qualified to fill. He is not an agriculturist, and taking into consideration the fact that one of the main objects of our Residential School system is to teach the Indian boys something about farming and stock-raising, it is most important that the Principals of these schools should be instructors well fitted with a thorough knowledge of each branch of the work. Mr. Gibney has been at this school for several years now and we have had constant complaint regarding his methods, and I should be glad if the Department would give serious consideration to the matter of making a change here. A man who does not understand the work cannot expect to carry on successfully, even though those under him are practical people.\n\nW. M.

Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram of yesterday relative to the destruction of the Old Sun School by fire on Tuesday evening last, and note that you expect to hear further from me in this matter. I had expected to receive a report from the Principal by this morning's mail, but this has not come to hand. I may state for your information, however, that immediately after hearing of the destruction of the School, I telegraphed to Archdeacon Tams to proceed to Gleichen and furnish me with a full report as to the cause, so far as this could be ascertained. When this report has been received, I will write to you again and furnish you with all the information which he and the Principal are able to give me. In my telegram of the 27th instant I informed you that the Principal, the Farmer, the General Assistant, and one lady agent were being retained, and the other agents either transferred or dismissed. I felt that certain agents were required to look after the remaining School property, including buildings, live stock, and the farming and gardening activities, and trust that this arrangement may meet with your approval. At a later date, after the report referred to above has been received, and our Commission have had an opportunity of considering the same, I hope to be able to submit certain suggestions and recommendations to you with regard to the transfer of the pupils after the summer holidays to other institutions, where they could remain until a new School has been provided.\n\nI may say that I have already written to the Principals of the Elkhorn, Onion Lake, St. Cyprian, St. Paul's and Mackay Schools asking them to consult the local Indian Agents with regard to the question of receiving some of the pupils from the Old Sun School,\nand let me know the numbers which could be accommodated in this way. The information contained in their replies will be embodied in the full report which I will make when all the information referred to above has come to hand. As this is the first School which has been destroyed by fire since these institutions came under the control of our Society, the members of our Commission who are responsible for their administration are feeling the loss very keenly. The merciful deliverance, however, of all the pupils and staff agents is something which they cannot soon forget and they heartily thank God for it.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\nJuly 10th, 1928.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate,\n\nI have your note of June 29th. With reference to the future of the pupils it occurs to me to say that it is most important that the Blackfoot parents should consent to the transfer of their children and I doubt very much whether they would consent to sending them to other schools. In any event I would like to give my approval to any arrangement. I am leaving for Regina tonight and will have an opportunity of discussing the matter with Commissioner Graham from our point of view.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. R. B. R.

Archdeacon Tipp, who was asked by our Commission to proceed to the Old Sun School and report on the cause of the fire which destroyed this institution, and also from the Rev. P. H. R. Gibney, the Principal of the same, full statements in this connexion.\n\nThe Archdeacon arrived at the school on June 26th, and his statement reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"There is absolutely nothing left of the building except the concrete foundation and a lot of bent and twisted iron-work in the basement, the remains of bedsteads, pipes and radiators. The fire was first noticed about 8:30 p.m. smoke was seen to be coming from the ventilator of the old roof cellar, used partly as a dairy, at the extreme south end of the building. Mrs. Douglas, the Kitchen Matron, went at once to the door leading to the Dairy, beyond which a lot of raffia and sacking (bale covering) had been stored away, and found the smoke issuing from within overheating. An alarm was at once phoned to Gleichen, and in a short time the fire brigade and nearly 100 civilians as well as the Indian Agent and his staff were on the spot. Meanwhile the children, 50 of whom were in bed, were all got out in an orderly manner and Mr. Gibney had turned the house down the ventilator on the roof of the old root cellar. The fire brigade on arrival broke through the roof and used their chemical engine on the fire which burst into flame as soon as the roof was opened up.\"\nThe water pressure soon gave out from the low pressure tank, and when the chemical engine required re-charging there was no water except from the well at the barn.\n\nAs soon as it was seen that the fire was going to take the building, the civilians who had brought scores of buckets with them set to work to save the Principal's residence on the one side and the Church on the other, by carrying water from the barn. This supply however was cut off when the fire affected the power line which ran the pump motor.\n\nAn attempt was made to use dynamite to blow up the portion of the building between the main building and the annex with a view to getting more time to salvage the effects but this failed of its purpose.\n\nThe whole of the effects in the Principal's residence were carried out of doors, but fortunately the building was not touched, thanks to the men who protected the walls and roof with blankets and water.\n\nThere is only one opinion as to the cause of the fire and that is spontaneous combustion from the pile of raffia and old sacking in which the babies had come, stacked away in the old dairy or root cellar. The exceptional rains we have experienced lately had carried the damp through the roof and probably assisted in creating a condition which issued in the combustion.\n\nThe raffia, etc., had been placed here, when the old class room was pulled down, as the only place where it could be stored.\n\nToo great praise and gratitude cannot be given to the Indian Agent and staff, or to the civilians from Gleichen who all rendered what assistance they could.\n\nThe pupils were all dispersed to their homes as soon as the parents could be notified, with the exception of a few of the older boys who are retained to assist in the farm work.\n\nThe children all had just what they could carry out with them. The fire drill regularly held seems to have proved its value for on the alarm every child jumped from bed, wrapped itself in a quilt, picked up its clothes and marched down the fire escape.\n\nIn a few cases where the parents are destitute and have no bed or other clothing for their children suddenly returned to them, it is really necessary that some assistance should be given them in the way of more quilts and clothing for the children.\n\nThe Indian Agent kindly placed an empty house at the disposal of the Farm Instructor and his wife, and the Hospital authorities offered shelter to all the other members of the staff.\"\nMr. Gibney's statement reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Why this time you will have in hand Archdeacon Tim's report re our recent regrettable fire.\n\nThe Archdeacon's report is so comprehensive and as he went over all details carefully with me and then the report was read over in the rough to me, I find that the ground has been so thoroughly covered that I can only corroborate what he has said. We had only been in a half hour or so from a rehearsal of closing day exercises at the front of the school building when the smoke was noticed. No time was lost in sending in the alarm, which was answered promptly by the fire-brigade and townspeople. Our heartbreaking difficulty was the lack of water pressure. An early attempt was made to blow up by a charge of dynamite the hind end of the building but without effect. This of necessity drove all out of the building and consequently any thought of saving our splendid supply of clothing was put aside. This was a bad blow to me as many of the children have very little in the way of clothing and a number of the parents are not able to make adequate provision. This fact is constantly coming up before me. I feel sure that the Indian Dept. will assist us as far as possible to meet needy cases, and Mr. Agent Gooderham has requested me to note such cases carefully.\n\nAll children have gone home. We are, of course, having relays of the bigger boys to assist in farm work. Those will be looked after at the Mission House. We may have also to make certain provisions for some of the older girls. All the cooking, etc., for these will be looked after by Mrs. Gibney assisted by Miss Hobson who is very pleased to remain on with us. Certain emergencies will arise, of course, from time to time, which I shall have to refer to you for advice.\n\nMr. Gooderham has been exceedingly kind and considerate in every way, and in fact the agency staff as a whole and very many of the townspeople could not have been more kind. I am thanking one and all publicly through our local paper.\"\n\nThe above statements were presented to our Commission at a meeting held yesterday, and I was instructed to forward the same to our General Secretary in Toronto, with a strong recommendation that he should endeavour to arrange an interview with you at the earliest date possible, and take up such urgent and important\nquestions as the provision of clothing for the pupils, their transfer, or otherwise, to other schools after the summer holidays, the building of a new school, the means of maintaining a small staff to look after the livestock, crops, remaining buildings, etc.\n\nMy letter to our General Secretary is going forward today, and as he will no doubt communicate with you in the very near future, I do not see that there is anything further which I can do at present.\n\nOur Commission will be glad, however, to have any suggestions you may wish to offer, and to co-operate to the fullest extent of their power with your Department in overcoming the difficulties which have arisen so unexpectedly through the loss of this valuable institution.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.O.O.\nRA220 14\n\nKI TORONTO ONT 10 1014A\n\nD C SCOTT\n\nDEPT INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA ONT\n\nPROPOSE TO SEE YOU FRIDAY MORNING THIS WEEK RE BLACKFOOT FIRE NOTIFY IF CONVENIENT\n\nCANON GOULD\nOttawa, July 10th, 1928.\n\nRev.

Scott.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe matter of placing the pupils of this Institution in school must be considered now. A suggestion has come from the M.S.C.C. that Anglican schools at Cardston, Brocket and Elkhorn are in a position to accept a large proportion of the pupils for such time as there is no school on this Reserve. This would be an excellent move, I believe, provided the parents give their full consent.\n\nI have asked some of them and find that the younger people have no objections and rather favour the idea, whereas the older people are opposed. If the Department favoured the plan, I would be in a position to interview the parents at Treaty which is being paid on August 7 & 8th.\n\nAs an alternative, I suggest that the M.S.C.C. operate two Day-Schools here. At Gleichen, the Church would be used and Mr. Gibney says that he could teach the pupils who would attend this school. At the west end of the Reserve, known as Farm 3 area, the Church has a building which could readily be made into a school. In talking this over with Mr. Gibney, he states that Miss Hauver, Senior teacher would be glad to teach them and would live with Mrs. Geo Crane Bear (Mina Stonechild). The building is centrally located and would accommodate 30 to 40 pupils. The cost of equipping it and making it fit for use would not be great.\n\nIt would be appreciated if the Department would give me instructions in regard to this matter at an early date.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nSt. Cyprian: grade 6 - enrollment 31\nElectoral: 120 - \" 128\nDonoghue: the school could accommodate more than 15 pupils\nSchool (St. Patrick): 140 - \" 122\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, August 9, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your B-12 of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the pupils of the Old Sun's Indian Residential School.

Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI have to submit the following report for the month of July 1928.\n\nRegarding the pupils at Old Sun's it is hoped that the Department can employ some way to get them into school for the coming school year. If the children are not sent to schools on other reserves I would suggest that two day schools be operated here. The Church at the school site could be used for pupils in the Gleichen area and a mission building at the west end of the reserve could be used for pupils in that area. I believe this latter place would receive good attendance. The building is central and the parents for the most part are ex-pupils of Old Sun's.\n\nO. H. Goodrum,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRegina, Sask., Aug. 10th, 1928.\n\nYou will note what the Agent says regarding the children who are out of school, as a result of the loss of the Old Sun's buildings.

Mr. Gibney and I have individually made enquiries and only two parents stated that they were willing to send their children away. I stressed the many advantages to the children, but to no avail.\n\nThe Chiefs interviewed me on the 13th inst. and asked that the Department supply temporary quarters on the reserve; they stated that the Band was prepared to pay from their funds at Ottawa any expenses necessary to working these temporary quarters.\n\nFurthermore that if day schools were established as I suggested in my letter of 27th ultimo that they were prepared to pay for the transportation of pupils to and from school each day from the Band Funds. They are familiar with this method as there is a consolidated school at Arrowwood.\n\nI believe this is the solution for the existing school year and would recommend that steps be taken, in conjunction with the M.S.C.C., to carry it into effect.\n\nAwaiting your further instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst: Deputy & Secretary,\nDept: of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa, September 1, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of July 4th and other correspondence, relative to the pupils at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School. Mr. Indian Agent Gooderham reports that Rev. Mr. Gibney and he have individually made enquiries, and only two parents stated they were willing to send their children to either the St. Cyprian or St. Paul's Indian Residential School. Our agent writes that he stressed the many advantages to the children, but, to no avail. The chiefs of the band have repeatedly urged the Department to conduct two temporary day schools on the reserve, and the Deputy Superintendent General has approved of the proposal. I am enclosing, for your information and guidance, a copy of my letter of today's date to Mr. Agent Gooderham.\n\nYou will note that Rev. Mr. Gibney and Miss Hauver will teach the two temporary day schools. For this service, they will be allowed salary as day school teachers. I should like to have a statement from you as to the cost of operating the residential school farm, caring for the stock, etc. I have to urge that no unnecessary expense be undertaken and that the interim costs until a new residential school is ready for occupancy be kept as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The Department has given favourable consideration to your proposal in connection with the pupils at the Old Sun's Residential School, and I have to authorize you to arrange for two temporary day schools\u2014one in the church at Gleichen and the other in a church building at the west end of the reserve. Rev. Mr. Gibney and Miss Hauver may be engaged to do the teaching. I note that the cost of preparation and equipping will not be great. If desks and blackboards are required, please make immediate requisition. Would it be possible to get along without regular school desks for the time being?\n\nYou may also ascertain what arrangement you could make for transporting the children to and from school each day. When your report in this connection is to hand, the Department will give it consideration. The funds necessary for these temporary day schools will not be taken from Band Funds, as it is the Department's practice to pay all educational costs from Parliamentary Appropriation.

An Anglican Mission at the West end of the Reserve was put in repair by bearing it up on the outside and removing a partition inside and building in long board desks. Benches and a few chairs will be used to seat the pupils and the capacity will be 35. The school supplied most of the material and a competent carpenter did the work. It was necessary to purchase a stove to heat the building. At Clischen, long board desks were built into the paws of the church, and both schools were ready for October First. For some reason known only to the M.S.J. officials, Mr. Sauwar, the teacher for the west end school, did not arrive and on Saturday afternoon informed that she will arrive in time to open on the 15th October. She will live in a good 4 roomed house near the school and a matron from Old Sun's will live with her. Mr Gibney has laid plans to give the pupils a hot mid-day meal at both schools. In this he is getting our co-operation. Although the arrangements are of a temporary nature, the schools should be quite satisfactory and a good place for the children throughout the present school year. The Indians are interested and I expect their co-operation except in the extreme cold winter days.\n\nBoth schools will open next week.\n\nNumber of Pupils in 1st Standard\n\ndo do in 2nd do\ndo do in 3rd do\ndo do in 4th do\ndo do in 5th do\ndo do in 6th do\n\nAgency: Blackfoot\nDated: October 9, 1928\n\nN.R.\u2014A separate form to be used for each school. \"State whether 'day', 'boarding' or 'industrial'.\"\nOttawa, October 18, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have today had a discussion with the Field Secretary of the M. S. C. C., concerning the financing of the two temporary day schools on the Blackfoot reserve. I explained that the Department would be responsible for the legitimate expenditure at these schools and that all accounts should be submitted to your office and forwarded to Ottawa for payment. Teachers' salaries will be paid upon receipt of day school quarterly returns. Food that is required for the noonday lunch, expenditure in connection with fixing up the classrooms, fuel, any transportation of children necessary, etc., should all be the subject of vouchers directed to Ottawa by your office. Any church expenditure should be limited to missionary activity and to the looking after of the property at the Old Sun site. Concerning this year's expenditure at the old residential school property, the Department will make arrangements with the church authorities. The Department considers that the parents should be responsible for the clothing of the children while they are living at home and whatever transportation they can provide.\n\nI may say that salary will be allowed to the Rev. Mr. Gibney and Miss Hawver at the rates of $80 and $45 per teaching month, respectively. They should make arrangements for their living expenses with the M. S. C. C.\n\nI am enclosing an extra copy of this letter to you, so that you can hand it to Mr. Gibney.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. McLEAN,\nA. D. McLean,\nAsst.

During my visit to your Department last month, further reference was made to this matter in my interview with the Superintendent of Indian Education, and I undertook to submit it to our Indian Residential Schools' Commission for their consideration. The Commission met on the 6th instant, and after carefully canvassing the whole situation, instructed me to inform you that, in their opinion, drastic action of the nature contemplated, should rest on a written statement, embodying specific reasons for the same, and not merely on a verbal request. If, therefore, you will kindly furnish me with the statement suggested, I will submit it to the Commission at their next meeting. In making this request the Commission desired me to inform you of some of the major considerations which influenced them in connection with the same. Two of these were as follows:\n\n1. Their anxiety that no injustice or any appearance of such, should be done to any of the parties concerned, and\n2. The necessity which is laid upon them themselves by the constitution setting forth their duties of submitting to the Society's Executive Committee, all matters relating to the appointment, transfer or dismissal of Principals.\n\nThey would assure you of their hearty desire to conform to the wishes and instructions of your Department at all times, but would like to feel well assured before final and drastic action is taken in a matter of such great moment, as the one in\nquestion, that such action is not only fair and fully justified,\nbut that the Society has some prospect of being able to effect\nimmediately the improvements in the School management which\nyour Department apparently desires.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRN/JF\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring my recent visit to the Blackfoot Reserve, the Teachers of the temporary Day Schools who were members of the staff of the Old Sun School before it was destroyed by fire, desires to know if your Department would be responsible for their salary allowances during the two months holiday period. They directed my attention to your letter of Oct. 16th in which you stated that your Department would be responsible for the Teachers salaries for the 10 months of the teaching year. As the new building to replace the Old Sun School is not likely to be ready for occupation when the 10 months have elapsed, the Teachers and Miss Robson who is living with Miss Hauver who is in charge of the School at the West end of the reserve are naturally anxious to know whether they will receive any salary allowance for their holiday period or not. I am under instruction to ascertain this information from your Department, and will be obliged if you will furnish me with your decision in connection with the same. It seems to me that the 3 agents concerned, namely, Mr. Gibney, Miss Hauver and Miss Robson are deserving of every consideration which can be shown to them, as they are discharging a duty of the highest value and under exceptionally trying circumstances. It would be a comfort and an encouragement to them to know that their salary allowances would be provided for the two months in question, and I trust that this action may be taken by your Department.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.,\n\nTRW/JF\nOttawa, February 12, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to salary for the teachers who are engaged at the temporary day schools on the Blackfoot reserve. The Department cannot pay salary to day school teachers for 12 months of the year, but there is no reason why your Society should not make grant to these workers and include the item in your statement of expenditure, mentioned in the last paragraph of my letter of September first, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

INDIAN AGENT GOODERHAM,\nFOR THE MONTH OF MAY, 1929, ON THE OLD SUN'S INDIAN\nDAY SCHOOL.\n\nThis temporary day school is conducted as well as Mr. Gibney can but I hope it will not be long before a residential school is erected. The pupils come irregularly and when they come from a distance, often do not arrive until late forenoon. Advancement in class-work is slow under ideal conditions but is negligible under temporary arrangements.\n\nA splendid mid-day meal is served but this is possible only as long as the threshing cockear is available.\n\nOLD SUN'S WEST END DAY:\n\nThis temporary day school is not so bad. The building is used only for school work and is centrally located in a farming district. Good progress in school work is not possible as so many children attend irregularly despite our endeavours and inducements. Grades 1 to 4 are taught and most pupils are in the first three. The teacher and the Matron do their best with class work and mid-day meals. I feel, however, that the temporary arrangement should be replaced by the permanent school as early as possible.\nJanuary 17, 1930.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. MacInnes,\n\nThe main building of the Old Sun Indian Residential School was destroyed by fire in June, 1928. The Indian Band, wishing to expedite replacement, petitioned the Department to take from its funds whatever was necessary to proceed with a new building at an early date. For the current fiscal year, Parliament provided $40,000.00 towards the replacement. There will be expended this year at least $120,000.00 for the purpose, and I wish to secure an Order in Council approving of a transfer of $80,000.00 from the funds of the Blackfoot Band (Interest Account) to Indian Education 1929--30 Vote No. 226. The interest to the credit of the Blackfoot Band at the present time is $850,474.79.\n\nThis loan will be repaid from the Appropriation for Indian Education during the next two fiscal years.\nOttawa, January 16, 1930.\n\n104-1-1\n\nHis Excellency\n\nThe Governor General in Council,\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report that the main building of the Old Sun Indian Residential School on the Blackfoot Indian Reserve, in the Province of Alberta, was destroyed by fire in June, 1928.

Gen.)\n\nThe new Old Sun's School is fast nearing completion. This is a wonderful building, and when completed will, in my opinion, be the finest Indian school I was ever in. I do not think for one minute that the present Principal is the man to take charge of an institution of this kind. He has been there for some time now and has never been satisfactory. The farming and gardening activities at the school have never been properly carried on under his management, and to put a man of this type in to take charge of this splendid new school would not be right. I am not alone in this opinion, all our officers who visit the reserve will agree that he is not the man for the position. If the Department agree it might be well to take the matter up with the proper authorities.\nApril 28, 1930.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nFrom time to time, departmental officers have reported none too favourably concerning the Reverend Mr. Gibney, Principal of the Old Sun Indian Residential School. I have not pressed strongly for his removal from our work; but I do believe your Society should now consider a new incumbent. They will be moving into the new building soon. It is one of the finest the Department has erected and I believe that the School could enter on an era of much usefulness if you would place at the head of the Institution a man concerning whom our officers could give favourable reports.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

I am writing to Canon Gould, asking if they can find a more suitable principal. In the meantime, we should all cooperate heartily with the present incumbent.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

F.M. Ross Gibney, Principal of the Old Sun Indian Residential School, has accepted appointment to the missionary work on the Sarcee Reserve, released vacant through the retirement of Archdeacon Tims. Mr Gibney holds a first-class teacher's certificate and it is the proposal, I believe, that on the retirement of Miss Tims he should combine the work of School Teacher with that of missionary. In view of the fact that the total population on the Reserve is very small, about sixty, I believe, this combination should be both workable and satisfactory. I do not know whether Dr. Westgate has consulted you on this matter, if not a further communication will be sent to you in due course.\n\nWe shall be prepared, in due time, to submit for your consideration a nominee for the post of Principal of the new \"Old Sun\" Indian Residential School.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Secretary.\nMay 28, 1930.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to the retirement of the Reverend Mr. Ross Gibney, Principal of the Old Sun Indian Residential School. Concerning his appointment to the position of teacher at the Sarcee Indian Day School, I am enclosing, for your information, a copy of official letter of today's date to Dr. Westgate.\n\nI note that you will nominate a new principal for Old Sun as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

J. H. House will take up residence as Principal of the Red Sun School, I hereto state that I visited the Creesee Indians last week and had an interview with the Rev. Archdeacon King and the Rev. W. L. H. Gibney with regard to various matters pertaining to our Society's work on the Creesee and Blackfoot Reserves. At this interview I learned from Archdeacon King that he would be unable to vacate the Creesee Mission house before the middle of September. Therefore, they will be unable to move until the larger Mission house is ready to accommodate him and his family. I agreed to recommend to your Department that he be allowed to continue to act as principal of the Old Sun School until about the middle of September, when he would hand over his duties to the Rev. Mr. House who has been appointed his successor. Mr. Gibney's residence and services should be a great help in getting the district in place, and the new school ready for opening. Arrangements could also be made for Mr. House, the new principal, to reach the school probably a week before Mr. Gibney leaves.\n\nWhile writing about matters pertaining to this school, I beg to state that Mr. Donaldson has practically completed all arrangements for the engagement of the staff already required, and Mr. Gibney recommended some of these be appointed immediately and asked to take up residence in the school in order to assist in the work of having the school made ready for the reception of pupils. It seems to me that the Engineer, the Head-Latrine, the Kitchen Laborer and a Supervisor should be engaged at once, and I shall be obliged if you will let me know if your Department will pay the salaries of these four agents in addition to that of the Principal until the school is placed on a per capita earning basis. The\nSalary of the Engineer will be at the rate of $50.00 a month,\nand Mr. Palmer who is receiving this appointment has been\nstrongly recommended by Mr. Indian Agent Gooderham. The salary\nof the Head Teacher will be at the rate of $40.00 a month, the\nKitchen Ladder will receive $36.00 a month and the salary of the\nSupervisor will be $36.00 a month.

There is no reason why Mr. Gibney should not remain there until the middle of September but I believe that the Reverend Mr. House, the new incumbent, should be at the school as soon as possible. Two or three weeks with Mr. Gibney would be of much value to him and he would be there while the school was being prepared for the reception of pupils.\n\nThe Department agrees that the Engineer, the Matron, the Kitchen Supervisor and one other officer should be engaged at once and the Department will allow a grant to cover their stipends, in lieu of per capita grant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In my letter of July 31st, I stated that our Commission had practically completed all arrangements for the engagement of the staff agents required. At that time I fully expected that the school would be ready for occupation by the 1st of September, and our Commission took steps to have the full staff ready at that time. The other agents engaged have been wondering when their services will be required, and have written more than once to the Commission pointing out the inconvenience to which they have been subjected through the unexpected long delay. I have advised Miss Bedford, the Junior Teacher, and Miss Turner, the Girls' Supervisor, that arrangements would be made for them to proceed to the school in the immediate future, and that they would be placed on salary from the 1st of October. I trust that this action may meet with your approval, and that stipends of these agents may be paid along with those mentioned in your letter of August 6th last.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nMr. Orr informs me that the air space at the new Old Sun's Indian Residential School is for 106 pupils but it is safe to allow a pupilage of 110.\n\n[Signature]\n\nNovember 25th, 1930.\nExtract from letter from G.

J. W. House,\nPrincipal,\nOld Sun Indian School,\nBlackfoot Reserve,\nGleichen, Alta.\nOLD SUN SCHOOL OPENED, GLEICHEN\n\nProminent Members Clergy Officiate at Colorful Ceremony\n\nForty-four years ago the Indian department gave $500 towards the erection of a Church of England boarding school on the Blackfoot reserve.\n\nTuesday saw the formal opening of its successor, the new Old Sun residential school, to be operated by the Church of England, and built at a cost to the government of about $250,000.\n\nThis splendid school, the last word in modern educational convenience and efficiency, is entirely fireproof, has large airy rooms, delightful sunny playrooms, four well-equipped classrooms comfortably furnished, and two dressing rooms for the staff, and kitchen, supply room, etc., all fitted with the latest electrical devices, make the new building one which is probably not excelled anywhere in Canada.\n\nThe dedication of the school chapel preceded the formal opening and the services of dedication and thanksgiving, followed by a celebration of Holy Communion, conducted by Bishop Sherman, assisted by Rev. Canon Gale, Archdeacon Time, Rev. Canon Gale, Rev. Canon Gooderham, Rev. R. Gilney, Rev. C. F. Ilves and Rev. J. W. House, principal. The bishop intoned the prayer suitable for the rest of the proceedings.\n\nA large number of Indians gathered outside the new school and marched in procession around the building. Among the Archdeacon Time, Indian Agent Gooderham, Mrs. Cross, diocesan president of the Women's Auxiliary, and other clergy, followed by visiting Indians, the girls, then the boys, and a great number of other Indians, men, women and children, all of them adorned with blankets, shawls and blankets, added color to the proceedings. There were also many visitors from Calgary and Gleichen.\n\nKeys presented\n\nAt the front entrance the keys were formally handed over by the Indian agent, representing the government, to Mr. Wood, representing the missionary society.\n\nThere was a short service of singing of the doxology, followed by the singing of \"God Save the King,\" the doors were opened and all filed into the school.\n\nIndian Agent Gooderham, in a speech, indicated his belief that said that the wish of the government regarding the Blackfoot children should have a well-rounded and balanced education, with due regard for their religious and moral development.\n\nArchdeacon Time spoke of his own Blackfoot and English of his early experiences there in days gone by. Canon Gale, speaking in both languages, conveyed greetings from St. Paul's Cathedral.\n\nThe native catechist, Paul Puka, said that he himself wanted to go to school, but was prevented by his parents from doing so because they thought the white man's ways. He warned and give their children instructions, and exhorted the boys and girls to take advantage of the opportunities.\n\nChief of the Blackfoot, Duck-Chief, then bestowed on the school the name of \"Natsol,\" meaning \"The Shining One,\" the school is named, and with whose permission Archdeacon Time and Mrs. Cross visited the Blackfoot reserve. This portrait was the work of N. Grandmason.\n\nFor the Calgary Herald,\n\nFeb. 18/31\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nOld Sun School was officially opened on the 17th inst. Mr. Graham was unable to attend owing to sickness and wired me. In a further wire, it was suggested that I represent the Department in his stead. Your letter of regret and wishes was read by the Chairman.\n\nAttached is a clipping from the Calgary paper; this gives a good resume of the proceedings. Dr. Rossiter on behalf of the M.S.O.S., and the Church of England wished me to convey to you their very great thanks for giving them this very fine building and splendid equipment with which to carry on their work.\n\nKind regards,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nBlackfoot Indians Have Fine School\n\nModern Residential Institution Is Named After Chief Old Sun\n\nBy CAROLYN CORNELL\n\nWithin a short distance of the old chief's deathbed in 1877, in Blackfoot country of Indians, entered into treaty for the sale of Canada's vast western lands miles of their ancestral territory in southeastern Alberta, there stands today a beautiful residential school for the education of descendants of those Indians who subscribed to the treaty.\n\nThe school, situated near Gleichen, Alta., was built by the government of Canada and is administered by the Anglican Church.\n\nIt is called Old Sun School, in honor of Chief Old Sun, leader of the North Blackfoot, one of the signers of the treaty.\n\nA fine portrait of the chief, painted by Mrs. E. C. Crockett, wife of Chief Crockett, was unveiled at the opening ceremonies by Mrs. Crockett, daughter of Chief Old Sun.\n\nHer Majesty's representative, the chief justice of the North-West Territories, Mr. Justice Macleod, and his contingent of the North-West Mounted Police, presented the keys of the new school to Bishop Weigelt, who was representing the missionary who had been engaged by the church to build the school.\n\nThe new Old Sun residential school, recently opened by the Anglican Missionary Society near Gleichen, Alta., gives an idea of the magnificent building being erected by the Dominion of Canada for her Indian wards.\n\nNamed After Chief\n\nThe new school is one of the few Indian residential schools after the name of the tribe being educated in connection with Blackfoot. In recognition of its close association with the British Empire he was presented with a sword by Queen Victoria for Indian Chiefs, signatures of which are on display.\n\nThe Blackfeet are among the most prominent of the North American aborigines, owning more than 600,000 acres of land, according to recent reports.\n\nThe tribe now has a population of about 3,000 and annual rentals amount to more than $10,000.\n\nChief Old Sun\n\nTwo Ceremonies Linked\n\nMartha Crockett, who is a prominent worker in the Woman's Auxiliary of the Anglican Church, has performed a connecting link between the two ceremonies, both so interesting, yet picturesque, both in their own way.\n\nIn 1877 representatives of the Canadian government came to great Blackfoot confederacy camp, in all their glory, and the chief, Mr. George Gough in paint, feathers and powdered buckskins, the Indian on the Blackfoot reserve, who then a young missionary, said no words, but stood watching, hoping that he, the chief, might come in to view.\n\nBishop Dedicates Charge\n\nRight Rev. L. H. Sherman, Bishop of the Diocese of Rupert's Land in Canada, officially took over the charge of the new school for administration.\n\nHe was assisted by a delegation headed by the energy Mayor of Calgary, Mr. J. B. McCauley, agents of the school, with the Indian children from the old school to the front entrance. They were followed by the teachers and many of the Indian parents from the Reserve. Numbering 400 pupils, the school is now providing excellent facilities for the children.\n\nArchbishop Tied\n\nIn an address to the gathering Chief Crockett, who died in 1925, gave the hand of friendship to the old chief gave the archbishop.\n\nNurses Are Graduated\n\nIndian girls take very kindly to nursing, and in this case two girls from the Shingwauk Institute have graduated and are now employed in the New York Hospital. Four are in training in various hospitals, one in Ottawa and one in Nelson, B.C.\n\nOne girl is now employed in one of the schools administered by the mission. She graduated recently from Trinity college.\n\nOthers are being graduated from the Shingwauk agricultural and other regular colleges.\n\nOne girl is employed in the residential schools. One girl, from the residential school in Ontario, is a graduate of an Anglican residential school.\nOttawa, July 16th, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the June quarter return of the Old Sun's Indian Residential School. This school was placed on per capita grant basis from April 1st, 1931. Provision has been made for a pupilage of 100 at a per capita rate of $165.\n\nA cheque in payment of the June quarter grant for this school is being forwarded to the General Treasurer of the M. S. C. C. in Toronto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 29th January, 1930.\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 16th January, 1930, from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, submitting that the main building of the Old Sun Indian Residential School on the Blackfoot Indian Reserve, in the Province of Alberta, was destroyed by fire in June, 1928. The Blackfoot Indian Band, wishing to expedite replacement, petitioned the department to take from its funds whatever was necessary to proceed with a new building at an early date. For the current fiscal year, Parliament provided $40,000 towards the replacement.\n\nAs the amount required, however, is $120,000, the Minister recommends that authority be granted for an expenditure of $60,000 from the interest funds of the said Blackfoot Band, which now amount to $880,474.79, under section 95 of the Indian Act.\n\nThe Minister states that it is proposed that this amount should be refunded to the band within the next two fiscal years in conformity with the department's policy that all cost of Indian education should be defrayed from public funds.\n\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing recommendation and submit the same for approval.\n\n(Sgd.) E. J. Lemaire,\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Supt. General of Indian Affairs.\nWe, the undersigned, members of the Blackfoot Indian tribe, and living on the Blackfoot Reserve, Gleichen, Alberta, beg to approach the Department of Indian Affairs with the request that they take immediate steps to provide a fully equipped and modern building, constructed of brick and as fire-proof as possible, to replace the Old Sun Indian Residential School on this Reserve, which was recently destroyed by fire.\n\nWe, further, beg to suggest that sufficient monies for this purpose be borrowed from our vested funds in order that no delay may take place in meeting the above emergency in an adequate manner.\n\nNOTE:\n\nThe above document was signed by over 200 leading Indians of the Blackfoot Band.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nThe main building of the Old Sun Indian Residential School, on the Blackfoot Indian Reserve, was destroyed by fire in June 1928.\n\nThe Indians, wishing to expedite replacement, petitioned the Department to take from their funds the sum of $50,000.00 which, with $40,000.00 provided by Parliament, enabled the rebuilding to proceed. Approval of the loan was granted by P.C. 207 of January 29th, 1930. It was proposed that the loan should be refunded to the band funds within the next two fiscal years but no payments have been made.\n\nAs the band funds would have received interest each year at 5% I think provision should be made to recoup band funds to the amount of interest which has accrued and in future, or so long as the loan continues, provision should be made each year to pay over the interest on the loan.\n\nTo protect the interests of the Indians for money invested in the building, it was decided, in June 1933, to place fire insurance on the building. A policy for $60,000.00 was placed and the premium of $600.13 was paid from band funds and this must be added to the original loan of $50,000.\nIf interest had been allowed each year, the band funds would have benefitted the next year by the interest on the same, which means really that compound interest must be allowed at five per centum the rate allowed by the Government on Trust Funds.\n\nThe following sets forth what is due band funds in the way of deferred interest:\n\nPayable for fiscal year 1930-31 ...... $4,000.00\n\" \" \" \" 1931-32 ...... 4,200.00\n\" \" \" \" 1932-33 ...... 4,410.00\n\" \" \" \" 1933-34 ...... 4,670.50\n\nWhen additional amount of $800.11 insurance premium must be included.\n\nTotal ....... $17,280.50\n\nG. A. Conley.\nJanuary 17th, 1926.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General -\n\nI send herewith a memorandum prepared by Mr. Conley setting forth the present situation in regard to the funds advanced from the monies of the Blackfoot Indians for the rebuilding of the Old Sun Residential School.\n\nIn my opinion this was an undesirable arrangement from its inception and I believe that it would be good policy to correct it by returning the amount to Band Funds at the earliest possible date.\n\nOwing to the necessity of conserving our funds this may not be feasible at the moment, but I would recommend that an amount be placed in the Supplementary Estimates requisite to put the matter in good standing so far as interest and insurance costs are concerned.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nJanuary 17th, 1925.\n\nEXD.\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General -\n\nI send herewith a memorandum prepared by Mr. Conley setting forth the present situation in regard to the funds advanced from the monies of the Blackfoot Indians for the rebuilding of the Old Sun Residential School.\n\nIn my opinion this was an undesirable arrangement from its inception and I believe that it would be good policy to correct it by returning the amount to band funds at the earliest possible date.\n\nOwing to the necessity of conserving our funds this may not be feasible at the moment, but I would recommend that an amount be placed in the Supplementary Estimates requisite to put the matter in good standing so far as interest and insurance costs are concerned.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to report on an inspection of Old Sun's Indian Residential School at Gleichen.\n\nAt the time of my visit I found there were 99 children on the roll, but only 92 present. It will not be necessary for me to report on the health of the children, as the Department are aware of the results of the T.B. clinic held there last fall, when it was found that many of the children were suspected of having tuberculosis, and a number of others were found to be active cases. Certain instructions were given by the doctor in charge of the clinic, as to the method of treatment, such as rest and special food, &c. I found in talking to the Agent and Doctor Windsor that the instructions were being carried out with good results.\n\nI found the school building in very good condition, clean and tidy and everything in order. The machinery and equipment are all in A1 shape.\n\nAppearance of children - Good.\n\nClothing - Ample; Several changes for both girls and boys.\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOTTAWA.\nThe girls are given the usual training carried on in all Indian Residential Schools \u2014 that is to say, those girls who are not T.B. suspects.\n\nRegarding the training of boys, a shop has been fixed up in one of the rooms of the school and the boys receive a certain amount of manual training in the way of carpentering, &c. The boys also help with the farm work, looking after stock, milking cows, &c. It might also be interesting to the Department to note that arrangements have been made to irrigate some of the land used by the school! In co-operation with the Agency an irrigation ditch was built last fall connecting up with the C.P.R. irrigation ditch, and using the overflow from this ditch. This gives the agency sufficient water to irrigate the flats down by the North cow camp, and also gives the school water to irrigate approximately 200 acres. This will be of great assistance to the school, as for the last four years they have had their crop dried out and have had to buy feed. I was down looking over the irrigation project, and both the school and the agency have certainly done well in bringing this about, as it has meant considerable voluntary labour.\n\nThe school have about 100 acres of crop in that can be irrigated, and they have broken about 50 acres of new land.\n\nThey have 40 head of cattle, most of which are cows, and they were milking 22 at the time of my visit, which gives them all the milk, cream and butter that they require. They have 6 work horses and a few pigs.\nThe Staff consists of 4 male members, including the Principal, and 7 lady members\u2014a total of 11. I consider they have a fairly good staff at this institution and there have been no changes lately in this respect.\n\nI am taking up the matter of repairs, &c., in a separate letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

There are 3 classes with a change of teachers in the senior and primary rooms. The Nursing Sister looks after the T.B.'s only. All bigger boys returned and new pupils are being enrolled. Two girls went to the Lacombe Home for their final year. All was in good order and running smoothly, and the T.B.'s were getting proper attention. At Old Sun's pupils were back and all new pupils of age 7 admitted. A nursing matron has been added to the staff.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nBlackfoot Reserve, Nov. 1936.\n\nI beg to submit the following report for the month of November 1936.\n\nThe Matron of Old Sun School went under a serious operation in a Calgary Hospital and will be off duty for some time. This means extra work for the staff, and I think, too much for general efficiency.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nBlackfoot Reserve.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report for the month of December, 1936.\n\nSchools.\n\nAll went along smoothly at the schools. Christmas concerts and feasts were given and pupils were allowed to go home for three days between the holidays. The pupils at the Crowfoot School are particularly well trained in singing and orchestra work. Their concert was excellent.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nBlackfoot Reserve, January 1937.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit the following report for the month of January 1937.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nAt Old Sun's there are three new staff\u2014 all are experienced and appear to be capable. The water supply is low and care must be taken in the use of water. The Bow River is very low and we have an idea that the well must be deepened to try to get a bigger flow unless the river raises and precipitation increases this year. All pupils are getting good attention. The hockey teams play excellent games with neighbouring teams and amongst themselves. This applies to both schools and the children are quite happy; no overnight leave to their homes is allowed during the winter. So far, serious colds and Flu have been avoided by following this rule.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nThough I visited both Boarding schools during the month no thorough inspection was made. All children seemed well and happy. Crowfoot school was very crowded.\n\nAt Old Sun's I attended evening milking while hunting for a cow for the mine and was particularly impressed with this work. Eight boys were milking and the milk from each cow was weighed and recorded. This was a check on the milker as well as on the cow and the boys took great pride in their job. The pupils of both schools gave a splendid account of themselves at the Treaty Celebration on the 22nd.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nAGENT'S REPORT ON BLACKFOOT AGENCY FOR OCTOBER 1937.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nBoth schools were inspected. Class/work O.K. and general conditions satisfactory. Pupils at Old Sun might have been more tidy and cleaner but a number of changes in staff disorganizes a big institution. A nurse arrived on the 30th for Old Suns. A good flow of water was obtained at 185 feet in drilling at this school. At Crowfoot, girls downstairs were much overcrowded but now that an addition is to be erected, many of the housing troubles should disappear. Both schools threshed crops which totaled near 2500 bus. of all kinds of grain.\n\nG. H.

As a result, Cutter appeared before Judge Boyd, Judge of the Juvenile Court at Gleichen during the 16th and 17th instant. He did commit an act likely to make Marie Wheeler a juvenile delinquent. Before the above mentioned offence was given by Marie McKeister, Nurse Water Chief Josephine Pendergast and Uncle Wolf Ear to the effect that Cutter visited old Sun school around 8:30 P.M. of Oct. 16th, and got Marie McKeister to let him in the girls wash room through the window. Also that he tried to get the girl to go in a bathroom with him. Supervision then came along and he was taken away. Shortly thereafter, Cutter was arrested. He was accused of an assault of Indian Hospital and was receiving treatment for gonorrhea. Cutter in his own evidence endeavoured to blame the school girls for encouraging him to get through the window into the wash room. Cutter was found guilty of offence and sentenced until 20th instant for sentence. On this date, the above sentence was imposed.

This school has three new members on its staff. I met them and discussed their work with them. I was particularly impressed with the nurse. (She is young and good looking). She seems to be a good energetic sensible girl, a graduate of Winnipeg General, with some experience. She will get results if given support, I believe. The kitchen matron is also a nurse.

The Old Sun was inspected on two dates; first, when the District Sports Day was held there, at which the Indian children competed with whites from the schools in neighboring towns, and secondly, at night in company with Major Randle, of the Six Nations agency. All appeared to be running smoothly. Crowfoot school was inspected during the month and I was particularly interested in the splendid spirit of all the children in classroom and at play.\n\nG. H. Gooderham.\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON BLACKFOOT AGENCY FOR MONTH OF NOVEMBER 1938.\n\nThe principal of the Old Sun School broke a leg and was in the hospital for a short while but the school ran along as usual and there was nothing out of the ordinary transpired.\n\nG.H. Gooderham\nIndian agent.\nAt the Old Sun School the Principal was able again to take complete supervision and all branches of the work seemed to be going along quite smoothly. Very little manual training could be given because of lack of facilities and the instructor in this branch had the boys under his charge mostly on the care of stock. I was not altogether satisfied that the children looked as clean and tidy as they should, especially the young boys. It is all very well to allow boys to scuffle around and enjoy themselves and not be too dressed up to do so but there is a limit both ways. Neatness and tidiness is certainly one thing that Indian children must be taught.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith my report for the month of January 1939.\n\nA regular inspection of the Old Sun School was not made, but the writer was there to see a hockey game and found all enthusiastic and apparently in good health. At this school, we are pleased to report that outdoor sports are encouraged. There are two excellent boys hockey teams and the Principal has also taken under his wing a hockey team comprised of graduates, who are playing in a provincial amateur league, and giving a very good account of themselves.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nAt the Old Sun School there has been a change in staff when the girls' Matron returned to Aklavik and was replaced by a matron who is a qualified nurse and comes from Sioux Lockout.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nGleichen, Jan. 10, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON BLACKFOOT AGENCY FOR DECEMBER 1939.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nBoth schools were inspected and all the children were well and happy.\n\nAt the Crowfoot school fire escape doors were completed on the 14th. At both schools there were Christmas concerts when the parents loaded their children down with presents. It seems to be a case of \"keeping up with the Jones'\" and with the cooperation of the principals we hope in the future to stop this considerable waste of money on useless trinkets.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nGleichen, Alta., Mar. 6, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON BLACKFOOT AGENCY FOR FEBRUARY.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nBoth schools were inspected and at the Old Sun's I felt that there should be some shake up in staff as it was evident that general conditions were not as good as could be expected. I took it up with the principal and he stated he was of the same mind and had already asked his commission for certain changes. This school is doing reasonably good work but there is certainly room for improvement. However, the children are happy, healthy and well fed.\n\nFor sometime now it has always been a pleasure to inspect the Crowfoot school. There is such an air of happy well organized industry everywhere in this institution. The class work, particularly in the intermediate class rooms, is well organized and well done. The other work, outside the class rooms, is certainly above the average. The children are very happy, they have a grand time and are just as enthusiastic about their work as they are about their play; they are unusually well fed and their sports are also very well organized. I must add that at both schools there are good hockey teams. A team composed of Old Sun School graduates is entered in the Junior Intermediate Provincial Playdowns, and at date of writing have not yet been beaten.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nGleichen, May 8th, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON BLACKFOOT AGENCY FOR MONTH OF APRIL.\n\nGENERAL XXX\n\nSCHOOLS XXX\n\nEXD XXXXXXXXX\n\nBoth schools were inspected and pupils were found to be in reasonably good health and cheerful\u2014especially so at the Crowfoot school. Some changes should be made at the Old Sun School in the staff; the nurse is not efficient, nor is one of the Matrons. The principal also advises me that he proposes to strengthen his teaching staff by putting a more capable teacher in the junior room. I respectfully agree, as it is this room that the real ground work is done. One member of the staff, Mr. Bell, the farmer, has enlisted, and has been replaced by Mr. Toons, who has been at this school for some time and will carry on very well, I believe. Mr. Bell was an especially good farmer and brought the farm and the dairy herd to the highest point of efficiency and productivity in the history of this institution.\n\nAt the Crowfoot school the spring run-off cut a deep canal right through the middle of their farm, at the rear of the institution. This canal has been in existence for some years in draining off the water from north of the town of Qu'Appelle and the artesian wells in the town. The existing canal is dangerous and something must be done to prevent further erosion and it is now our duty to find out with whom the responsibility or fixing this rests.\n\nAt both institutions everything is ready to go ahead with seeding when conditions will allow.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nGleichen, April 4, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON BLACKFOOT AGENCY FOR MARCH 1940.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nThe writer was on holidays the latter half of the month and did not inspect any of the schools. It is reported, however, that everything has progressed favorably.\n\nAt both schools, it has been the policy, in which this office concurred, to keep the names of pupils on the register until they were about 13, even when such pupils were not in residence. This policy permitted what might be called, has worked well, particularly with the boys. They have moved themselves back when they knew that they might be brought back to the school. It is now realized, of course, that the financial set-up does not allow for remuneration to the church schools for all children whom they may be able to enroll. One of the schools on this reserve has been in residence quite a number of pupils for whom they did not get the grant. We have had some assistance in financing and it must be said here that the standard of living and general care of pupils, even in this school was very much higher than it was in the years gone by.\n\nAlthough the writer has never been in favor of the large boarding schools, I think it must be admitted that the churches do educate the child at less cost than if the Government paid all the costs of education, under the same conditions. We have also concluded that the cost of medical care could be materially reduced if more assistance could be given for new work in schools. I think this has been proven by the conditions existing on this reserve. After all, health and education are intertwined and one cannot be considered without the other.\n\nAs it is now the policy of the Department to discharge pupils at the age of 16, we feel it is in the best interests of the Indians to try to work out some scheme of control of those children who leave at that age.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nGleichen, July 9, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON BLACKFOOT AGENCY FOR JUNE.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nBoth schools were inspected in the last week of the month when everyone was busy cleaning up for the year. At the Old Sun School the principal had practically all children in the garden and on the irrigated land, which I think was the very best way to employ them. The abstract teaching of the classroom doesn't get very good results with Indian children and I feel that there isn't enough realistic work given to them. The Old Sun farm and gardens are very good indeed. At Crowfoot School the junior room shows what a really good teacher can do; the Sister in charge has developed a bright class by realistic teaching. The pupils of this school have done some excellent handicraft, none better can be found anywhere. The farm crop looks very good, but the gardens are poor at this institution. Children appeared to be in good health and happy; particularly so because they were going on holidays very soon.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nGlenchen, Oct. 7, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON BLACKFOOT AGENCY FOR SEPTEMBER.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nChildren returned to schools on the first of the month and the Principals reported that nearly all came back quite promptly. Some of the larger boys were allowed out on harvest work and are still out. It has been difficult to get new pupils started but presumably they are now bringing results. There are less children in these schools than there have been for many years as children over sixteen have been discharged. The principal of the Old Sun School tried to get two of his \"teenage pupils,\" who had completed grade eight, into the Glenchen High School, but the Board of Trustees would not accept them despite the fact that arrangements had been made to pay the fees. He brought it to the attention of the Department of Education, Edmonton, stating that in his opinion the Board of Trustees should have been prepared to accept these children as there was nothing in the act to state that they should refuse their admission. There was some correspondence about it but Mr. House had arranged a correspondence course, nothing further was done, but the writer brings it to your attention as he believes that there must be something in Mr. House's argument. Why should an Indian be refused admission to a school which has the accommodation, if the Indian can meet financial obligations and is physically fit?\n\nThe crops and gardens at both schools are encouraging and have been harvested. Although the writer wasn't in a position to make an inspection during the month he knows that the teaching staff of both schools have been greatly improved with the appointment of teachers who have had normal training and higher qualifications than those who filled a number of these positions in past years.\n\nG.

Work in this institution was going along as usual and I was particularly interested in the farm work as being carried out by the new farmer. All land in crop and garden is irrigated and on the date of inspection looked very well indeed. This school has 55 head of cattle of which 30 are milking, 3 sows and a boar, 225 hens and chicks and eight head of horses. As the Principal explained, the farm is operated for subsistence only, and it must be said that he has a good balanced layout to carry out this program.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\n\nG.H. Gooderham\nIndian Agent.\nBlackfoot Indian Agency,\nGleichen, July 9, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHerewith my report for the month of June, 1941:\n\nSCHOOLS:\n\nInspections were made at both schools where conditions were found to be generally satisfactory. At the Old Sun School two pupils wrote grade 9 exams and showed some indication that they understood what it was all about. Classroom work at both schools was very limited, the objective being to teach the pupil to speak English, read and write English and to do simple problems. The R.C. School has arranged to send Father Charron to attend the Provincial Youth Training School this summer, in order that technical training can be properly carried out in this institution in the coming year -- this is a step in the right direction. Crops at both schools were standing up fairly well and there was sufficient pasture for their herds of cattle, with sufficient feed on hand for fattening stock. All pupils went on holidays on the 29th.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\n\nG.H. Gooderham\nIndian Agent\nBlackfoot Indian Agency\nGleichen, Aug. 12, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHerewith my report for the month of July, 1941.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nAt the Old Sun School, most work was confined to farming and irrigation. The Principal spent six weeks in military training and could only give a small part of his time to the school work; however, everything seems to be running smoothly.\n\nG.H. Gooderham\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\nBlackfoot Indian Agency,\nGleichen, Sept. 8, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHerewith my report for the month of August, 1941.\n\nSCHOOLS:\n\nSchools were still closed, but the principals and their staffs were busy preparing for opening, and in harvesting on their farms. It is hoped that four-roomed houses can be moved during September to both institutions for vocational training. The pressure tank buried underground at Crowfoot School, burst and permanent replacement or repair of this will be a real job. A temporary plant is being set up. Owing to the prevalence of poliomyelitis and sleeping sickness, pupils will not return to school until further orders.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nHerewith my report for the month of September 1941.\n\nSCHOOLS:\n\nSchools did not open until the 22nd and the writer did not make an inspection after that date. Pupils were apparently happy to return but the parents have been very slow in bringing in children who were entering for the first time. As usual, there was the unfortunate situation where there are mixed marriages and many disputes as to which school the child should attend. Our only interest is that the child of school age should go to school and we do not consider it our duty to either advise or dissuade the parent where the child must be placed. Very little vocational work has been started at either school as accommodation has not yet been provided. A temporary plant to supply necessary water at Crowfoot School has been set up. From a recent survey and information given to me, I am glad to report that the children returned to school generally in very good physical condition. The T.B. Clinic will commence almost immediately, when the real condition will be known.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\n\nG.H. Gooderham\nIndian Agent\nDear Sir:\n\nHerewith my report for the month of October, 1941;\n\nSCHOOLS:\n\nAt the Old Sun School I found the classroom work well in hand under two very capable teachers. There is a good nurse on the staff and I was interested to note that most of the pupils had gained weight during the summer and that their weight charts indicated that the parents had looked after the health of their children. In vocational training, the usual classes in cooking and sewing have been started. To stimulate this, I was fortunate enough to bring with me on my visit a cookery expert who was demonstrating in local stores, and I am sure the pupils, as well as the teachers, enjoyed her assistance. She led the cooking class for a whole afternoon. The farm and garden is on irrigated land and results were very good. Ample feed and vegetables have been harvested. A four room Indian house was moved to this institution and has been made ready for use in vocational training. The boys have assisted in repair work and will follow out their course of study during November under a capable instructor.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nG.H. Gooderham\n\nIndian agent.\nBlackfoot Indian Agency\nGleichen, Feb. 11, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHerewith my report for the month of January, 1942.\n\nAt the Old Sun School, I was impressed with the improved classroom work and the general condition of the pupils. I inspected their meals which were not elaborate, but care had been taken to give the children the proper diet. Vocational work at this school was not so far advanced but a good foundation had been laid to carry this out properly. The Principals of both schools had had trouble with the Chief and Headmen, as well as parents, and they have taken definite steps to prevent the everlasting visiting and haranguing about setting the children out.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nGleichen, Alta., Aug. 11, 1942.\n\nREPORT ON BLACKFOOT FOR MONTH OF JULY.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nInspections were made at both schools in company with the Inspector and visiting officers. Very necessary repairs had been arranged for but nothing has been done except some interior painting. At Crowfoot school the garden was badly damaged by hail which was confined to a very small area in and about the school; fortunately the grain crops were only slightly damaged. This school has a surplus of feed from last year and is now getting more from the Indians with still more of their own to harvest. At the Old Sun School, alfalfa was harvested and the garden as well as grain crops looked very good. This institution has lost a number of the staff, including the nurse, two women supervisors and the man in charge of vocational training. It is understood that all vacancies cannot be filled.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nSchools:\n\nBoth schools were inspected and children were back off holidays. Most of them came promptly and in surprisingly good health. At the Old Sun School there were a number of new members on the staff and even temporary help until such time as more permanent can be secured. At Crewfoot School extensive repairs were made to the main building and to the water supply system. This school is now in better condition than it has been for many years. At both institutions the principals have been busy with their harvesting operations and despite a labor shortage have done surprisingly well and are harvesting excellent crops.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nBoth schools were inspected; Crowfoot school was in splendid order, three class rooms with qualified teacher, and a night watchman making hourly rounds, except for a few cases of colds all pupils were well and happy.\n\nThreshing has been completed with good returns -1900 bushels wheat, 1800 bushels of barley and 5 to 6000 bushel of oats, besides a good quantity of green feed; unfortunately the yield from the garden was ruined by hail.\n\nOld Sun School all running smoothly, but one senior teacher was temporary from the principal anticipated a difficulty in replacing her. A number of the children had light attacks of flu, nothing serious.\n\nAll crops have been harvested with a satisfactory yield, though the yield from the garden was not as big as hoped; very little vegetable, will have be purchased.\n\nBoth schools anticipated a shortage of staff and great difficulty in filling vacancies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nAn inspection was made of the Old Sun School and this was confined to barns, stock and the kitchen and basement of the school; all was operating smoothly though there was no surplus coal. Class rooms were not inspected; there is now only one teacher and she has taken to junior room half the day and senior the other half. The kitchen matron was leaving the end of the month, and so far as is known the Principal has been unable to replace her and had to reorganize his remaining staff. On the whole the children are doing well, though a few had colds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON BLACKFOOT INDIAN AGENCY FOR MONTH OF DECEMBER, 1942.\n\nSCHOOLS:\nBoth schools were inspected; I found everything going along smoothly despite a shortage in staff; the work and the instructions were well done. The children were well and happy. This is particularly true at the Crowfoot school where I attended an excellent concert.\n\nAt both schools the cattle and hogs are raised for home consumption and market; one school even had a surplus of cream for sale.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY, 1943.\n\nSCHOOLS.\n\nThe Old Sun school was given a thorough inspection, the children were happy though a few had light colds; the staff had been depleted again with the enlistment of a man, & the nurse assumed the position of a police matron in the city of Calgary. Despite this all work was proceeding in orderly manner; the principal takes the vocational training, at which he is very good; the remaining teacher takes Juniors in the forenoon and Seniors in the afternoon; and the matron looking after the infirmary as well as her other work. The diet was ample and varied and there was lots of milk butter fat; the meat ration was reduced. I was particularly gratified with the care given to stock; the farmer is a good stockman and has his milk herd in splendid condition. The boys do all the work and do it very well. This school will have a surplus of feed at the end of the winter. At present there is only one breeding sow here. The hog house is a mere shell and very small; as a result pigs can only be raised in warm weather.\n\nNo inspection was made at the Crowfoot School but all was running smoothly according to last reports.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON BLACKFOOT INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH, 1943.\n\nSCHOOLS:\n\nOwing to the press of other work neither of the schools were inspected.\n\nAt the Old Sun School the second teacher has arrived and a young man has been employed to assist the principal with vocational training.\n\nAt the Crowfoot School the principal has taken full charge of all branches of the work and business of this institution. The health of the pupils at both school was good.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON BLACKFOOT INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF MAY, 1943.\n\nSchools;\n\nBoth Schools were inspected and condition found to be exceptionally good. There had been an epidemic of flu but all children look strong and happy; the diet had been changed owing to the difficulty in getting meat, more vegetables and other foods were supplied; Farm and garden work was well cared for and there was ample milk and eggs at both schools.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON BLACKFOOT INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE, 1943.\n\nSchools;\n\nBoth schools were visited and inspected and conditions found to be very good. Parents and pupils were told that they must return to school on the 1st of September and so far as is known there was no objections to that. All children are now on holidays.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON BLACKFOOT INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JULY, 1943.\n\nSchools:\n\nAt the Crowfoot school, the principle and his staff were busy working erecting an excellent piggery. The crop on the school farm is fairly good. The Principle is going to find it very difficult to finance if he takes in more pupils than the grant allows. Costs are increasing as well as food prices and labor is hard to get, wages are higher.\n\nAt Old Sun School the haying was the order of the day; a good ton of alfalfa was secured and the crops and gardens were irrigated and looked very good. The Principle is having a terrible time getting labor and holding staff. A thorough inspection was made of the roof of the school and it is expected that the cost of making it weather proof will be considered. All pupils were on holidays.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON BLACKFOOT INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH SEPTEMBER, 1943.\n\nSchools:\n\nTwo or more inspections were made at each of the schools during the month. Most of the pupils returned at the opening date.\n\nAt the Crowfoot School there are now 102 pupils, equally divided, boys and girls. They appear to be in pretty good health and happy to be in school.\n\nAt the Old Suns School there are 90 pupils.\n\nBoth institutions have a good staff of teachers and work was proceeding in good order. Both have very good crops and have harvested them. There is ample garden stuff, milk and meat to meet the immediate requirements.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON BLACKFOOT INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OCTOBER, 1943.\n\nSchools;\nBoth schools were inspected. Pupils were healthy and happy and these institutions were running smoother than at almost any time in our experience. The diets were good though the milk supply could be increased. This, of course is seasonal and as cows freshen there will always be ample.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON BLACKFOOT INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH NOVEMBER, 1943.\n\nSchools;\n\nBoth schools were visited and inspected. The health of the pupils was good and the class room work appeared to be quite satisfactory. Little had been done in Manual training as the members of the staff, who are in charge, were otherwise employed. The boys, however, had been employed on good practical vocational work.\n\nThe large roof on the Old Sun School was renewed by a contractor, under the supervision of Mr. Nelson. Fine weather is the greatest assistance and it is believed that a very fine job was done. At this institution the water level in the wells dropped and steps were taken to stop all leaks and keep a steady flow into the water tanks. By the end of the month, this institution was getting sufficient water but there was certainly no surplus. The farmer at this school has an excellent herd of cattle; there is evidence of good care and supervision. The boys received good instructions in animal husbandry and care of poultry.\n\nAt the CROWFOOT SCHOOL, the raising of pigs is a large industry; a fine quality of bacon hog is being produced here. Since the Blackfeet are raising hogs it is a good thing that the youngsters are being taught how to look after them.\n\nIt requires a great deal more attention and experience to raise hogs of the right type than it does to raise horses and cattle; and this is one thing that must be instilled into the minds of these young Indians.\n\nBoth schools supply a splendid diet to their pupils and have a good supply of vegetables and meat.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON BLOOD INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JANUARY, 1944.\n\nSchools:\n\nRegular visits were made to the residential schools during the month, and were found functioning well, with all students at school.\n\nThe result of the T.B. Clinic, necessitated the discharge of two children from St. Mary's School and three from St. Paul's School, and their removal to the T.B. ward at the Indian Hospital. Observation cases in both schools were named in letters to the Principals along with instructions for their care; these instructions came from Inspector C.P. Schmidt.\n\nThe St. Paul's Indian School this month won the award for the best amount of their quota, in this case around 600%, in doing this the children purchased during December & January around $165.00 worth of stamps.\n\nAnthony McMillan,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nAttention Schools' Section\n\nThe Blackfoot Council Meeting of 4th instant registered the following minutes under heading \"SCHOOLS\":-\n\n\"Moved by Big Snake, and by Yellowfly that the Agent 'ascertain from the Department if the text books used in the Indian Schools on this reserve are standard for the Province and if not, why not?'.\n\nCouncillor Big Snake raised the point in the first instance and said that the senior teacher at the Crowfoot School complained that she could not get the proper books. She gave him the list - copy attached hereto.\n\nFor your attention and instructions, please.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n\n/HM.\nOttawa,\nOctober 27, 1944.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham, Indian Agent, Gleichen, Alta.\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the books supplied to the Crowfoot Residential School. The Department feels that we have supplied the necessary books to this school. However, it is our intention to communicate with the Principal, although Father Forester was written very fully on August 19.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nREPORT ON BLACKFOOT INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OCTOBER, 1944.\n\nSchools;\n\nThere were 197 pupils at the two schools when inspected this month; all were happily and looked well. Classroom work was progressive and at Crowfoot School typewriting is being taught to some seniors by the teacher who recently qualified.\n\nAll plants were operating satisfactorily and buildings in good state of repair. Everything was running smoothly.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON BLACKFOOT AGENCY FOR MONTH OF NOVEMBER, 1944.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nThe Indians are better off than many of their white neighbors; they have well run boarding schools where there are teachers, good food and good clothes. Many white schools are closed because no teachers are available and even if the schools were open the children would travel miles each day to attend. Classroom work has been found to compare very favorably with white schools in equal grades and besides the class work, Indian children get vocational training that many whites can never get. The trend in neighboring white schools is to form large units with dormitories and vocational training added to the basic three R's. The trend is towards the Indian boarding school system rather than away from it. The Blackfoot see this now and are showing more appreciation of their schools. There is only one thing wrong. Not enough money is allowed for the operation; salaries are too low to attract the better qualified and more efficient. Withal, reasonably good work is being done, but what a gamble.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nQUARTERLY REPORT ENDING MARCH, 1945, ON BLACKFOOT INDIAN AGENCY\n\nEducation:\n\nThere were 200 pupils attending the two residential Indian Schools and 3 attending the Gleichen High School.\n\nThe Mumps epidemic did not break up the routine very badly at the boarding schools; classroom work went on as usual and was much of the same calibre.\n\nAt the Crowfoot School, dormitory space was increased by moving the quarters of the senior matron of boys and girls into the hallway and very comfortable and well ventilated rooms were erected over the stairways at either end of the buildings. At this school, the girls are receiving training in typewriting and music as well as domestic and sewing; the boys are not so fortunate; they receive good training in care of stock but no manual training. The Principal is anxious to supply this when a competent instructor can be found.\n\nDespite the fact that there are over 100 children in this school (30 over the grant) they are very comfortably housed and very well fed. The Principal and Sister Superior deserve all the credit.\n\nThe Old Suns School is also running smoothly; the Principal Rev. J.W. House, is a capable administrator. He secured the services of a qualified manual training instructor and the boys are now receiving regular training.\n\nThere is a need for trained carpenters and mechanics on this reserve and it is our hope and expectation that a few boys will graduate from year to year, who will make carpentry or allied trades their vocation after some apprenticeship.\n\nThe boys attending high School did very well this term. They proved one thing, that they can do well when made to apply themselves to this work.\n\nThe Old Suns School has a Cadet Company and good hockey teams. The Crowfoot School also has hockey teams.\n\nG.H. Gooderham, Indian Agent.\nQUARTERLY REPORT ENDING JUNE 30th, 1945, ON BLACKFOOT AGENCY\n\nEDUCATION:\n\nAttendance was good at the two boarding schools and very little time lost by sickness. German Measles and colds did keep some in bed for a couple of days.\n\nThe class room work wasn't so good at either school as in 1944-45. Changes in teaching staffs brought less qualified persons to this important work. The Indians are conscious of this, but during the war years they have made allowances. There were no pupils in either school who would pass into Grade IX. The three boys who attended Gleichen High School wrote Grade IX. The results are not out but the principal states they were capable of leading their class when they worked; we did our bit to keep them working and hope they made it.\n\nAt the Old Suns School, the training in carpentry, farming and care of stock is particularly good. Ex-pupils get employment and show the results of this. These schools should turn out some boys who could most of the repair work on the reserve. On the Blackfoot Reserve, there is enough carpentering and painting to keep two or three men employed. The generation of Indian carpenters is now past work; they were the product of industrial schools at the beginning of this century. We must produce more like them.\n\nOne could go on at length about the education of Indians. It will, I think, be conceded that the grant must be increased, the calibre of staffs raised and a definite contract made with the churches that run schools, before definite results can be expected or demanded.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nBlackfoot Indian Agency\nGleichen, Alberta.\nJanuary 4, 1946.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR THE QUARTER ENDING DECEMBER 31, 1945.\n\nXX XX XX\n\nEducation: Two boys are attending Gleichen High School in Grade 10; they are doing alright.\n\nThere are 200 pupils at the two residential Boarding Schools. They are healthy and happy. Vocational training has been improved and the calibre of the instructors satisfactory.\n\nClassroom work always appears to be lacking in something; possibly this is due to lack of interest by the pupil but it is so easy for a teacher to get in a rut and lack that spirit which the child needs so much to retain its interest and enthusiasm. Indian children love to sing and they are good singers. We need to practice a little more psychology to get nearer the desired results.\n\nAll children who were school age and physically fit at the beginning of the term are attending the schools.\n\nAt both institutions, the farms produced ample feed for stock. Good milch herds are retained while the flocks of fowl produced sufficient eggs. Some cattle and pigs are slaughtered for school consumption. The Crowfoot School has a splendid lot of pigs. The Old Suns School had a splendid garden on its irrigated farms.\n\nXX XX XX\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nAs I have recently returned from a visit to several schools I think it well to give you a few notes at I found.\n\nOld Sun School, Gleichen: I did not visit this school as I was there last February but Principal House decided to take a short holiday and accompany me to the Pacific Coast.

CURRICULAR OLD SUN SCHOOL:\nThe under mentioned information was learned on questions raised by the council at the September 19th meeting re the half-day labor system and half-day study periods for children attending the Old Sun Indian Residential School. The pupils in primary grades are in the classroom the entire school hours and the pupils in Grades 3 to 8 inclusive are on the half-day labor system. During a discussion the council desired to be recorded as stating that as long as these children are under the half-day labor system and take only half day's classroom work they could not as often expected compete with white children etc., who have the benefit of full days' classroom work.

Sorry to trouble you. Thanking you in anticipation.\n\nW. P. B. Pugh,\nSuperintendent.\nWe, the undersigned, members of the Blackfoot tribe, and living on the Blackfoot Reserve, Gleichen, Alberta, beg to approach the Department of Indian Affairs with the request that they take immediate steps to provide a fully equipped and modern building, constructed of brick and as fire-proof as possible, to replace the Old Sun Indian Residential School on this Reserve, which was recently destroyed by fire.\n\nWe, further, beg to suggest that sufficient monies for this purpose be borrowed from our vested funds in order that no delay may take place in meeting the above emergency in an adequate manner.\n\nNames: Address:\nSigned by 193 Indians. Indian Agency, Gleichen, Alta.\nGleichen, Alta.\nSeptember 6, 1928.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to yours of the 31st ult., I enclose herewith the petition which the Blackfoot Indians signed in connection with the building of a new school.\n\nThe petition was taken around the Reserve by the Rev. Mr. Gibney at the request of the Chiefs. Before he did so, he asked me if it was in order and I stated that I could see no objection. The Chiefs and some of the Indians who are Protestants approached me at the same time and stated that in their belief, the Members of the Band would be glad to ask the Department to loan sufficient money from Band Funds to erect the school, provided it could be built this year. The petition was completed and handed to me by Mr. Gibney on August 4th.\n\nThe Indians want a school and at that time (July) were afraid that the children might be sent to other schools. Even if a school could not be provided during the present school year, I am satisfied that the Indians are prepared to advance necessary funds to proceed with construction in time to allow occupancy in the fall of 1929.\n\nIt is hoped that Day schools can be started by October 1st at the latest. If the Indians keep their promise, the pupils of Old Sun's will continue school work as usual. Health conditions will be watched and the Church authorities have supplied considerable clothing from other points for the children of the poor parents who cannot purchase necessary clothing.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(Signed) W.H.

Hoey, Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThe sudden death of Canon J. W. House has made necessary two changes in the Principalships of our schools.\n\nAt the meeting of our Committee last week Archdeacon H. G. Cook, who has been the Principal of our School at Moose Factory, was appointed Superintendent in the place of Canon Alderwood. There has thus been necessary a change in the Principalships at Gleichen and Moose Factory.\n\n1. Gleichen. After careful study of the situation in Alberta it has seemed best to transfer the Rev. E.S. W. Cole from St. Cyrian's School at Brocket to succeed Canon House at Gleichen. Mr. Cole is 45 years of age. He served for five years during the war. In January of 1946, at our request, he was appointed by you as Principal of the School at Brocket. His service has been satisfactory. We would ask therefore for approval of his transfer to Gleichen.\n\n2. Moose Factory. Mr. Herbert Taylor has been serving in this school as Assistant Principal since August last. During part of the time when Archdeacon Cook was away through illness he acted as Principal in his place. He is twenty-six years of age, married with two children. He served for six years in the Army first in the ranks and later as an officer and Adjutant of his Battalion. His service at Moose Factory has been very satisfactory. We would ask for his appointment as Principal of the School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nLAD K.\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A. Dixon\nFebruary 19, 1948.\n\nMr. W.P.B. Pugh, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Gleichen, Alberta.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, the Department has approved the transfer of Rev. E.S.W. Cole from the principalship of the St. Cyprian's Residential School to the principalship of the Old Sun's Residential School.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nc/o to Regional Supervisor Gooderham.\nOttawa, February 19, 1948.\n\nDear Canon Dixon:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant, we approve the appointment of Rev. E.S.W. Cole as principal of the Old Sun School. It is noted that he is being transferred from St. Cyprian's Residential School.\n\nWe also approve the appointment of Mr. Herbert Taylor as principal of the Moose Fort Residential School.\n\nI presume you will advise me later regarding the name of the principal of the St. Cyprian's School.\n\nI also note that the Ven. Archdeacon H.G. Cook has been appointed Superintendent of the Indian School Administration of the M.S.C.C.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. Canon L.A. Dixon, M.A., D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada,\n604 Jarvis St.,\nToronto 5, Ontario.\n\nPP/MGD\nIn regard to the sum of $80,000.00, which was taken from the Blackfoot Band Fund to assist in the erection of the Old Sun Residential School on the Reserve in 1929/30, it is noted that the Council of the Band is inquiring as to when this will be paid and if same will be paid with interest.\n\nThis Band, by the surrender of a large portion of their reserve in 1911, has now the largest Band Fund, I believe, of any Band in Canada. At the same time, from that date the Band has paid for practically everything that was done for and on behalf of the Indians of the Band from this fund. Aside from the two schools, the Agency building and the house of the Superintendent and one clerk, all other buildings on the Reserve are the property of the Band. For many years there were expended from Band Funds, on behalf of the Band, for various services which included staff and medicalization, as well as programs of development, an annual amount of approximately $150,000.00.\n\nDuring recent years the expenditures from the Fund have risen for the same services that they were formerly receiving until the necessary expenditure for the year 1948/49 is about $250,000.00. By their surrender agreement the Indians were prepared to pay the salaries of added staff to carry on the farming and ranching program, and this program was commenced in 1912. It is not necessary to elaborate on this, as we are all aware that the costs of farming have increased tremendously during the interim.\n\nThe services which these Indians were prepared to supply themselves have since been supplied to most other reserves from appropriated funds. In 1925 the Band erected a hospital, and from that date has paid all operating expenses, including the salaries of a resident doctor and staff. This was done voluntarily. They also paid for outside hospitalization, including stays in sanatoria over a period of years. Since 1925 they have seen the medical services on behalf of Indians gradually grow in extent and expense until today it is no doubt the most expensive service on behalf of the Indians. They are now having free hospitalization at the Cassell Hospital for tuberculosis patients, and all other medicalization and hospitalization is still charged to their account. They have noted, furthermore, that Bands of Indians similarly situated have received all these services at no cost to them, because they did not turn their land capital into a liquid capital. This has given them food for thought.\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.\n\nFeb. 12/48\n\nThe Blackfoot are very proud of their ability to pay their own way, but the cost has now become so great, it is wondered if it is fair to allow them to continue to do so.\n\nThis brings us back to the advance for the erection of the Residential school. The Indians will undoubtedly continue to press for payment as they must increase their capital and revenue to meet their obligations.\n\nIf the salaries of necessary staff could be paid from appropriation, a heavy load would be taken off the Band Funds. The existing condition is not a healthy one, nor does it appear to be entirely fair. Staff is employed without consulting the Indians who pay the salaries, and it is increasingly evident that the better educated Indians object vehemently to this. It is argued that if they have to pay for the staff, they should have some say as to who will be hired and the salary that will be paid.\n\nInsofar as hospitalization and medicalization are concerned, the Band, through its Council, have indicated that they will meet this obligation, as they were the first to have started hospitalization in the country. Whether or not the resident doctor and nurses in the hospital can be called necessary staff is debatable. The Indians believe that a resident doctor is part of the necessary staff of an Indian Reserve, and that if other members of the staff are paid from appropriation, then the salary of the doctor should be paid.\n\nThe foregoing is brought to your attention, Mr. Hoey, because there is no desire on the part of anyone, I am sure, to willfully exploit this Band, but unwittingly there may be a tendency to do so, and now is the time to curb such a move.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nGHG:RM\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 29th JANUARY, 1930.\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 18th January, 1930, from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, submitting that the main building of the old Sun Indian Residential School on the Blackfoot Indian Reserve, in the Province of Alberta, was destroyed by fire in June, 1928. The Blackfoot Indian Band, wishing to expedite replacement, petitioned the department to take from its funds whatever was necessary to proceed with a new building at an early date. For the current fiscal year, Parliament provided $40,000 towards the replacement.\n\nAs the amount required, however, is $120,000, the Minister recommends that authority be granted for an expenditure of $80,000 from the interest funds of the said Blackfoot Band, which now amount to $880,474.79, under section 93 of the Indian Act.\n\nThe minister states that it is proposed that this amount should be refunded to the band within the next two fiscal years in conformity with the department's policy that all cost of Indian education should be defrayed from public funds.\n\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing recommendation and submit the same for approval.\n\nE.

General of Indian Affairs.\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nOld Sun Indian Residential School.\n\nIn 1929 the Old Sun Residential School was under construction on the Blackfoot Indian Reserve and funds were not available to complete the project. Therefore the following resolution was passed by the Blackfoot Band:\n\n\"We, the undersigned, members of the Blackfeet Indian tribe, and living on the Blackfoot Reserve, Gleichen, Alberta, beg to approach the Department of Indian Affairs with the request that they take immediate steps to provide a fully equipped and modern building, constructed of brick and as fire-proof as possible, to replace the Old Sun Indian Residential School on this Reserve, which was recently destroyed by fire.\n\n\"We, further, beg to suggest that sufficient monies for this purpose be borrowed from our vested funds in order that no delay may take place in meeting the above emergency in an adequate manner.\"\n\nAs a result of this resolution, the attached Order-in-Council was passed.\n\nThe sum of $80,000.00 thus obtained was used for the completion of the Old Sun Residential School.\n\nOn different occasions during the last eighteen years we have included in the preliminary draft of our\nestimates this sum of $80,000.00 but the item has always been deleted.\n\nWe are now advised by Mr. Gooderham that the Council of the Blackfoot Band is inquiring as to when this amount will be paid and also if interest will be allowed on it. Mr. Gooderham advises the Indians will undoubtedly continue to press for payment as they must increase their capital and revenue to meet added obligations from their Band Funds.\n\nIn again asking reconsideration of your decision in this matter I am influenced by the fear expressed by Mr. Gooderham that delay may cause the Blackfoot Band to accept the invitation of the Alberta Indian Association to appoint delegates to represent them in that Association. Should the Band decide to do so, the result would probably be that representations would be made to us and to the Members of Parliament for Calgary, with the result that when the matter is settled, no matter how voluntarily, the Association and its self-appointed publicity agents would claim credit for forcing the hand of the Government.\n\nIt appears to me that it would be preferable to settle this matter without waiting for any further representations from the Band or pressure from the Indian Association or persons whom the Association might influence to plead the Blackfoot cause.\n\nWithin the next week or so the question of management of Band Funds will be considered by the Parliamentary Committee inquiring into the Indian Act and I would like to have some provision for settlement of this matter made before being called upon to report on it.\nIn view of the above, I would strongly recommend that consideration be given to the inclusion of the following amounts in our next supplementary estimates:\n\n(a) Return of funds borrowed from Blackfoot Band Trust Fund for construction of Old Sun Residential School ............ $80,000.00\n\n(b) Interest on the above from January 29, 1930 (date of O.C.) to March 31, 1948, at 5% simple interest ............ $72,668.49\n\nTotal ....... $152,668.49\n\nDirector\n\nPP/MGD\n\nMr. Murray:\nThis letter is a joint draft by Mr. Allman.\n\nS.\nThe Indian School Administration\nof the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nREV.

Authorization for a pupilage of 120 should be obtained. Above that number, pupils should be day pupils, and an attempt should be made to increase the time spent on academic subjects and directed progressive vocational training. This school has a \"chore\" tradition.\n\nThe principal wishes to create a third classroom by \"walking off\" the auditorium. The basement dormitory would serve also as the auditorium and theatre. The only alternative is to build more classrooms\u2014if we intend accommodating all who should attend.\n\nThe principal agrees to employ three teachers. He should have four, but there is no fourth room.\n\nAs at Crexford, there is a small house (about 35' x 25') donated by the tribe, and equipped for Manual Training. To lack of an instructor it is not in active use.\n\nThis school, in my opinion, is in a more difficult situation than some people realize. It had a bad year in farming activities. Hay failed. Six milk cows had to be sold. Water is served to the pupils more often than is milk. Meat, potatoes, and vegetables have to be bought. I doubt the adequacy of the Principal, the farmer, the implements, or the boys available to cope with the peculiar agricultural problems that this institution presents. Help is needed. Who will supply it? Or will this school be allowed to follow the ineffectual pattern that Blood (C.E.) presents?\nAlthough, as stated above, water appears on the tables more often than milk, during my two-day visit there was a shortage of water for the wash-basins and toilets. An attempt is being made to correct this shortcoming.\n\nSimilarly, the Superintendent and Principal are anxious to adjust the boys' toilets to a state approximating the original installation. The removal of partitions, seats, and toilet paper, and the apparent lack of any attempt to keep the bowls clean, has resulted in a situation better imagined than described. Supervision of this department is the duty of a maiden lady.\n\nI am grateful to be able to report that this school has recently inaugurated a cadre of prefects. Unfortunately, at the time of my visit three of the boy prefects were missing, and no responsible person had any certain knowledge of their whereabouts.\n\nThe teacher of the upper grades, supported by the Principal, hopes to include Grade Nine in the work of the classrooms next year. I told them that I considered that this project had little to commend it, but I agreed that they should state the case for your consideration. In turn, I warned them that, if they proceeded according to plan, the outcome would scarcely afford reason for all-round congratulation, but rather the opposite.\n\nC.O.T.

For the current fiscal year, Parliament provided $40,000 towards the replacement.\n\nAs the amount required, however, is $120,000, the Minister recommends that authority be granted for an expenditure of $30,000 from the interest funds of the said Blackfoot Band, which now amount to $380,474.79, under Section 93 of the Indian Act.\n\nThe Minister states that it is proposed that this amount should be refunded to the band within the next two fiscal years in conformity with the department's policy that all cost of Indian education should be defrayed from public funds.\n\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing recommendation and submit the same for approval.\n\nE.J. Lemaire,\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Supt. General of Indian Affairs.\nJuly 27th, 1943.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL.\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report,\n\nTHAT under authority of P.C. 207 of January 29, 1930, the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs was granted authority to expend eighty thousand dollars ($80,000.00) from the Interest Funds of the Blackfoot Indian Band in order to assist with the erection of the Old Sun Indian Residential School;\n\nTHAT in conformity with the Department's policy that all costs of Indian education should be defrayed from public funds, P.C. 207 of January 29, 1930 provided that the above amount should be refunded to the Band within the following two fiscal years. This latter provision of the Order in Council was not put into effect and consequently the amount borrowed from the Band Funds has not yet been refunded;\n\nTHAT the interest on eighty thousand dollars ($80,000.00) from January 29, 1930 to March 31, 1943, at five per-cent simple interest amounts to seventy six thousand, six hundred and sixty eight dollars and forty nine cents ($76,668.49). The rate of interest just stated is the same as the Government allows on credit balances in the Indian Trust Fund.\n\nAt the present time, therefore, a sum of one hundred and fifty two thousand, six hundred and sixty eight dollars and forty nine cents ($152,668.49) is required in order to reimburse the Interest Funds of the said Blackfoot Band.\n\nThe amount just mentioned was included in our supplementary Appropriation, 1943-49, and it is recommended that authority be given for the payment of this amount to the Interest Funds of the Blackfoot Band.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\n\nPP/MSD\nOttawa, July 27, 1948.\n\nPRECIS FOR THE CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL.\n\nRequesting authority to reimburse the Interest Funds of the Blackfoot Band an amount of $152,668.49, being a loan of $80,000.00 from the Interest Funds of the said Band, plus five per cent simple interest - $72,668.49.\n\nTwo extra copies of the order in Council are required by Indian Affairs Branch.\nOttawa, July 27, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nAttached is Memorandum to Council requesting authority to refund the interest funds of the Blackfoot Band, an amount of $80,000.00 plus interest at five per-cent, from January 29, 1930 to March 31, 1948.\n\nFor your information I attach copy of P.C. 207 dated January 29, 1930 authorizing the use of $80,000.00 from the Interest Funds of the Blackfoot Band to pay part of the cost of the erection of the Old Sun Indian Residential School.\n\nYou will note that the Order in Council mentioned also providing the refund of the amount within the two fiscal years following the date of the passing of P.C. 207. Due to varying circumstances the amount mentioned above has never been refunded to the Interest Funds of the Blackfoot Band and during the last two or three years the Band has been pressing for the return of the loan.\n\nFunds for the purpose are provided in our Supplementary Estimates for the fiscal year 1948-49.\n\nDirector.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nPP/MGD\nBlackfoot Agency,\nGleichen, Alberta.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\nAttention of B.F.

Re Education\n\nSimon Bigsnake asked if there was any development in regards to Indian Education - agent replied that the enrollment of both schools has been increased to 130 pupils, two more class rooms are being made at Crowfoot School and one more at Old Sun, that there would be two more teachers at Crowfoot and one more at Old Sun. Further, that the Dept. had allowed both Schools to hire Manual Training Teachers, but that great difficulty was being experienced by both schools in obtaining this class of teacher. Agent was glad to inform the Council that the two High School Girls, attending the Cluny White High School, namely Doreen Kuning Rabbit and Hoselyn Bigsnake had both passed from Grade 9 to Grade 10, and both are going to continue their studies. Percy Yellowfly was now writing supplemental examinations in connection with Grade 12.\n\n(Sgd) W.P.B Pugh,\nSuperintendent.\n\nCopied: V.S.\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL,\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report,\n\nTHAT under authority of P.C. 207 of January 29, 1930, the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs was granted authority to expend eighty thousand dollars ($80,000.00) from the Interest Funds of the Blackfoot Indian Band in order to assist with the erection of the Old Sun Indian Residential School.\n\nThis in conformity with the Department's policy that all costs of Indian residential schools be defrayed from Public Funds, P.C. 207 of January 29, 1930 provided that the amount should be refunded to the Band within the following two fiscal years.

Keenleyside,\nDeputy Minister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Dr. Keenleyside:\n\nThis will refer to your Minister's recommendation of August 21, 1948, for authority to reimburse the interest fund of the Blackfoot Band of Indians with the sum of $152,668.49, being the principle borrowed with accrued interest from January 29, 1930 to March 31, 1948.\n\nWhile the Order in Council, which authorized this loan from the Interest Funds of this Band of Indians, provided that the loan was to be repaid within two years, it seems that no action has been taken until the current fiscal year towards meeting this provision of the Order in Council. Under the circumstances, it would be appreciated if you would submit for the information of the Board, detailed explanations for not repaying this loan within the period specified in the Order in Council, and thus allowing interest to accumulate to the substantial amount of $72,668.49.\n\nFrom a review of the above Order in Council the only explanation which seems to have been advanced in support of the loan was that the Indian Band had requested the Department to take from its funds whatever was necessary to proceed with the building required at an early date. The Band's request was apparently granted in view of the fact that Parliament provided only $40,000.00 for this purpose, whereas an expenditure of $120,000.00 was required. However, as it has not been the policy of the Government to make loans from Indian Band Funds, the question has come up as to whether it was not considered feasible at the time to request Parliament to provide additional sums for this purpose. It would be appreciated, therefore, if you could review for the information of the Board the circumstances which led to the necessity of making this loan.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) R.B. Bryce,\nFor Secretary.\nOttawa, September 27, 1948.\n\nR.B. Bryce, Esq.,\nfor Secretary,\nTreasury Board of Canada,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Bryce:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of September 11th, with reference to the Minister's recommendation of August 21st, 1948, for authority to reimburse the interest fund of the Blackfoot Band of Indians to the sum of $152,668.49.\n\nOwing to the economic conditions existing at the time the loan should have been repaid as provided by P.C. 207 of January 29th, 1930, it was found impossible to provide the necessary funds. The matter has been considered on several occasions since that time but owing to other urgent demands, previous Ministers apparently felt that the matter could be allowed to stand.\n\nIn the last year, the Council of the Blackfoot Band has strongly urged that their funds be reimbursed to the extent requested and provision for the repayment was made in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49.\n\nIt is noted that the question of interest is mentioned in your communication. Permit me to point out that interest at the rate of five per cent (5%) is allowed at the end of March each year on the \"Revenue (Interest) Account\" of each Band and, consequently, if we had repaid the loan at the time provided by P.C. 207,\nthe amount would have been placed in the \"Revenue (Interest) Account\" and the Band would have been allowed five per cent (5%) interest each year. Consequently, the amount paid in interest would have been much larger than the amount of interest that we are now recommending be allowed.\n\nIt is regretted that the file does not disclose the reasons for the departure made from established policy in this case, and we can only conclude that the Government of the day had not set up sufficient funds for the purpose and took advantage of the offer of the Indians to get the work under way.\n\nIt may interest you to note the following entry which appeared in our estimates for Indian Education for the fiscal year 1929-30:\n\n\"Old Sun, Alta. (C.E.).\n\nThe main building at the Old Sun Indian Residential School was destroyed by fire in June, 1928.

I understand that the purpose of the proposed payment into the Revenue (Interest) Account is to reimburse the Blackfoot Band in respect of moneys from that account that were used in 1930 for the construction of an Indian School.\n\nVote 772 provides certain moneys for the purpose of \"Indian Education\". In my opinion, this Vote does not authorize the transfer or the crediting of any amount to the Revenue (Interest) Account of the Blackfoot Band, and this may legally be done only pursuant to statutory authority which may be provided by a specific item in an appropriation Act.\n\n(Sgd.)

That Department has now advised that the above Vote does not authorize the transfer or the crediting of any amount to the Revenue (Interest) Account of the Blackfoot Band, and that this may legally be done only pursuant to statutory authority which may be provided by a specific item in the Appropriation Act. A copy of Mr. Varcoe's letter is attached for your information.\n\nIn view of Mr. Varcoe's opinion, the Board have taken no action with respect to this recommendation, and in order to make it possible for you to reimburse this Interest Account, it will be necessary for you to submit a specific item in the Annual Estimates.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) R. B. BRYCE,\n\nFor Secretary.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. MacKay,\n\nReimbursement to Interest Fund of Blackfoot Band of Indians - Legality of making payment from Vote 772 - \"Indian Education\".\n\nAttached hereto is letter from the Secretary of the Treasury Board, together with copy of letter from the Deputy Minister of Justice, dated the 10th instant, in connection with the above.\n\nKindly acknowledge receipt of this memorandum.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLegal Adviser\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Acting Director.\n\nWith reference to memorandum from Mr. Cory, dated November 25th, and attached letter from Mr. R.B. Bryce of the Treasury Board with copy of letter received by Treasury Board from the Department of Justice, I would say that I spoke to Mr. O'Call in this regard this morning and he asked that I get in touch with Mr. Smellie of the Treasury Board.\n\nMr. Smellie stated that our Legal Adviser or the Department of Justice should prepare the necessary wording in regard to the securing of an appropriation to enable us to pay to the Interest Account of the Blackfoot Band the amount owing for the construction of the Old Sun's School. It would appear that this will have to be a Special Item in our Annual Estimates, and not an item in the Vote for Indian Education or, it may possibly prove to be a Special Item in the Education Vote. I am not quite clear on that point. Mr. Smellie stated that we could include this item in the Further Supplementary Estimates, 1948-49, which we will have an opportunity of submitting in March next.\n\nI telephoned to Mr. Cory and he is prepared to take the matter up with the Department of Justice to ascertain just what should be done and what 'wording' or explanation will be required in order that we may properly submit the item in our Further Supplementary Estimates.\n\nMay I suggest that the attached correspondence be returned to Mr. Cory, with a copy of this memorandum, in order that he may advise us in the matter.\n\nThe item in the Indian Education Vote, Supplementary Estimates 1948-49, under the heading of \"Construction of Buildings, Works and Structures,\" amounting to $165,000 for the above mentioned purpose will lapse.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature] Wallen\nNovember 27, 1948.\n\nMr. Cory,\nLegal Adviser,\n\nRe: Reimbursement to Interest Fund of Blackfoot Band of Indians - Legality of making payment from Vote 772 - Indian Education.\n\nI should be pleased if you would take up with the Department of Justice on behalf of this branch the matter of how we may legally make the payment referred to above, and how provision for the necessary sum can be made in our Further Supplementary Estimates.\n\nI am returning to you Mr. Bryce's letter to the Deputy and copy of letter addressed to the Treasury Board by the Department of Justice, also a copy of a memorandum sent to me today by Miss Walton of this Branch. Will you kindly return to me Mr. Bryce's letter to the Deputy Minister and copy of the ruling of the Department of Justice with your reply?\n\nM. W.\n\nA./ Director, Indian Affairs Branch.\nOttawa, December 8, 1948.\n\nAttention: Mr. R. B. Bryce.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of November 22 an item has been included in the estimates for 1949-50 to provide for the repayment of the loan from the Band funds of the Blackfoot Indians, used in connection with the reconstruction of the Old Sun Indian Residential School. The wording suggested is as follows, and it is thought that it should overcome the legal obstacle to payment out of this year's appropriation:\n\n\"To re-imburse the Blackfoot Band of Indians for an expenditure in 1930 out of Band Funds for the reconstruction of the old Sun Residential School, with interest at 5 per cent per annum.\"\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\n\nThe Secretary,\nTreasury Board,\nDepartment of Finance,\nOttawa.\nDecember 14, 1948.\n\nConfidential\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nOld Sun Residential School\n\nThere is still considerable controversy with regard to the payment of the loan from the Band funds of the Blackfoot Indians used in connection with the construction of the Old Sun Residential School.\n\nI am advised that a decision has finally been reached and that an item has been included in the estimates for 1949-50 to provide for this repayment. A new wording is being used as follows and it is thought that it should overcome the legal obstacle to payment out of this year's appropriation:\n\n\"To re-imburse the Blackfoot Band of Indians for an expenditure in 1930 out of Band Funds for the reconstruction of the Old Sun Residential School, with interest at 5 per cent per annum.\"\n\nIn other words, while funds were voted this year, they were put in the wrong vote and it has been necessary to insert another item in next year's estimates so that legal difficulties can thus be overcome.\n\nBernard F.

For fifty-three years I have preached on the Blackfoot, Peigan and Blood Reserves. The people didn't believe in the Heavenly Father so I went around telling them about Him.\n\nI am getting old now. I can't get around very much anymore. I am glad to tell you how old I am. I am eighty-two years old.\n\nIt was very nice of you children to let me say a few words in your Year Book.

I guess we will be just as glad when its time to come back in September. We hope our dear native holiday and reunion will bring us faces. We will miss the boys and girls who will not be returning next Fall but we hope they will come back to see us, specially on Sundays for our Church services.

Of course, we often envied you enjoying your own room with private bathroom etc etc. I am glad there was a grade IX class this year and I hope my sisters will take your place in the future.\n\nOn behalf of the other graduates, I wish you well.

All this will come in handy some day when I leave school at the end of the term.\n\nWhen I was a little girl I thought school was fine because the girls were so friendly. But during the third year I tried to run away because I was homesick. I hope rest of you won't do as I did. Now I realize how important education is to all of us.\n\nDuring the days to come, this our first year book, will bring back to mind many pleasant memories.\n\nViolet Reweuter\n\nOUR PRINCIPAL'S INDIAN NAME\n\nOn November 11, 1948, when the Indians were gathered together for a memorial service, our Principal was given the Indian name of \"Blackfoot\". English Indians scan walkers came there on walks across the sky to keep us warm and to light the world. Mr. Cole walked among his Indian brothers to teach us to be Christians. The Senior pupils and some of the Staff were there at the time Rev. Cole was given his Blackfoot name.\n\nGrade 6\n\nREMEMBRANCE DAY - 1948\n\nOn November 11, 1948, the Blackfoot Indians held their first Remembrance service. They joined together in the Crewe Hall in memory of the boys who served in the second world war. They remembered especially Gordon Yellowsky, who lost his life in the Frontenac Mines. A wreath was placed on the grave of Gordon. All the men marched in as the drums rolled. Mrs. Old Woman carried the flag. Then there were some speeches and we sat praying and were silent for two minutes. Even the little children were quiet.\n\nGrade 6\n\nGIRLS' AUXILIARY\n\nThe word \"auxiliary\" means helping and that is what we try to do as members of the Girl's Auxiliary. We not only realize that we are making someone happy but we are training ourselves to be able to help others expecting no reward for doing so. We also learn to be better and take pride in our work.\n\nMost of us are interested to know what others are doing so Miss Hicks, our leader, reads to us and tells us about the many different branches of the G.A.\n\nEarlier in the fall a circle was a fantastic show for which every girl had to dress up. Miss Hicks borrowed a photograph and we were told to make costumes for the roles she had in mind.\n\nWe are always happy to have Miss Stearns, the superintendent of the G.A., come to visit us. She teaches us many songs that are new to us and we really have a great time when she is here.\n\nLast week we met here on Friday 10th and we realized over ninety dollars. The girls contributed towards buying the proceeds towards altar furnishings.\n\nWe have had a very fruitful year and have learned a great deal. I am sure all the graduates are sorry to leave. We only hope that next year the Girl's Auxiliary will be a success again.\n\nBeatrice Crowfoot\n\nA. Loving Heavenly Father, giver of life and light and power; give us hearts that love Thee, i.e. to love Thee, i.e. to serve Thee. Great God, we send all members of our Girls' Branches may be joyful messengers of Thy love wherever Thou dost call us. Bless Thy national schools so that they may be a blessing to all. May all the children, we with them, may be used to bring many souls to Thee. Teach us to do the things that please Thee, and show us where and how we best may serve and glorify Thee; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\nAs Girl Guides, we have many little duties to do in and out of school. We are proud to be part of the Order of Canada. Miss Vincennes is our Governor, Miss Captain Beatrice Crowfoot is our Company Leader. We have five different patrols, each with a leader and second.\n\nFour times a month we have our meetings in the dining room or sometimes we take field trips. During the early weeks of February and March we built a fire outside and made s'mores.\n\nOn 7th March, the Principal took us to a Guide rally at Celery. The Guides, Boy Scouts, Brownies, Cubs and Rangers from Celery were there. As we went through the hall, the Guides there were told to stand at attention. Then we took part in the Grand march. We stood at attention for two hours, at least it seemed that long. Later we were introduced to other Guides, where we started for home. Although the wind Mr Cole could hardly see to drive but we got home alright.\n\nOn 9th June, we were enrolled as Guides by the Bishop of the Calgary Diocese. We received our pins. The ceremony was held in front of the school. The wind was so strong our hats kept blowing off.\n\nNow even though none of us are graduating this year we will still be members of the Girl Guides.\n\nDelma Mayfield.\n\nCONFIRMATION\n\nOn Easter Sunday, the Bishop of Calgary came down to confirm thirty-eight of our boys and girls.\n\nThe girls wore white dresses with lace around the bottom. They looked very lovely.\n\nAfter the service our parents had lunch with us in the children's dining room. Our parents were very proud of us that night. The Bishop regretted that he could not stay to visit with us.\n\nWILLY COVETED MEMBERS OF OUR CHURCH\n\nMargarette Bouchard\nChristina Crawford\nJean Selvey\nMarina Crocker\nLila Sheehan\nValerie Benfield\nRosie Sanders\nPeggy Smith\nShirley Fraser\nRona Geil & Youngman\nBetty Craig\nDorothy Stevenson\nIna Rose Hays\nBecky Jane Haynes\nAnnette Yellow Old Woman\nBeatrice Turning Robe\nMary Lillian Cutter\nMarina Guder\n\nSolomon Bouchard\nParry Cox Ramsay\nFrancis Benfield\nErnest Sheehan\nRaymond Interchief\nRichard Medicine Traveller\nQuentin Craig\nPovesh White Elk\nGabriel Yellow Horse\nNicol McCarley\nBurton Blackmore\nAngus McMaster\nWilson Macleod\nFloyd Old Roman\nSamuel Lowhorn\nEddie Stevenson\nRobert Lowhorn\nMorris Brass\n\nO Jesus, Thou hast promised\nTo all who follow Thee,\nThat where Thou art in glory,\nThere shall I be also;\nAnd, Jesus!

It was a grand one too. There were quite a number of us who masqueraded. There were two funny horses. The girls' horse had a chuck wagon behind it. Betty was dressed as a native of India. There were two girls who really made us laugh. They were dressed as ghosts and they danced and pranced all over the place. The main prizes went to these people.\n\nOur parents, Mr. and Mrs. Pugh and Linda, Mrs. Oliver, Dr. and Mrs. Hoepel joined in our fun. We played games and danced. Sonny and Henry were in costume and did the children dance for us. After lunch we went up to our dormitories and quickly donned off to sleep.\n\nCHRISTMAS\n\nOn the Sunday before we went home for our Christmas holidays we put on our first White Gift Service. The senior pupils each made or bought a gift for the service. All the children brought some money in their envelopes from every country of Europe. We were very proud when we took our gifts to the front of the Chapel. We had our first concert this year but we had a little concert on the eve before we went home, the grade nine had a \"surprise party\" for the Stars. They invited Mr. and Mrs. Oliver, Mr. and Mrs. Evans, Dr. and Mrs. Hoepel, Mr. and Mrs. Marshall, Miss Watkins, Cpl. and Mrs. Yates (continued on next page)\n\nMr. Yates Sr., and all the senior boys and girls. As the guests entered the dining room, they were given paper hats. There was a short program and Miss Claus introduced the seniors. Then the seniors presented us to the sitting room where they were served by the grade nine girls. Mr. Pugh and Dr. Hoepel stayed and visited with the children until they were all seated for lunch. The tables were set festively with candles on each one. On the head table was our Christmas cake.\n\nThe following day we had our concert again for our parents and the juniors. The little ones sang for us as well. Yes, and Santa found time to pay us another visit.\n\nVALENTINE'S DAY\n\nOn Valentine's Day the Girl Guides put on a party. Miss Decker and our Governors helped us get things together. We sent invitations to the Stars. Jennifer Thomas and Arthur Whitelock were chosen Queen and King of Hearts and they gave out the valentines. We played several games. Miss White played the piano for us and was an expert pianist.\n\nWe had lunch and then danced, played more games and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. Then the boys sang, \"Good-night Ladies\" and we didn't dance and went to bed.\n\nWINTER BOATS\n\nIn April we had our first winter boat of the year. We had our bonfire on the girl's playground. It was such a big one that the police thought the school was on fire.\n\nWe sat on benches around the fire and sang songs. The next thing we knew, we were running in. It was showering. Presently we came out again. Then we had our \"hot dogs\" and apples. The juniors went to bed early.\n\nDelma, Dorothy, and Marjorie sang \"The Old Rugged Cross\". Everyone was so quiet as they sang this beautiful old song.\n\nThen the boys played the drums and sang while we danced around the bonfire. Mr. Cole really was funny! Before we went in we sang \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" to Mr. Cole. We always appreciate that Mr. Cole and the Staff do for us.\n\nCecelia Yellow Old Woman.\nSPORTS\n\nThe rink was not ready in time for skating last winter but we managed to get down to see a few fast hockey games in Glencoe.\n\nAs soon as the snow had gone the boys and girls were \"itchy\" to play soft ball. We had some good games after tea and after supper.\n\nOn May 28th, the children all walked down to participate in a field day with other schools at Glencoe, Glengarry and Dwyer. As usual Mr. G. hired two trucks to bring us home for dinner and take us back for the afternoon. Teddy Yellowly brought us back again at four o'clock. Several of the pupils won prizes. Tim Sherron, David Yellowly and Rachel Langbein won Honors. Tim was outstanding in the Pole-vaulting event.\n\nOn June 4th Tim, David and Rachel went down to compete with some other schools. They again won some ribbons.\n\nLila Healey\nWe enjoy the shows that we have every Tuesday evening. The ones we liked best this year were \"Tom Brown's School Days\", \"Let There Be Music\", and \"Breaking the Ice\". We always enjoy shows with that wonderful singer Bobby Breen. Everyone will be looking forward to the shows again in September.\n\nMiss DeGroot taught the older girls some shell craft on Wednesday nights. The sets they made are lovely.\n\nOur school paper was well on the way to being published but because of circumstances that could not be helped, it was never completed. However, it will be published regularly next term.\n\nThe tuck-shop was opened in February but has been closed for the last few weeks. Selina and Patty were in charge. There were apples, chocolate bars, candy, peanuts and soda biscuits for sale. Everyone lined up in the hall and waited for their turn to be served. We are glad to have a canteen in school and we hope it will open again in September.\n\nWe had a lovely surprise when we came back to school after the Easter holidays. Mr. Cole had bought two radios for the boys' and girls' playgrounds. We enjoy them so much that we often would rather stay in and listen than go out to play - but we must have our fresh air!\n\nBeatrice, Evelyn, and Lila brought the smallest boys and girls who couldn't speak English their Sunday School lessons. We are sure they must be very good teachers.\n\nMr. Hugh comes around at least once a month to see our school. He always has a big smile for us. We are no longer shy of him. One time he went into the kitchen just as Miss Twigg was taking some burnt cookies out of the oven.\n\nGrades five and six.\nCHIEF CROWFOOT\n\nThe warm sun was shining brightly on Sunday afternoon, 26th September, 1948, when we, one hundred and twenty-one pupils of Old Sun, started to walk to the Crowfoot Hall. This day was the occasion of the unveiling of a monument by Mr. Crowfoot, a great grandson of Chief Crowfoot. Those taking part in the ceremony were seated on a long platform including our late Head Chief, President of Long Island University, Dr. Robert B. Gordon, M.D., of Medicine Hill. Both Trude and Ileana and Senator Gertshaw told us something of the history of Chief Crowfoot. It seems the old Chief had been very powerful in war, but the white man came and took his land away when he signed the Treaty in 1877 he never went to fight again and was a good man of peace from that day until his death in 1890. The Indians were drawn in our native homes and the whites came closely here, a very good advice and told us we should try to live a life as good as Chief Crowfoot did after he became a Christian.\n\nBeatrice and Christine Crowfoot, Valerie Beaton and Norman Mohan were present at the unveiling. After the Ceremonies they went over to the home of Superintendent and Mrs. Pugh's to assist in serving tea to the people from Calgary and the Indian Children who came from the nearby reserve, Rocky View, the Towne Brothers. We came back after the Ceremony and saw a lot of people looking over our school, they even watched us serve supper.\n\nDelma Harfield\n\nThe monument reads:\n\n\"Great Chief of the Blackfoot Confederacy. Born about 1830, died 25th April 1890. Fearless in war, but lover of Peace, he promoted unity among the Tribes of the Plains and friendship with the White Man. He surrendered his Elected Chiefs and the Great Title to their tribal lands in 1877, began to adopt a sedentary life, and remained loyal during the North-West Rebellion in 1885. His nobility of character, his gift of oratory and his wisdom in council gained for him the title, 'The Father of His People.'\"\n\nThe R.C.M.P. invited us down to see some films that they showed in the Gleichen Community Hall. The main picture was \"Scarlet and Gold\" - all about the life of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. There was also a reel on the strange animals of Australia. We all enjoyed the evening very much.\n\nWe have enjoyed many good BROADCASTS on the radio that Miss Willson gave us. The two we enjoyed most were \"Western Getaways\" and \"Listening Musicians\".\n\nThe boys have been down to the river two or three times for a SWIM. There is nothing like a \"duck in the water to cool one off.\"\n\nThe girls haven't been swimming but we have had some nice long walks. One very hot Sunday afternoon, we walked down to the Stampede grounds. We were so hot and weary, we didn't know how we were ever going to be back. But Mr. Holmby's truck came along sight unseen and we were glad when he killed his horse and gave us all a ride home! We surely did appreciate that ride. It was the first time we were cool that day.\n\nMrs. YATES has kindly given much of her time in training the choir and playing the organ on Sundays for our Chapel Services. We all appreciate this very much.\n\nMR. COLE AND CANON COCK went down to Oklahoma to attend a conference. We hope they enjoyed themselves and aren't too tired after their trip.\n\nMR. COLE SR. and MR. CHENELLS made a really good job of our chapel house when they were visiting us. We hope they enjoyed their visits. We always like to see Mr. CHENELLS for she always has a smile for us.\n\nWe were very lucky this year that we had so little SICKNESS in our school. Of course we had some cases of the \"flue\" but compared to other places we can't complain.\n\nWhen Miss WATKINS' foot gets better she is going to nurse again in our hospital. We hope her coming back men as she likes us. DR. HIOPEL is always a welcome visitor even though he does \"poke\" us with a needle sometimes.\nThe following is an article that was written in the \"Indian Voice,\" a newspaper of the Indians of B.C.\n\n**Canadian Indian Girls Train in New Zealand**\n\nTwo Canadian Indian girls have recently made an important step in the world of Indian welfare when they journeyed to take up their studies in maternity nursing in far off New Zealand. Miss Norah Scowen from Saskatchewan and Miss Dorcas Oberton from Alberta are now students at St. Helen's Hospital, Wellington, N.Z., where they will undergo special two years' course in their chosen field of nursing.\n\nThe girls have already had a year's training in their chosen profession at the Canadian Mothercraft Hospital at Toronto.\n\nIt is interesting to know that the curriculum used at St. Helen's Hospital embraces the methods of the late Sir Truby King which he developed at parliament schools as far advanced in their medical fields as they were the private factor in New Zealand at the top of the list for better babies and low mortality for years.\n\nThe two Canadian girls will be in direct contact with the most progressive Native race in the world. The Maori race of New Zealand has shown the world that they are able to hold their own in this world today. These natives have not only members of Parliament; they also have their own entire members in many of the leading professions in that sister Dominion.\n\nThe most encouraging angle of the whole picture regarding our progressive-minded girls is their proved determination to work among their own people when they return to Canada.\n\n---\n\nThe 75th Anniversary of the City of Winnipeg was celebrated on 6th June. They invited about sixty Blackfoot Indians down. Our Indians were the only ones invited. They took horses and tipis with them...\n\nShirley McHugh.\n\nMy Trip to Winnipeg.\n\nI'm very glad to go to Winnipeg but I was homesick for my Mother. We arrived in Winnipeg on 3rd June. I didn't know where the station was so I followed the others and found it underneath. The Winnipeg streets are very much wider than the Calgary streets. I'm not homesick anymore because I'm not so tired at night. It was very hot, too. Some of the white people were friendly and kind to us.\n\nWe went to the city park on Saturday and surely enjoyed ourselves. We went dancing and Simon Big Snake gave a speech.\n\nLast Sunday we all went to All Saints Church. I had my Communion there. In the afternoon we went to St Luke's Church for our confirmation service.\n\nWell, I sure had a good time at Winnipeg but I missed a lot of school work and am glad to be home again. I think this is the first time I've been away from school for so long. I would like to thank my Principal for letting me go with my Father who is a Chief.\n\nValerie Backfat.\nALONE WITH MY THOUGHTS\n\nHarriette Lowhorn\n\nSpring is here,\nAll the grass turns green,\nTrees are in blossom again,\nMusic of the birds,\nPerfume of the flowers,\nWind softly moving through the trees,\nEverywhere it is beautiful,\nAnimals around are friendly,\nThe dew will softly fall.\n\nFriends love each other,\nThey keep their secrets, and won't tell,\nIf a friend turns into an enemy,\nYour secrets will unfurl,\nPeople get vexed with you,\nThe whole world will know.\n\nA lover one dies,\nOnly loneliness and sadness now,\nThe grave.\nSometime God calls us home,\nWe will be happy again,\nNo more weeping,\nSmiles\u2014happy and gay forever.\n\nTHE GRADUATION BANQUET\n\nDo not think that when you put your books away you have finished your education; you start to learn when you finish school. This was the keynote of the address by the Very Reverend G.B. Small, Dean of the Cathedral of the Calgary Episcopate, to the Old Sun Graduates at our first annual banquet, held last night, June 25th.\n\nMrs. R. Axon, with Mrs. Brown from London, England, presented the prizes. The prizes and special prizes were awarded to the following pupils for being always punctual: Misses Margaret MacKenzie, Helen Big Old Man, Morris Brecker, Inn Rose Mangheela, Joanna Watersfield and Rosella A. Young Man. In her address, Mrs. Axon urged the Graduates not to let apathy get the better of them, perseverance is one of the things we need to attain success in our daily lives. In order to help further the cause of the Graduates, presented Mrs. Axon with a piece of embroidery work done by the Infant Department of the school.\n\nThe highlight of the evening was the valedictory address given by Beatrice Crosette. Beatrice spoke to the boys and girls who will be returning in September. \"We have had our ups and downs in this school but we will always will, love Old Sun. We hope to see you back once, especially on Sundays to help us out in our Social Dance.\" On behalf of the Graduates, Beatrice thanked the Principal and Staff for their many kindnesses during their years at Old Sun.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Pugh and Linda were our other guests at this dinner. We are very sorry Mr. and Mrs. Pugh and Linda were not with us. Also our very good friend and catechist Paul Little Walker, was unable to attend due to his recently diagnosed serious illness.\n\nIn his opening remarks, the Principal pointed out he had received a letter from the Bishop expressing his regrets at being unable to be with us. We look forward to having him back and Mrs. Hopper, Misses Hagg and Misses Scott, who were away serving in the camps whose names appear above, Mr. Cole had already given his farewell message to the Graduates on the previous Sunday.\n\nThe dining hall was decorated with the school colours and the finishing touch was added to the tables by miniature teapots well designed and painted\u2014complete with poles\u2014by the \"little ones\" in the Junior class. The graduates sat at a table for the evening and sang our\u66f2\u76ee. They sang \"Button and Bone\" and \"Cruising Down the River\". Mrs. Yates sang a solo accompanied on the piano by Mrs. Hopper. In between, the \"gang\" enjoyed Community singing but none as good as the Junior grades when they sang \"I'll Will\" and hymn, \"Any in A Hunger\".\n\nThis happy evening concluded with \"O Canada\" and the National Anthem. Dean Small gave the benediction.\n\n* * * * *\nDo You Remember...\n\nWhen the boys brought the baby engines from the sand hills?\nWhen you didn't come back to school on time?\nWhen David Yellow Horse ran into an iron girder, head on?\nWhen Arthur White Elk and Jen were chosen King & Queen of Hearts at our Valentine party?\nThe day the boys started to serve supper and how they are improvising?\nHow everyone laughed when Mr. Tutte sang, \"K-I-N-Katie\"?\nWhen the girls gave Miss Hicks a new hair-do?\nThe fun we have getting ready for parties, especially just before a holiday?\nWhen Moreen melted the pudding instead of the meat & vegetables?\nThe mess Patsy & Selina made of the sewing room when they made their horse for the Halloween party?\nWhen Joan cut up good boys pants for patching?\nWhen the boys put a live mouse in Beatrice's desk?\nWhen the boys, playing at stampede, used Donald's neck instead of a calf's?\nWhen the Principal hit the gravel trunk with his car and got cut alive?\nIt costs the boys fifty-cents every time they break a window.\nWhen we just about came out on top at the Gleichen Sports day?\n\nHELLO FOLKS!\n\nThis is Howard and Leonard reporting on the Blackfoot Indian Stampede. We went there last week took a holiday and went to see \"them fellas ride\". It was the finest show I ever saw. A big crowd turned up. There were over one hundred cars alone.\n\nSome of the Indians rode steers. We knew some of the cowboys from the States. Most of them got \"bucked off\" their horses.\n\nIn the evening there was a dance held at Gleichen. It lasted until 3:00 A.M. Boy, were we over sleepy next day!\n\nWell, so long folks! Be seeing you at the Calgary Stampede.\nLord, dismiss us with thy blessing,\nThanks for mercies past receive;\nPardon our faults confessing;\nTime that's lost may all retrieve;\nMay thy children\nNever again thy Spirit grieve.\n\nBless thou all our days of leisure;\nHelp us selfish lusts to flee;\nShow us every plenteous;\nPure and blameless may it be;\nMay our gladness\nDraw us evermore to thee.\n\nBy thy kindly influence cherish\nAll the good we have obtained;\nMay our hearts of grace enrich\nBy thy mightier power restrained;\nSeek we ever\nKnowledge pure and unconfined.\n\nLet thy father-hand be shielding\nAll who here shall meet no more;\nMay their once-time past be yielding\nYear by year a richer store;\nThose returning,\nMake more faithful than before.\n\nAmen.\n\nEDITORS' NOTE\n\nAs this is our first year book, we have not attempted to make it a long one. We hope there will be more and better ones to come.\n\nWe wish to thank you all for your co-operation in preparing our Year Book.

School Prizes.\n\nSuperintendent stated that he had been asked by principals of Old Sun and Crowfoot if the Band would consider grant of $25.00 for each school to be awarded to school pupils as prizes the same as in previous years.

Educational Facilities on the Blackfoot Reserve.\n\nSimon Big Snake asked what was the educational plans on the Blackfoot Reserve. Sup't stated that at Crowfoot School a number of day pupils would be admitted and they would have to walk to school and Father Charbon had an excellent staff in prospect, practically the same as last year.\n\nOld Sun School - Sup't stated that through certain changes accommodation for all the Anglican pupils had been made for this fall. Rev. Cole expected a full staff of teachers.\n\nHigher Education - Sup't reported that the Department is acting very favourably to this and further grant has been allowed for higher education when they carry it on, at the Reserve Schools.\n\n(Sgd.) W.F.B. Pugh,\nSuperintendent.\nMr. W.B.H. Pugh,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nGleichen, Alta.\n\nOld Sun Indian Residential School\nGrade IX Pupils\n\nThe report of the Alberta Superintendent of Schools concerning the classroom work at the Old Sun school has recently been received. It is stated therein that pupils in Grades five to eight inclusive received only half-time classroom instruction, and that this arrangement leaves much to be desired.\n\nIt is noted, moreover, that Grade nine classes were being conducted in the school. In the circumstances it appears advisable to arrange that no pupils above Grade eight should receive their classroom instruction in this school but should go to the nearest available Provincial, Intermediate and High School.\n\nWill you, therefore, make the necessary investigations at once and return answers to the following questions:\n\n(1) How many pupils in grades above Grade eight are enrolled at the Old Sun Residential School?\n\n(2) Are they Day pupils or boarders?\n\n(3) Is there accommodation for them in Gleichen High School?\n\n(4) What extra costs will their attendance at Gleichen High School entail?\n\nIt is the practice, wherever possible, to encourage the attendance of pupils above Grade eight at well organized...\nHigh Schools rather than to attempt their instruction in Residential schools which must necessarily be staffed and equipped with emphasis placed upon elementary education. Such High School pupils continue, if necessary, to be domiciled in the Residential school, which receives for each such child the usual per capita grant. The Indian Superintendent by arrangement with the Department pays any additional amount involved to the parties concerned.\n\nYou may inform the Reverend Principal of the Department's wishes in this matter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nATTENTION: Education Division\n\nRE: Old Sun Indian Residential School - Grade 9 Pupils\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of September 9th and regret my delay in replying to same. In the meantime the local inspector of the Alberta Provincial Government of schools, Mr. Larson, has made a recent inspection of the school and is fully conversant with the conditions. No doubt you have received a report in this connection.\n\nMay I suggest that matters rest (status quo), in so far I think there is being done a very good educational job by the Rev. Cole and his staff.\n\nI understand Major Clark is in the district and will be calling here before he returns east. Trust that you will bear with me in this matter.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nW.P.B. Pugh\nSuperintendent\nOctober 27, 1949.\n\nMr. W. P. B. Pugh,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nGleichen, Alberta.\n\nOld Sun Indian Residential School.\n\nReference your 10/6-5 of October 20\n\nWe note that this matter will be discussed with Major Clark and that a decision will be reached with regard to these pupils.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nBFN/EM\nMEMORANDUM\n\nFROM\n\nTO\n\nDate\n\nAn effort will be made however, to obtain teachers holding qualifications higher than the minimum. It is expected that teachers will be obtained who hold the Senior certificate together with a university degree in the proper field.\n\n(7) Expenditures Involved.\n\nIt would appear reasonable that the expense to be borne by each school authority should vary directly according to the instruction time received. That is to say, if the Indian Schools received two days of instruction time per week - then they should pay two-fifths of the instruction costs.\n\nEstimated costs are listed below -\n\n| Teachers salary (Boys) | $3000.00 |\n|------------------------|----------|\n| \" (Girls)              | $3000.00 |\n| Total Salary           | $6000.00 |\n\nCost to Indian Agency -\n\n| Salary | $2400.00 |\n|--------|----------|\n| Travelling expenses to Indian Schools | $100.00 |\n| Total | $2500.00 |\n\nTo this must be added the cost of equipment. It is understood however, that the Indian Schools already have some of this equipment on hand. Please note - the above costs are estimates only.\n\nIn order that proper plans for this instructional circuit may be completed for next year, it is necessary to come to an early decision on this matter. A definite decision should be made in December 1949 before the Board prepares its annual budget. If, therefore, the Indian schools or the Indian Agency are interested in cooperating with the Bow Valley School Division in carrying out the proposals noted above, a definite commitment to this effect should be submitted to the Board of the Bow Valley School Division before February 15, 1950, if at all possible.\n\nYour early attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated by the Board.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nO. P. Larson,\nSuperintendent of Schools.\n(2) Grades Involved\n\nThe Department of Education recommends that these courses be offered only to pupils enrolled in Grade VII and up. However, since many of the pupils attending the Indian Schools may be a little older for their grade than those attending provincial schools, and since the Indian Schools do not come under the jurisdiction of the provincial Department of Education, it is possible that it may be practical to offer these courses in the Indian Schools to pupils from Grade VI and up.\n\n(3) Class Enrolment.\n\nThe average class in Farm and Home Mechanics and in Home Economics may vary from 15-20 pupils. It should not exceed 20. With this in mind the number of classes required in each school can easily be determined.\n\n(4) Instruction Time at each Centre.\n\nThis of course will depend on the number of classes in each centre. It is probable, however, that the time spent at each centre by the two teachers will be as follows:\n\n- Cluny - 1\u00bd days.\n- Arrowwood - 1 day.\n- Hussar - \u00bd day.\n- Crowfoot Indian School - 1 day.\n- Old Sun Indian School - 1 day.\n\nIt should be borne in mind that each class, whether in provincial schools or Indian Schools, will receive equal instruction time, which must meet the standards laid down by the Department of Education.\n\n(5) Equipment Required.\n\nIt is expected that each school authority will provide its own equipment. This should include a suitable room to carry on class activities together with at least a minimum list of tools and equipment. A suggested list of equipment may be obtained on request.\n\n(6) Qualifications of Instructors.\n\nThe qualifications of the teachers engaged must meet the requirements laid down by the provincial Department of Education. The minimum requirement calls for the Junior Certificate in Industrial Arts in order to offer instruction in Farm and Home Mechanics, and for the Junior Certificate in Home Economics to offer instruction in Home Economics. Together with this the teacher must hold the proper teaching certificate for the grades concerned.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nFROM O. P. Larson,\nTO Mrs W.P.B. Pugh,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nGLEICHEN, Alberta.\n\nDate Brooks, Alberta.\nDecember 8, 1949.\n\nProposed Circuit,\nFarm and Home Mechanics, and Home Economics.\n\nThe following information is submitted on behalf of the Board of Trustees of the Bow Valley School Division, #43, Cluny, Alberta.\n\nThe Board has recently been giving some consideration to the possibility of establishing a circuit in Farm and Home Mechanics and Home Economics for the next school year. This will mean that full time teachers in Farm and Home Mechanics and another in Home Economics will be engaged. They will travel from one centre to another and offer instruction in their respective fields.\n\nIt is understood that the Indian Agency in Gleichen, under the Department of Indian Affairs, has indicated a desire to cooperate with the Bow Valley School Division in this matter in order that courses in Farm and Home Mechanics for the boys and Home Economics for the girls may be offered in the Crowfoot Indian School and the Old Sun Indian School. If this materializes it is proposed to offer these courses in the following centres - Cluny, Arrowwood, Hussar, Crowfoot Indian School in Cluny, and the Old Sun Indian School in Gleichen.\n\nFurther data in regard to the operation of this circuit is indicated below -\n\n(1) Instruction Time.\n\nThe instruction time allotted to each course must meet the time requirement as laid down by the Department of Education of the Province of Alberta. This calls for a total instruction time of \u00bd day per week for each class of Farm and Home Mechanics and for each class of Home Economics.\n\nNormally, class periods in academic subjects are from 30-35 minute duration. These are held daily and will therefore total about \u00bd day per week. Class periods in Farm and Home Mechanics or Home Economics, however, are usually of \u00bd day duration as it is not practical and feasible to have shorter periods in such courses.\n\nThe total instruction time per week required of the teacher in Farm and Home Mechanics at each centre or school, will therefore depend on the number of classes receiving instruction. If there is only one class of boys then a half day per week is sufficient to meet standard instruction requirements. If two classes are present then one whole day is required of the teacher. The same is true for Home Economics.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nATTENTION: Mr. B. F. Neary\n\nRE: Proposed Circuit Farm and Home Mechanics and Home Economics\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from Mr. O. P. Larson, Superintendent of the Bow Valley School District, Cluny, Alberta. The letter is exceptionally comprehensive as Mr. Larson and I discussed the matter last week and there is nothing I can add. I might say I think it is a splendid opportunity for us to get the right kind of instruction in Farm and Home Mechanics and Home Economics at these two Indian Schools and this start, if allowed, may lead to much further and better development between the outside schools and our Indian schools, which is much to be desired. I can do nothing better than strongly recommend the acceptance. Trusting that your good office can do likewise and arrange for the costs.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Larson would like a decision at the beginning of February 1950.\n\nRespectfully submitted\n\nW.P.B. Pugh\nSuperintendent\nDecember 1st, 1949.\n\nMr. W.P.B. Pugh,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nGleichen, Alta.\n\nRE: Proposed Circuit\nFarm and Home Mechanics, and Home Economics\n\nReference your 10H-25-7 of December 10\n\nI have discussed the contents of your letter of December 10 with Mr. Doucet, our Supervisor of Vocational Training. We are both in agreement with the general principle of the proposals made and feel that this is a good solution to the problem of Vocational Training at both these schools.\n\nThere are two points which I would like to have more information about before putting these proposals forward to the Director.\n\n(a) Have both Principals been consulted concerning these proposals and are they both in agreement?\n\n(b) The Sisters at the Crowfoot School are presumably teaching Home Economics now. It is suggested you consult with them and when the teacher is appointed, efforts be made to follow a coordinated programme.\n\nBernard V. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nI am in agreement with the m/n proposition as a temporary measure; I do, however, consider a full time Farm Mechanics instructor would be more efficacious. I am sure we agree that an instructor reporting for classes once weekly may experience some difficulty in getting the necessary response from the Indian pupils. The personality of an Indian teacher is all important.\n\nInsofar as the Home Economics are concerned the senior girls in this school, as in others, do enjoy a thorough training in general 'housekeeping and cooking'.\n\nI assume the Indian Affairs Branch are cognizant of the inadequacy of any outbuilding to serve as a manual training shop at this school and complete lack of working provisions in the main building for Home Economics, apart, of course, from the kitchen.\n\nE.S.W. Cole,\nPrincipal.\nDec. 22nd 1949\n\nMr. W. P. Pugh,\nGlacier Alta.\n\nDear Mr. Pugh,\n\nI fully endorse your policy and Ottawa's policy regarding the proposed Farm and Home Mechanics & Home Economics course at our school next year.\n\nThis training is very adequate to prepare the children for a true home life on the reserve in future years.\n\nI did all I could to find a qualified teacher for this course - but to no avail.\n\nThe sisters welcome the qualified Home Economics teacher - and it will be easier to have a followed and well coordinated programme.\n\nYou may rest assured of my cooperation, and I hope that the department will readily furnish us the equipment and local, to establish firmly these courses.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. Harston, M.S.,\nprincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nATTENTION: Mr. Bernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nRE: Proposed farm and home mechanics\nand Home Economics\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of December 14th last raising two points in connection with the above:\n\n(A) Have both Principals been consulted concerning these proposals and are they both in agreement? For your information I have kept this matter constantly before the two principals, and when I received Mr. Larson's letter of December 8th I sent them a copy of that together with my covering letter dated December 10th 1949, both to Old Sun School and Crowfoot School.\n\n(B) The Sisters at the Crowfoot School are presumably teaching Home Economics now. When I received your letter of December 14th I sent a copy to both principals asking for their written comments which I herewith attach their original answers, which Father Charron answers your question \"B\".\n\nYou will notice Father Charron, Principal of the Crowfoot School is very enthusiastic about the proposed set-up and always has been, in fact we have worked very close in this matter.\n\nIn regards to Rev. Cole's letter, I think Rev. Cole of the Old Sun School is probably just a little nervous of breaking into something like this, but I have\npointed out to him that it will definitely appeal to the Indians and I think will be of great advantage to his school and I know it will increase the prestige of both schools with the Indians, in so far that a teacher teaching at white schools in the proposed set-up will also be teaching at our Indian schools.\n\nFor your information I will not leave a stone unturned to see that this matter is a success.\n\nIn regards to Rev. Cole's closing paragraph in which he points out the shortage of space, the Department have had this pointed out to them, and no doubt some building programme will be likely started at both schools this coming spring.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nW.P.B. Pugh\nSuperintendent\n\nWPBP/EB\n29 December, 1949.\n\nMr. W.F.B. Pugh,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nGlenbow, Alberta.\n\nVocational Training - Old Sun and Crossfoot Indian Residential Schools.\n\nReference your 104-35-7 of 23 December.\n\nWe are pleased to receive your report of December 23 with attached letters from Father Charbonneau and the Reverend Mr. Cole. I have discussed this matter with Mr. Doucet again and he feels that this proposed circuit is a worthwhile experiment. I believe that he has written already with regard to the list of equipment which will be required.\n\nI attach a draft letter to the Secretary of the Bow Valley School Division, which I believe will cover the requirements mentioned in Mr. Larson's letter of December 8. You might discuss this matter with Mr. Larson and if the draft letter is satisfactory, then an official letter will be sent to the Secretary of the School Division.\n\nI note that Mr. Cole, in his letter, states that he does not have a manual training shop at his school. Mr. Doucet informs me that two buildings, former Indian houses, were moved some four years ago, one to each school. These buildings were to be used as manual training shops and we would appreciate a report from you as to what is being done with these two buildings.\n\nYou might also discuss with Mr. Larson as to how he wishes the payments made to the Bow Valley School Division. The usual procedure is to submit a voucher at the end of each month or quarter, reading as follows: \"To Manual training and domestic science instruction at the Old Sun and Crossfoot Residential School .... $ ....\"\n\nBernard F.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days in residence.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1934.\n\nPrincipal: John W.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of pupils.\"\n\n9. The amount of quarterly per capita grant is assessed by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: John W. House\n\nDated: January 14, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n| BROTHER NUMBER | NAME OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DAYS OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|----------------|---------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 171            | Amy Breeden   | 11  | 1   |      | Blackfoot      |                   | Farming Capable         | 3-4-35                    | 92 58      |\n| 172            | George Fox    | 11  | 1   |      |                |                   |                          | 4-2-35                    | 92 30      |\n| 173            | Allen M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is obtained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Old Sun School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1962.\n\nPrincipal: John W. House\n\nDated: April 6, 1962\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 103...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present in all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pegging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is determined by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per pupil grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per pupil grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Old Sun School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1940.\n\nPrincipal: John W. House\n\nDated: Jan 14, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pacing it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 20th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils are attending during quarter means the total number of days in which each of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Old Sun School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1941.\n\nPrincipal: John W. House\n\nDated April 3rd, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ........................................... this ........................................... 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Old Swan School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1941.\n\nPrincipal: John W. House\n\nDated: July 25, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRep.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the feet thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present during the quarter by all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by shifting the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Old Sun Alta School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1941.\n\nPrincipal: John W. House\n\nDated: Oct 17, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ...........................................\n\nthis ........................................... 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L.A. 403\n\nRep.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of quarterly grant to be paid for quarter is determined by multiplying the \"Average attendance during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Old Sun School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1941.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: ___________________________ 19 _____\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated: ___________________________ 19 _____\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Old Sun School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated ........................................... 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ........................................... this ........................................... 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L A 403\nRev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant allowed is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Old Sure School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated:\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is obtained by dividing the aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return, the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Old Sault School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1912.\n\nPrincipal: John W.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Old Sun School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Blackfoot Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Old Swan School at Blackfoot Reserve for Quarter ended December 31, 1942.**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDARD OF CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 195             | Benjamin Swallow | 9   | 1   | 0   | 6th Grade      | 12                  | Turning Woodwork       | 1 - 10 - 38                 | 92         |\n| 196             | John Ross       | 11  | 1   | 0   | 6th Grade      | 12                  |                        | 260                         | 92         |\n| 197             | Henry Blackfoot | 10  | 1   | 0   | 6th Grade      | 12                  |                        | 200                         | 92         |\n| 198             | Paul Carre      | 11  | 1   | 0   | 6th Grade      | 12                  |                        | 250                         | 92         |\n| 199             | Gordon Y.O.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' attendance of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per pupil grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entering the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance per capita during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Old Sun School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated:\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM L.A. 403\nRep.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Old Sun School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated:\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of quarterly grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Old Sun School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1943.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated: this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupil in residence during quarter means the total number of days attended by all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Old Sun School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT of the Old Sun School at Gleichen on Blackfoot Reserve for Quarter ended March 31, 1944**\n\n| REPORT NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDARD IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|---------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 197           | Henry Rockfat   | 11  | 25  | 40   | Blackfoot      | 16 3 28 9 8 17 8 | Task Board             | 1 - 10-38                | 91 32 5    |\n| 198           | Cecil Currie    | 12  |     |      |                |                   | Farming, Domestic      | 1 - 2-39                  | 91 32 5    |\n| 199           | Gordon Y.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and union at the Old Swan School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal John W. House\n\nDated April 5, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, ending it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Days pupils in residence during quarter\" for each quarter.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Old School School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated:\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of the attendance of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the total number of days in quarter.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 26th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days attended by all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\nThe amount per capita grant due for quarter is determined by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 26th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Old Swan School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The estimated per capita grant due for quarter is calculated by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Old School School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 103\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance during quarter is calculated by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, should any deduction be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, so called under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, putting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 30th March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils mentioned on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the average attendance of pupils by the rate of grant per quarter per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Old Church School School for the Quarter ended January 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Blackfoot Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Old Sure School at Blackfoot on Blackfoot Reserve for Quarter ended June 30, 1946**\n\n| BROTHER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n|                |                 |     |     |      |                |                   |                          |                             |            |\n\n### Totals\n\n- **Total number of days in Quarter:** 91\n- **Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during Quarter:** 9078\n- **Average attendance of pupils during Quarter:** 99.758\n\n### Amount of per capita grant due for Quarter:\n\n\\[ \\text{Amount} = \\frac{\\text{Total}}{\\text{Number of Days}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total} = 9078 \\times 4.25 = 38,710 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Amount} = \\frac{38,710}{91} = 426.62 \\]\n\n**Note:** Additions to be correctly made and entered at the foot of column.\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DAYS OF RESIDENCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n|                 |                 |     |     |      |               |                   |                          |                             |            |\n| 164             | Billy A.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under each pupil's name for the period covered by the Return.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Old School School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nBLACKFOOT AGENCY\n\nDated at NOV 1 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entering the Return and is calculated by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nNOTE:\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter for all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case will any grant be paid for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days attended by all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of stipend grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate of grant per pupil per day. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Old Sure School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per pupil grant due for quarter is determined by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate fixed for the quarter. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Old Sure School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal John W. House\n\nDated Oct 15, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In cases where adjustments may be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is calculated by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall any school be liable for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the BLACKFOOT (Old Sun) School for the Quarter ended OLD SUN 1948.\n\nDated 8/4/48\n\nPrincipal: Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on this Return and must be obtained by adding the column under heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will pupils be paid more than the average attendance of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the OLD SUN School for the Quarter ended June 20, 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 28/6/48\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

foot of column.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per pupil grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the OLD SUN School for the Quarter ended September 30 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 9 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nW.F.B.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in the quarter of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case will grants be paid for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return, the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Old Sun River School for the Quarter ended 31st Dec., 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 1-1-1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA. 603\n\nR. 3608\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT OF the Old Sun Indian Residential School at Gleichen on Blackfoot Reserve for Quarter ended 31st December / 1948**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | SEX | CLASS OR STUDY | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DAY OF ENTRANCE INTO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|----------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 0860            | Turning Robe, Susie. | 8   | X   | \"              |                         | 6/9/48                      | 92         |\n| 0861            | Old Woman, Daisy. | 7   | X   | \"              |                         | 11/9/48                     | 92         |\n| 0862            | Royal, Roma.     | 7   | X   | \"              |                         | 18/9/48                     | 92         |\n| 0863            | Maryhaden, Rachel.| 7   | X   | \"              |                         | 25/9/48                     | 92         |\n| 0864            | Black, Elsie.    | 8   | X   | \"              |                         | 30/9/48                     | 92         |\n| 0865            | Waterchief, Joanne.| 7  | X   | \"              |                         | 25/9/48                     | 92         |\n| 0866            | Lewhorn, Rachel. | 7   | X   | \"              |                         | 26/9/48                     | 92         |\n| 0867            | A.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under \"Days in residence\" for each pupil.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the OLD SUN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended 31st MARCH 1949.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated 4/4/1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.P.B.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On the Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the OLD SUN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended 30th June 1949.\n\nPrincipal (Rev) E.S.M.Cole\n\nDated 30th June 1949.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nW.P.B.Pugh, Superintendent\n\nBlackfoot Agency\n\nDated at Gleichen, Alberta\n\nthis 30th June 1949.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT of the OLD SUN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School at GLECHEN**\n\n| RECORD NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|---------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 0651          | OLD WOMAN, Daisy| 7   | X   |      |                |                    |                        |                             |            |\n| 0652          | ROYAL, Emma     | 8   | X   |      |                |                    |                        |                             |            |\n| 0653          | MARY HEARD, Rachel | 7 | X   |      |                |                    |                        |                             |            |\n| 0654          | BLAKE, Elsie    | 9   | X   |      |                |                    |                        |                             |            |\n| 0655          | WATERCHIP, Joanna| 8 | X   |      |                |                    |                        |                             |            |\n| 0656          | LOW HORN, Michel| 9   | X   |      |                |                    |                        |                             |            |\n| 0657          | A.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Old San Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended 31st December 1949.\n\nPrincipal (Rev) E.S.W.

THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present in school of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall any credit be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and union at the Old New Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended 31st March, 1900.\n\nDated 31/3/00\n\nPrincipal\n\nI have carefully examined the

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 5, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the number of the rate of grant per child. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the OLD SIOUX School for the Quarter ended 31st DECEMBER 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 31st DECEMBER 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nW.P.J.

When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column totals in the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the OLD SUN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended 31-4-51.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 31-4-51\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nW.P.B.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarters\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall there be made any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the OLD SUN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended 30th June 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 30th June 1951.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nH.

RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them on the proper line of the second sheet.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 20th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in which all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will allowance be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI declare that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the OLD SUN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL for the Quarter ended 30th June 1931.\n\nPrincipal: ____________________________\n\nDated: 30th June 1931\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nW.P.B.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2 and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the OLD SUN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended 30th SEPTEMBER 1901.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 8-10-01\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nW.P.B.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When citing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita credit due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Oka Shu Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended 31st December 1951.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: 30th December 1951.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nW.P.B.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pasting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils in residence pupils appear on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupil during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Old Sun Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended 31st December 1951.\n\nPrincipal: E.S.W.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2 and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the number of pupils attending during quarter.\n\n9. The amount per pupil per quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the OLD SUN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended 31-3-1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 4-4-1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nW.J.B.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will pupils be paid for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for whom grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the OLD SUN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended 30-6-1952.\n\nPrincipal (Rev) E.S.W.

residential school state the number of (i) non-Indian children who are boarding pupils; (ii) non-Indian children who are day school pupils.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupil in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return plus the amount by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupil in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average number of pupils attending during quarter is calculated by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is determined by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Old Sun Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended 30-9-1952.\n\nPrincipal (Rev) E.S.M.

OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the columns under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the OLD SUN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended 30-9-1952.\n\nPrincipal (Reg) E.S.W.Cole,\n\nDated 1st October 1952.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nW.F.B.Pugh, Superintendent, Indian Agent\n\nDated at GLEICHEN, Alberta, this 4th October 1952.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due or quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the OLD SUN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended 31-12-1933.\n\nprincipal\n\nDated 5-1-1934\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nW.F.B.

THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI Herewith Certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Old Sun Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended 31-12-1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 2-1-1953\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nV.P.J.
